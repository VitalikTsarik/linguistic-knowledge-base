harry
Potter
and
the
sorcerer's
Stone
chapter
one
the
boy
who
lived
mr.
and
Mrs
dursley
of
number
four
Privet
Drive
were
proud
to
say
that
they
were
perfectly
normal
thank
you
very
much
they
were
the
last
people
you'd
expect
to
be
involved
in
anything
strange
or
mysterious
because
they
just
didn't
hold
with
such
nonsense
mr.
Dursley
was
the
director
of
a
firm
called
Grunnings
which
made
drills
he
was
a
big
beefy
man
with
hardly
any
neck
although
he
did
have
a
very
large
mustache
mrs
dursley
was
thin
and
blonde
and
had
nearly
twice
the
usual
amount
of
neck
which
came
in
very
useful
as
she
spent
so
much
of
her
time
craning
over
garden
fences
spying
on
the
neighbors
the
Dursleys
had
a
small
son
called
Dudley
and
in
their
opinion
there
was
no
finer
boy
anywhere
the
Dursleys
had
everything
they
wanted
but
they
also
had
a
secret
and
their
greatest
fear
was
that
somebody
would
discover
it
they
didn't
think
they
could
bear
it
if
anyone
found
out
about
the
Potters
mrs
potter
was
Mrs
dursley's
sister
but
they
hadn't
met
for
several
years
in
fact
Mrs
dursley
pretended
she
didn't
have
a
sister
because
her
sister
and
her
good-for-nothing
husband
were
as
unDursleyish
as
it
was
possible
to
be
the
Dursleys
shuddered
to
think
what
the
neighbors
would
say
if
the
Potters
arrived
in
the
street
the
Dursleys
knew
that
the
Potters
had
a
small
son
too
but
they
had
never
even
seen
him
this
boy
was
another
good
reason
for
keeping
the
Potters
away
they
didn't
want
Dudley
mixing
with
a
child
like
that
when
mr.
and
Mrs
dursley
woke
up
on
the
dull
gray
Tuesday
our
story
starts
there
was
nothing
about
the
cloudy
sky
outside
to
suggest
that
strange
and
mysterious
things
would
soon
be
happening
all
over
the
country
mr.
Dursley
hummed
as
he
picked
out
his
most
boring
tie
for
work
and
Mrs
dursley
gossiped
away
happily
as
she
wrestled
a
screaming
Dudley
into
his
high
chair
none
of
them
noticed
a
large
tawny
owl
flutter
past
the
window
at
half
past
eight
mr.
Dursley
picked
up
his
briefcase
pecked
Mrs
dursley
on
the
cheek
and
tried
to
kiss
Dudley
good-bye
but
missed
because
Dudley
was
now
having
a
tantrum
and
throwing
his
cereal
at
the
walls
little
tyke
chortled
mr.
Dursley
as
he
left
the
house
he
got
into
his
car
and
backed
out
of
number
four's
drive
it
was
on
the
corner
of
the
street
that
he
noticed
the
first
sign
of
something
peculiar
a
cat
reading
a
map
for
a
second
mr.
Dursley
didn't
realize
what
he
had
seen
then
he
jerked
his
head
around
to
look
again
there
was
a
tabby
cat
standing
on
the
corner
of
Privet
Drive
but
there
wasn't
a
map
in
sight
what
could
he
have
been
thinking
of
it
must
have
been
a
trick
of
the
light
mr.
Dursley
blinked
and
stared
at
the
cat
it
stared
back
as
mr.
Dursley
drove
around
the
corner
and
up
the
road
he
watched
the
cat
in
his
mirror
it
was
now
reading
the
sign
that
said
Privet
Drive
no
looking
at
the
sign
cats
couldn't
read
maps
or
signs
mr.
Dursley
gave
himself
a
little
shake
and
put
the
cat
out
of
his
mind
as
he
drove
toward
town
he
thought
of
nothing
except
a
large
order
of
drills
he
was
hoping
to
get
that
day
but
on
the
edge
of
town
drills
were
driven
out
of
his
mind
by
something
else
as
he
sat
in
the
usual
morning
traffic
jam
he
couldn't
help
noticing
that
there
seemed
to
be
a
lot
of
strangely
dressed
people
about
people
in
cloaks
mr.
Dursley
couldn't
bear
people
who
dressed
in
funny
clothes
the
getups
you
saw
on
young
people
he
supposed
this
was
some
stupid
new
fashion
he
drummed
his
fingers
on
the
steering
wheel
and
his
eyes
fell
on
a
huddle
of
these
weirdos
standing
quite
close
by
they
were
whispering
excitedly
together
mr.
Dursley
was
enraged
to
see
that
a
couple
of
them
weren't
young
at
all
why
that
man
had
to
be
older
than
he
was
and
wearing
an
emerald-green
cloak
the
nerve
of
him
but
then
it
struck
mr.
Dursley
that
this
was
probably
some
silly
stunt
these
people
were
obviously
collecting
for
something
yes
that
would
be
it
the
traffic
moved
on
and
a
few
minutes
later
mr.
Dursley
arrived
in
the
Grunnings
parking
lot
his
mind
back
on
drills
mr.
Dursley
always
sat
with
his
back
to
the
window
in
his
office
on
the
ninth
floor
if
he
hadn't
he
might
have
found
it
harder
to
concentrate
on
drills
that
morning
he
didn't
see
the
owls
swoop
ing
past
in
broad
daylight
though
people
down
in
the
street
did
they
pointed
and
gazed
open
mouthed
as
owl
after
owl
sped
overhead
most
of
them
had
never
seen
an
owl
even
at
nighttime
mr.
Dursley
however
had
a
perfectly
normal
owl-free
morning
he
yelled
at
five
different
people
he
made
several
important
telephone
calls
and
shouted
a
bit
more
he
was
in
a
very
good
mood
until
lunchtime
when
he
thought
he'd
stretch
his
legs
and
walk
across
the
road
to
buy
himself
a
bun
from
the
bakery
he'd
forgotten
all
about
the
people
in
cloaks
until
he
passed
a
group
of
them
next
to
the
baker's
he
eyed
them
angrily
as
he
passed
he
didn't
know
why
but
they
made
him
uneasy
this
bunch
were
whispering
excitedly
too
and
he
couldn't
see
a
single
collecting
tin
it
was
on
his
way
back
past
them
clutching
a
large
doughnut
in
a
bag
that
he
caught
a
few
words
of
what
they
were
saying
the
Potters
that's
right
that's
what
I
heard
yes
their
son
Harry
mr.
Dursley
stopped
dead
fear
flooded
him
he
looked
back
at
the
whisperers
as
if
he
wanted
to
say
something
to
them
but
thought
better
of
it
he
dashed
back
across
the
road
hurried
up
to
his
office
snapped
at
his
secretary
not
to
disturb
him
seized
his
telephone
and
had
almost
finished
dialing
his
home
number
when
he
changed
his
mind
he
put
the
receiver
back
down
and
stroked
his
mustache
thinking
no
he
was
being
stupid
potter
wasn't
such
an
unusual
name
he
was
sure
there
were
lots
of
people
called
Potter
who
had
a
son
called
Harry
come
to
think
of
it
he
wasn't
even
sure
his
nephew
was
called
Harry
he'd
never
even
seen
the
boy
it
might
have
been
Harvey
or
Harold
there
was
no
point
in
worrying
Mrs
dursley
she
always
got
so
upset
at
any
mention
of
her
sister
he
didn't
blame
her
if
he'd
had
a
sister
like
that
but
all
the
same
those
people
in
cloaks
he
found
it
a
lot
harder
to
concentrate
on
drills
that
afternoon
and
when
he
left
the
building
at
five
o'clock
he
was
still
so
worried
that
he
walked
straight
into
someone
just
outside
the
door
sorry
he
grunted
as
the
tiny
old
man
stumbled
and
almost
fell
it
was
a
few
seconds
before
mr.
Dursley
realized
that
the
man
was
wearing
a
violet
cloak
he
didn't
seem
at
all
upset
at
being
almost
knocked
to
the
ground
on
the
contrary
his
face
split
into
a
wide
smile
and
he
said
in
a
squeaky
voice
that
made
passersby
stare
don't
be
sorry
my
dear
sir
for
nothing
could
upset
me
today
rejoice
for
You-Know-Who
has
gone
at
last
even
Muggles
like
yourself
should
be
celebrating
this
happy
happy
day
and
the
old
man
hugged
mr.
Dursley
around
the
middle
and
walked
off
mr.
Dursley
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
he
had
been
hugged
by
a
complete
stranger
he
also
thought
he
had
been
called
a
Muggle
whatever
that
was
he
was
rattled
he
hurried
to
his
car
and
set
off
for
home
hoping
he
was
imagining
things
which
he
had
never
hoped
before
because
he
didn't
approve
of
imagination
as
he
pulled
into
the
driveway
of
number
four
the
first
thing
he
saw
and
it
didn't
improve
his
mood
was
the
tabby
cat
he'd
spotted
that
morning
it
was
now
sitting
on
his
garden
wall
he
was
sure
it
was
the
same
one
it
had
the
same
markings
around
its
eyes
shoo
said
mr.
Dursley
loudly
the
cat
didn't
move
it
just
gave
him
a
stern
look
was
this
normal
cat
behavior
mr.
Dursley
wondered
trying
to
pull
himself
together
he
let
himself
into
the
house
he
was
still
determined
not
to
mention
anything
to
his
wife
mrs
dursley
had
had
a
nice
normal
day
she
told
him
over
dinner
all
about
Mrs
next
door's
problems
with
her
daughter
and
how
Dudley
had
learned
a
new
word
won't
mr.
Dursley
tried
to
act
normally
when
Dudley
had
been
put
to
bed
he
went
into
the
living
room
in
time
to
catch
the
last
report
on
the
evening
news
And
finally
bird-watchers
everywhere
have
reported
that
the
nation's
owls
have
been
behaving
very
unusually
today
although
owls
normally
hunt
at
night
and
are
hardly
ever
seen
in
daylight
there
have
been
hundreds
of
sightings
of
these
birds
flying
in
every
direction
since
sunrise
experts
are
unable
to
explain
why
the
owls
have
suddenly
changed
their
sleeping
pattern
the
newscaster
allowed
himself
a
grin
most
mysterious
and
now
over
to
Jim
McGuffin
with
the
weather
going
to
be
any
more
showers
of
owls
tonight
Jim
well
Ted
said
the
weatherman
I
don't
know
about
that
but
it's
not
only
the
owls
that
have
been
acting
oddly
today
viewers
as
far
apart
as
Kent
Yorkshire
and
Dundee
have
been
phoning
in
to
tell
me
that
instead
of
the
rain
I
promised
yesterday
they've
had
a
downpour
of
shooting
stars
perhaps
people
have
been
celebrating
Bonfire
Night
early
it's
not
until
next
week
folks
but
I
can
promise
a
wet
night
tonight
mr.
Dursley
sat
frozen
in
his
armchair
shooting
stars
all
over
Britain
owls
flying
by
daylight
mysterious
people
in
cloaks
all
over
the
place
and
a
whisper
a
whisper
about
the
Potters
mrs
dursley
came
into
the
living
room
carrying
two
cups
of
tea
it
was
no
good
he'd
have
to
say
something
to
her
he
cleared
his
throat
nervously
er
Petunia
dear
you
haven't
heard
from
your
sister
lately
have
you
as
he
had
expected
Mrs
dursley
looked
shocked
and
angry
after
all
they
normally
pretended
she
didn't
have
a
sister
no
she
said
sharply
why
funny
stuff
on
the
news
mr.
Dursley
mumbled
owls
shooting
stars
and
there
were
a
lot
of
funny-looking
people
in
town
today
so
snapped
Mrs
dursley
well
I
just
thought
maybe
it
was
something
to
do
with
you
know
her
crowd
mrs
dursley
sipped
her
tea
through
pursed
lips
mr.
Dursley
wondered
whether
he
dared
tell
her
he'd
heard
the
name
Potter
he
decided
he
didn't
dare
instead
he
said
as
casually
as
he
could
Their
son
he'd
be
about
dudley's
age
now
wouldn't
he
i
suppose
so
said
Mrs
dursley
stiffly
what's
his
name
again
howard
isn't
it
harry
nasty
common
name
if
you
ask
me
oh
yes
said
mr.
Dursley
his
heart
sinking
horribly
yes
I
quite
agree
he
didn't
say
another
word
on
the
subject
as
they
went
upstairs
to
bed
while
Mrs
dursley
was
in
the
bathroom
mr.
Dursley
crept
to
the
bedroom
window
and
peered
down
into
the
front
garden
the
cat
was
still
there
it
was
staring
down
Privet
Drive
as
though
it
were
waiting
for
something
was
he
imagining
things
could
all
this
have
anything
to
do
with
the
Potters
if
it
did
if
it
got
out
that
they
were
related
to
a
pair
of
well
he
didn't
think
he
could
bear
it
the
Dursleys
got
into
bed
mrs
dursley
fell
asleep
quickly
but
mr.
Dursley
lay
awake
turning
it
all
over
in
his
mind
his
last
comforting
thought
before
he
fell
asleep
was
that
even
if
the
Potters
were
involved
there
was
no
reason
for
them
to
come
near
him
and
Mrs
dursley
the
Potters
knew
very
well
what
he
and
Petunia
thought
about
them
and
their
kind
he
couldn't
see
how
he
and
Petunia
could
get
mixed
up
in
anything
that
might
be
going
on
he
yawned
and
turned
over
it
couldn't
affect
them
how
very
wrong
he
was
mr.
Dursley
might
have
been
drifting
into
an
uneasy
sleep
but
the
cat
on
the
wall
outside
was
showing
no
sign
of
sleepiness
it
was
sitting
as
still
as
a
statue
its
eyes
fixed
unblinkingly
on
the
far
corner
of
Privet
Drive
it
didn't
so
much
as
quiver
when
a
car
door
slammed
on
the
next
street
nor
when
two
owls
swooped
overhead
in
fact
it
was
nearly
midnight
before
the
cat
moved
at
all
a
man
appeared
on
the
corner
the
cat
had
been
watching
appeared
so
suddenly
and
silently
you'd
have
thought
he'd
just
popped
out
of
the
ground
the
cat's
tail
twitched
and
its
eyes
narrowed
nothing
like
this
man
had
ever
been
seen
on
Privet
Drive
he
was
tall
thin
and
very
old
judging
by
the
silver
of
his
hair
and
beard
which
were
both
long
enough
to
tuck
into
his
belt
he
was
wearing
long
robes
a
purple
cloak
that
swept
the
ground
and
high-heeled
buckled
boots
his
blue
eyes
were
light
bright
and
sparkling
behind
half-moon
spectacles
and
his
nose
was
very
long
and
crooked
as
though
it
had
been
broken
at
least
twice
this
man's
name
was
Albus
Dumbledore
albus
Dumbledore
didn't
seem
to
realize
that
he
had
just
arrived
in
a
street
where
everything
from
his
name
to
his
boots
was
unwelcome
he
was
busy
rummaging
in
his
cloak
looking
for
something
but
he
did
seem
to
realize
he
was
being
watched
because
he
looked
up
suddenly
at
the
cat
which
was
still
staring
at
him
from
the
other
end
of
the
street
for
some
reason
the
sight
of
the
cat
seemed
to
amuse
him
he
chuckled
and
muttered
I
should
have
known
he
found
what
he
was
looking
for
in
his
inside
pocket
it
seemed
to
be
a
silver
cigarette
lighter
he
flicked
it
open
held
it
up
in
the
air
and
clicked
it
the
nearest
street
lamp
went
out
with
a
little
pop
he
clicked
it
again
the
next
lamp
flickered
into
darkness
twelve
times
he
clicked
the
Put-Outer
until
the
only
lights
left
on
the
whole
street
were
two
tiny
pinpricks
in
the
distance
which
were
the
eyes
of
the
cat
watching
him
if
anyone
looked
out
of
their
window
now
even
beady-eyed
Mrs
dursley
they
wouldn't
be
able
to
see
anything
that
was
happening
down
on
the
pavement
dumbledore
slipped
the
Put-Outer
back
inside
his
cloak
and
set
off
down
the
street
toward
number
four
where
he
sat
down
on
the
wall
next
to
the
cat
he
didn't
look
at
it
but
after
a
moment
he
spoke
to
it
fancy
seeing
you
here
Professor
McGonagall
he
turned
to
smile
at
the
tabby
but
it
had
gone
instead
he
was
smiling
at
a
rather
severe-looking
woman
who
was
wearing
square
glasses
exactly
the
shape
of
the
markings
the
cat
had
had
around
its
eyes
she
too
was
wearing
a
cloak
an
emerald
one
her
black
hair
was
drawn
into
a
tight
bun
she
looked
distinctly
ruffled
how
did
you
know
it
was
me
she
asked
my
dear
Professor
I
ve
never
seen
a
cat
sit
so
stiffly
you'd
be
stiff
if
you'd
been
sitting
on
a
brick
wall
all
day
said
Professor
McGonagall
all
day
when
you
could
have
been
celebrating
i
must
have
passed
a
dozen
feasts
and
parties
on
my
way
here
professor
McGonagall
sniffed
angrily
oh
yes
everyone's
celebrating
all
right
she
said
impatiently
you'd
think
they'd
be
a
bit
more
careful
but
no
even
the
Muggles
have
noticed
something's
going
on
it
was
on
their
news
she
jerked
her
head
back
at
the
Dursleys
dark
living-room
window
i
heard
it
flocks
of
owls
shooting
stars
well
they're
not
completely
stupid
they
were
bound
to
notice
something
shooting
stars
down
in
Kent
i'll
bet
that
was
Dedalus
Diggle
he
never
had
much
sense
you
can't
blame
them
said
Dumbledore
gently
we've
had
precious
little
to
celebrate
for
eleven
years
i
know
that
said
Professor
McGonagall
irritably
but
that's
no
reason
to
lose
our
heads
people
are
being
downright
careless
out
on
the
streets
in
broad
daylight
not
even
dressed
in
Muggle
clothes
swapping
rumors
she
threw
a
sharp
sideways
glance
at
Dumbledore
here
as
though
hoping
he
was
going
to
tell
her
something
but
he
didn't
so
she
went
on
a
fine
thing
it
would
be
if
on
the
very
day
YouKnow-Who
seems
to
have
disappeared
at
last
the
Muggles
found
out
about
us
all
i
suppose
he
really
has
gone
Dumbledore
it
certainly
seems
so
said
Dumbledore
we
have
much
to
be
thankful
for
would
you
care
for
a
lemon
drop
a
what
a
lemon
drop
they're
a
kind
of
Muggle
sweet
i'm
rather
fond
of
no
thank
you
said
Professor
McGonagall
coldly
as
though
she
didn't
think
this
was
the
moment
for
lemon
drops
as
I
say
even
if
You-Know-Who
has
gone
my
dear
Professor
surely
a
sensible
person
like
yourself
can
call
him
by
his
name
all
this
You
Know-Who
nonsense
for
eleven
years
I
have
been
trying
to
persuade
people
to
call
him
by
his
proper
name
Voldemort
professor
McGonagall
flinched
but
Dumbledore
who
was
unsticking
two
lemon
drops
seemed
not
to
notice
it
all
gets
so
confusing
if
we
keep
saying
You-Know-Who
i
have
never
seen
any
reason
to
be
frightened
of
saying
voldemort's
name
i
know
you
haven
t
said
Professor
McGonagall
sounding
half
exasperated
half
admiring
but
you're
different
everyone
knows
you're
the
only
one
You-Know
oh
all
right
Voldemort
was
frightened
of
you
flatter
me
said
Dumbledore
calmly
voldemort
had
powers
I
will
never
have
only
because
you're
too
well
noble
to
use
them
it's
lucky
it's
dark
i
haven't
blushed
so
much
since
Madam
Pomfrey
told
me
she
liked
my
new
earmuffs
professor
McGonagall
shot
a
sharp
look
at
Dumbledore
and
said
The
owls
are
nothing
next
to
the
rumors
that
are
flying
around
you
know
what
everyone's
saying
about
why
he's
disappeared
about
what
finally
stopped
him
it
seemed
that
Professor
McGonagall
had
reached
the
point
she
was
most
anxious
to
discuss
the
real
reason
she
had
been
waiting
on
a
cold
hard
wall
all
day
for
neither
as
a
cat
nor
as
a
woman
had
she
fixed
Dumbledore
with
such
a
piercing
stare
as
she
did
now
it
was
plain
that
whatever
everyone
was
saying
she
was
not
going
to
believe
it
until
Dumbledore
told
her
it
was
true
dumbledore
however
was
choosing
another
lemon
drop
and
did
not
answer
what
they're
saying
she
pressed
on
is
that
last
night
Voldemort
turned
up
in
godric's
Hollow
he
went
to
find
the
Potters
the
rumor
is
that
Lily
and
James
Potter
are
are
that
they're
dead
dumbledore
bowed
his
head
professor
McGonagall
gasped
lily
and
James
i
can't
believe
it
i
didn't
want
to
believe
it
oh
Albus
dumbledore
reached
out
and
patted
her
on
the
shoulder
i
know
i
know
he
said
heavily
professor
mcgonagall's
voice
trembled
as
she
went
on
that's
not
all
they're
saying
he
tried
to
kill
the
potter's
son
Harry
but
he
couldn't
he
couldn't
kill
that
little
boy
no
one
knows
why
or
how
but
they're
saying
that
when
he
couldn't
kill
Harry
Potter
voldemort's
power
somehow
broke
and
that's
why
he's
gone
dumbledore
nodded
glumly
it's
it's
true
faltered
Professor
McGonagall
after
all
he's
done
all
the
people
he's
killed
he
couldn't
kill
a
little
boy
it's
just
astounding
of
all
the
things
to
stop
him
but
how
in
the
name
of
heaven
did
Harry
survive
we
can
only
guess
said
Dumbledore
we
may
never
know
professor
McGonagall
pulled
out
a
lace
handkerchief
and
dabbed
at
her
eyes
beneath
her
spectacles
dumbledore
gave
a
great
sniff
as
he
took
a
golden
watch
from
his
pocket
and
examined
it
it
was
a
very
odd
watch
it
had
twelve
hands
but
no
numbers
instead
little
planets
were
moving
around
the
edge
it
must
have
made
sense
to
Dumbledore
though
because
he
put
it
back
in
his
pocket
and
said
hagrid's
late
i
suppose
it
was
he
who
told
you
i'd
be
here
by
the
way
yes
said
Professor
McGonagall
and
I
don't
suppose
you're
going
to
tell
me
why
you're
here
of
all
places
i've
come
to
bring
Harry
to
his
aunt
and
uncle
they're
the
only
family
he
has
left
now
you
don't
mean
you
can't
mean
the
people
who
live
here
cried
Professor
McGonagall
jumping
to
her
feet
and
pointing
at
number
four
dumbledore
you
can't
i've
been
watching
them
all
day
you
couldn't
find
two
people
who
are
less
like
us
and
they've
got
this
son
I
saw
him
kicking
his
mother
all
the
way
up
the
street
screaming
for
sweets
harry
Potter
come
and
live
here
it's
the
best
place
for
him
said
Dumbledore
firmly
his
aunt
and
uncle
will
be
able
to
explain
everything
to
him
when
he's
older
i've
written
them
a
letter
a
letter
repeated
Professor
McGonagall
faintly
sitting
back
down
on
the
wall
really
Dumbledore
you
think
you
can
explain
all
this
in
a
letter
these
people
will
never
understand
him
he'll
be
famous
a
legend
I
wouldn't
be
surprised
if
today
was
known
as
Harry
Potter
day
in
the
future
there
will
be
books
written
about
Harry
every
child
in
our
world
will
know
his
name
exactly
said
Dumbledore
looking
very
seriously
over
the
top
of
his
half-moon
glasses
it
would
be
enough
to
turn
any
boy's
head
famous
before
he
can
walk
and
talk
famous
for
something
he
won't
even
remember
cara
you
see
how
much
better
off
he'll
be
growing
up
away
from
all
that
until
he's
ready
to
take
it
professor
McGonagall
opened
her
mouth
changed
her
mind
swallowed
and
then
said
Yes
yes
you're
right
of
course
but
how
is
the
boy
getting
here
Dumbledore
she
eyed
his
cloak
suddenly
as
though
she
thought
he
might
be
hiding
Harry
underneath
it
hagrid's
bringing
him
you
think
it
wise
to
trust
Hagrid
with
something
as
important
as
this
i
would
trust
Hagrid
with
my
life
said
Dumbledore
i'm
not
saying
his
heart
isn't
in
the
right
place
said
Professor
McGonagall
grudgingly
but
you
can't
pretend
he's
not
careless
he
does
tend
to
what
was
that
a
low
rumbling
sound
had
broken
the
silence
around
them
it
grew
steadily
louder
as
they
looked
up
and
down
the
street
for
some
sign
of
a
headlight
it
swelled
to
a
roar
as
they
both
looked
up
at
the
sky
and
a
huge
motorcycle
fell
out
of
the
air
and
landed
on
the
road
in
front
of
them
if
the
motorcycle
was
huge
it
was
nothing
to
the
man
sitting
astride
it
he
was
almost
twice
as
tall
as
a
normal
man
and
at
least
five
times
as
wide
he
looked
simply
too
big
to
be
allowed
and
so
wild
long
tangles
of
bushy
black
hair
and
beard
hid
most
of
his
face
he
had
hands
the
size
of
trash
can
lids
and
his
feet
in
their
leather
boots
were
like
baby
dolphins
in
his
vast
muscular
arms
he
was
holding
a
bundle
of
blankets
hagrid
said
Dumbledore
sounding
relieved
at
last
and
where
did
you
get
that
motorcycle
borrowed
it
Professor
Dumbledore
sit
said
the
giant
climbing
carefully
off
the
motorcycle
as
he
spoke
young
Sirius
Black
lent
it
to
me
i've
got
him
sir
no
problems
were
there
no
sir
house
was
almost
destroyed
but
I
got
him
out
all
right
before
the
Muggles
started
swarmin
around
he
fell
asleep
as
we
was
flyin
over
Bristol
dumbledore
and
Professor
McGonagall
bent
forward
over
the
bundle
of
blankets
inside
just
visible
was
a
baby
boy
fast
asleep
under
a
tuft
of
jet-black
hair
over
his
forehead
they
could
see
a
curiously
shaped
cut
like
a
bolt
of
lightning
is
that
where
whispered
Professor
McGonagall
yes
said
Dumbledore
he'll
have
that
scar
forever
couldn't
you
do
something
about
it
Dumbledore
even
if
I
could
I
wouldn't
scars
can
come
in
handy
i
have
one
myself
above
my
left
knee
that
is
a
perfect
map
of
the
London
Underground
well
give
him
here
Hagrid
we'd
better
get
this
over
with
dumbledore
took
Harry
in
his
arms
and
turned
toward
the
Dursleys
house
could
I
could
I
say
good-bye
to
him
sir
asked
Hagrid
he
bent
his
great
shaggy
head
over
Harry
and
gave
him
what
must
have
been
a
very
scratchy
whiskery
kiss
then
suddenly
Hagrid
let
out
a
howl
like
a
wounded
dog
shhh
hissed
Professor
McGonagall
you'll
wake
the
Muggles
s-s-sorry
sobbed
Hagrid
taking
out
a
large
spotted
handkerchief
and
burying
his
face
in
it
but
I
c-c-can't
stand
it
Lily
an
James
dead
an
poor
little
Harry
off
ter
live
with
Muggles
yes
yes
it's
all
very
sad
but
get
a
grip
on
yourself
Hagrid
or
we'll
be
found
Professor
McGonagall
whispered
patting
Hagrid
gingerly
on
the
arm
as
Dumbledore
stepped
over
the
low
garden
wall
and
walked
to
the
front
door
he
laid
Harry
gently
on
the
doorstep
took
a
letter
out
of
his
cloak
tucked
it
inside
harry's
blankets
and
then
came
back
to
the
other
two
for
a
full
minute
the
three
of
them
stood
and
looked
at
the
little
bundle
hagrid's
shoulders
shook
Professor
McGonagall
blinked
furiously
and
the
twinkling
light
that
usually
shone
from
dumbledore's
eyes
seemed
to
have
gone
out
well
said
Dumbledore
finally
that's
that
we've
no
business
staying
here
we
may
as
well
go
and
join
the
celebrations
yeah
said
Hagrid
in
a
very
muffled
voice
i'll
be
takin
Sirius
his
bike
back
g'night
Professor
McGonagall
Professor
Dumbledore
sir
wiping
his
streaming
eyes
on
his
jacket
sleeve
Hagrid
swung
himself
onto
the
motorcycle
and
kicked
the
engine
into
life
with
a
roar
it
rose
into
the
air
and
off
into
the
night
i
shall
see
you
soon
I
expect
Professor
McGonagall
said
Dumbledore
nodding
to
her
professor
McGonagall
blew
her
nose
in
reply
dumbledore
turned
and
walked
back
down
the
street
on
the
corner
he
stopped
and
took
out
the
silver
Put-Outer
he
clicked
it
once
and
twelve
balls
of
light
sped
back
to
their
street
lamps
so
that
Privet
Drive
glowed
suddenly
orange
and
he
could
make
out
a
tabby
cat
slinking
around
the
corner
at
the
other
end
of
the
street
he
could
just
see
the
bundle
of
blankets
on
the
step
of
number
four
good
luck
Harry
he
murmured
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
with
a
swish
of
his
cloak
he
was
gone
a
breeze
ruffled
the
neat
hedges
of
Privet
Drive
which
lay
silent
and
tidy
under
the
inky
sky
the
very
last
place
you
would
expect
astonishing
things
to
happen
harry
Potter
rolled
over
inside
his
blankets
without
waking
up
one
small
hand
closed
on
the
letter
beside
him
and
he
slept
on
not
knowing
he
was
special
not
knowing
he
was
famous
not
knowing
he
would
be
woken
in
a
few
hours
time
by
Mrs
dursley's
scream
as
she
opened
the
front
door
to
put
out
the
milk
bottles
nor
that
he
would
spend
the
next
few
weeks
being
prodded
and
pinched
by
his
cousin
Dudley
he
couldn't
know
that
at
this
very
moment
people
meeting
in
secret
all
over
the
country
were
holding
up
their
glasses
and
saying
in
hushed
voices
To
Harry
Potter
the
boy
who
lived
chapter
two
the
vanishing
glass
nearly
ten
years
had
passed
since
the
Dursleys
had
woken
up
to
find
their
nephew
on
the
front
step
but
Privet
Drive
had
hardly
changed
at
all
the
sun
rose
on
the
same
tidy
front
gardens
and
lit
up
the
brass
number
four
on
the
Dursleys
front
door
it
crept
into
their
living
room
which
was
almost
exactly
the
same
as
it
had
been
on
the
night
when
mr.
Dursley
had
seen
that
fateful
news
report
about
the
owls
only
the
photographs
on
the
mantelpiece
really
showed
how
much
time
had
passed
ten
years
ago
there
had
been
lots
of
pictures
of
what
looked
like
a
large
pink
beach
ball
wearing
different-colored
bonnets
but
Dudley
Dursley
was
no
longer
a
baby
and
now
the
photographs
showed
a
large
blond
boy
riding
his
first
bicycle
on
a
carousel
at
the
fair
playing
a
computer
game
with
his
father
being
hugged
and
kissed
by
his
mother
the
room
held
no
sign
at
all
that
another
boy
lived
in
the
house
too
yet
Harry
Potter
was
still
there
asleep
at
the
moment
but
not
for
long
his
Aunt
Petunia
was
awake
and
it
was
her
shrill
voice
that
made
the
first
noise
of
the
day
up
get
up
now
harry
woke
with
a
start
his
aunt
rapped
on
the
door
again
up
she
screeched
harry
heard
her
walking
toward
the
kitchen
and
then
the
sound
of
the
frying
pan
being
put
on
the
stove
he
rolled
onto
his
back
and
tried
to
remember
the
dream
he
had
been
having
it
had
been
a
good
one
there
had
been
a
flying
motorcycle
in
it
he
had
a
funny
feeling
he'd
had
the
same
dream
before
his
aunt
was
back
outside
the
door
are
you
up
yet
she
demanded
nearly
said
Harry
well
get
a
move
on
I
want
you
to
look
after
the
bacon
and
don't
you
dare
let
it
burn
I
want
everything
perfect
on
duddy's
birthday
harry
groaned
what
did
you
say
his
aunt
snapped
through
the
door
nothing
nothing
dudley's
birthday
how
could
he
have
forgotten
harry
got
slowly
out
of
bed
and
started
looking
for
socks
he
found
a
pair
under
his
bed
and
after
pulling
a
spider
off
one
of
them
put
them
on
harry
was
used
to
spiders
because
the
cupboard
under
the
stairs
was
full
of
them
and
that
was
where
he
slept
when
he
was
dressed
he
went
down
the
hall
into
the
kitchen
the
table
was
almost
hidden
beneath
all
dudley's
birthday
presents
it
looked
as
though
Dudley
had
gotten
the
new
computer
he
wanted
not
to
mention
the
second
television
and
the
racing
bike
exactly
why
Dudley
wanted
a
racing
bike
was
a
mystery
to
Harry
as
Dudley
was
very
fat
and
hated
exercise
unless
of
course
it
involved
punching
somebody
dudley's
favorite
punching
bag
was
Harry
but
he
couldn't
often
catch
him
harry
didn't
look
it
but
he
was
very
fast
perhaps
it
had
something
to
do
with
living
in
a
dark
cupboard
but
Harry
had
always
been
small
and
skinny
for
his
age
he
looked
even
smaller
and
skinnier
than
he
really
was
because
all
he
had
to
wear
were
old
clothes
of
dudley's
and
Dudley
was
about
four
times
bigger
than
he
was
harry
had
a
thin
face
knobbly
knees
black
hair
and
bright
green
eyes
he
wore
round
glasses
held
together
with
a
lot
of
Scotch
tape
because
of
all
the
times
Dudley
had
punched
him
on
the
nose
the
only
thing
Harry
liked
about
his
own
appearance
was
a
very
thin
scar
on
his
forehead
that
was
shaped
like
a
bolt
of
lightning
he
had
had
it
as
long
as
he
could
remember
and
the
first
question
he
could
ever
remember
asking
his
Aunt
Petunia
was
how
he
had
gotten
it
in
the
car
crash
when
your
parents
died
she
had
said
and
don't
ask
questions
don't
ask
questions
that
was
the
first
rule
for
a
quiet
life
with
the
Dursleys
uncle
Vernon
entered
the
kitchen
as
Harry
was
turning
over
the
bacon
comb
your
hair
he
barked
by
way
of
a
morning
greeting
about
once
a
week
Uncle
Vernon
looked
over
the
top
of
his
newspaper
and
shouted
that
Harry
needed
a
haircut
harry
must
have
had
more
haircuts
than
the
rest
of
the
boys
in
his
class
put
together
but
it
made
no
difference
his
hair
simply
grew
that
way
all
over
the
place
harry
was
frying
eggs
by
the
time
Dudley
arrived
in
the
kitchen
with
his
mother
dudley
looked
a
lot
like
Uncle
Vernon
he
had
a
large
pink
face
not
much
neck
small
watery
blue
eyes
and
thick
blond
hair
that
lay
smoothly
on
his
thick
fat
head
aunt
Petunia
often
said
that
Dudley
looked
like
a
baby
angel
Harry
often
said
that
Dudley
looked
like
a
pig
in
a
wig
harry
put
the
plates
of
egg
and
bacon
on
the
table
which
was
difficult
as
there
wasn't
much
room
dudley
meanwhile
was
counting
his
presents
his
face
fell
thirty-six
he
said
looking
up
at
his
mother
and
father
that's
two
less
than
last
year
darling
you
haven't
counted
Auntie
marge's
present
see
it's
here
under
this
big
one
from
Mommy
and
Daddy
all
right
thirty-seven
then
said
Dudley
going
red
in
the
face
harry
who
could
see
a
huge
Dudley
tantrum
coming
on
began
wolfing
down
his
bacon
as
fast
as
possible
in
case
Dudley
turned
the
table
over
aunt
Petunia
obviously
scented
danger
too
because
she
said
quickly
And
we'll
buy
you
another
two
presents
while
we're
out
today
how's
that
popkin
two
more
presents
is
that
all
right
Dudley
thought
for
a
moment
it
looked
like
hard
work
finally
he
said
slowly
So
i'll
have
thirty
thirty
thirty-nine
sweetums
said
Aunt
Petunia
oh.
Dudley
sat
down
heavily
and
grabbed
the
nearest
parcel
all
right
then
uncle
Vernon
chuckled
little
tyke
wants
his
money's
worth
just
like
his
father
atta
boy
Dudley
he
ruffled
dudley's
hair
at
that
moment
the
telephone
rang
and
Aunt
Petunia
went
to
answer
it
while
Harry
and
Uncle
Vernon
watched
Dudley
unwrap
the
racing
bike
a
video
camera
a
remote
control
airplane
sixteen
new
computer
games
and
a
vcr
he
was
ripping
the
paper
off
a
gold
wristwatch
when
Aunt
Petunia
came
back
from
the
telephone
looking
both
angry
and
worried
bad
news
Vernon
she
said
mrs
figg's
broken
her
leg
she
can't
take
him
she
jerked
her
head
in
harry's
direction
dudley's
mouth
fell
open
in
horror
but
harry's
heart
gave
a
leap
every
year
on
dudley's
birthday
his
parents
took
him
and
a
friend
out
for
the
day
to
adventure
parks
hamburger
restaurants
or
the
movies
every
year
Harry
was
left
behind
with
Mrs
figg
a
mad
old
lady
who
lived
two
streets
away
harry
hated
it
there
the
whole
house
smelled
of
cabbage
and
Mrs
figg
made
him
look
at
photographs
of
all
the
cats
she'd
ever
owned
now
what
said
Aunt
Petunia
looking
furiously
at
Harry
as
though
he'd
planned
this
harry
knew
he
ought
to
feel
sorry
that
Mrs
figg
had
broken
her
leg
but
it
wasn't
easy
when
he
reminded
himself
it
would
be
a
whole
year
before
he
had
to
look
at
Tibbles
Snowy
mr.
Paws
and
Tufty
again
we
could
phone
Marge
Uncle
Vernon
suggested
don't
be
silly
Vernon
she
hates
the
boy
the
Dursleys
often
spoke
about
Harry
like
this
as
though
he
wasn't
there
or
rather
as
though
he
was
something
very
nasty
that
couldn't
understand
them
like
a
slug
what
about
what's-her-name
your
friend
Yvonne
on
vacation
in
Majorca
snapped
Aunt
Petunia
you
could
just
leave
me
here
Harry
put
in
hopefully
he'd
be
able
to
watch
what
he
wanted
on
television
for
a
change
and
maybe
even
have
a
go
on
dudley's
computer
aunt
Petunia
looked
as
though
she'd
just
swallowed
a
lemon
and
come
back
and
find
the
house
in
ruins
she
snarled
i
won't
blow
up
the
house
said
Harry
but
they
weren't
listening
i
suppose
we
could
take
him
to
the
zoo
said
Aunt
Petunia
slowly
and
leave
him
in
the
car
that
car's
new
he's
not
sitting
in
it
alone
dudley
began
to
cry
loudly
in
fact
he
wasn't
really
crying
it
had
been
years
since
he'd
really
cried
but
he
knew
that
if
he
screwed
up
his
face
and
wailed
his
mother
would
give
him
anything
he
wanted
dinky
Duddydums
don't
cry
Mummy
won't
let
him
spoil
your
special
day
she
cried
flinging
her
arms
around
him
don't
want
him
t-t-to
come
dudley
yelled
between
huge
pretend
sobs
he
always
sp
spoils
everything
he
shot
Harry
a
nasty
grin
through
the
gap
in
his
mother's
arms
just
then
the
doorbell
rang
Oh
good
Lord
they're
here
said
Aunt
Petunia
frantically
and
a
moment
later
dudley's
best
friend
Piers
Polkiss
walked
in
with
his
mother
piers
was
a
scrawny
boy
with
a
face
like
a
rat
he
was
usually
the
one
who
held
people's
arms
behind
their
backs
while
Dudley
hit
them
dudley
stopped
pretending
to
cry
at
once
half
an
hour
later
Harry
who
couldn't
believe
his
luck
was
sitting
in
the
back
of
the
Dursleys
car
with
Piers
and
Dudley
on
the
way
to
the
zoo
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
his
aunt
and
uncle
hadn't
been
able
to
think
of
anything
else
to
do
with
him
but
before
they'd
left
Uncle
Vernon
had
taken
Harry
aside
i'm
warning
you
he
had
said
putting
his
large
purple
face
right
up
close
to
harry's
i'm
warning
you
now
boy
any
funny
business
anything
at
all
and
you'll
be
in
that
cupboard
from
now
until
Christmas
i'm
not
going
to
do
anything
said
Harry
honestly
but
Uncle
Vernon
didn't
believe
him
no
one
ever
did
the
problem
was
strange
things
often
happened
around
Harry
and
it
was
just
no
good
telling
the
Dursleys
he
didn't
make
them
happen
once
Aunt
Petunia
tired
of
Harry
coming
back
from
the
barbers
looking
as
though
he
hadn't
been
at
all
had
taken
a
pair
of
kitchen
scissors
and
cut
his
hair
so
short
he
was
almost
bald
except
for
his
bangs
which
she
left
to
hide
that
horrible
scar
dudley
had
laughed
himself
silly
at
Harry
who
spent
a
sleepless
night
imagining
school
the
next
day
where
he
was
already
laughed
at
for
his
baggy
clothes
and
taped
glasses
next
morning
however
he
had
gotten
up
to
find
his
hair
exactly
as
it
had
been
before
Aunt
Petunia
had
sheared
it
off
He
had
been
given
a
week
in
his
cupboard
for
this
even
though
he
had
tried
to
explain
that
he
couldn't
explain
how
it
had
grown
back
so
quickly
another
time
Aunt
Petunia
had
been
trying
to
force
him
into
a
revolting
old
sweater
of
dudley's
brown
with
orange
puff
balls
The
harder
she
tried
to
pull
it
over
his
head
the
smaller
it
seemed
to
become
until
finally
it
might
have
fitted
a
hand
puppet
but
certainly
wouldn't
fit
Harry
aunt
Petunia
had
decided
it
must
have
shrunk
in
the
wash
and
to
his
great
relief
Harry
wasn't
punished
on
the
other
hand
he'd
gotten
into
terrible
trouble
for
being
found
on
the
roof
of
the
school
kitchens
dudley's
gang
had
been
chasing
him
as
usual
when
as
much
to
harry's
surprise
as
anyone
else's
there
he
was
sitting
on
the
chimney
the
Dursleys
had
received
a
very
angry
letter
from
harry's
headmistress
telling
them
Harry
had
been
climbing
school
buildings
but
all
he'd
tried
to
do
as
he
shouted
at
Uncle
Vernon
through
the
locked
door
of
his
cupboard
was
jump
behind
the
big
trash
cans
outside
the
kitchen
doors
harry
supposed
that
the
wind
must
have
caught
him
in
mid
jump
but
today
nothing
was
going
to
go
wrong
it
was
even
worth
being
with
Dudley
and
Piers
to
be
spending
the
day
somewhere
that
wasn't
school
his
cupboard
or
Mrs
figg's
cabbage-smelling
living
room
while
he
drove
Uncle
Vernon
complained
to
Aunt
Petunia
he
liked
to
complain
about
things
people
at
work
Harry
the
council
Harry
the
bank
and
Harry
were
just
a
few
of
his
favorite
subjects
this
morning
it
was
motorcycles
roaring
along
like
maniacs
the
young
hoodlums
he
said
as
a
motorcycle
overtook
them
i
had
a
dream
about
a
motorcycle
said
Harry
remembering
suddenly
it
was
flying
uncle
Vernon
nearly
crashed
into
the
car
in
front
he
turned
right
around
in
his
seat
and
yelled
at
Harry
his
face
like
a
gigantic
beet
with
a
mustache
motorcycles
don't
fly
dudley
and
Piers
sniggered
i
know
they
don't
said
Harry
it
was
only
a
dream
but
he
wished
he
hadn't
said
anything
if
there
was
one
thing
the
Dursleys
hated
even
more
than
his
asking
questions
it
was
his
talking
about
anything
acting
in
a
way
it
shouldn't
no
matter
if
it
was
in
a
dream
or
even
a
cartoon
they
seemed
to
think
he
might
get
dangerous
ideas
it
was
a
very
sunny
Saturday
and
the
zoo
was
crowded
with
families
the
Dursleys
bought
Dudley
and
Piers
large
chocolate
ice
creams
at
the
entrance
and
then
because
the
smiling
lady
in
the
van
had
asked
Harry
what
he
wanted
before
they
could
hurry
him
away
they
bought
him
a
cheap
lemon
ice
pop
it
wasn't
bad
either
Harry
thought
licking
it
as
they
watched
a
gorilla
scratching
its
head
who
looked
remarkably
like
Dudley
except
that
it
wasn't
blond
harry
had
the
best
morning
he'd
had
in
a
long
time
he
was
careful
to
walk
a
little
way
apart
from
the
Dursleys
so
that
Dudley
and
Piers
who
were
starting
to
get
bored
with
the
animals
by
lunchtime
wouldn't
fall
back
on
their
favorite
hobby
of
hitting
him
they
ate
in
the
zoo
restaurant
and
when
Dudley
had
a
tantrum
because
his
knickerbocker
glory
didn't
have
enough
ice
cream
on
top
Uncle
Vernon
bought
him
another
one
and
Harry
was
allowed
to
finish
the
first
harry
felt
afterward
that
he
should
have
known
it
was
all
too
good
to
last
after
lunch
they
went
to
the
reptile
house
it
was
cool
and
dark
in
there
with
lit
windows
all
along
the
walls
behind
the
glass
all
sorts
of
lizards
and
snakes
were
crawling
and
slithering
over
bits
of
wood
and
stone
dudley
and
Piers
wanted
to
see
huge
poisonous
cobras
and
thick
man-crushing
pythons
dudley
quickly
found
the
largest
snake
in
the
place
it
could
have
wrapped
its
body
twice
around
Uncle
vernon's
car
and
crushed
it
into
a
trash
can
but
at
the
moment
it
didn't
look
in
the
mood
in
fact
it
was
fast
asleep
dudley
stood
with
his
nose
pressed
against
the
glass
staring
at
the
glistening
brown
coils
make
it
move
he
whined
at
his
father
uncle
Vernon
tapped
on
the
glass
but
the
snake
didn't
budge
do
it
again
Dudley
ordered
uncle
Vernon
rapped
the
glass
smartly
with
his
knuckles
but
the
snake
just
snoozed
on
this
is
boring
Dudley
moaned
he
shuffled
away
harry
moved
in
front
of
the
tank
and
looked
intently
at
the
snake
he
wouldn't
have
been
surprised
if
it
had
died
of
boredom
itself
no
company
except
stupid
people
drumming
their
fingers
on
the
glass
trying
to
disturb
it
all
day
long
it
was
worse
than
having
a
cupboard
as
a
bedroom
where
the
only
visitor
was
Aunt
Petunia
hammering
on
the
door
to
wake
you
up
at
least
he
got
to
visit
the
rest
of
the
house
the
snake
suddenly
opened
its
beady
eyes
slowly
very
slowly
it
raised
its
head
until
its
eyes
were
on
a
level
with
harry's
it
winked
harry
stared
then
he
looked
quickly
around
to
see
if
anyone
was
watching
they
weren't
he
looked
back
at
the
snake
and
winked
too
the
snake
jerked
its
head
toward
Uncle
Vernon
and
Dudley
then
raised
its
eyes
to
the
ceiling
it
gave
Harry
a
look
that
said
quite
plainly
I
get
that
all
the
time
i
know
Harry
murmured
through
the
glass
though
he
wasn't
sure
the
snake
could
hear
him
it
must
be
really
annoying
the
snake
nodded
vigorously
where
do
you
come
from
anyway
harry
asked
the
snake
jabbed
its
tail
at
a
little
sign
next
to
the
glass
harry
peered
at
it
boa
Constrictor
Brazil
was
it
nice
there
the
boa
constrictor
jabbed
its
tail
at
the
sign
again
and
Harry
read
on
This
specimen
was
bred
in
the
zoo
oh
I
see
so
you've
never
been
to
Brazil
as
the
snake
shook
its
head
a
deafening
shout
behind
Harry
made
both
of
them
jump
dudley
mr
dursley
come
and
look
at
this
snake
you
won't
believe
what
it's
doing
dudley
came
waddling
toward
them
as
fast
as
he
could
out
of
the
way
you
he
said
punching
Harry
in
the
ribs
caught
by
surprise
Harry
fell
hard
on
the
concrete
floor
what
came
next
happened
so
fast
no
one
saw
how
it
happened
one
second
Piers
and
Dudley
were
leaning
right
up
close
to
the
glass
the
next
they
had
leapt
back
with
howls
of
horror
harry
sat
up
and
gasped
the
glass
front
of
the
boa
constrictor's
tank
had
vanished
the
great
snake
was
uncoiling
itself
rapidly
slithering
out
onto
the
floor
people
throughout
the
reptile
house
screamed
and
started
running
for
the
exits
as
the
snake
slid
swiftly
past
him
Harry
could
have
sworn
a
low
hissing
voice
said
Brazil
here
I
come
thanksss
amigo
the
keeper
of
the
reptile
house
was
in
shock
but
the
glass
he
kept
saying
where
did
the
glass
go
the
zoo
director
himself
made
Aunt
Petunia
a
cup
of
strong
sweet
tea
while
he
apologized
over
and
over
again
piers
and
Dudley
could
only
gibber
as
far
as
Harry
had
seen
the
snake
hadn't
done
anything
except
snap
playfully
at
their
heels
as
it
passed
but
by
the
time
they
were
all
back
in
Uncle
vernon's
car
Dudley
was
telling
them
how
it
had
nearly
bitten
off
his
leg
while
Piers
was
swearing
it
had
tried
to
squeeze
him
to
death
but
worst
of
all
for
Harry
at
least
was
Piers
calming
down
enough
to
say
Harry
was
talking
to
it
weren't
you
Harry
uncle
Vernon
waited
until
Piers
was
safely
out
of
the
house
before
starting
on
Harry
he
was
so
angry
he
could
hardly
speak
he
managed
to
say
Go
cupboard
stay
no
meals
before
he
collapsed
into
a
chair
and
Aunt
Petunia
had
to
run
and
get
him
a
large
brandy
harry
lay
in
his
dark
cupboard
much
later
wishing
he
had
a
watch
he
didn't
know
what
time
it
was
and
he
couldn't
be
sure
the
Dursleys
were
asleep
yet
until
they
were
he
couldn't
risk
sneaking
to
the
kitchen
for
some
food
he'd
lived
with
the
Dursleys
almost
ten
years
ten
miserable
years
as
long
as
he
could
remember
ever
since
he'd
been
a
baby
and
his
parents
had
died
in
that
car
crash
he
couldn't
remember
being
in
the
car
when
his
parents
had
died
sometimes
when
he
strained
his
memory
during
long
hours
in
his
cupboard
he
came
up
with
a
strange
vision
a
blinding
flash
of
green
light
and
a
burn
ing
pain
on
his
forehead
this
he
supposed
was
the
crash
though
he
couldn't
imagine
where
all
the
green
light
came
from
he
couldn't
remember
his
parents
at
all
his
aunt
and
uncle
never
spoke
about
them
and
of
course
he
was
forbidden
to
ask
questions
there
were
no
photographs
of
them
in
the
house
when
he
had
been
younger
Harry
had
dreamed
and
dreamed
of
some
unknown
relation
coming
to
take
him
away
but
it
had
never
happened
the
Dursleys
were
his
only
family
yet
sometimes
he
thought
or
maybe
hoped
that
strangers
in
the
street
seemed
to
know
him
very
strange
strangers
they
were
too
a
tiny
man
in
a
violet
top
hat
had
bowed
to
him
once
while
out
shopping
with
Aunt
Petunia
and
Dudley
after
asking
Harry
furiously
if
he
knew
the
man
Aunt
Petunia
had
rushed
them
out
of
the
shop
without
buying
anything
a
wild-looking
old
woman
dressed
all
in
green
had
waved
merrily
at
him
once
on
a
bus
a
bald
man
in
a
very
long
purple
coat
had
actually
shaken
his
hand
in
the
street
the
other
day
and
then
walked
away
without
a
word
the
weirdest
thing
about
all
these
people
was
the
way
they
seemed
to
vanish
the
second
Harry
tried
to
get
a
closer
look
at
school
Harry
had
no
one
everybody
knew
that
dudley's
gang
hated
that
odd
Harry
Potter
in
his
baggy
old
clothes
and
broken
glasses
and
nobody
liked
to
disagree
with
dudley's
gang
chapter
three
the
letters
from
no
one
the
escape
of
the
Brazilian
boa
constrictor
earned
Harry
his
longest-ever
punishment
by
the
time
he
was
allowed
out
of
his
cupboard
again
the
summer
holidays
had
started
and
Dudley
had
already
broken
his
new
video
camera
crashed
his
remote
control
airplane
and
first
time
out
on
his
racing
bike
knocked
down
old
Mrs
figg
as
she
crossed
Privet
Drive
on
her
crutches
harry
was
glad
school
was
over
but
there
was
no
escaping
dudley's
gang
who
visited
the
house
every
single
day
piers
Dennis
Malcolm
and
Gordon
were
all
big
and
stupid
but
as
Dudley
was
the
biggest
and
stupidest
of
the
lot
he
was
the
leader
the
rest
of
them
were
all
quite
happy
to
join
in
dudley's
favorite
sport
Harry
Hunting
this
was
why
Harry
spent
as
much
time
as
possible
out
of
the
house
wandering
around
and
thinking
about
the
end
of
the
holidays
where
he
could
see
a
tiny
ray
of
hope
when
September
came
he
would
be
going
off
to
secondary
school
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
wouldn't
be
with
Dudley
dudley
had
been
accepted
at
Uncle
vernon's
old
private
school
Smeltings
piers
Polkiss
was
going
there
too
harry
on
the
other
hand
was
going
to
Stonewall
High
the
local
public
school
dudley
thought
this
was
very
funny
they
stuff
people's
heads
down
the
toilet
the
first
day
at
Stonewall
he
told
Harry
want
to
come
upstairs
and
practice
no
thanks
said
Harry
the
poor
toilet's
never
had
anything
as
horrible
as
your
head
down
it
it
might
be
sick
then
he
ran
before
Dudley
could
work
out
what
he'd
said
one
day
in
July
Aunt
Petunia
took
Dudley
to
London
to
buy
his
Smeltings
uniform
leaving
Harry
at
Mrs
figg's
mrs
figg
wasn
t
as
bad
as
usual
it
turned
out
she'd
broken
her
leg
tripping
over
one
of
her
cats
and
she
didn't
seem
quite
as
fond
of
them
as
before
she
let
Harry
watch
television
and
gave
him
a
bit
of
chocolate
cake
that
tasted
as
though
she'd
had
it
for
several
years
that
evening
Dudley
paraded
around
the
living
room
for
the
family
in
his
brand-new
uniform
smeltings
boys
wore
maroon
tailcoats
orange
knickerbockers
and
flat
straw
hats
called
boaters
they
also
carried
knobbly
sticks
used
for
hitting
each
other
while
the
teachers
weren't
looking
this
was
supposed
to
be
good
training
for
later
life
as
he
looked
at
Dudley
in
his
new
knickerbockers
Uncle
Vernon
said
gruffly
that
it
was
the
proudest
moment
of
his
life
aunt
Petunia
burst
into
tears
and
said
she
couldn't
believe
it
was
her
Ickle
Dudleykins
he
looked
so
handsome
and
grown-up
harry
didn't
trust
himself
to
speak
he
thought
two
of
his
ribs
might
already
have
cracked
from
trying
not
to
laugh
there
was
a
horrible
smell
in
the
kitchen
the
next
morning
when
Harry
went
in
for
breakfast
it
seemed
to
be
coming
from
a
large
metal
tub
in
the
sink
he
went
to
have
a
look
the
tub
was
full
of
what
looked
like
dirty
rags
swimming
in
gray
water
what's
this
he
asked
Aunt
Petunia
her
lips
tightened
as
they
always
did
if
he
dared
to
ask
a
question
your
new
school
uniform
she
said
harry
looked
in
the
bowl
again
oh
he
said
I
didn't
realize
it
had
to
be
so
wet
dota
be
stupid
snapped
Aunt
Petunia
i'm
dyeing
some
of
dudley's
old
things
gray
for
you
it'll
look
just
like
everyone
else's
when
i've
finished
harry
seriously
doubted
this
but
thought
it
best
not
to
argue
he
sat
down
at
the
table
and
tried
not
to
think
about
how
he
was
going
to
look
on
his
first
day
at
Stonewall
High
like
he
was
wearing
bits
of
old
elephant
skin
probably
dudley
and
Uncle
Vernon
came
in
both
with
wrinkled
noses
because
of
the
smell
from
harry's
new
uniform
uncle
Vernon
opened
his
newspaper
as
usual
and
Dudley
banged
his
Smelting
stick
which
he
carried
everywhere
on
the
table
they
heard
the
click
of
the
mail
slot
and
flop
of
letters
on
the
doormat
get
the
mail
Dudley
said
Uncle
Vernon
from
behind
his
paper
make
Harry
get
it
get
the
mail
Harry
make
Dudley
get
it
poke
him
with
your
Smelting
stick
Dudley
harry
dodged
the
Smelting
stick
and
went
to
get
the
mail
three
things
lay
on
the
doormat
a
postcard
from
Uncle
vernon's
sister
Marge
who
was
vacationing
on
the
Isle
of
Wight
a
brown
envelope
that
looked
like
a
bill
and
a
letter
for
Harry
harry
picked
it
up
and
stared
at
it
his
heart
twanging
like
a
giant
elastic
band
no
one
ever
in
his
whole
life
had
written
to
him
who
would
he
had
no
friends
no
other
relatives
he
didn't
belong
to
the
library
so
he'd
never
even
got
rude
notes
asking
for
books
back
yet
here
it
was
a
letter
addressed
so
plainly
there
could
be
no
mistake
mr.
H
potter
The
Cupboard
under
the
Stairs
Privet
Drive
Little
Whinging
Surrey
The
envelope
was
thick
and
heavy
made
of
yellowish
parchment
and
the
address
was
written
in
emerald-green
ink
there
was
no
stamp
turning
the
envelope
over
his
hand
trembling
Harry
saw
a
purple
wax
seal
bearing
a
coat
of
arms
a
lion
an
eagle
a
badger
and
a
snake
surrounding
a
large
letter
H
hurry
up
boy
shouted
Uncle
Vernon
from
the
kitchen
what
are
you
doing
checking
for
letter
bombs
he
chuckled
at
his
own
joke
harry
went
back
to
the
kitchen
still
staring
at
his
letter
he
handed
Uncle
Vernon
the
bill
and
the
postcard
sat
down
and
slowly
began
to
open
the
yellow
envelope
uncle
Vernon
ripped
open
the
bill
snorted
in
disgust
and
flipped
over
the
postcard
marge's
ill
he
informed
Aunt
Petunia
ate
a
funny
whelk
dad
said
Dudley
suddenly
dad
harry's
got
something
harry
was
on
the
point
of
unfolding
his
letter
which
was
written
on
the
same
heavy
parchment
as
the
envelope
when
it
was
jerked
sharply
out
of
his
hand
by
Uncle
Vernon
that's
mine
said
Harry
trying
to
snatch
it
back
who'd
be
writing
to
you
sneered
Uncle
Vernon
shaking
the
letter
open
with
one
hand
and
glancing
at
it
his
face
went
from
red
to
green
faster
than
a
set
of
traffic
lights
and
it
didn't
stop
there
within
seconds
it
was
the
grayish
white
of
old
porridge
p-P-Petunia
he
gasped
dudley
tried
to
grab
the
letter
to
read
it
but
Uncle
Vernon
held
it
high
out
of
his
reach
aunt
Petunia
took
it
curiously
and
read
the
first
line
for
a
moment
it
looked
as
though
she
might
faint
she
clutched
her
throat
and
made
a
choking
noise
vernon
oh
my
goodness
Vernon
they
stared
at
each
other
seeming
to
have
forgotten
that
Harry
and
Dudley
were
still
in
the
room
dudley
wasn't
used
to
being
ignored
he
gave
his
father
a
sharp
tap
on
the
head
with
his
Smelting
stick
i
want
to
read
that
letter
he
said
loudly
want
to
read
it
said
Harry
furiously
as
it's
mine
get
out
both
of
you
croaked
Uncle
Vernon
stuffing
the
letter
back
inside
its
envelope
harry
didn't
move
i
want
my
letter
he
shouted
let
me
see
it
demanded
Dudley
out
roared
Uncle
Vernon
and
he
took
both
Harry
and
Dudley
by
the
scruffs
of
their
necks
and
threw
them
into
the
hall
slamming
the
kitchen
door
behind
them
harry
and
Dudley
promptly
had
a
furious
but
silent
fight
over
who
would
listen
at
the
keyhole
Dudley
won
so
Harry
his
glasses
dangling
from
one
ear
lay
flat
on
his
stomach
to
listen
at
the
crack
between
door
and
floor
vernon
Aunt
Petunia
was
saying
in
a
quivering
voice
look
at
the
address
how
could
they
possibly
know
where
he
sleeps
you
don't
think
they're
watching
the
house
watching
spying
might
be
following
us
muttered
Uncle
Vernon
wildly
but
what
should
we
do
Vernon
should
we
write
back
tell
them
we
don't
want
harry
could
see
Uncle
vernon's
shiny
black
shoes
pacing
up
and
down
the
kitchen
no
he
said
finally
no
we'll
ignore
it
if
they
don't
get
an
answer
yes
that's
best
we
won't
do
anything
but
i'm
not
having
one
in
the
house
Petunia
didn't
we
swear
when
we
took
him
in
we'd
stamp
out
that
dangerous
nonsense
that
evening
when
he
got
back
from
work
Uncle
Vernon
did
something
he'd
never
done
before
he
visited
Harry
in
his
cupboard
where's
my
letter
said
Harry
the
moment
Uncle
Vernon
had
squeezed
through
the
door
who's
writing
to
me
no
one
it
was
addressed
to
you
by
mistake
said
Uncle
Vernon
shortly
i
have
burned
it
it
was
not
a
mistake
said
Harry
angrily
it
had
my
cupboard
on
it
silence
yelled
Uncle
Vernon
and
a
couple
of
spiders
fell
from
the
ceiling
he
took
a
few
deep
breaths
and
then
forced
his
face
into
a
smile
which
looked
quite
painful
er
yes
Harry
about
this
cupboard
your
aunt
and
I
have
been
thinking
you're
really
getting
a
bit
big
for
it
we
think
it
might
be
nice
if
you
moved
into
dudley's
second
bedroom
why
said
Harry
don't
ask
questions
snapped
his
uncle
take
this
stuff
upstairs
now
the
Dursleys
house
had
four
bedrooms
one
for
Uncle
Vernon
and
Aunt
Petunia
one
for
visitors
usually
Uncle
vernon's
sister
Marge
one
where
Dudley
slept
and
one
where
Dudley
kept
all
the
toys
and
things
that
wouldn't
fit
into
his
first
bedroom
it
only
took
Harry
one
trip
upstairs
to
move
everything
he
owned
from
the
cupboard
to
this
room
he
sat
down
on
the
bed
and
stared
around
him
nearly
everything
in
here
was
broken
the
month-old
video
camera
was
lying
on
top
of
a
small
working
tank
Dudley
had
once
driven
over
the
next
door
neighbor's
dog
in
the
corner
was
dudley's
first-ever
television
set
which
he'd
put
his
foot
through
when
his
favorite
program
had
been
canceled
there
was
a
large
birdcage
which
had
once
held
a
parrot
that
Dudley
had
swapped
at
school
for
a
real
air
rifle
which
was
up
on
a
shelf
with
the
end
all
bent
because
Dudley
had
sat
on
it
other
shelves
were
full
of
books
they
were
the
only
things
in
the
room
that
looked
as
though
they'd
never
been
touched
from
downstairs
came
the
sound
of
Dudley
bawling
at
his
mother
I
don't
want
him
in
there
i
need
that
room
make
him
get
out
harry
sighed
and
stretched
out
on
the
bed
yesterday
he'd
have
given
anything
to
be
up
here
today
he'd
rather
be
back
in
his
cupboard
with
that
letter
than
up
here
without
it
next
morning
at
breakfast
everyone
was
rather
quiet
dudley
was
in
shock
he'd
screamed
whacked
his
father
with
his
Smelting
stick
been
sick
on
purpose
kicked
his
mother
and
thrown
his
tortoise
through
the
greenhouse
roof
and
he
still
didn't
have
his
room
back
harry
was
thinking
about
this
time
yesterday
and
bitterly
wishing
he'd
opened
the
letter
in
the
hall
uncle
Vernon
and
Aunt
Petunia
kept
looking
at
each
other
darkly
when
the
mail
arrived
Uncle
Vernon
who
seemed
to
be
trying
to
be
nice
to
Harry
made
Dudley
go
and
get
it
they
heard
him
banging
things
with
his
Smelting
stick
all
the
way
down
the
hall
then
he
shouted
there's
another
one
mr.
H
potter
The
Smallest
Bedroom
Privet
Drive
with
a
strangled
cry
Uncle
Vernon
leapt
from
his
seat
and
ran
down
the
hall
Harry
right
behind
him
uncle
Vernon
had
to
wrestle
Dudley
to
the
ground
to
get
the
letter
from
him
which
was
made
difficult
by
the
fact
that
Harry
had
grabbed
Uncle
Vernon
around
the
neck
from
behind
after
a
minute
of
confused
fighting
in
which
everyone
got
hit
a
lot
by
the
Smelting
stick
Uncle
Vernon
straightened
up
gasping
for
breath
with
harry's
letter
clutched
in
his
hand
go
to
your
cupboard
I
mean
your
bedroom
he
wheezed
at
Harry
dudley
go
just
go
harry
walked
round
and
round
his
new
room
someone
knew
he
had
moved
out
of
his
cupboard
and
they
seemed
to
know
he
hadn't
received
his
first
letter
surely
that
meant
they'd
try
again
and
this
time
he'd
make
sure
they
didn't
fail
he
had
a
plan
the
repaired
alarm
clock
rang
at
six
o'clock
the
next
morning
harry
turned
it
off
quickly
and
dressed
silently
he
mustn't
wake
the
Dursleys
he
stole
downstairs
without
turning
on
any
of
the
lights
he
was
going
to
wait
for
the
postman
on
the
corner
of
Privet
Drive
and
get
the
letters
for
number
four
first
his
heart
hammered
as
he
crept
across
the
dark
hall
toward
the
front
door
Harry
leapt
into
the
air
he'd
trodden
on
something
big
and
squashy
on
the
doormat
something
alive
lights
clicked
on
upstairs
and
to
his
horror
Harry
realized
that
the
big
squashy
something
had
been
his
uncle's
face
uncle
Vernon
had
been
lying
at
the
foot
of
the
front
door
in
a
sleeping
bag
clearly
making
sure
that
Harry
didn't
do
exactly
what
he'd
been
trying
to
do
he
shouted
at
Harry
for
about
half
an
hour
and
then
told
him
to
go
and
make
a
cup
of
tea
harry
shuffled
miserably
off
into
the
kitchen
and
by
the
time
he
got
back
the
mail
had
arrived
right
into
Uncle
vernon's
lap
harry
could
see
three
letters
addressed
in
green
ink
i
want
he
began
but
Uncle
Vernon
was
tearing
the
letters
into
pieces
before
his
eyes
uncle
Vernon
didnt
go
to
work
that
day
he
stayed
at
home
and
nailed
up
the
mail
slot
see
he
explained
to
Aunt
Petunia
through
a
mouthful
of
nails
if
they
can't
deliver
them
they'll
just
give
up
i'm
not
sure
that'll
work
Vernon
oh
these
people's
minds
work
in
strange
ways
Petunia
they're
not
like
you
and
me
said
Uncle
Vernon
trying
to
knock
in
a
nail
with
the
piece
of
fruitcake
Aunt
Petunia
had
just
brought
him
on
Friday
no
less
than
twelve
letters
arrived
for
Harry
as
they
couldn't
go
through
the
mail
slot
they
had
been
pushed
under
the
door
slotted
through
the
sides
and
a
few
even
forced
through
the
small
window
in
the
downstairs
bathroom
uncle
Vernon
stayed
at
home
again
after
burning
all
the
letters
he
got
out
a
hammer
and
nails
and
boarded
up
the
cracks
around
the
front
and
back
doors
so
no
one
could
go
out
he
hummed
Tiptoe
Through
the
Tulips
as
he
worked
and
jumped
at
small
noises
on
Saturday
things
began
to
get
out
of
hand
twenty-four
letters
to
Harry
found
their
way
into
the
house
rolled
up
and
hidden
inside
each
of
the
two
dozen
eggs
that
their
very
confused
milkman
had
handed
Aunt
Petunia
through
the
living
room
window
while
Uncle
Vernon
made
furious
telephone
calls
to
the
post
office
and
the
dairy
trying
to
find
someone
to
complain
to
Aunt
Petunia
shredded
the
letters
in
her
food
processor
who
on
earth
wants
to
talk
to
you
this
badly
dudley
asked
Harry
in
amazement
on
Sunday
morning
Uncle
Vernon
sat
down
at
the
breakfast
table
looking
tired
and
rather
ill
but
happy
no
post
on
Sundays
he
reminded
them
cheerfully
as
he
spread
marmalade
on
his
newspapers
no
damn
letters
today
something
came
whizzing
down
the
kitchen
chimney
as
he
spoke
and
caught
him
sharply
on
the
back
of
the
head
next
moment
thirty
or
forty
letters
came
pelting
out
of
the
fireplace
like
bullets
the
Dursleys
ducked
but
Harry
leapt
into
the
air
trying
to
catch
one
out
out
uncle
Vernon
seized
Harry
around
the
waist
and
threw
him
into
the
hall
when
Aunt
Petunia
and
Dudley
had
run
out
with
their
arms
over
their
faces
Uncle
Vernon
slammed
the
door
shut
they
could
hear
the
letters
still
streaming
into
the
room
bouncing
off
the
walls
and
floor
that
does
it
said
Uncle
Vernon
trying
to
speak
calmly
but
pulling
great
tufts
out
of
his
mustache
at
the
same
time
i
want
you
all
back
here
in
five
minutes
ready
to
leave
we're
going
away
just
pack
some
clothes
no
arguments
he
looked
so
dangerous
with
half
his
mustache
missing
that
no
one
dared
argue
ten
minutes
later
they
had
wrenched
their
way
through
the
boarded-up
doors
and
were
in
the
car
speeding
toward
the
highway
dudley
was
sniffling
in
the
back
seat
his
father
had
hit
him
round
the
head
for
holding
them
up
while
he
tried
to
pack
his
television
vcr
and
computer
in
his
sports
bag
they
drove
and
they
drove
even
Aunt
Petunia
didn't
dare
ask
where
they
were
going
every
now
and
then
Uncle
Vernon
would
take
a
sharp
turn
and
drive
in
the
opposite
direction
for
a
while
shake'em
off
shake
em
off
he
would
mutter
whenever
he
did
this
they
didn't
stop
to
eat
or
drink
all
day
by
nightfall
Dudley
was
howling
he'd
never
had
such
a
bad
day
in
his
life
he
was
hungry
he'd
missed
five
television
programs
he'd
wanted
to
see
and
he'd
never
gone
so
long
without
blowing
up
an
alien
on
his
computer
uncle
Vernon
stopped
at
last
outside
a
gloomy-looking
hotel
on
the
outskirts
of
a
big
city
dudley
and
Harry
shared
a
room
with
twin
beds
and
damp
musty
sheets
dudley
snored
but
Harry
stayed
awake
sitting
on
the
windowsill
staring
down
at
the
lights
of
passing
cars
and
wondering
they
ate
stale
cornflakes
and
cold
tinned
tomatoes
on
toast
for
breakfast
the
next
day
they
had
just
finished
when
the
owner
of
the
hotel
came
over
to
their
table
scuse
me
but
is
one
of
you
mr.
H
potter
only
I
got
about
an
undred
of
these
at
the
front
desk
she
held
up
a
letter
so
they
could
read
the
green
ink
address
mr.
H
potter
Room
Railview
Hotel
Cokeworth
Harry
made
a
grab
for
the
letter
but
Uncle
Vernon
knocked
his
hand
out
of
the
way
the
woman
stared
i'll
take
them
said
Uncle
Vernon
standing
up
quickly
and
following
her
from
the
dining
room
wouldn't
it
be
better
just
to
go
home
dear
aunt
Petunia
suggested
timidly
hours
later
but
Uncle
Vernon
didn't
seem
to
hear
her
exactly
what
he
was
looking
for
none
of
them
knew
he
drove
them
into
the
middle
of
a
forest
got
out
looked
around
shook
his
head
got
back
in
the
car
and
off
they
went
again
the
same
thing
happened
in
the
middle
of
a
plowed
field
halfway
across
a
suspension
bridge
and
at
the
top
of
a
multilevel
parking
garage
daddy's
gone
mad
hasn't
he
dudley
asked
Aunt
Petunia
dully
late
that
afternoon
uncle
Vernon
had
parked
at
the
coast
locked
them
all
inside
the
car
and
disappeared
it
started
to
rain
great
drops
beat
on
the
roof
of
the
car
dud
ley
sniveled
it's
Monday
he
told
his
mother
the
Great
humberto's
on
tonight
i
want
to
stay
somewhere
with
a
television
monday
this
reminded
Harry
of
something
if
it
was
Monday
and
you
could
usually
count
on
Dudley
to
know
the
days
the
week
because
of
television
then
tomorrow
Tuesday
was
harry's
eleventh
birthday
of
course
his
birthdays
were
never
exactly
fun
last
year
the
Dursleys
had
given
him
a
coat
hanger
and
a
pair
of
Uncle
vernon's
old
socks
still
you
weren't
eleven
every
day
uncle
Vernon
was
back
and
he
was
smiling
he
was
also
carrying
a
long
thin
package
and
didn't
answer
Aunt
Petunia
when
she
asked
what
he'd
bought
found
the
perfect
place
he
said
come
on
everyone
out
it
was
very
cold
outside
the
car
uncle
Vernon
was
pointing
at
what
looked
like
a
large
rock
way
out
at
sea
perched
on
top
of
the
rock
was
the
most
miserable
little
shack
you
could
imagine
one
thing
was
certain
there
was
no
television
in
there
storm
forecast
for
tonight
said
Uncle
Vernon
gleefully
clapping
his
hands
together
and
this
gentleman's
kindly
agreed
to
lend
us
his
boat
a
toothless
old
man
came
ambling
up
to
them
pointing
with
a
rather
wicked
grin
at
an
old
rowboat
bobbing
in
the
iron-gray
water
below
them
i've
already
got
us
some
rations
said
Uncle
Vernon
so
all
aboard
it
was
freezing
in
the
boat
icy
sea
spray
and
rain
crept
down
their
necks
and
a
chilly
wind
whipped
their
faces
after
what
seemed
like
hours
they
reached
the
rock
where
Uncle
Vernon
slipping
and
sliding
led
the
way
to
the
broken-down
house
the
inside
was
horrible
it
smelled
strongly
of
seaweed
the
wind
whistled
through
the
gaps
in
the
wooden
walls
and
the
fireplace
was
damp
and
empty
there
were
only
two
rooms
uncle
vernon's
rations
turned
out
to
be
a
bag
of
chips
each
and
four
bananas
he
tried
to
start
a
fire
but
the
empty
chip
bags
just
smoked
and
shriveled
up
could
do
with
some
of
those
letters
now
eh
he
said
cheerfully
he
was
in
a
very
good
mood
obviously
he
thought
nobody
stood
a
chance
of
reaching
them
here
in
a
storm
to
deliver
mail
harry
privately
agreed
though
the
thought
didn't
cheer
him
up
at
all
as
night
fell
the
promised
storm
blew
up
around
them
spray
from
the
high
waves
splattered
the
walls
of
the
hut
and
a
fierce
wind
rattled
the
filthy
windows
aunt
Petunia
found
a
few
moldy
blankets
in
the
second
room
and
made
up
a
bed
for
Dudley
on
the
moth-eaten
sofa
she
and
Uncle
Vernon
went
off
to
the
lumpy
bed
next
door
and
Harry
was
left
to
find
the
softest
bit
of
floor
he
could
and
to
curl
up
under
the
thinnest
most
ragged
blanket
the
storm
raged
more
and
more
ferociously
as
the
night
went
on
harry
couldn't
sleep
he
shivered
and
turned
over
trying
to
get
comfortable
his
stomach
rumbling
with
hunger
dudley's
snores
were
drowned
by
the
low
rolls
of
thunder
that
started
near
midnight
the
lighted
dial
of
dudley's
watch
which
was
dangling
over
the
edge
of
the
sofa
on
his
fat
wrist
told
Harry
he'd
be
eleven
in
ten
minutes
time
he
lay
and
watched
his
birthday
tick
nearer
wondering
if
the
Dursleys
would
remember
at
all
wondering
where
the
letter
writer
was
now
five
minutes
to
go
harry
heard
something
creak
outside
he
hoped
the
roof
wasn't
going
to
fall
in
although
he
might
be
warmer
if
it
did
four
minutes
to
go
maybe
the
house
in
Privet
Drive
would
be
so
full
of
letters
when
they
got
back
that
he'd
be
able
to
steal
one
somehow
three
minutes
to
go
was
that
the
sea
slapping
hard
on
the
rock
like
that
and
two
minutes
to
go
what
was
that
funny
crunching
noise
was
the
rock
crumbling
into
the
sea
one
minute
to
go
and
he'd
be
eleven
thirty
seconds
twenty
ten
nine
maybe
he'd
wake
Dudley
up
just
to
annoy
him
three
two
one
boom
the
whole
shack
shivered
and
Harry
sat
bolt
upright
staring
at
the
door
someone
was
outside
knocking
to
come
in
chapter
four
the
keeper
of
the
keys
boom
they
knocked
again
dudley
jerked
awake
where's
the
cannon
he
said
stupidly
there
was
a
crash
behind
them
and
Uncle
Vernon
came
skidding
into
the
room
he
was
holding
a
rifle
in
his
hands
now
they
knew
what
had
been
in
the
long
thin
package
he
had
brought
with
them
who's
there
he
shouted
i
warn
you
i'm
armed
there
was
a
pause
then
smash
the
door
was
hit
with
such
force
that
it
swung
clean
off
its
hinges
and
with
a
deafening
crash
landed
flat
on
the
floor
a
giant
of
a
man
was
standing
in
the
doorway
his
face
was
almost
completely
hidden
by
a
long
shaggy
mane
of
hair
and
a
wild
tangled
beard
but
you
could
make
out
his
eyes
glinting
like
black
beetles
under
all
the
hair
the
giant
squeezed
his
way
into
the
hut
stooping
so
that
his
head
just
brushed
the
ceiling
he
bent
down
picked
up
the
door
and
fitted
it
easily
back
into
its
frame
the
noise
of
the
storm
outside
dropped
a
little
he
turned
to
look
at
them
all
couldn't
make
us
a
cup
o
tea
could
yeh
it's
not
been
an
easy
journey
he
strode
over
to
the
sofa
where
Dudley
sat
frozen
with
fear
budge
up
yeh
great
lump
said
the
stranger
dudley
squeaked
and
ran
to
hide
behind
his
mother
who
was
crouching
terrified
behind
Uncle
Vernon
an
here's
Harry
said
the
giant
harry
looked
up
into
the
fierce
wild
shadowy
face
and
saw
that
the
beetle
eyes
were
crinkled
in
a
smile
las
time
I
saw
you
you
was
only
a
baby
said
the
giant
yeh
look
a
lot
like
yet
dad
but
yeh've
got
yet
mom's
eyes
uncle
Vernon
made
a
funny
rasping
noise
i
demand
that
you
leave
at
once
sit
he
said
you
are
breaking
and
entering
ah
shut
up
Dursley
yeh
great
prune
said
the
giant
he
reached
over
the
back
of
the
sofa
jerked
the
gun
out
of
Uncle
vernon's
hands
bent
it
into
a
knot
as
easily
as
if
it
had
been
made
of
rubber
and
threw
it
into
a
corner
of
the
room
uncle
Vernon
made
another
funny
noise
like
a
mouse
being
trodden
on
anyway
Harry
said
the
giant
turning
his
back
on
the
Dursleys
a
very
happy
birthday
to
yeh
got
summat
fer
yeh
here
I
mighta
sat
on
it
at
some
point
but
it'll
taste
all
right
from
an
inside
pocket
of
his
black
overcoat
he
pulled
a
slightly
squashed
box
harry
opened
it
with
trembling
fingers
inside
was
a
large
sticky
chocolate
cake
with
Happy
Birthday
Harry
written
on
it
in
green
icing
harry
looked
up
at
the
giant
he
meant
to
say
thank
you
but
the
words
got
lost
on
the
way
to
his
mouth
and
what
he
said
instead
was
Who
are
you
the
giant
chuckled
true
I
haven't
introduced
meself
rubeus
Hagrid
Keeper
of
Keys
and
Grounds
at
Hogwarts
he
held
out
an
enormous
hand
and
shook
harry's
whole
arm
what
about
that
tea
then
eh
he
said
rubbing
his
hands
together
i'd
not
say
no
ter
summat
stronger
if
yeh've
got
it
mind
his
eyes
fell
on
the
empty
grate
with
the
shriveled
chip
bags
in
it
and
he
snorted
he
bent
down
over
the
fireplace
they
couldn't
see
what
he
was
doing
but
when
he
drew
back
a
second
later
there
was
a
roaring
fire
there
it
filled
the
whole
damp
hut
with
flickering
light
and
Harry
felt
the
warmth
wash
over
him
as
though
he'd
sunk
into
a
hot
bath
the
giant
sat
back
down
on
the
sofa
which
sagged
under
his
weight
and
began
taking
all
sorts
of
things
out
of
the
pockets
of
his
coat
a
copper
kettle
a
squashy
package
of
sausages
a
poker
a
teapot
several
chipped
mugs
and
a
bottle
of
some
amber
liquid
that
he
took
a
swig
from
before
starting
to
make
tea
soon
the
hut
was
full
of
the
sound
and
smell
of
sizzling
sausage
nobody
said
a
thing
while
the
giant
was
working
but
as
he
slid
the
first
six
fat
juicy
slightly
burnt
sausages
from
the
poker
Dudley
fidgeted
a
little
uncle
Vernon
said
sharply
don't
touch
anything
he
gives
you
Dudley
the
giant
chuckled
darkly
yet
great
puddin
of
a
son
don
need
fattenin
anymore
Dursley
don
worry
he
passed
the
sausages
to
Harry
who
was
so
hungry
he
had
never
tasted
anything
so
wonderful
but
he
still
couldn't
take
his
eyes
off
the
giant
finally
as
nobody
seemed
about
to
explain
anything
he
said
i'm
sorry
but
I
still
don't
really
know
who
you
are
the
giant
took
a
gulp
of
tea
and
wiped
his
mouth
with
the
back
of
his
hand
call
me
Hagrid
he
said
everyone
does
an
like
I
told

of
Keys

Harry

shocked

Harry
said
quickly
sony
barked
Hagrid
turning
to
stare
at
the
Dursleys
who
shrank
back
into
the
shadows
it
s
them
as

be
sorry
i

I
never

never
wonder
where

parents
learned

all
all
what

Harry
all
what
hagrid
thundered
now
wait
jus
one
second
he
had
leapt
to
his
feet
in
his
anger
he
seemed
to
fill
the
whole
hut
the
Dursleys
were
cowering
against
the
wall
do
you
mean
ter
tell
me
he
growled
at
the
Dursleys
that
this
boy
this
boy

abou

harry
thought
this
was
going
a
bit
far
he

and
his
marks
weren't
bad
i
know
some
things
he
said
i
can

Hagrid
simply
waved
his
hand
and
said
About

world
I
mean
your
world

world
yer
parents
world
what
world
hagrid
looked
as
if
he
was
about
to
explode
dursley
he
boomed
uncle
Vernon
who
had
gone
very
pale
whispered
something
that
sounded
like
Mimblewimble
hagrid
stared
wildly
at
Harry
but
yeh
must
know
about
yet
mom
and
dad
he
said
i

hagrid
ran
his
fingers
through
his
hair
fixing
Harry
with
a
bewildered
stare

know
what

are
he
said
finally
uncle
Vernon
suddenly
found
his
voice
stop
he
commanded
stop

there
sit
i
forbid
you
to
tell
the
boy
anything
a
braver
man
than
Vernon
Dursley
would

under

furious
look
Hagrid
now
gave
him
when
Hagrid
spoke
his
every
syllable
trembled
with
rage
you
never
told
him
never
told
him

Uncle

in

there
was
silence
inside
the
hut
only
the
sea
and
the
whistling
wind
could
be
heard
a
what
gasped
Harry
a
wizard
o
course
said
Hagrid
sitting
back
down
on
the
sofa
which
groaned
and
sank
even
lower
an
a
thumpin
good'un

say

trained
up
a
bit
with
a

Minerva
McGonagall
Deputy
Headmistress
Questions
exploded
inside
harry's
head
like
fireworks
and
he
couldn't
decide
which
to
ask
first
after
a
few
minutes
he
stammered
What
does
it
mean
they
await
my
owl
gallopin
Gorgons
that
reminds
me
said
Hagrid
clapping
a
hand
to
his
forehead
with
enough
force
to
knock
over
a
cart
horse
and
from
yet
another
pocket
inside
his
overcoat
he
pulled
an
owl
a
real
live
rather
ruffled-looking
owl
a
long
quill
and
a
roll
of
parchment
with
his
tongue
between
his
teeth
he
scribbled
a
note
that
Harry
could
read
upside
down
Dear
Professor
Dumbledore
Given
Harry
his
letter
taking
him
to
buy
his
things
tomorrow
weather's
horrible
hope
you're
Well
hagrid
Hagrid
rolled
up
the
note
gave
it
to
the
owl
which
clamped
it
in
its
beak
went
to
the
door
and
threw
the
owl
out
into
the
storm
then
he
came
back
and
sat
down
as
though
this
was
as
normal
as
talking
on
the
telephone
harry
realized
his
mouth
was
open
and
closed
it
quickly
where
was
I
said
Hagrid
but
at
that
moment
Uncle
Vernon
still
ashen-faced
but
looking
very
angry
moved
into
the
firelight
he's
not
going
he
said
hagrid
grunted
i'd
like
ter
see
a
great
Muggle
like
you
stop
him
he
said
a
what
said
Harry
interested
a
Muggle
said
Hagrid
it's
what
we
call
nonmagic
folk
like
thern
an
it's
your
bad
luck
you
grew
up
in
a
family
o
the
biggest
Muggles
I
ever
laid
eyes
on
we
swore
when
we
took
him
in
we'd
put
a
stop
to
that
rubbish
said
Uncle
Vernon
swore
we'd
stamp
it
out
of
him
wizard
indeed
you
knew
said
Harry
you
knew
i'm
a
a
wizard
knew
shrieked
Aunt
Petunia
suddenly
knew
of
course
we
knew
how
could
you
not
be
my
dratted
sister
being
what
she
was
oh
she
got
a
letter
just
like
that
and
disappeared
off
to
that-that
school-and
came
home
every
vacation
with
her
pockets
full
of
frog
spawn
turning
teacups
into
rats
i
was
the
only
one
who
saw
her
for
what
she
was
a
freak
but
for
my
mother
and
father
oh
no
it
was
Lily
this
and
Lily
that
they
were
proud
of
having
a
witch
in
the
family
she
stopped
to
draw
a
deep
breath
and
then
went
ranting
on
it
seemed
she
had
been
wanting
to
say
all
this
for
years
then
she
met
that
Potter
at
school
and
they
left
and
got
married
and
had
you
and
of
course
I
knew
you'd
be
just
the
same
just
as
strange
just
as
as
abnormal
and
then
if
you
please
she
went
and
got
herself
blown
up
and
we
got
landed
with
you
harry
had
gone
very
white
as
soon
as
he
found
his
voice
he
said
Blown
up
you
told
me
they
died
in
a
car
crash
car
crash
roared
Hagrid
jumping
up
so
angrily
that
the
Dursleys
scuttled
back
to
their
corner
how
could
a
car
crash
kill
Lily
an
James
Potter
it's
an
outrage
a
scandal
harry
Potter
not
knowin
his
own
story
when
every
kid
in
our
world
knows
his
name
but
why
what
happened
harry
asked
urgently
the
anger
faded
from
hagrid's
face
he
looked
suddenly
anxious
i
never
expected
this
he
said
in
a
low
worried
voice
i
had
no
idea
when
Dumbledore
told
me
there
might
be
trouble
gettin
hold
of
yeh
how
much
yeh
didn't
know
ah
Harry
I
don
know
if
i'm
the
right
person
ter
tell
yeh
but
someone
s
gotta
yeh
can't
go
off
ter
Hogwarts
not
knowin
he
threw
a
dirty
look
at
the
Dursleys
well
it's
best
yeh
know
as
much
as
I
can
tell
yeh
mind
I
can't
tell
yeh
everythin
it's
a
great
myst'ry
parts
of
it
he
sat
down
stared
into
the
fire
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
said
It
begins
I
suppose
with
with
a
person
called
but
it's
incredible
yeh
don't
know
his
name
everyone
in
our
world
knows
who
well
I
don
like
sayin
the
name
if
I
can
help
it
no
one
does
why
not
gulpin
gargoyles
Harry
people
are
still
scared
blimey
this
is
difficult
see
there
was
this
wizard
who
went
bad
as
bad
as
you
could
go
worse
worse
than
worse
his
name
was
hagrid
gulped
but
no
words
came
out
could
you
write
it
down
harry
suggested
nah
can't
spell
it
all
right
Voldemort
hagrid
shuddered
don
make
me
say
it
again
anyway
this
this
wizard
about
twenty
years
ago
now
started
lookin
fer
followers
got
em
too
some
were
afraid
some
just
wanted
a
bit
o
his
power
cause
he
was
gettin
himself
power
all
right
dark
days
Harry
didn't
know
who
ter
trust
didn't
dare
get
friendly
with
strange
wizards
or
witches
terrible
things
happened
he
was
takin
over
course
some
stood
up
to
him
an
he
killed
em
horribly
one
o
the
only
safe
places
left
was
Hogwarts
reckon
dumbledore's
the
only
one
You-Know-Who
was
afraid
of
didn't
dare
try
takin
the
school
not
jus
then
anyway
now
yer
mum
an
dad
were
as
good
a
witch
an
wizard
as
I
ever
knew
head
boy
an
girl
at
Hogwarts
in
their
day
suppose
the
myst'ry
is
why
You-Know-Who
never
tried
to
get
em
on
his
side
before
probably
knew
they
were
too
close
ter
Dumbledore
ter
want
anythin
ter
do
with
the
Dark
Side
maybe
he
thought
he
could
persuade
em
maybe
he
just
wanted
em
outta
the
way
all
anyone
knows
is
he
turned
up
in
the
village
where
you
was
all
living
on
Halloween
ten
years
ago
you
was
just
a
year
old
he
came
ter
yer
house
an
an
hagrid
suddenly
pulled
out
a
very
dirty
spotted
handkerchief
and
blew
his
nose
with
a
sound
like
a
foghorn
sorry
he
said
but
it's
that
sad
knew
yer
mum
an
dad
an
nicer
people
yeh
couldn't
find
anyway
you-Know-Who
killed
em
an
then
an
this
is
the
real
myst'ry
of
the
thing
he
tried
to
kill
you
too
wanted
ter
make
a
clean
job
of
it
I
suppose
or
maybe
he
just
liked
killin
by
then
but
he
couldn't
do
it
never
wondered
how
you
got
that
mark
on
yer
forehead
that
was
no
ordinary
cut
that's
what
yeh
get
when
a
Powerful
evil
curse
touches
yeh
took
care
of
yer
mum
an
dad
an
yer
house
even
but
it
didn't
work
on
you
an
that's
why
yer
famous
Harry
no
one
ever
lived
after
he
decided
ter
kill
em
no
one
except
you
an
he'd
killed
some
o
the
best
witches
an
wizards
of
the
age
the
McKinnons
the
Bones
the
Prewetts
an
you
was
only
a
baby
an
you
lived
something
very
painful
was
going
on
in
harry's
mind
as
hagrid's
story
came
to
a
close
he
saw
again
the
blinding
flash
of
green
light
more
clearly
than
he
had
ever
remembered
it
before
and
he
remembered
something
else
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
a
high
cold
cruel
laugh
hagrid
was
watching
him
sadly
took
yeh
from
the
ruined
house
myself
on
dumbledore's
orders
brought
yeh
ter
this
lot
load
of
old
tosh
said
Uncle
Vernon
harry
jumped
he
had
almost
forgotten
that
the
Dursleys
were
there
uncle
Vernon
certainly
seemed
to
have
got
back
his
courage
he
was
glaring
at
Hagrid
and
his
fists
were
clenched
now
you
listen
here
boy
he
snarled
I
accept
there's
something
strange
about
you
probably
nothing
a
good
beating
wouldn't
have
cured
and
as
for
all
this
about
your
parents
well
they
were
weirdos
no
denying
it
and
the
world's
better
off
without
them
in
my
opinion
asked
for
all
they
got
getting
mixed
up
with
these
wizarding
types
just
what
I
expected
always
knew
they'd
come
to
a
sticky
end
but
at
that
moment
Hagrid
leapt
from
the
sofa
and
drew
a
battered
pink
umbrella
from
inside
his
coat
pointing
this
at
Uncle
Vernon
like
a
sword
he
said
i'm
warning
you
Dursley
i'm
warning
you
one
more
word
in
danger
of
being
speared
on
the
end
of
an
umbrella
by
a
bearded
giant
Uncle
vernon's
courage
failed
again
he
flattened
himself
against
the
wall
and
fell
silent
that's
better
said
Hagrid
breathing
heavily
and
sitting
back
down
on
the
sofa
which
this
time
sagged
right
down
to
the
floor
harry
meanwhile
still
had
questions
to
ask
hundreds
of
them
but
what
happened
to
Vol
sorry
I
mean
You-Know-Who
good
question
Harry
disappeared
vanished
same
night
he
tried
ter
kill
you
makes
yeh
even
more
famous
that's
the
biggest
myst'ry
see
he
was
gettin
more
an
more
powerful
why'd
he
go
some
say
he
died
codswallop
in
my
opinion
dunno
if
he
had
enough
human
left
in
him
to
die
some
say
he's
still
out
there
bidin
his
time
like
but
I
don
believe
it
people
who
was
on
his
side
came
back
ter
ours
some
of
em
came
outta
kinda
trances
don
reckon
they
could've
done
if
he
was
comin
back
most
of
us
reckon
he's
still
out
there
somewhere
but
lost
his
powers
too
weak
to
carry
on
cause
somethin
about
you
finished
him
Harry
there
was
somethin
goin
on
that
night
he
hadn't
counted
on
I
dunno
what
it
was
no
one
does
but
somethin
about
you
stumped
him
all
right
hagrid
looked
at
Harry
with
warmth
and
respect
blazing
in
his
eyes
but
Harry
instead
of
feeling
pleased
and
proud
felt
quite
sure
there
had
been
a
horrible
mistake
a
wizard
him
how
could
he
possibly
be
he'd
spent
his
life
being
clouted
by
Dudley
and
bullied
by
Aunt
Petunia
and
Uncle
Vernon
if
he
was
really
a
wizard
why
hadn't
they
been
turned
into
warty
toads
every
time
they'd
tried
to
lock
him
in
his
cupboard
if
he'd
once
defeated
the
greatest
sorcerer
in
the
world
how
come
Dudley
had
always
been
able
to
kick
him
around
like
a
football
hagrid
he
said
quietly
I
think
you
must
have
made
a
mistake
i
don't
think
I
can
be
a
wizard
to
his
surprise
Hagrid
chuckled
not
a
wizard
eh
never
made
things
happen
when
you
was
scared
or
angry
harry
looked
into
the
fire
now
he
came
to
think
about
it
every
odd
thing
that
had
ever
made
his
aunt
and
uncle
furious
with
him
had
happened
when
he
Harry
had
been
upset
or
angry
chased
by
dudley's
gang
he
had
somehow
found
himself
out
of
their
reach
dreading
going
to
school
with
that
ridiculous
haircut
he'd
managed
to
make
it
grow
back
and
the
very
last
time
Dudley
had
hit
him
hadn't
he
got
his
revenge
without
even
realizing
he
was
doing
it
hadn't
he
set
a
boa
constrictor
on
him
harry
looked
back
at
Hagrid
smiling
and
saw
that
Hagrid
was
positively
beaming
at
him
see
said
Hagrid
harry
Potter
not
a
wizard
you
wait
you'll
be
right
famous
at
Hogwarts
but
Uncle
Vernon
wasn't
going
to
give
in
without
a
fight
haven't
I
told
you
he's
not
going
he
hissed
he's
going
to
Stonewall
High
and
he'll
be
grateful
for
it
i've
read
those
letters
and
he
needs
all
sorts
of
rubbish
spell
books
and
wands
and
if
he
wants
ter
go
a
great
Muggle
like
you
won't
stop
him
growled
Hagrid
stop
Lily
an
James
Potter
s
son
goin
ter
Hogwarts
yer
mad
his
name's
been
down
ever
since
he
was
born
he's
off
ter
the
finest
school
of
witchcraft
and
wizardry
in
the
world
seven
years
there
and
he
won't
know
himself
he'll
be
with
youngsters
of
his
own
sort
fer
a
change
an
he'll
be
under
the
greatest
headmaster
Hogwarts
ever
had
Albus
Dumbled
i
am
not
paying
for
some
crackpot
old
fool
To
teach
him
magic
tricks
yelled
Uncle
Vernon
but
he
had
finally
gone
too
far
hagrid
seized
his
umbrella
and
whirled
it
over
his
head
never
he
thundered
insult
albus
dumbledorein
front
of
me
he
brought
the
umbrella
swishing
down
through
the
air
to
point
at
Dudley
there
was
a
flash
of
violet
light
a
sound
like
a
firecracker
a
sharp
squeal
and
the
next
second
Dudley
was
dancing
on
the
spot
with
his
hands
clasped
over
his
fat
bottom
howling
in
pain
when
he
turned
his
back
on
them
Harry
saw
a
curly
pig's
tail
poking
through
a
hole
in
his
trousers
uncle
Vernon
roared
pulling
Aunt
Petunia
and
Dudley
into
the
other
room
he
cast
one
last
terrified
look
at
Hagrid
and
slammed
the
door
behind
them
hagrid
looked
down
at
his
umbrella
and
stroked
his
beard
shouldn'ta
lost
me
temper
he
said
ruefully
but
it
didn't
work
anyway
meant
ter
turn
him
into
a
pig
but
I
suppose
he
was
so
much
like
a
pig
anyway
there
wasn't
much
left
ter
do
he
cast
a
sideways
look
at
Harry
under
his
bushy
eyebrows
be
grateful
if
yeh
didn't
mention
that
ter
anyone
at
Hogwarts
he
said
i'm
er
not
supposed
ter
do
magic
strictly
speakin

was
allowed

bit

o
the
reasons
I
was

Harry

Hagrid
loudly

ter

books
an
that
he
took
off
his
thick
black
coat
and
threw
it
to
Harry
you
can
kip
under
that
he
said
don
mind
if
it

a
bit
I
think
I

a
couple
o
dormice
in
one
o
the
pockets
chapter
five
diagon
alley
harry
woke
early
the
next
morning
although
he
could
tell
it
was
daylight
he
kept
his
eyes
shut
tight
it
was
a
dream
he
told
himself
firmly
i
dreamed
a
giant
called
Hagrid
came
to
tell
me
I
was
going
to
a
school
for
wizards
when
I
open
my
eyes
i'll
be
at
home
in
my
cupboard
there
was
suddenly
a
loud
tapping
noise
and
there's
Aunt
Petunia
knocking
on
the
door
Harry
thought
his
heart
sinking
but
he
still
didn't
open
his
eyes
it
had
been
such
a
good
dream
tap
tap
tap
all
right
Harry
mumbled
i'm
getting
up
he
sat
up
and
hagrid's
heavy
coat
fell
off
him
the
hut
was
full
of
sunlight
the
storm
was
over
Hagrid
himself
was
asleep
on
the
collapsed
sofa
and
there
was
an
owl
rapping
its
claw
on
the
window
a
newspaper
held
in
its
beak
harry
scrambled
to
his
feet
so
happy
he
felt
as
though
a
large
balloon
was
swelling
inside
him
he
went
straight
to
the
window
and
jerked
it
open
the
owl
swooped
in
and
dropped
the
newspaper
on
top
of
Hagrid
who
didn't
wake
up
the
owl
then
fluttered
onto
the
floor
and
began
to
attack
hagrid's
coat
don't
do
that
harry
tried
to
wave
the
owl
out
of
the
way
but
it
snapped
its
beak
fiercely
at
him
and
carried
on
savaging
the
coat
hagrid
said
Harry
loudly
there's
an
owl
Pay
him
Hagrid
grunted
into
the
sofa
what
he
wants
payin
fer
deliverin
the
paper
look
in
the
pockets
hagrid's
coat
seemed
to
be
made
of
nothing
but
pockets
bunches
of
keys
slug
pellets
balls
of
string
peppermint
humbugs
teabags
finally
Harry
pulled
out
a
handful
of
strange-looking
coins
give
him
five
Knuts
said
Hagrid
sleepily
knuts
the
little
bronze
ones
harry
counted
out
five
little
bronze
coins
and
the
owl
held
out
his
leg
so
Harry
could
put
the
money
into
a
small
leather
pouch
tied
to
it
then
he
flew
off
through
the
open
window
hagrid
yawned
loudly
sat
up
and
stretched
best
be
Off
Harry
lots
ter
do
today

get
up
ter
London
an
buy
all
yer
stuff
fer
school
harry
was
turning
over
the
wizard
coins
and
looking
at
them
he
had
just
thought
of
something
that
made
him
feel
as
though
the
happy
balloon
inside
him
had
got
a
puncture
um
Hagrid
mm
said
Hagrid
who
was
pulling
on
his
huge
boots
i
haven't
got
any
money
and
you
heard
Uncle
Vernon
last
night
he
won't
pay
for
me
to
go
and
learn
magic
don't
worry
about
that
said
Hagrid
standing
up
and
scratching
his
head
d'yeh
think
yer
parents
didn't
leave
yeh
anything
but
if
their
house
was
destroyed
they
didn
keep
their
gold
in
the
house
boy
nah
first
stop
fer

is
Gringotts

a
sausage
they're
not
bad
cold
an
I
wouldn
say
no
teh
a
bit
o
yer
birthday
cake
neither
wizards
have
banks
just
the
one
gringotts
run
by
goblins
harry
dropped
the
bit
of
sausage
he
was
holding
goblins
yeah
so
yeh'd
be
mad
ter
try
an
rob
it
i'll
tell
yeh
that
never
mess
with
goblins
Harry
gringotts
is
the
safest
place
in
the
world
fer
anything
yeh
want
ter
keep
safe
cept
maybe
Hogwarts
as
a
matter
o
fact
I
gotta
visit
Gringotts
anyway
fer
Dumbledore
hogwarts
business
hagrid
drew
himself
up
proudly
he
usually
gets
me
ter
do
important
stuff
fer
him
fetchin
you
gettin
things
from
Gringotts
knows
he
can
trust
me
see
got
everythin
come
on
then
harry
followed
Hagrid
out
onto
the
rock
the
sky
was
quite
clear
now
and
the
sea
gleamed
in
the
sunlight
the
boat
Uncle
Vernon
had
hired
was
still
there
with
a
lot
of
water
in
the
bottom
after
the
storm
how
did
you
get
here
harry
asked
looking
around
for
another
boat
flew
said
Hagrid
flew
yeah
but
we'll
go
back
in
this
not
s'pposed
ter
use
magic
now
i've
got
yeh
they
settled
down
in
the
boat
Harry
still
staring
at
Hagrid
trying
to
imagine
him
flying
seems
a
shame
ter
row
though
said
Hagrid
giving
Harry
another
of
his
sideways
looks
if
I
was
ter
er
speed
things
up
a
bit
would
yeh
mind
not
mentionin
it
at
Hogwarts
of
course
not
said
Harry
eager
to
see
more
magic
hagrid
pulled
out
the
pink
umbrella
again
tapped
it
twice
on
the
side
of
the
boat
and
they
sped
off
toward
land
why
would
you
be
mad
to
try
and
rob
Gringotts
harry
asked
spells
enchantments
said
Hagrid
unfolding
his
newspaper
as
he
spoke
they
say
there's
dragons
guardin
the
highsecurity
vaults
and
then
yeh
gotta
find
yer
way
Gringotts
is
hundreds
of
miles
under
London
see
deep
under
the
Underground
yeh'd
die
of
hunger
tryin
ter
get
out
even
if
yeh
did
manage
ter
get
yer
hands
on
summat
harry
sat
and
thought
about
this
while
Hagrid
read
his
newspaper
the
Daily
Prophet
harry
had
learned
from
Uncle
Vernon
that
people
liked
to
be
left
alone
while
they
did
this
but
it
was
very
difficult
he'd
never
had
so
many
questions
in
his
life
ministry
o
Magic
messin
things
up
as
usual
Hagrid
muttered
turning
the
page
there's
a
Ministry
of
Magic
harry
asked
before
he
could
stop
himself
course
said
Hagrid
they
wanted
Dumbledore
fer
Minister
course
but
he'd
never
leave
Hogwarts
so
old
Cornelius
Fudge
got
the
job
bungler
if
ever
there
was
one
so
he
pelts
Dumbledore
with
owls
every
morning
askin
fer
advice
but
what
does
a
Ministry
of
Magic
do
well
their
main
job
is
to
keep
it
from
the
Muggles
that
there's
still
witches
an
wizards
up
an
down
the
country
why
why
blimey
Harry
everyone'd
be
wantin
magic
solutions
to
their
problems
nah
we're
best
left
alone
at
this
moment
the
boat
bumped
gently
into
the
harbor
wall
hagrid
folded
up
his
newspaper
and
they
clambered
up
the
stone
steps
onto
the
street
passersby
stared
a
lot
at
Hagrid
as
they
walked
through
the
little
town
to
the
station
harry
couldn't
blame
them
not
only
was
Hagrid
twice
as
tall
as
anyone
else
he
kept
pointing
at
perfectly
ordinary
things
like
parking
meters
and
saying
loudly
See
that
Harry
things
these
Muggles
dream
up
eh
hagrid
said
Harry
panting
a
bit
as
he
ran
to
keep
up
did
you
say
there
are
dragons
at
Gringotts
well
so
they
say
said
Hagrid
crikey
i'd
like
a
dragon
you'd
like
one
wanted
one
ever
since
I
was
a
kid
here
we
go
they
had
reached
the
station
there
was
a
train
to
London
in
five
minutes
time
hagrid
who
didn't
understand
Muggle
money
as
he
called
it
gave
the
bills
to
Harry
so
he
could
buy
their
tickets
people
stared
more
than
ever
on
the
train
hagrid
took
up
two
seats
and
sat
knitting
what
looked
like
a
canary-yellow
circus
tent
still
got
yer
letter
Harry
he
asked
as
he
counted
stitches
harry
took
the
parchment
envelope

Can
we
buy
all
this
in
London
harry
wondered
aloud
if
yeh
know
where
to
go
said
Hagrid
harry
had
never
been
to
London
before
although
Hagrid
seemed
to
know
where
he
was
going
he
was
obviously
not
used
to
getting
there
in
an
ordinary
way
he
got
stuck
in
the
ticket
barrier
on
the
Underground
and
complained
loudly
that
the
seats
were
too
small
and
the
trains
too
slow
i
don't
know
how
the
Muggles
manage
without
magic
he
said
as
they
climbed
a
broken-down
escalator
that
led
up
to
a
bustling
road
lined
with
shops
hagrid
was
so
huge
that
he
parted
the
crowd
easily
all
Harry
had
to
do
was
keep
close
behind
him
they
passed
book
shops
and
music
stores
hamburger
restaurants
and
cinemas
but
nowhere
that
looked
as
if
it
could
sell
you
a
magic
wand
this
was
just
an
ordinary
street
full
of
ordinary
people
could
there
really
be
piles
of
wizard
gold
buried
miles
beneath
them
were
there
really
shops
that
sold
spell
books
and
broomsticks
might
this
not
all
be
some
huge
joke
that
the
Dursleys
had
cooked
up
if
Harry
hadn't
known
that
the
Dursleys
had
no
sense
of
humor
he
might
have
thought
so
yet
somehow
even
though
everything
Hagrid
had
told
him
so
far
was
unbelievable
Harry
couldn't
help
trusting
him
this
is
it
said
Hagrid
coming
to
a
halt
the
Leaky
Cauldron
it's
a
famous
place
it
was
a
tiny
grubby-looking
pub
if
Hagrid
hadn't
pointed
it
out
Harry
wouldn't
have
noticed
it
was
there
the
people
hurrying
by
didn't
glance
at
it
their
eyes
slid
from
the
big
book
shop
on
one
side
to
the
record
shop
on
the
other
as
if
they
couldn't
see
the
Leaky
Cauldron
at
all
in
fact
Harry
had
the
most
peculiar
feeling
that
only
he
and
Hagrid
could
see
it
before
he
could
mention
this
Hagrid
had
steered
him
inside
for
a
famous
place
it
was
very
dark
and
shabby
a
few
old
women
were
sitting
in
a
corner
drinking
tiny
glasses
of
sherry
one
of
them
was
smoking
a
long
pipe
a
little
man
in
a
top
hat
was
talking
to
the
old
bartender
who
was
quite
bald
and
looked
like
a
toothless
walnut
the
low
buzz
of
chatter
stopped
when
they
walked
in
everyone
seemed
to
know
Hagrid
they
waved
and
smiled
at
him
and
the
bartender
reached
for
a
glass
saying
The
usual
Hagrid
can't
Tom
i'm
on
Hogwarts
business
said
Hagrid
clapping
his
great
hand
on
harry's
shoulder
and
making
harry's
knees
buckle
good
Lord
said
the
bartender
peering
at
Harry
is
this
can
this
be
the
Leaky
Cauldron
had
suddenly
gone
completely
still
and
silent
bless
my
soul
whispered
the
old
bartender
Harry
Potter
what
an
honor
he
hurried
out
from
behind
the
bar
rushed
toward
Harry
and
seized
his
hand
tears
in
his
eyes
welcome
back
mr.
Potter
welcome
back
harry
didn't
know
what
to
say
everyone
was
looking
at
him
the
old
woman
with
the
pipe
was
puffing
on
it
without
realizing
it
had
gone
out
hagrid
was
beaming
then
there
was
a
great
scraping
of
chairs
and
the
next
moment
Harry
found
himself
shaking
hands
with
everyone
in
the
Leaky
Cauldron
doris
Crockford
mr.
Potter
can't
believe
i'm
meeting
you
at
last
so
proud
mr.
Potter
i'm
just
so
proud
always
wanted
to
shake
your
hand
i'm
all
of
a
flutter
delighted
mr.
Potter
just
can't
tell
you
diggle's
the
name
Dedalus
Diggle
i've
seen
you
before
said
Harry
as
Dedalus
diggle's
top
hat
fell
off
in
his
excitement
you
bowed
to
me
once
in
a
shop
he
remembers
cried
Dedalus
Diggle
looking
around
at
everyone
did
you
hear
that
he
remembers
me
harry
shook
hands
again
and
again
Doris
Crockford
kept
coming
back
for
more
a
pale
young
man
made
his
way
forward
very
nervously
one
of
his
eyes
was
twitching
professor
Quirrell
said
Hagrid
harry
Professor
Quirrell
will
be
one
of
your
teachers
at
Hogwarts
p-P-Potter
stammered
Professor
Quirrell
grasping
harry's
hand
c-can't
t-tell
you
how
p
pleased
I
am
to
meet
you
what
sort
of
magic
do
you
teach
Professor
Quirrell
d-Defense
Against
the
D-D-Dark
Arts
muttered
Professor
Quirrell
as
though
he'd
rather
not
think
about
it
n-not
that
you
n-need
it
eh
P-P-Potter
he
laughed
nervously
you'll
be
g-getting
all
your
equipment
I
suppose
i've
g-got
to
p-pick
up
a
new
b-book
on
vampires
m-myself
he
looked
terrified
at
the
very
thought
but
the
others
wouldn't
let
Professor
Quirrell
keep
Harry
to
himself
it
took
almost
ten
minutes
to
get
away
from
them
all
at
last
Hagrid
managed
to
make
himself
heard
over
the
babble
must
get
on
lots
ter
buy
come
on
Harry
doris
Crockford
shook
harry's
hand
one
last
time
and
Hagrid
led
them
through
the
bar
and
out
into
a
small
walled
courtyard
where
there
was
nothing
but
a
trash
can
and
a
few
weeds
hagrid
grinned
at
Harry
told
yeh
didn't
I
told
yeh
you
was
famous
even
Professor
Quirrell
was
tremblin
ter
meet
yeh
mind
you
he's

tremblin
is
he
always
that
nervous
oh
yeah
poor
bloke
brilliant
mind
he
was
fine
while
he
was
studyin
outta
books
but
then
he
took
a
year
off
ter
get
some
firsthand
experience
they
say
he
met
vampires
in
the
Black
Forest
and
there
was
a
nasty
bit
o
trouble
with
a
hag
never
been
the
same
since
scared
of
the
students
scared
of
his
own
subject
now
where's
me
umbrella
vampires
hags
harry's
head
was
swimming
hagrid
meanwhile
was
counting
bricks
in
the
wall
above
the
trash
can
three
up
two
across
he
muttered
right
stand
back
Harry
he
tapped
the
wall
three
times
with
the
point
of
his
umbrella
the
brick
he
had
touched
quivered
it
wriggled
in
the
middle
a
small
hole
appeared
it
grew
wider
and
wider
a
second
later
they
were
facing
an
archway
large
enough
even
for
Hagrid
an
archway
onto
a
cobbled
street
that
twisted
and
turned
out
of
sight
welcome
said
Hagrid
to
Diagon
Alley
he
grinned
at
harry's
amazement
they
stepped
through
the
archway
harry
looked
quickly
over
his
shoulder
and
saw
the
archway
shrink
instantly
back
into
solid
wall
the
sun
shone
brightly
on
a
stack
of
cauldrons
outside
the
nearest
shop
cauldrons
All
Sizes
Copper
Brass
Pewter
Silver
Self-Stirring
Collapsible
said
a
sign
hanging
over
them
yeah
you'll
be
needin
one
said
Hagrid
but
we
gotta
get
yer
money
first
harry
wished
he
had
about
eight
more
eyes
he
turned
his
head
in
every
direction
as
they
walked
up
the
street
trying
to
look
at
everything
at
once
the
shops
the
things
outside
them
the
people
doing
their
shopping
a
plump
woman
outside
an
Apothecary
was
shaking
her
head
as
they
passed
saying
Dragon
liver
seventeen
Sickles
an
ounce
they're
mad
a
low
soft
hooting
came
from
a
dark
shop
with
a
sign
saying
Eeylops
Owl
Emporium
Tawny
Screech
Barn
Brown
and
Snowy
several
boys
of
about
harry's
age
had
their
noses
pressed
against
a
window
with
broomsticks
in
it
look
Harry
heard
one
of
them
say
the
new
Nimbus
Two
Thousand
fastest
ever
There
were
shops
selling
robes
shops
selling
telescopes
and
strange
silver
instruments
Harry
had
never
seen
before
windows
stacked
with
barrels
of
bat
spleens
and
eels
eyes
tottering
piles
of
spell
books
quills
and
rolls
of
parchment
potion
bottles
globes
of
the
moon
gringotts
said
Hagrid
they
had
reached
a
snowy
white
building
that
towered
over
the
other
little
shops
standing
beside
its
burnished
bronze
doors
wearing
a
uniform
of
scarlet
and
gold
was
Yeah
that's
a
goblin
said
Hagrid
quietly
as
they
walked
up
the
white
stone
steps
toward
him
the
goblin
was
about
a
head
shorter
than
Harry
he
had
a
swarthy
clever
face
a
pointed
beard
and
Harry
noticed
very
long
fingers
and
feet
he
bowed
as
they
walked
inside
now
they
were
facing
a
second
pair
of
doors
silver
this
time
with
words
engraved
upon
them
Enter
stranger
but
take
heed
Of
what
awaits
the
sin
of
greed
For
those
who

Must

dearly
in

turn
so
if
you
seek
beneath
our
floors
A
treasure
that
was

Thief

been
warned
beware
Of
finding
more
than
treasure

like
I
said
yeh'd
be
mad
ter
try

rob
it
said
Hagrid
a
pair
of
goblins
bowed
them
through
the
silver
doors
and
they
were
in
a
vast
marble
hall
about
a
hundred
more
goblins
were
sitting
on
high
stools
behind
a
long
counter
scribbling
in
large
ledgers
weighing
coins
in
brass
scales
examining
precious
stones
through
eyeglasses
there
were
too
many
doors
to
count
leading
off
the
hall
and
yet
more
goblins
were
showing
people
in
and
out
of
these
hagrid
and
Harry
made
for
the
counter
morning
said
Hagrid
to
a
free
goblin
we've
come
ter
take
some
money
outta
mr.
Harry
potter's
safe
you
have
his
key
Sir
got
it
here
somewhere
said
Hagrid
and
he
started
emptying
his
pockets
onto
the
counter
scattering
a
handful
of
moldy
dog
biscuits
over
the
goblin's
book
of
numbers
the
goblin
wrinkled
his
nose
harry
watched
the
goblin
on
their
right
weighing
a
pile
of
rubies
as
big
as
glowing
coals
got
it
said
Hagrid
at
last
holding
up
a
tiny
golden
key
the
goblin
looked
at
it
closely
that
seems
to
be
in
order
an
i've
also
got
a
letter
here
from
Professor
Dumbledore
said
Hagrid
importantly
throwing
out
his
chest
it's
about
the
YouKnow-What
in
vault
seven
hundred
and
thirteen
the
goblin
read
the
letter
carefully
very
well
he
said
handing
it
back
to
Hagrid
I
will
have
Someone
take
you
down
to
both
vaults
griphook
griphook
was
yet
another
goblin
once
Hagrid
had
crammed
all
the
dog
biscuits
back
inside
his
pockets
he
and
Harry
followed
Griphook
toward
one
of
the
doors
leading
off
the
hall
what's
the
You-Know-What
in
vault
seven
hundred
and
thirteen
harry
asked
can't
tell
yeh
that
said
Hagrid
mysteriously
very
secret
hogwarts
business
dumbledore's
trusted
me
more'n
my
job's
worth
ter
tell
yeh
that
griphook
held
the
door
open
for
them
harry
who
had
expected
more
marble
was
surprised
they
were
in
a
narrow
stone
passageway
lit
with
flaming
torches
it
sloped
steeply
downward
and
there
were
little
railway
tracks
on
the
floor
griphook
whistled
and
a
small
cart
came
hurtling
up
the
tracks
toward
them
they
climbed
in
Hagrid
with
some
difficulty
and
were
off
at
first
they
just
hurtled
through
a
maze
of
twisting
passages
harry
tried
to
remember
left
right
right
left
middle
fork
right
left
but
it
was
impossible
the
rattling
cart
seemed
to
know
its
own
way
because
Griphook
wasn't
steering
harry's
eyes
stung
as
the
cold
air
rushed
past
them
but
he
kept
them
wide
open
once
he
thought
he
saw
a
burst
of
fire
at
the
end
of
a
passage
and
twisted
around
to
see
if
it
was
a
dragon
but
too
late
they
plunged
even
deeper
passing
an
underground
lake
where
huge
stalactites
and
stalagmites
grew
from
the
ceiling
and
floor
i
never
know
Harry
called
to
Hagrid
over
the
noise
of
the
cart
what's
the
difference
between
a
stalagmite
and
a
stalactite
stalagmite's
got
an
m
in
it
said
Hagrid
an
don
ask
me
questions
just
now
I
think
i'm
gonna
be
sick
he
did
look
very
green
and
when
the
cart
stopped
at
last
beside
a
small
door
in
the
passage
wall
Hagrid
got
out
and
had
to
lean
against
the
wall
to
stop
his
knees
from
trembling
griphook
unlocked
the
door
a
lot
of
green
smoke
came
billowing
out
and
as
it
cleared
Harry
gasped
inside
were
mounds
of
gold
coins
columns
of
silver
heaps
of
little
bronze
Knuts
all
yours
smiled
Hagrid
all
harry's
it
was
incredible
the
Dursleys
couldn't
have
known
about
this
or
they'd
have
had
it
from
him
faster
than
blinking
how
often
had
they
complained
how
much
Harry
cost
them
to
keep
and
all
the
time
there
had
been
a
small
fortune
belonging
to
him
buried
deep
under
London
hagrid
helped
Harry
pile
some
of
it
into
a
bag
the
gold
ones
are
Galleons
he
explained
seventeen
silver
Sickles
to
a
Galleon
and
twenty-nine
Knuts
to
a
Sickle
it's
easy
enough
right
that
should
be
enough
fer
a
couple
o
terms
we'll
keep
the
rest
safe
for
yeh
he
turned
to
Griphook
vault
seven
hundred
and
thirteen
now
please
and
can
we
go
more
slowly
one
speed
only
said
Griphook
they
were
going
even
deeper
now
and
gathering
speed
the
air
became
colder
and
colder
as
they
hurtled
round
tight
corners
they
went
rattling
over
an
underground
ravine
and
Harry
leaned
over
the
side
to
try
to
see
what
was
down
at
the
dark
bottom
but
Hagrid
groaned
and
pulled
him
back
by
the
scruff
of
his
neck
vault
seven
hundred
and
thirteen
had
no
keyhole
stand
back
said
Griphook
importantly
he
stroked
the
door
gently
with
one
of
his
long
fingers
and
it
simply
melted
away
if
anyone
but
a
Gringotts
goblin
tried
that
they'd
be
sucked
through
the
door
and
trapped
in
there
said
Griphook
how
often
do
you
check
to
see
if
anyone's
inside
harry
asked
about
once
every
ten
years
said
Griphook
with
a
rather
nasty
grin
something
really
extraordinary
had
to
be
inside
this
top
security
vault
Harry
was
sure
and
he
leaned
forward
eagerly
expecting
to
see
fabulous
jewels
at
the
very
least
but
at
first
he
thought
it
was
empty
then
he
noticed
a
grubby
little
package
wrapped
up
in
brown
paper
lying
on
the
floor
hagrid
picked
it
up
and
tucked
it
deep
inside
his
coat
harry
longed
to
know
what
it
was
but
knew
better
than
to
ask
come
on
back
in
this
infernal
cart
and
don't
talk
to
me
on
the
way
back
it's
best
if
I
keep
me
mouth
shut
said
Hagrid
one
wild
cart
ride
later
they
stood
blinking
in
the
sunlight
outside
Gringotts
harry
didn't
know
where
to
run
first
now
that
he
had
a
bag
full
of
money
he
didn't
have
to
know
how
many
Galleons
there
were
to
a
pound
to
know
that
he
was
holding
more
money
than
he'd
had
in
his
whole
life
more
money
than
even
Dudley
had
ever
had
might
as
well
get
yer
uniform
said
Hagrid
nodding
toward
Madam
malkin's
Robes
for
All
Occasions
listen
Harry
would
yeh
mind
if
I
slipped
off
fer
a
pick-me-up
in
the
Leaky
Cauldron
i
hate
them
Gringotts
carts
he
did
still
look
a
bit
sick
so
Harry
entered
Madam
malkin's
shop
alone
feeling
nervous
madam
Malkin
was
a
squat
smiling
witch
dressed
all
in
mauve
hogwarts
clear
she
said
when
Harry
started
to
speak
got
the
lot
here
another
young
man
being
fitted
up
just
now
in
fact
in
the
back
of
the
shop
a
boy
with
a
pale
pointed
face
was
standing
on
a
footstool
while
a
second
witch
pinned
up
his
long
black
robes
madam
Malkin
stood
Harry
on
a
stool
next
to
him
slipped
a
long
robe
over
his
head
and
began
to
pin
it
to
the
right
length
hello
said
the
boy
Hogwarts
too
yes
said
Harry
my
father's
next
door
buying
my
books
and
mother's
up
the
street
looking
at
wands
said
the
boy
he
had
a
bored
drawling
voice
then
i'm
going
to
drag
them
off
to
took
at
racing
brooms
i
don't
see
why
first
years
can't
have
their
own
i
think
i'll
bully
father
into
getting
me
one
and
i'll
smuggle
it
in
somehow
harry
was
strongly
reminded
of
Dudley
have
you
got
your
own
broom
the
boy
went
on
no
said
Harry
play
Quidditch
at
all
no
Harry
said
again
wondering
what
on
earth
Quidditch
could
be
i
do
Father
says
it's
a
crime
if
i'm
not
picked
to
play
for
my
house
and
I
must
say
I
agree
know
what
house
you'll
be
in
yet
no
said
Harry
feeling
more
stupid
by
the
minute
well
no
one
really
knows
until
they
get
there
do
they
but
I
know
i'll
be
in
Slytherin
all
our
family
have
been
imagine
being
in
Hufflepuff
I
think
i'd
leave
wouldn't
you
mmm
said
Harry
wishing
he
could
say
something
a
bit
more
interesting
i
say
look
at
that
man
said
the
boy
suddenly
nodding
toward
the
front
window
hagrid
was
standing
there
grinning
at
Harry
and
pointing
at
two
large
ice
creams
to
show
he
couldn't
come
in
that's
Hagrid
said
Harry
pleased
to
know
something
the
boy
didn't
he
works
at
Hogwarts
oh
said
the
boy
i've
heard
of
him
he's
a
sort
of
servant
isn't
he
he's
the
gamekeeper
said
Harry
he
was
liking
the
boy
less
and
less
every
second
yes
exactly
i
heard
he's
a
sort
of
savage
lives
in
a
hut
on
the
school
grounds
and
every
now
and
then
he
gets
drunk
tries
to
do
magic
and
ends
up
setting
fire
to
his
bed
i
think
he's
brilliant
said
Harry
coldly
do
you
said
the
boy
with
a
slight
sneer
why
is
he
with
you
where
are
your
parents
they're
dead
said
Harry
shortly
he
didn't
feel
much
like
going
into
the
matter
with
this
boy
oh
sorry
said
the
other
not
sounding
sorry
at
all
but
they
were
our
kind
weren't
they
they
were
a
witch
and
wizard
if
that's
what
you
mean
i
really
don't
think
they
should
let
the
other
sort
in
do
you
they're
just
not
the
same
they've
never
been
brought
up
to
know
our
ways
some
of
them
have
never
even
heard
of
Hogwarts
until
they
get
the
letter
imagine
i
think
they
should
keep
it
in
the
old
wizarding
families
what's
your
surname
anyway
but
before
Harry
could
answer
Madam
Malkin
said
that's
you
done
my
dear
and
Harry
not
sorry
for
an
excuse
to
stop
talking
to
the
boy
hopped
down
from
the
footstool
well
i'll
see
you
at
Hogwarts
I
suppose
said
the
drawling
boy
harry
was
rather
quiet
as
he
ate
the
ice
cream
Hagrid
had
bought
him
chocolate
and
raspberry
with
chopped
nuts
what's
up
said
Hagrid
nothing
Harry
lied
they
stopped
to
buy
parchment
and
quills
harry
cheered
up
a
bit
when
he
found
a
bottle
of
ink
that
changed
color
as
you
wrote
when
they
had
left
the
shop
he
said
Hagrid
what's
Quidditch
blimey
Harry
I
keep
forgettin
how
little
yeh
know
not
knowin
about
Quidditch
don't
make
me
feel
worse
said
Harry
he
told
Hagrid
about
the
pate
boy
in
Madam
malkin's
and
he
said
people
from
Muggle
families
shouldn't
even
be
allowed
in
yer
not
from
a
Muggle
family
if
he'd
known
who
yeh
were
he's
grown
up
knowin
yer
name
if
his
parents
are
wizardin
folk
you
saw
what
everyone
in
the
Leaky
Cauldron
was
like
when
they
saw
yeh
anyway
what
does
he
know
about
it
some
o
the
best
I
ever
saw
were
the
only
ones
with
magic
in
em
in
a
long
line
Muggles
look
at
yer
mum
look
what
she
had
fer
a
sister
so
what
is
Quidditch
it's
our
sport
wizard
sport
it's
like
like
soccer
in
the
Muggle
world
everyone
follows
Quidditch
played
up
in
the
air
on
broomsticks
and
there's
four
balls
sorta
hard
ter
explain
the
rules
and
what
are
Slytherin
and
Hufflepuff
school
houses
there's
four
everyone
says
Hufflepuff
are
a
lot
o
duffers
but
i
bet
i'm
in
Hufflepuff
said
Harry
gloomily
better
Hufflepuff
than
Slytherin
said
Hagrid
darkly
there's
not
a
single
witch
or
wizard
who
went
bad
who
wasn't
in
Slytherin
you-Know-Who
was
one
vol
sorry
You-Know-Who
was
at
Hogwarts
years
an
years
ago
said
Hagrid
they
bought
harry's
school
books
in
a
shop
called
Flourish
and
Blotts
where
the
shelves
were
stacked
to
the
ceiling
with
books
as
large
as
paving
stones
bound
in
leather
books
the
size
of
postage
stamps
in
covers
of
silk
books
full
of
peculiar
symbols
and
a
few
books
with
nothing
in
them
at
all
even
Dudley
who
never
read
anything
would
have
been
wild
to
get
his
hands
on
some
of
these
hagrid
almost
had
to
drag
Harry
away
from
Curses
and
Countercurses
Bewitch
Your
Friends
and
Befuddle
Your
Enemies
with
the
Latest
Revenges
Hair
Loss
Jelly-Legs
Tongue
Tying
and
Much
Much
More
by
Professor
Vindictus
Viridian
i
was
trying
to
find
out
how
to
curse
Dudley
i'm
not
sayin
that's
not
a
good
idea
but
yer
not
ter
use
magic
in
the
Muggle
world
except
in
very
special
circumstances
said
Hagrid
an
anyway
yeh
couldn
work
any
of
them
curses
yet
yeh'll
need
a
lot
more
study
before
yeh
get
ter
that
level
hagrid
wouldn't
let
Harry
buy
a
solid
gold
cauldron
either
It
says
pewter
on
yer
list
but
they
got
a
nice
set
of
scales
for
weighing
potion
ingredients
and
a
collapsible
brass
telescope
then
they
visited
the
Apothecary
which
was
fascinating
enough
to
make
up
for
its
horrible
smell
a
mixture
of
bad
eggs
and
rotted
cabbages
barrels
of
slimy
stuff
stood
on
the
floor
jars
of
herbs
dried
roots
and
bright
powders
lined
the
walls
bundles
of
feathers
strings
of
fangs
and
snarled
claws
hung
from
the
ceiling
while
Hagrid
asked
the
man
behind
the
counter
for
a
supply
of
some
basic
potion
ingredients
for
Harry
Harry
himself
examined
silver
unicorn
horns
at
twenty-one
Galleons
each
and
minuscule
glittery-black
beetle
eyes
five
Knuts
a
scoop
outside
the
Apothecary
Hagrid
checked
harry's
list
again
just
yer
wand
left
A
yeah
an
I
still
haven't
got
yeh
a
birthday
present
harry
felt
himself
go
red
you
don't
have
to
i
know
I
don't
have
to
tell
yeh
what
i'll
get
yer

I

get
yer
an
owl
all
the
kids

dead
useful
carry
yer
mail
an
everythin
twenty
minutes
later
they
left
Eeylops
Owl
Emporium
which
had
been
dark
and
full
of
rustling
and
flickering
jewel-bright
eyes
harry
now
carried
a
large
cage
that
held
a
beautiful
snowy
owl
fast
asleep
with
her
head
under
her
wing
he
couldn't
stop
stammering
his
thanks
sounding
just
like
Professor
Quirrell
don
mention
it
said
Hagrid
gruffly
don
expect
you've
had
a
lotta
presents
from
them
Dursleys
just
Ollivanders
left
now
only
place
fer
wands
Ollivanders
and
yeh
gotta
have
the
best
wand
a
magic
wand
this
was
what
Harry
had
been
really
looking
forward
to
the
last
shop
was
narrow
and
shabby
peeling
gold
letters
over
the
door
read
Ollivanders
Makers
of
Fine
Wands
since
B
c.
A
single
wand
lay
on
a
faded
purple
cushion
in
the
dusty
window
a
tinkling
bell
rang
somewhere
in
the
depths
of
the
shop
as
they
stepped
inside
it
was
a
tiny
place
empty
except
for
a
single
spindly
chair
that
Hagrid
sat
on
to
wait
harry
felt
strangely
as
though
he
had
entered
a
very
strict
library
he
swallowed
a
lot
of
new
questions
that
had
just
occurred
to
him
and
looked
instead
at
the
thousands
of
narrow
boxes
piled
neatly
right
up
to
the
ceiling
for
some
reason
the
back
of
his
neck
prickled
the
very
dust
and
silence
in
here
seemed
to
tingle
with
some
secret
magic
good
afternoon
said
a
soft
voice
harry
jumped
hagrid
must
have
jumped
too
because
there
was
a
loud
crunching
noise
and
he
got
quickly
off
the
spindly
chair
an
old
man
was
standing
before
them
his
wide
pale
eyes
shining
like
moons
through
the
gloom
of
the
shop
hello
said
Harry
awkwardly
ah
yes
said
the
man
yes
yes
i
thought
i'd
be
seeing
you
soon
harry
Potter
it
wasn't
a
question
you
have
your
mother's
eyes
it
seems
only
yesterday
she
was
in
here
herself
buying
her
first
wand
ten
and
a
quarter
inches
long
swishy
made
of
willow
nice
wand
for
charm
work
mr.
Ollivander
moved
closer
to
Harry
harry
wished
he
would
blink
those
silvery
eyes
were
a
bit
creepy
your
father
on
the
other
hand
favored
a
mahogany
wand
eleven
inches
pliable
a
little
more
power
and
excellent
for
transfiguration
well
I
say
your
father
favored
it
it's
really
the
wand
that
chooses
the
wizard
of
course
mr.
Ollivander
had
come
so
close
that
he
and
Harry
were
almost
nose
to
nose
harry
could
see
himself
reflected
in
those
misty
eyes
and
that's
where
mr.
Ollivander
touched
the
lightning
scar
on
harry's
forehead
with
a
long
white
finger
i'm
sorry
to
say
I
sold
the
wand
that
did
it
he
said
softly
thirteen-and-a-half
inches
yew
powerful
wand
very
powerful
and
in
the
wrong
hands
well
if
i'd
known
what
that
wand
was
going
out
into
the
world
to
do
he
shook
his
head
and
then
to
harry's
relief
spotted
Hagrid
rubeus
rubeus
Hagrid
how
nice
to
see
you
again
oak
sixteen
inches
rather
bendy
wasn't
it
it
was
sir
yes
said
Hagrid
good
wand
that
one
but
I
suppose
they
snapped
it
in
half
when
you
got
expelled
said
mr.
Ollivander
suddenly
stern
er
yes
they
did
yes
said
Hagrid
shuffling
his
feet
i've
still
got
the
pieces
though
he
added
brightly
but
you
don't
use
them
said
mr.
Ollivander
sharply
oh
no
sit
said
Hagrid
quickly
harry
noticed
he
gripped
his
pink
umbrella
very
tightly
as
he
spoke
hmmm
said
mr.
Ollivander
giving
Hagrid
a
piercing
look
well
now
mr.
Potter
let
me
see
he
pulled
a
long
tape
measure
with
silver
markings
out
of
his
pocket
which
is
your
wand
arm
er
well
i'm
right-handed
said
Harry
hold
out
your
arm
that's
it
he
measured
Harry
from
shoulder
to
finger
then
wrist
to
elbow
shoulder
to
floor
knee
to
armpit
and
round
his
head
as
he
measured
he
said
Every
Ollivander
wand
has
a
core
of
a
powerful
magical
substance
mr.
Potter
we
use
unicorn
hairs
phoenix
tail
feathers
and
the
heartstrings
of
dragons
no
two
Ollivander
wands
are
the
same
just
as
no
two
unicorns
dragons
or
phoenixes
are
quite
the
same
and
of
course
you
will
never
get
such
good
results
with
another
wizard's
wand
harry
suddenly
realized
that
the
tape
measure
which
was
measuring
between
his
nostrils
was
doing
this
on
its
own
mr.
Ollivander
was
flitting
around
the
shelves
taking
down
boxes
that
will
do
he
said
and
the
tape
measure
crumpled
into
a
heap
on
the
floor
right
then
mr.
Potter
try
this
one
beechwood
and
dragon
heartstring
nine
inches
nice
and
flexible
just
take
it
and
give
it
a
wave
harry
took
the
wand
and
feeling
foolish
waved
it
around
a
bit
but
mr.
Ollivander
snatched
it
out
of
his
hand
almost
at
once
maple
and
phoenix
feather
seven
inches
quite
whippy
try
harry
tried
but
he
had
hardly
raised
the
wand
when
it
too
was
snatched
back
by
mr.
Ollivander
no
no
here
ebony
and
unicorn
hair
eight
and
a
half
inches
springy
go
on
go
on
try
it
out
harry
tried
and
tried
he
had
no
idea
what
mr.
Ollivander
was
waiting
for
the
pile
of
tried
wands
was
mounting
higher
and
higher
on
the
spindly
chair
but
the
more
wands
mr.
Ollivander
pulled
from
the
shelves
the
happier
he
seemed
to
become
tricky
customer
eh
not
to
worry
we'll
find
the
perfect
match
here
somewhere
I
wonder
now
yes
why
not
unusual
combination
holly
and
phoenix
feather
eleven
inches
nice
and
supple
harry
took
the
wand
he
felt
a
sudden
warmth
in
his
fingers
he
raised
the
wand
above
his
head
brought
it
swishing
down
through
the
dusty
air
and
a
stream
of
red
and
gold
sparks
shot
from
the
end
like
a
firework
throwing
dancing
spots
of
light
on
to
the
walls
hagrid
whooped
and
clapped
and
mr.
Ollivander
cried
Oh
bravo
yes
indeed
oh
very
good
well
well
well
how
curious
how
very
curious
he
put
harry's
wand
back
into
its
box
and
wrapped
it
in
brown
paper
still
muttering
Curious
curious
sorry
said
Harry
but
what's
curious
mr.
Ollivander
fixed
Harry
with
his
pale
stare
i
remember
every
wand
i've
ever
sold
mr.
Potter
every
single
wand
it
so
happens
that
the
phoenix
whose
tail
feather
is
in
your
wand
gave
another
feather
just
one
other
it
is
very
curious
indeed
that
you
should
be
destined
for
this
wand
when
its
brother
why
its
brother
gave
you
that
scar
harry
swallowed
yes
thirteen-and-a-half
inches
yew
curious
indeed
how
these
things
happen
the
wand
chooses
the
wizard
remember
i
think
we
must
expect
great
things
from
you
mr.
Potter
after
all
He
Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
did
great
things
terrible
yes
but
great
harry
shivered
he
wasn't
sure
he
liked
mr.
Ollivander
too
much
he
paid
seven
gold
Galleons
for
his
wand
and
mr.
Ollivander
bowed
them
from
his
shop
the
late
afternoon
sun
hung
low
in
the
sky
as
Harry
and
Hagrid
made
their
way
back
down
Diagon
Alley
back
through
the
wall
back
through
the
Leaky
Cauldron
now
empty
harry
didn't
speak
at
all
as
they
walked
down
the
road
he
didn't
even
notice
how
much
people
were
gawking
at
them
on
the
Underground
laden
as
they
were
with
all
their
funny-shaped
packages
with
the
snowy
owl
asleep
in
its
cage
on
harry's
lap
up
another
escalator
out
into
Paddington
station
Harry
only
realized
where
they
were
when
Hagrid
tapped
him
on
the
shoulder
got
time
fer
a
bite
to
eat
before
yer
train
leaves
he
said
he
bought
Harry
a
hamburger
and
they
sat
down
on
plastic
seats
to
eat
them
harry
kept
looking
around
everything
looked
so
strange
somehow
you
all
right
Harry
yer
very
quiet
said
Hagrid
harry
wasn't
sure
he
could
explain
he'd
just
had
the
best
birthday
of
his
life
and
yet
he
chewed
his
hamburger
trying
to
find
the
words
everyone
thinks
i'm
special
he
said
at
last
all
those
people
in
the
Leaky
Cauldron
Professor
Quirrell
mr.
Ollivander
but
I
don't
know
anything
about
magic
at
all
how
can
they
expect
great
things
i'm
famous
and
I
can't
even
remember
what
i'm
famous
for
i
don't
know
what
happened
when
Vol
sorry
I
mean
the
night
my
parents
died
hagrid
leaned
across
the
table
behind
the
wild
beard
and
eyebrows
he
wore
a
very
kind
smile
don
you
worry
Harry
you'll
learn
fast
enough
everyone
starts
at
the
beginning
at
Hogwarts
you'll
be
just
fine
just
be
yerself
i
know
it's
hard
yeh've
been
singled
out
an
that's
always
hard
but
yeh'll
have
a
great
time
at
Hogwarts
I
did
still
do
smatter
of
fact
hagrid
helped
Harry
on
to
the
train
that
would
take
him
back
to
the
Dursleys
then
handed
him
an
envelope
yer
ticket
fer
Hogwarts
he
said
first
o
September
king's
Cross
it's
all
on
yer
ticket
any
problems
with
the
Dursleys
send
me
a
letter
with
yer
owl
she'll
know
where
to
find
me
see
yeh
soon
Harry
the
train
pulled
out
of
the
station
harry
wanted
to
watch
Hagrid
until
he
was
out
of
sight
he
rose
in
his
seat
and
pressed
his
nose
against
the
window
but
he
blinked
and
Hagrid
had
gone
chapter
six
the
journey
from
platform
nine
and
three-quarters
harry's
last
month
with
the
Dursleys
wasn't
fun
true
Dudley
was
now
so
scared
of
Harry
he
wouldn't
stay
in
the
same
room
while
Aunt
Petunia
and
Uncle
Vernon
didn't
shut
Harry
in
his
cupboard
force
him
to
do
anything
or
shout
at
him
in
fact
they
didn't
speak
to
him
at
all
half
terrified
half
furious
they
acted
as
though
any
chair
with
Harry
in
it
were
empty
although
this
was
an
improvement
in
many
ways
it
did
become
a
bit
depressing
after
a
while
harry
kept
to
his
room
with
his
new
owl
for
company
he
had
decided
to
call
her
Hedwig
a
name
he
had
found
in
A
History
of
Magic
his
school
books
were
very
interesting
he
lay
on
his
bed
reading
late
into
the
night
Hedwig
swooping
in
and
out
of
the
open
window
as
she
pleased
it
was
lucky
that
Aunt
Petunia
didn't
come
in
to
vacuum
anymore
because
Hedwig
kept
bringing
back
dead
mice
every
night
before
he
went
to
sleep
Harry
ticked
off
another
day
on
the
piece
of
paper
he
had
pinned
to
the
wall
counting
down
to
September
the
first
on
the
last
day
of
August
he
thought
he'd
better
speak
to
his
aunt
and
uncle
about
getting
to
king's
Cross
station
the
next
day
so
he
went
down
to
the
living
room
where
they
were
watching
a
quiz
show
on
television
he
cleared
his
throat
to
let
them
know
he
was
there
and
Dudley
screamed
and
ran
from
the
room
er
Uncle
Vernon
uncle
Vernon
grunted
to
show
he
was
listening
er
I
need
to
be
at
king's
Cross
tomorrow
to
to
go
to
Hogwarts
uncle
Vernon
grunted
again
would
it
be
all
right
if
you
gave
me
a
lift
grunt
harry
supposed
that
meant
yes
thank
you
he
was
about
to
go
back
upstairs
when
Uncle
Vernon
actually
spoke
funny
way
to
get
to
a
wizards
school
the
train
magic
carpets
all
got
punctures
have
they
harry
didn't
say
anything
where
is
this
school
anyway
i
don't
know
said
Harry
realizing
this
for
the
first
time
he
pulled
the
ticket
Hagrid
had
given
him
out
of
his
pocket
i
just
take
the
train
from
platform
nine
and
three-quarters
at
eleven
o'clock
he
read
his
aunt
and
uncle
stared
platform
what
nine
and
three-quarters
don't
talk
rubbish
said
Uncle
Vernon
there
is
no
platform
nine
and
three-quarters
it's
on
my
ticket
barking
said
Uncle
Vernon
howling
mad
the
lot
of
them
you'll
see
you
just
wait
all
right
we'll
take
you
to
king's
Cross
we're
going
up
to
London
tomorrow
anyway
or
I
wouldn't
bother
why
are
you
going
to
London
harry
asked
trying
to
keep
things
friendly
taking
Dudley
to
the
hospital
growled
Uncle
Vernon
got
to
have
that
ruddy
tail
removed
before
he
goes
to
Smeltings
harry
woke
at
five
o'clock
the
next
morning
and
was
too
excited
and
nervous
to
go
back
to
sleep
he
got
up
and
pulled
on
his
jeans
because
he
didn't
want
to
walk
into
the
station
in
his
wizard's
robes
he'd
change
on
the
train
he
checked
his
Hogwarts
list
yet
again
to
make
sure
he
had
everything
he
needed
saw
that
Hedwig
was
shut
safely
in
her
cage
and
then
paced
the
room
waiting
for
the
Dursleys
to
get
up
two
hours
later
harry's
huge
heavy
trunk
had
been
loaded
into
the
Dursleys
car
Aunt
Petunia
had
talked
Dudley
into
sitting
next
to
Harry
and
they
had
set
off
they
reached
king's
Cross
at
half
past
ten
uncle
Vernon
dumped
harry's
trunk
onto
a
cart
and
wheeled
it
into
the
station
for
him
harry
thought
this
was
strangely
kind
until
Uncle
Vernon
stopped
dead
facing
the
platforms
with
a
nasty
grin
on
his
face
well
there
you
are
boy
platform
nine
platform
ten
your
platform
should
be
somewhere
in
the
middle
but
they
don't
seem
to
have
built
it
yet
do
they
he
was
quite
right
of
course
there
was
a
big
plastic
number
nine
over
one
platform
and
a
big
plastic
number
ten
over
the
one
next
to
it
and
in
the
middle
nothing
at
all
have
a
good
term
said
Uncle
Vernon
with
an
even
nastier
smile
he
left
without
another
word
harry
turned
and
saw
the
Dursleys
drive
away
all
three
of
them
were
laughing
harry's
mouth
went
rather
dry
what
on
earth
was
he
going
to
do
he
was
starting
to
attract
a
lot
of
funny
looks
because
of
Hedwig
he'd
have
to
ask
someone
he
stopped
a
passing
guard
but
didn't
dare
mention
platform
nine
and
three-quarters
the
guard
had
never
heard
of
Hogwarts
and
when
Harry
couldn't
even
tell
him
what
part
of
the
country
it
was
in
he
started
to
get
annoyed
as
though
Harry
was
being
stupid
on
purpose
getting
desperate
Harry
asked
for
the
train
that
left
at
eleven
o'clock
but
the
guard
said
there
wasn't
one
in
the
end
the
guard
strode
away
muttering
about
time
wasters
harry
was
now
trying
hard
not
to
panic
according
to
the
large
clock
over
the
arrivals
board
he
had
ten
minutes
left
to
get
on
the
train
to
Hogwarts
and
he
had
no
idea
how
to
do
it
he
was
stranded
in
the
middle
of
a
station
with
a
trunk
he
could
hardly
lift
a
pocket
full
of
wizard
money
and
a
large
owl
hagrid
must
have
forgotten
to
tell
him
something
you
had
to
do
like
tapping
the
third
brick
on
the
left
to
get
into
Diagon
Alley
he
wondered
if
he
should
get
out
his
wand
and
start
tapping
the
ticket
inspector's
stand
between
platforms
nine
and
ten
at
that
moment
a
group
of
people
passed
just
behind
him
and
he
caught
a
few
words
of
what
they
were
saying
packed
with
Muggles
of
course
harry
swung
round
the
speaker
was
a
plump
woman
who
was
talking
to
four
boys
all
with
flaming
red
hair
each
of
them
was
pushing
a
trunk
like
harry's
in
front
of
him
and
they
had
an
owl
heart
hammering
Harry
pushed
his
cart
after
them
they
stopped
and
so
did
he
just
near
enough
to
hear
what
they
were
saying
now
what's
the
platform
number
said
the
boys
mother
nine
and
three-quarters
piped
a
small
girl
also
red-headed
who
was
holding
her
hand
Mom
can't
I
go
you're
not
old
enough
Ginny
now
be
quiet
all
right
Percy
you
go
first
what
looked
like
the
oldest
boy
marched
toward
platforms
nine
and
ten
harry
watched
careful
not
to
blink
in
case
he
missed
it
but
just
as
the
boy
reached
the
dividing
barrier
between
the
two
platforms
a
large
crowd
of
tourists
came
swarming
in
front
of
him
and
by
the
time
the
last
backpack
had
cleared
away
the
boy
had
vanished
fred
you
next
the
plump
woman
said
i'm
not
Fred
i'm
George
said
the
boy
honestly
woman
you
call
yourself
our
mother
cara
you
tell
i'm
George
sorry
George
dear
only
joking
I
am
Fred
said
the
boy
and
off
he
went
his
twin
called
after
him
to
hurry
up
and
he
must
have
done
so
because
a
second
later
he
had
gone
but
how
had
he
done
it
now
the
third
brother
was
walking
briskly
toward
the
barrier
he
was
almost
there
and
then
quite
suddenly
he
wasn't
anywhere
there
was
nothing
else
for
it
excuse
me
Harry
said
to
the
plump
woman
hello
dear
she
said
first
time
at
Hogwarts
ron's
new
too
she
pointed
at
the
last
and
youngest
of
her
sons
he
was
tall
thin
and
gangling
with
freckles
big
hands
and
feet
and
a
long
nose
yes
said
Harry
the
thing
is
the
thing
is
I
don't
know
how
to
how
to
get
onto
the
platform
she
said
kindly
and
Harry
nodded
not
to
worry
she
said
all
you
have
to
do
is
walk
straight
at
the
barrier
between
platforms
nine
and
ten
don't
stop
and
don't
be
scared
you'll
crash
into
it
that's
very
important
best
do
it
at
a
bit
of
a
run
if
you're
nervous
go
on
go
now
before
Ron
er
okay
said
Harry
he
pushed
his
trolley
around
and
stared
at
the
barrier
it
looked
very
solid
he
started
to
walk
toward
it
people
jostled
him
on
their
way
to
platforms
nine
and
ten
harry
walked
more
quickly
he
was
going
to
smash
right
into
that
barrier
and
then
he'd
be
in
trouble
leaning
forward
on
his
cart
he
broke
into
a
heavy
run
the
barrier
was
coming
nearer
and
nearer
he
wouldn't
be
able
to
stop
the
cart
was
out
of
control
he
was
a
foot
away
he
closed
his
eyes
ready
for
the
crash
It
didn't
come
he
kept
on
running
he
opened
his
eyes
a
scarlet
steam
engine
was
waiting
next
to
a
platform
packed
with
people
a
sign
overhead
said
Hogwarts
Express
eleven
o'clock
harry
looked
behind
him
and
saw
a
wrought-iron
archway
where
the
barrier
had
been
with
the
words
Platform
Nine
and
Three-Quarters
on
it
He
had
done
it
smoke
from
the
engine
drifted
over
the
heads
of
the
chattering
crowd
while
cats
of
every
color
wound
here
and
there
between
their
legs
owls
hooted
to
one
another
in
a
disgruntled
sort
of
way
over
the
babble
and
the
scraping
of
heavy
trunks
the
first
few
carriages
were
already
packed
with
students
some
hanging
out
of
the
window
to
talk
to
their
families
some
fighting
over
seats
harry
pushed
his
cart
off
down
the
platform
in
search
of
an
empty
seat
he
passed
a
round-faced
boy
who
was
saying
Gran
i've
lost
my
toad
again
oh
Neville
he
heard
the
old
woman
sigh
a
boy
with
dreadlocks
was
surrounded
by
a
small
crowd
give
us
a
look
Lee
go
on
the
boy
lifted
the
lid
of
a
box
in
his
arms
and
the
people
around
him
shrieked
and
yelled
as
something
inside
poked
out
a
long
hairy
leg
harry
pressed
on
through
the
crowd
until
he
found
an
empty
compartment
near
the
end
of
the
train
he
put
Hedwig
inside
first
and
then
started
to
shove
and
heave
his
trunk
toward
the
train
door
he
tried
to
lift
it
up
the
steps
but
could
hardly
raise
one
end
and
twice
he
dropped
it
painfully
on
his
foot
want
a
hand
it
was
one
of
the
red-haired
twins
he'd
followed
through
the
barrier
yes
please
Harry
panted
oy
Fred
c'mere
and
help
with
the
twins
help
harry's
trunk
was
at
last
tucked
away
in
a
corner
of
the
compartment
thanks
said
Harry
pushing
his
sweaty
hair
out
of
his
eyes
what's
that
said
one
of
the
twins
suddenly
pointing
at
harry's
lightning
scar
blimey
said
the
other
twin
are
you
He
is
said
the
first
twin
aren't
you
he
added
to
Harry
what
said
Harry
harry
Potter
chorused
the
twins
oh
him
said
Harry
i
mean
yes
I
am
the
two
boys
gawked
at
him
and
Harry
felt
himself
turning
red
then
to
his
relief
a
voice
came
floating
in
through
the
train's
open
door
fred
george
are
you
there
coming
Mom
with
a
last
look
at
Harry
the
twins
hopped
off
the
train
harry
sat
down
next
to
the
window
where
half
hidden
he
could
watch
the
red-haired
family
on
the
platform
and
hear
what
they
were
saying
their
mother
had
just
taken
out
her
handkerchief
ron
you've
got
something
on
your
nose
the
youngest
boy
tried
to
jerk
out
of
the
way
but
she
grabbed
him
and
began
rubbing
the
end
of
his
nose
mom
geroff
He
wriggled
free
aaah
has
ickle
Ronnie
got
somefink
on
his
nosie
said
one
of
the
twins
shut
up
said
Ron
where's
Percy
said
their
mother
he's
coming
now
the
oldest
boy
came
striding
into
sight
he
had
already
changed
into
his
billowing
black
Hogwarts
robes
and
Harry
noticed
a
shiny
silver
badge
on
his
chest
with
the
letter
P
on
it
can't
stay
long
Mother
he
said
i'm
up
front
the
prefects
have
got
two
compartments
to
themselves
oh
are
you
a
prefect
Percy
said
one
of
the
twins
with
an
air
of
great
surprise
you
should
have
said
something
we
had
no
idea
hang
on
I
think
I
remember
him
saying
something
about
it
said
the
other
twin
once
or
twice
a
minute
all
summer
oh
shut
up
said
Percy
the
Prefect
how
come
Percy
gets
new
robes
anyway
said
one
of
the
twins
because
he's
a
prefect
said
their
mother
fondly
all
right
dear
well
have
a
good
term
send
me
an
owl
when
you
get
there
she
kissed
Percy
on
the
cheek
and
he
left
then
she
turned
to
the
twins
now
you
two
this
year
you
behave
yourselves
if
I
get
one
more
owl
telling
me
you've
you've
blown
up
a
toilet
or
blown
up
a
toilet
we've
never
blown
up
a
toilet
great
idea
though
thanks
Mom
it's
not
funny
and
look
after
Ron
don't
worry
ickle
Ronniekins
is
safe
with
us
shut
up
said
Ron
again
he
was
almost
as
tall
as
the
twins
already
and
his
nose
was
still
pink
where
his
mother
had
rubbed
it
hey
Mom
guess
what
guess
who
we
just
met
on
the
train
harry
leaned
back
quickly
so
they
couldn't
see
him
looking
you
know
that
black-haired
boy
who
was
near
us
in
the
station
know
who
he
is
who
harry
Potter
harry
heard
the
little
girl's
voice
oh
Mom
can
I
go
on
the
train
and
see
him
Mom
eh
please
you've
already
seen
him
Ginny
and
the
poor
boy
isn't
something
you
goggle
at
in
a
zoo
is
he
really
Fred
how
do
you
know
asked
him
saw
his
scar
it's
really
there
like
lightning
poor
dear
no
wonder
he
was
alone
I
wondered
he
was
ever
so
polite
when
he
asked
how
to
get
onto
the
platform
never
mind
that
do
you
think
he
remembers
what
You-Know-Who
looks
like
their
mother
suddenly
became
very
stern
i
forbid
you
to
ask
him
Fred
no
don't
you
dare
as
though
he
needs
reminding
of
that
on
his
first
day
at
school
all
right
keep
your
hair
on
a
whistle
sounded
hurry
up
their
mother
said
and
the
three
boys
clambered
onto
the
train
they
leaned
out
of
the
window
for
her
to
kiss
them
good-bye
and
their
younger
sister
began
to
cry
don't
Ginny
we'll
send
you
loads
of
owls
we'll
send
you
a
Hogwarts
toilet
seat
george
only
joking
Mom
the
train
began
to
move
harry
saw
the
boys
mother
waving
and
their
sister
half
laughing
half
crying
running
to
keep
up
with
the
train
until
it
gathered
too
much
speed
then
she
fell
back
and
waved
harry
watched
the
girl
and
her
mother
disappear
as
the
train
rounded
the
corner
houses
flashed
past
the
window
harry
felt
a
great
leap
of
excitement
he
didn't
know
what
he
was
going
to
but
it
had
to
be
better
than
what
he
was
leaving
behind
the
door
of
the
compartment
slid
open
and
the
youngest
redheaded
boy
came
in
anyone
sitting
there
he
asked
pointing
at
the
seat
opposite
Harry
everywhere
else
is
full
harry
shook
his
head
and
the
boy
sat
down
he
glanced
at
Harry
and
then
looked
quickly
out
of
the
window
pretending
he
hadn't
looked
harry
saw
he
still
had
a
black
mark
on
his
nose
hey
Ron
the
twins
were
back
listen
we're
going
down
the
middle
of
the
train
Lee
jordan's
got
a
giant
tarantula
down
there
right
mumbled
Ron
harry
said
the
other
twin
did
we
introduce
ourselves
fred
and
George
Weasley
and
this
is
Ron
our
brother
see
you
later
then
bye
said
Harry
and
Ron
the
twins
slid
the
compartment
door
shut
behind
them
are
you
really
Harry
Potter
ron
blurted
out
harry
nodded
oh
well
I
thought
it
might
be
one
of
Fred
and
george's
jokes
said
Ron
and
have
you
really
got
you
know
he
pointed
at
harry's
forehead
harry
pulled
back
his
bangs
to
show
the
lightning
scar
ron
stared
so
that's
where
You-Know-Who
Yes
said
Harry
but
I
can't
remember
it
nothing
said
Ron
eagerly
well
I
remember
a
lot
of
green
light
but
nothing
else
wow
said
Ron
he
sat
and
stared
at
Harry
for
a
few
moments
then
as
though
he
had
suddenly
realized
what
he
was
doing
he
looked
quickly
out
of
the
window
again
are
all
your
family
wizards
asked
Harry
who
found
Ron
just
as
interesting
as
Ron
found
him
er
Yes
I
think
so
said
Ron
i
think
mom's
got
a
second
cousin
who's
an
accountant
but
we
never
talk
about
him
so
you
must
know
loads
of
magic
already
the
Weasleys
were
clearly
one
of
those
old
wizarding
families
the
pale
boy
in
Diagon
Alley
had
talked
about
i
heard
you
went
to
live
with
Muggles
said
Ron
what
are
they
like
horrible
well
not
all
of
them
my
aunt
and
uncle
and
cousin
are
though
wish
i'd
had
three
wizard
brothers
five
said
Ron
for
some
reason
he
was
looking
gloomy
i'm
the
sixth
in
our
family
to
go
to
Hogwarts
you
could
say
i've
got
a
lot
to
live
up
to
bill
and
Charlie
have
already
left
Bill
was
head
boy
and
Charlie
was
captain
of
Quidditch
now
percy's
a
prefect
fred
and
George
mess
around
a
lot
but
they
still
get
really
good
marks
and
everyone
thinks
they're
really
funny
everyone
expects
me
to
do
as
well
as
the
others
but
if
I
do
it's
no
big
deal
because
they
did
it
first
you
never
get
anything
new
either
with
five
brothers
i've
got
bill's
old
robes
charlie's
old
wand
and
percy's
old
rat
ron
reached
inside
his
jacket
and
pulled
out
a
fat
gray
rat
which
was
asleep
his
name's
Scabbers
and
he's
useless
he
hardly
ever
wakes
up
percy
got
an
owl
from
my
dad
for
being
made
a
prefect
but
they
couldn't
aff
I
mean
I
got
Scabbers
instead
ron's
ears
went
pink
he
seemed
to
think
he'd
said
too
much
because
he
went
back
to
staring
out
of
the
window
harry
didn't
think
there
was
anything
wrong
with
not
being
able
to
afford
an
owl
after
all
he'd
never
had
any
money
in
his
life
until
a
month
ago
and
he
told
Ron
so
all
about
having
to
wear
dudley's
old
clothes
and
never
getting
proper
birthday
presents
this
seemed
to
cheer
Ron
up
and
until
Hagrid
told
me
I
didn't
know
anything
about
be
ing
a
wizard
or
about
my
parents
or
Voldemort
ron
gasped
what
said
Harry
you
said
you-know-who's
name
said
Ron
sounding
both
shocked
and
impressed
i'd
have
thought
you
of
all
people
i'm
not
trying
to
be
brave
or
anything
saying
the
name
said
Harry
I
just
never
knew
you
shouldn't
see
what
I
mean
i've
got
loads
to
learn
i
bet
he
added
voicing
for
the
first
time
something
that
had
been
worrying
him
a
lot
lately
I
bet
i'm
the
worst
in
the
class
you
won't
be
there's
loads
of
people
who
come
from
Muggle
families
and
they
learn
quick
enough
while
they
had
been
talking
the
train
had
carried
them
out
of
London
now
they
were
speeding
past
fields
full
of
cows
and
sheep
they
were
quiet
for
a
time
watching
the
fields
and
lanes
flick
past
around
half
past
twelve
there
was
a
great
clattering
outside
in
the
corridor
and
a
smiling
dimpled
woman
slid
back
their
door
and
said
Anything
off
the
cart
dears
harry
who
hadn't
had
any
breakfast
leapt
to
his
feet
but
ron's
ears
went
pink
again
and
he
muttered
that
he'd
brought
sandwiches
harry
went
out
into
the
corridor
he
had
never
had
any
money
for
candy
with
the
Dursleys
and
now
that
he
had
pockets
rattling
with
gold
and
silver
he
was
ready
to
buy
as
many
Mars
Bars
as
he
could
carry
but
the
woman
didn't
have
Mars
Bars
what
she
did
have
were
Bettie
bott's
Every
Flavor
Beans
drooble's
Best
Blowing
Gum
Chocolate
Frogs
pumpkin
Pasties
Cauldron
Cakes
Licorice
Wands
and
a
number
of
other
strange
things
Harry
had
never
seen
in
his
life
not
wanting
to
miss
anything
he
got
some
of
everything
and
paid
the
woman
eleven
silver
Sickles
and
seven
bronze
Knuts
ron
stared
as
Harry
brought
it
all
back
in
to
the
compartment
and
tipped
it
onto
an
empty
seat
hungry
are
you
starving
said
Harry
taking
a
large
bite
out
of
a
pumpkin
pasty
ron
had
taken
out
a
lumpy
package
and
unwrapped
it
there
were
four
sandwiches
inside
he
pulled
one
of
them
apart
and
said
She
always
forgets
I
don't
like
corned
beef
swap
you
for
one
of
these
said
Harry
holding
up
a
pasty
go
on
you
don't
want
this
it's
all
dry
said
Ron
she
hasn't
got
much
time
he
added
quickly
you
know
with
five
of
us
go
on
have
a
pasty
said
Harry
who
had
never
had
anything
to
share
before
or
indeed
anyone
to
share
it
with
it
was
a
nice
feeling
sitting
there
with
Ron
eating
their
way
through
all
harry's
pasties
cakes
and
candies
the
sandwiches
lay
forgotten
what
are
these
harry
asked
Ron
holding
up
a
pack
of
Chocolate
Frogs
they're
not
really
frogs
are
they
he
was
starting
to
feel
that
nothing
would
surprise
him
no
said
Ron
but
see
what
the
card
is
i'm
missing
Agrippa
what
oh
of
course
you
wouldn't
know
Chocolate
Frogs
have
cards
inside
them
you
know
to
collect
famous
witches
and
wizards
i've
got
about
five
hundred
but
I
haven't
got
Agrippa
or
Ptolemy
harry
unwrapped
his
Chocolate
Frog
and
picked
up
the
card
it
showed
a
man's
face
he
wore
half
moon
glasses
had
a
long
crooked
nose
and
flowing
silver
hair
beard
and
mustache
underneath
the
picture
was
the
name
Albus
Dumbledore
so
this
is
Dumbledore
said
Harry
don't
tell
me
you'd
never
heard
of
Dumbledore
said
Ron
can
I
have
a
frog
i
might
get
Agrippa
thanks
Harry
turned
over
his
card
and
read
albus
dumbledore
currently
headmaster
of
hogwarts
Considered
by
many
the
greatest
wizard
of
modern
times
Dumbledore
is
particularly
famous
for
his
defeat
of
the
dark
wizard
Grindelwald
in
for
the
discovery
of
the
twelve
uses
of
dragon's
blood
and
his
work
on
alchemy
with
his
partner
Nicolas
Flamel
professor
Dumbledore
enjoys
chamber
music
and
tenpin
bowling
harry
turned
the
card
back
over
and
saw
to
his
astonishment
that
dumbledore's
face
had
disappeared
he's
gone
well
you
can't
expect
him
to
hang
around
all
day
said
Ron
he'll
be
back
no
i've
got
Morgana
again
and
i've
got
about
six
of
her
do
you
want
it
you
can
start
collecting
ron's
eyes
strayed
to
the
pile
of
Chocolate
Frogs
waiting
to
be
unwrapped
help
yourself
said
Harry
but
in
you
know
the
Muggle
world
people
just
stay
put
in
photos
do
they
what
they
don't
move
at
all
ron
sounded
amazed
weird
harry
stared
as
Dumbledore
sidled
back
into
the
picture
on
his
card
and
gave
him
a
small
smile
ron
was
more
interested
in
eating
the
frogs
than
looking
at
the
Famous
Witches
and
Wizards
cards
but
Harry
couldn't
keep
his
eyes
off
them
soon
he
had
not
only
Dumbledore
and
Morgana
but
Hengist
of
Woodcroft
Alberic
Grunnion
Circe
Paracelsus
and
Merlin
he
finally
tore
his
eyes
away
from
the
druidess
Cliodna
who
was
scratching
her
nose
to
open
a
bag
of
Bertie
bott's
Every
Flavor
Beans
you
want
to
be
careful
with
those
Ron
warned
Harry
when
they
say
every
flavor
they
mean
every
flavor
you
know
you
get
all
the
ordinary
ones
like
chocolate
and
peppermint
and
mar
malade
but
then
you
can
get
spinach
and
liver
and
tripe
george
reckons
he
had
a
boogerflavored
one
once
ron
picked
up
a
green
bean
looked
at
it
carefully
and
bit
into
a
corner
bleaaargh
see
sprouts
they
had
a
good
time
eating
the
Every
Flavor
Beans
harry
got
toast
coconut
baked
bean
strawberry
curry
grass
coffee
sardine
and
was
even
brave
enough
to
nibble
the
end
off
a
funny
gray
one
Ron
wouldn't
touch
which
turned
out
to
be
pepper
the
countryside
now
flying
past
the
window
was
becoming
wilder
the
neat
fields
had
gone
now
there
were
woods
twisting
rivers
and
dark
green
hills
there
was
a
knock
on
the
door
of
their
compartment
and
the
round-faced
boy
Harry
had
passed
on
platform
nine
and
threequarters
came
in
he
looked
tearful
sorry
he
said
but
have
you
seen
a
toad
at
all
when
they
shook
their
heads
he
wailed
i've
lost
him
he
keeps
getting
away
from
me
he'll
turn
up
said
Harry
yes
said
the
boy
miserably
well
if
you
see
him
he
left
don't
know
why
he's
so
bothered
said
Ron
if
i'd
brought
a
toad
i'd
lose
it
as
quick
as
I
could
mind
you
I
brought
Scabbers
so
I
can't
talk
the
rat
was
still
snoozing
on
ron's
lap
he
might
have
died
and
you
wouldn't
know
the
difference
said
Ron
in
disgust
i
tried
to
turn
him
yellow
yesterday
to
make
him
more
interesting
but
the
spell
didn't
work
i'll
show
you
look
he
rummaged
around
in
his
trunk
and
pulled
out
a
very
battered-looking
wand
it
was
chipped
in
places
and
something
white
was
glinting
at
the
end
unicorn
hair's
nearly
poking
out
anyway
He
had
just
raised
his
wand
when
the
compartment
door
slid
open
again
the
toadless
boy
was
back
but
this
time
he
had
a
girl
with
him
she
was
already
wearing
her
new
Hogwarts
robes
has
anyone
seen
a
toad
neville's
lost
one
she
said
she
had
a
bossy
sort
of
voice
lots
of
bushy
brown
hair
and
rather
large
front
teeth
we've
already
told
him
we
haven't
seen
it
said
Ron
but
the
girl
wasn't
listening
she
was
looking
at
the
wand
in
his
hand
oh
are
you
doing
magic
let's
see
it
then
she
sat
down
ron
looked
taken
aback
er
all
right
he
cleared
his
throat
sunshine
daisies
butter
mellow
Turn
this
stupid
fat
rat
yellow
he
waved
his
wand
but
nothing
happened
scabbers
stayed
gray
and
fast
asleep
are
you
sure
that's
a
real
spell
said
the
girl
well
it's
not
very
good
is
it
i've
tried
a
few
simple
spells
just
for
practice
and
it's
all
worked
for
me
nobody
in
my
family's
magic
at
all
it
was
ever
such
a
surprise
when
I
got
my
letter
but
I
was
ever
so
pleased
of
course
I
mean
it's
the
very
best
school
of
witchcraft
there
is
i've
heard
i've
learned
all
our
course
books
by
heart
of
course
I
just
hope
it
will
be
enough
i'm
Hermione
Granger
by
the
way
who
are
you
she
said
all
this
very
fast
harry
looked
at
Ron
and
was
relieved
to
see
by
his
stunned
face
that
he
hadn't
learned
all
the
course
books
by
heart
either
i'm
Ron
Weasley
Ron
muttered
harry
Potter
said
Harry
are
you
really
said
Hermione
i
know
all
about
you
of
course
I
got
a
few
extra
books
for
background
reading
and
you're
in
Modern
Magical
History
and
The
Rise
and
Fall
of
the
Dark
Arts
and
Great
Wizarding
Events
of
the
Twentieth
Century
am
I
said
Harry
feeling
dazed
goodness
didn't
you
know
i'd
have
found
out
everything
I
could
if
it
was
me
said
Hermione
do
either
of
you
know
what
house
you'll
be
in
i've
been
asking
around
and
I
hope
i'm
in
Gryffindor
it
sounds
by
far
the
best
I
hear
Dumbledore
himself
was
in
it
but
I
suppose
Ravenclaw
wouldn't
be
too
bad
anyway
we'd
better
go
and
look
for
neville's
toad
you
two
had
better
change
you
know
I
expect
we'll
be
there
soon
and
she
left
taking
the
toadless
boy
with
her
whatever
house
i'm
in
I
hope
she's
not
in
it
said
Ron
he
threw
his
wand
back
into
his
trunk
stupid
spell
George
gave
it
to
me
bet
he
knew
it
was
a
dud
what
house
are
your
brothers
in
asked
Harry
gryffindor
said
Ron
gloom
seemed
to
be
settling
on
him
again
mom
and
Dad
were
in
it
too
i
don't
know
what
they'll
say
if
i'm
not
i
don't
suppose
Ravenclaw
would
be
too
bad
but
imagine
if
they
put
me
in
Slytherin
that's
the
house
Vol
I
mean
You-Know-Who
was
in
yeah
said
Ron
he
flopped
back
into
his
seat
looking
depressed
you
know
I
think
the
ends
of
Scabbers
whiskers
are
a
bit
lighter
said
Harry
trying
to
take
ron's
mind
off
houses
so
what
do
your
oldest
brothers
do
now
that
they've
left
anyway
harry
was
wondering
what
a
wizard
did
once
he'd
finished
school
charlie's
in
Romania
studying
dragons
and
bill's
in
Africa
doing
something
for
Gringotts
said
Ron
did
you
hear
about
Gringotts
it's
been
all
over
the
Daily
Prophet
but
I
don't
suppose
you
get
that
with
the
Muggles
someone
tried
to
rob
a
high
security
vault
harry
stared
really
what
happened
to
them
nothing
that's
why
it's
such
big
news
they
haven't
been
caught
my
dad
says
it
must've
been
a
powerful
Dark
wizard
to
get
round
Gringotts
but
they
don't
think
they
took
anything
that's
what's
odd
course
everyone
gets
scared
when
something
like
this
happens
in
case
you-know-who's
behind
it
harry
turned
this
news
over
in
his
mind
he
was
starting
to
get
a
prickle
of
fear
every
time
You
Know-Who
was
mentioned
he
supposed
this
was
all
part
of
entering
the
magical
world
but
it
had
been
a
lot
more
comfortable
saying
Voldemort
without
worrying
what's
your
Quidditch
team
ron
asked
er
I
don't
know
any
Harry
confessed
what
ron
looked
dumbfounded
oh
you
wait
it's
the
best
game
in
the
world
And
he
was
off
explaining
all
about
the
four
balls
and
the
positions
of
the
seven
players
describing
famous
games
he'd
been
to
with
his
brothers
and
the
broomstick
he'd
like
to
get
if
he
had
the
money
he
was
just
taking
Harry
through
the
finer
points
of
the
game
when
the
compartment
door
slid
open
yet
again
but
it
wasn't
Neville
the
toadless
boy
or
Hermione
Granger
this
time
three
boys
entered
and
Harry
recognized
the
middle
one
at
once
it
was
the
pale
boy
from
Madam
malkin's
robe
shop
he
was
looking
at
Harry
with
a
lot
more
interest
than
he'd
shown
back
in
Diagon
Alley
is
it
true
he
said
they're
saying
all
down
the
train
that
Harry
potter's
in
this
compartment
so
it's
you
is
it
yes
said
Harry
he
was
looking
at
the
other
boys
both
of
them
were
thickset
and
looked
extremely
mean
standing
on
either
side
of
the
pale
boy
they
looked
like
bodyguards
oh
this
is
Crabbe
and
this
is
Goyle
said
the
pale
boy
carelessly
noticing
where
Harry
was
looking
and
my
name's
Malfoy
Draco
Malfoy
ron
gave
a
slight
cough
which
might
have
been
hiding
a
snigget
draco
Malfoy
looked
at
him
think
my
name's
funny
do
you
no
need
to
ask
who
you
are
my
father
told
me
all
the
Weasleys
have
red
hair
freckles
and
more
children
than
they
can
afford
he
turned
back
to
Harry
you'll
soon
find
out
some
wizarding
families
are
much
better
than
others
Potter
you
don't
want
to
go
making
friends
with
the
wrong
sort
i
can
help
you
there
he
held
out
his
hand
to
shake
harry's
but
Harry
didn't
take
it
i
think
I
can
tell
who
the
wrong
sort
are
for
myself
thanks
he
said
coolly
draco
Malfoy
didn't
go
red
but
a
pink
tinge
appeared
in
his
pale
cheeks
i'd
be
careful
if
I
were
you
Potter
he
said
slowly
unless
you're
a
bit
politer
you'll
go
the
same
way
as
your
parents
they
didn't
know
what
was
good
for
them
either
you
hang
around
with
riffraff
like
the
Weasleys
and
that
Hagrid
and
it'll
rub
off
on
you
both
Harry
and
Ron
stood
up
say
that
again
Ron
said
his
face
as
red
as
his
hair
oh
you're
going
to
fight
us
are
you
malfoy
sneered
unless
you
get
out
now
said
Harry
more
bravely
than
he
felt
because
Crabbe
and
Goyle
were
a
lot
bigger
than
him
or
Ron
but
we
don't
feet
like
leaving
do
we
boys
we've
eaten
all
our
food
and
you
still
seem
to
have
some
goyle
reached
toward
the
Chocolate
Frogs
next
to
Ron
Ron
leapt
forward
but
before
he'd
so
much
as
touched
Goyle
Goyle
let
out
a
horrible
yell
scabbers
the
rat
was
hanging
off
his
finger
sharp
little
teeth
sunk
deep
into
goyle's
knuckle
Crabbe
and
Malfoy
backed
away
as
Goyle
swung
Scabbers
round
and
round
howling
and
when
Scabbets
finally
flew
off
and
hit
the
window
all
three
of
them
disappeared
at
once
perhaps
they
thought
there
were
more
rats
lurking
among
the
sweets
or
perhaps
they'd
heard
footsteps
because
a
second
later
Hermione
Granger
had
come
in
what
has
been
going
on
she
said
looking
at
the
sweets
all
over
the
floor
and
Ron
picking
up
Scabbers
by
his
tail
i
think
he's
been
knocked
out
Ron
said
to
Harry
he
looked
closer
at
Scabbers
no
I
don't
believe
it
he's
gone
back
to
sleep
and
so
he
had
you've
met
Malfoy
before
harry
explained
about
their
meeting
in
Diagon
Alley
i've
heard
of
his
family
said
Ron
darkly
they
were
some
of
the
first
to
come
back
to
our
side
after
You-Know-Who
disappeared
said
they'd
been
bewitched
my
dad
doesn't
believe
it
he
says
malfoy's
father
didn't
need
an
excuse
to
go
over
to
the
Dark
Side
he
turned
to
Hermione
can
we
help
you
with
something
you'd
better
hurry
up
and
put
your
robes
on
i've
just
been
up
to
the
front
to
ask
the
conductor
and
he
says
we're
nearly
there
you
haven't
been
fighting
have
you
you'll
be
in
trouble
before
we
even
get
there
scabbers
has
been
fighting
not
us
said
Ron
scowling
at
her
would
you
mind
leaving
while
we
change
all
right
I
only
came
in
here
because
people
outside
are
behaving
very
childishly
racing
up
and
down
the
corridors
said
Hermione
in
a
sniffy
voice
and
you've
got
dirt
on
your
nose
by
the
way
did
you
know
ron
glared
at
her
as
she
left
harry
peered
out
of
the
window
it
was
getting
dark
he
could
see
mountains
and
forests
under
a
deep
purple
sky
the
train
did
seem
to
be
slowing
down
he
and
Ron
took
off
their
jackets
and
pulled
on
their
long
black
robes
ron's
were
a
bit
short
for
him
you
could
see
his
sneakers
underneath
them
a
voice
echoed
through
the
train
We
will
be
reaching
Hogwarts
in
five
minutes
time
please
leave
your
luggage
on
the
train
it
will
be
taken
to
the
school
separately
harry's
stomach
lurched
with
nerves
and
Ron
he
saw
looked
pale
under
his
freckles
they
crammed
their
pockets
with
the
last
of
the
sweets
and
joined
the
crowd
thronging
the
corridor
the
train
slowed
right
down
and
finally
stopped
people
pushed
their
way
toward
the
door
and
out
on
to
a
tiny
dark
platform
harry
shivered
in
the
cold
night
air
then
a
lamp
came
bobbing
over
the
heads
of
the
students
and
Harry
heard
a
familiar
voice
Firs
years
firs
years
over
here
all
right
there
Harry
hagrid's
big
hairy
face
beamed
over
the
sea
of
heads
c'mon
follow
me
any
more
firs
years
mind
yer
step
now
firs
years
follow
me
slipping
and
stumbling
they
followed
Hagrid
down
what
seemed
to
be
a
steep
narrow
path
it
was
so
dark
on
either
side
of
them
that
Harry
thought
there
must
be
thick
trees
there
nobody
spoke
much
neville
the
boy
who
kept
losing
his
toad
sniffed
once
or
twice
ye
all
get
yer
firs
sight
o
Hogwarts
in
a
sec
Hagrid
called
over
his
shoulder
jus
round
this
bend
here
there
was
a
loud
Oooooh
the
narrow
path
had
opened
suddenly
onto
the
edge
of
a
great
black
take
perched
atop
a
high
mountain
on
the
other
side
its
windows
sparkling
in
the
starry
sky
was
a
vast
castle
with
many
turrets
and
towers
no
more'n
four
to
a
boat
hagrid
called
pointing
to
a
fleet
of
little
boats
sitting
in
the
water
by
the
shore
harry
and
Ron
were
followed
into
their
boat
by
Neville
and
Hermione
everyone
in
shouted
Hagrid
who
had
a
boat
to
himself
right
then
forward
and
the
fleet
of
little
boats
moved
off
all
at
once
gliding
across
the
lake
which
was
as
smooth
as
glass
everyone
was
silent
staring
up
at
the
great
castle
overhead
it
towered
over
them
as
they
sailed
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
cliff
on
which
it
stood
heads
down
yelled
Hagrid
as
the
first
boats
reached
the
cliff
they
all
bent
their
heads
and
the
little
boats
carried
them
through
a
curtain
of
ivy
that
hid
a
wide
opening
in
the
cliff
face
they
were
carried
along
a
dark
tunnel
which
seemed
to
be
taking
them
right
underneath
the
castle
until
they
reached
a
kind
of
underground
harbor
where
they
clambered
out
onto
rocks
and
pebbles
oy
you
there
is
this
your
toad
said
Hagrid
who
was
checking
the
boats
as
people
climbed
out
of
them
trevor
cried
Neville
blissfully
holding
out
his
hands
then
they
clambered
up
a
passageway
in
the
rock
after
hagrid's
lamp
coming
out
at
last
onto
smooth
damp
grass
right
in
the
shadow
of
the
castle
they
walked
up
a
flight
of
stone
steps
and
crowded
around
the
huge
Oak
front
door
everyone
here
you
there
still
got
yer
toad
hagrid
raised
a
gigantic
fist
and
knocked
three
times
on
the
castle
door
chapter
seven
the
sorting
hat
the
door
swung
open
at
once
a
tall
black-haired
witch
in
emerald-green
robes
stood
there
she
had
a
very
stern
face
and
harry's
first
thought
was
that
this
was
not
someone
to
cross
the
firs
years
Professor
McGonagall
said
Hagrid
thank
you
Hagrid
i
will
take
them
from
here
she
pulled
the
door
wide
the
entrance
hall
was
so
big
you
could
have
fit
the
whole
of
the
Dursleys
house
in
it
the
stone
walls
were
lit
with
flaming
torches
like
the
ones
at
Gringotts
the
ceiling
was
too
high
to
make
out
and
a
magnificent
marble
staircase
facing
them
led
to
the
upper
floors
they
followed
Professor
McGonagall
across
the
flagged
stone
floor
harry
could
hear
the
drone
of
hundreds
of
voices
from
a
doorway
to
the
right
the
rest
of
the
school
must
already
be
here
but
Professor
McGonagall
showed
the
first
years
into
a
small
empty
chamber
off
the
hall
they
crowded
in
standing
rather
closer
together
than
they
would
usually
have
done
peering
about
nervously
welcome
to
Hogwarts
said
Professor
McGonagall
the
start-of-term
banquet
will
begin
shortly
but
before
you
take
your
seats
in
the
Great
Hall
you
will
be
sorted
into
your
houses
the
Sorting
is
a
very
important
ceremony
because
while
you
are
here
your
house
will
be
something
like
your
family
within
Hogwarts
you
will
have
classes
with
the
rest
of
your
house
sleep
in
your
house
dormitory
and
spend
free
time
in
your
house
common
room
the
four
houses
are
called
Gryffindor
Hufflepuff
Ravenclaw
and
Slytherin
each
house
has
its
own
noble
history
and
each
has
produced
outstanding
witches
and
wizards
while
you
are
at
Hogwarts
your
triumphs
will
earn
your
house
points
while
any
rulebreaking
will
lose
house
points
at
the
end
of
the
year
the
house
with
the
most
points
is
awarded
the
house
cup
a
great
honor
i
hope
each
of
you
will
be
a
credit
to
whichever
house
becomes
yours
the
Sorting
Ceremony
will
take
place
in
a
few
minutes
in
front
of
the
rest
of
the
school
i
suggest
you
all
smarten
yourselves
up
as
much
as
you
can
while
you
are
waiting
her
eyes
lingered
for
a
moment
on
neville's
cloak
which
was
fastened
under
his
left
ear
and
on
ron's
smudged
nose
harry
nervously
tried
to
flatten
his
hair
i
shall
return
when
we
are
ready
for
you
said
Professor
McGonagall
please
wait
quietly
she
left
the
chamber
harry
swallowed
how
exactly
do
they
sort
us
into
houses
he
asked
Ron
some
sort
of
test
I
think
fred
said
it
hurts
a
lot
but
I
think
he
was
joking
harry's
heart
gave
a
horrible
jolt
a
test
in
front
of
the
whole
school
but
he
didn't
know
any
magic
yet
what
on
earth
would
he
have
to
do
he
hadn't
expected
something
like
this
the
moment
they
arrived
he
looked
around
anxiously
and
saw
that
everyone
else
looked
terrified
too
no
one
was
talking
much
except
Hermione
Granger
who
was
whispering
very
fast
about
all
the
spells
she'd
learned
and
wondering
which
one
she'd
need
harry
tried
hard
not
to
listen
to
her
he'd
never
been
more
nervous
never
not
even
when
he'd
had
to
take
a
school
report
home
to
the
Dursleys
saying
that
he'd
somehow
turned
his
teacher's
wig
blue
he
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
door
any
second
now
Professor
McGonagall
would
come
back
and
lead
him
to
his
doom
then
something
happened
that
made
him
jump
about
a
foot
in
the
air
several
people
behind
him
screamed
what
the
he
gasped
so
did
the
people
around
him
about
twenty
ghosts
had
just
streamed
through
the
back
wall
pearly-white
and
slightly
transparent
they
glided
across
the
room
talking
to
one
another
and
hardly
glancing
at
the
first
years
they
seemed
to
be
arguing
what
looked
like
a
fat
little
monk
was
saying
Forgive
and
forget
I
say
we
ought
to
give
him
a
second
chance
my
dear
Friar
haven't
we
given
Peeves
all
the
chances
he
deserves
he
gives
us
all
a
bad
name
and
you
know
he's
not
really
even
a
ghost
I
say
what
are
you
all
doing
here
a
ghost
wearing
a
ruff
and
tights
had
suddenly
noticed
the
first
years
nobody
answered
new
students
said
the
Fat
Friar
smiling
around
at
them
about
to
be
Sorted
I
suppose
a
few
people
nodded
mutely
hope
to
see
you
in
Hufflepuff
said
the
Friar
my
old
house
you
know
move
along
now
said
a
sharp
voice
the
Sorting
ceremony's
about
to
start
professor
McGonagall
had
returned
one
by
one
the
ghosts
floated
away
through
the
opposite
wall
now
form
a
line
Professor
McGonagall
told
the
first
years
and
follow
me
feeling
oddly
as
though
his
legs
had
turned
to
lead
Harry
got
into
line
behind
a
boy
with
sandy
hair
with
Ron
behind
him
and
they
walked
out
of
the
chamber
back
across
the
hall
and
through
a
pair
of
double
doors
into
the
Great
Hall
harry
had
never
even
imagined
such
a
strange
and
splendid
place
it
was
lit
by
thousands
and
thousands
of
candles
that
were
floating
in
midair
over
four
long
tables
where
the
rest
of
the
students
were
sitting
these
tables
were
laid
with
glittering
golden
plates
and
goblets
at
the
top
of
the
hall
was
another
long
table
where
the
teachers
were
sitting
professor
McGonagall
led
the
first
years
up
here
so
that
they
came
to
a
halt
in
a
line
facing
the
other
students
with
the
teachers
behind
them
the
hundreds
of
faces
staring
at
them
looked
like
pale
lanterns
in
the
flickering
candlelight
dotted
here
and
there
among
the
students
the
ghosts
shone
misty
silver
mainly
to
avoid
all
the
staring
eyes
Harry
looked
upward
and
saw
a
velvety
black
ceiling
dotted
with
stars
he
heard
Hermione
whisper
Its
bewitched
to
look
like
the
sky
outside
i
read
about
it
in
Hogwarts
A
History
it
was
hard
to
believe
there
was
a
ceiling
there
at
all
and
that
the
Great
Hall
didn't
simply
open
on
to
the
heavens
harry
quickly
looked
down
again
as
Professor
McGonagall
silently
placed
a
four-legged
stool
in
front
of
the
first
years
on
top
of
the
stool
she
put
a
pointed
wizard's
hat
this
hat
was
patched
and
frayed
and
extremely
dirty
aunt
Petunia
wouldn't
have
let
it
in
the
house
maybe
they
had
to
try
and
get
a
rabbit
out
of
it
Harry
thought
wildly
that
seemed
the
sort
of
thing
noticing
that
everyone
in
the
hall
was
now
staring
at
the
hat
he
stared
at
it
too
for
a
few
seconds
there
was
complete
silence
then
the
hat
twitched
a
rip
near
the
brim
opened
wide
like
a
mouth
and
the
hat
began
to
sing
Oh
you
may
not
think
i'm
pretty
But
don't
judge
on
what
you
see
i'll
eat
myself
if
you
can
find
A
smarter
hat
than
me
you
can
keep
your
bowlers
black
Your
top
hats
sleek
and
tall
For
i'm
the
Hogwarts
Sorting
Hat
And
I
can
cap
them
all
there's
nothing
hidden
in
your
head
The
Sorting
Hat
can't
see
So
try
me
on
and
I
will
tell
you
Where
you
ought
to
be
you
might
belong
in
Gryffindor
Where
dwell
the
brave
at
heart
Their
daring
nerve
and
chivalry
Set
Gryffindors
apart
You
might
belong
in
Hufflepuff
Where
they
are
just
and
loyal
Those
patient
Hufflepuffis
are
true
And
unafraid
of
toil
Or
yet
in
wise
old
Ravenclaw
if
you've
a
ready
mind
Where
those
of
wit
and
learning
Will
always
find
their
kind
Or
perhaps
in
Slytherin
you'll
make
your
real
friends
Those
cunning
folk
use
any
means
To
achieve
their
ends
so
put
me
on
don't
be
afraid
and
don't
get
in
a
flap
you're
in
safe
hands
though
I
have
none
For
i'm
a
Thinking
Cap
the
whole
hall
burst
into
applause
as
the
hat
finished
its
song
it
bowed
to
each
of
the
four
tables
and
then
became
quite
still
again
so
we've
just
got
to
try
on
the
hat
ron
whispered
to
Harry
i'll
kill
Fred
he
was
going
on
about
wrestling
a
troll
harry
smiled
weakly
yes
trying
on
the
hat
was
a
lot
better
than
having
to
do
a
spell
but
he
did
wish
they
could
have
tried
it
on
without
everyone
watching
the
hat
seemed
to
be
asking
rather
alot
Harry
didn't
feel
brave
or
quick-witted
or
any
of
it
at
the
moment
if
only
the
hat
had
mentioned
a
house
for
people
who
felt
a
bit
queasy
that
would
have
been
the
one
for
him
professor
McGonagall
now
stepped
forward
holding
a
long
roll
of
parchment
when
I
call
your
name
you
will
put
on
the
hat
and
sit
on
the
stool
to
be
sorted
she
said
abbott
Hannah
a
pink-faced
girl
with
blonde
pigtails
stumbled
out
of
line
put
on
the
hat
which
fell
right
down
over
her
eyes
and
sat
down
a
moments
pause
hufflepuff
shouted
the
hat
the
table
on
the
right
cheered
and
clapped
as
Hannah
went
to
sit
down
at
the
Hufflepuff
table
harry
saw
the
ghost
of
the
Fat
Friar
waving
merrily
at
her
bones
Susan
hufflepuff
shouted
the
hat
again
and
Susan
scuttled
off
to
sit
next
to
Hannah
boot
Terry
ravenclaw
the
table
second
from
the
left
clapped
this
time
several
Ravenclaws
stood
up
to
shake
hands
with
Terry
as
he
joined
them
brocklehurst
Mandy
went
to
Ravenclaw
too
but
Brown
Lavender
became
the
first
new
Gryffindor
and
the
table
on
the
far
left
exploded
with
cheers
Harry
could
see
ron's
twin
brothers
catcalling
bulstrode
Millicent
then
became
a
Slytherin
perhaps
it
was
harry's
imagination
after
all
he'd
heard
about
Slytherin
but
he
thought
they
looked
like
an
unpleasant
lot
he
was
starting
to
feel
definitely
sick
now
he
remembered
being
picked
for
teams
during
gym
at
his
old
school
he
had
always
been
last
to
be
chosen
not
because
he
was
no
good
but
because
no
one
wanted
Dudley
to
think
they
liked
him
finch-Fletchley
Justin
hufflepuff
sometimes
Harry
noticed
the
hat
shouted
out
the
house
at
once
but
at
others
it
took
a
little
while
to
decide
finnigan
Seamus
the
sandy-haired
boy
next
to
Harry
in
the
line
sat
on
the
stool
for
almost
a
whole
minute
before
the
hat
declared
him
a
Gryffindor
granger
Hermione
hermione
almost
ran
to
the
stool
and
jammed
the
hat
eagerly
on
her
head
gryffindor
shouted
the
hat
ron
groaned
a
horrible
thought
struck
Harry
as
horrible
thoughts
always
do
when
you're
very
nervous
what
if
he
wasn't
chosen
at
all
what
if
he
just
sat
there
with
the
hat
over
his
eyes
for
ages
until
Professor
McGonagall
jerked
it
off
his
head
and
said
there
had
obviously
been
a
mistake
and
he'd
better
get
back
on
the
train
when
Neville
Longbottom
the
boy
who
kept
losing
his
toad
was
called
he
fell
over
on
his
way
to
the
stool
the
hat
took
a
long
time
to
decide
with
Neville
when
it
finally
shouted
gryffindor
Neville
ran
off
still
wearing
it
and
had
to
jog
back
amid
gales
of
laughter
to
give
it
to
MacDougal
Morag
malfoy
swaggered
forward
when
his
name
was
called
and
got
his
wish
at
once
the
hat
had
barely
touched
his
head
when
it
screamed
slytherin
malfoy
went
to
join
his
friends
Crabbe
and
Goyle
looking
pleased
with
himself
there
weren't
many
people
left
now
moon
Nott
Parkinson
then
a
pair
of
twin
girls
Patil
and
Patil
then
Perks
Sally-Anne
and
then
at
last
Potter
Harry
as
Harry
stepped
forward
whispers
suddenly
broke
out
like
little
hissing
fires
all
over
the
hall
potter
did
she
say
the
Harry
Potter
the
last
thing
Harry
saw
before
the
hat
dropped
over
his
eyes
was
the
hall
full
of
people
craning
to
get
a
good
look
at
him
next
second
he
was
looking
at
the
black
inside
of
the
hat
he
waited
hmm
said
a
small
voice
in
his
ear
difficult
very
difficult
plenty
of
courage
I
see
not
a
bad
mind
either
there's
talent
A
my
goodness
yes
and
a
nice
thirst
to
prove
yourself
now
that's
interesting
so
where
shall
I
put
you
harry
gripped
the
edges
of
the
stool
and
thought
Not
Slytherin
not
Slytherin
not
Slytherin
eh
said
the
small
voice
are
you
sure
you
could
be
great
you
know
it's
all
here
in
your
head
and
Slytherin
will
help
you
on
the
way
to
greatness
no
doubt
about
that
no
well
if
you're
sure
better
be
gryffindor
harry
heard
the
hat
shout
the
last
word
to
the
whole
hall
he
took
off
the
hat
and
walked
shakily
toward
the
Gryffindor
table
he
was
so
relieved
to
have
been
chosen
and
not
put
in
Slytherin
he
hardly
noticed
that
he
was
getting
the
loudest
cheer
yet
percy
the
Prefect
got
up
and
shook
his
hand
vigorously
while
the
Weasley
twins
yelled
We
got
Potter
we
got
Potter
harry
sat
down
opposite
the
ghost
in
the
ruff
he'd
seen
earlier
the
ghost
patted
his
arm
giving
Harry
the
sudden
horrible
feeling
he'd
just
plunged
it
into
a
bucket
of
ice-cold
water
he
could
see
the
High
Table
properly
now
at
the
end
nearest
him
sat
Hagrid
who
caught
his
eye
and
gave
him
the
thumbs
up
harry
grinned
back
and
there
in
the
center
of
the
High
Table
in
a
large
gold
chair
sat
Albus
Dumbledore
harry
recognized
him
at
once
from
the
card
he'd
gotten
out
of
the
Chocolate
Frog
on
the
train
dumbledore's
silver
hair
was
the
only
thing
in
the
whole
hall
that
shone
as
brightly
as
the
ghosts
harry
spotted
Professor
Quirtell
too
the
nervous
young
man
from
the
Leaky
Cauldron
he
was
looking
very
peculiar
in
a
large
purple
turban
and
now
there
were
only
three
people
left
to
be
sorted
thomas
Dean
a
Black
boy
even
taller
than
Ron
joined
Harry
at
the
Gryffindor
table
turpin
Lisa
became
a
Ravenclaw
and
then
it
was
ron's
turn
he
was
pale
green
by
now
harry
crossed
his
fingers
under
the
table
and
a
second
later
the
hat
had
shouted
gryffindor
harry
clapped
loudly
with
the
rest
as
Ron
collapsed
into
the
chair
next
to
him
well
done
Ron
excellent
said
Percy
Weasley
Pompously
across
Harry
as
Zabini
Blaise
was
made
a
Slytherin
professor
McGonagall
rolled
up
her
scroll
and
took
the
Sorting
Hat
away
harry
looked
down
at
his
empty
gold
plate
he
had
only
just
realized
how
hungry
he
was
the
pumpkin
pasties
seemed
ages
ago
albus
Dumbledore
had
gotten
to
his
feet
he
was
beaming
at
the
students
his
arms
opened
wide
as
if
nothing
could
have
pleased
him
more
than
to
see
them
all
there
welcome
he
said
welcome
to
a
new
year
at
Hogwarts
before
we
begin
our
banquet
I
would
like
to
say
a
few
words
and
here
they
are
Nitwit
blubber
oddment
tweak
thank
you
he
sat
back
down
everybody
clapped
and
cheered
harry
didn't
know
whether
to
laugh
or
not
is
he
a
bit
mad
he
asked
Percy
uncertainly
mad
said
Percy
airily
he's
a
genius
best
wizard
in
the
world
but
he
is
a
bit
mad
yes
potatoes
Harry
harry's
mouth
fell
open
the
dishes
in
front
of
him
were
now
piled
with
food
he
had
never
seen
so
many
things
he
liked
to
eat
on
one
table
roast
beef
roast
chicken
pork
chops
and
lamb
chops
sausages
bacon
and
steak
boiled
potatoes
roast
potatoes
fries
Yorkshire
pudding
peas
carrots
gravy
ketchup
and
for
some
strange
reason
peppermint
humbugs
the
Dursleys
had
never
exactly
starved
Harry
but
he'd
never
been
allowed
to
eat
as
much
as
he
liked
dudley
had
always
taken
anything
that
Harry
really
wanted
even
if
It
made
him
sick
harry
piled
his
plate
with
a
bit
of
everything
except
the
peppermints
and
began
to
eat
it
was
all
delicious
that
does
look
good
said
the
ghost
in
the
ruff
sadly
watching
Harry
cut
up
his
steak
can't
you
i
haven't
eaten
for
nearly
four
hundred
years
said
the
ghost
i
don't
need
to
of
course
but
one
does
miss
it
i
don't
think
i've
in
troduced
myself
sir
Nicholas
de
Mimsy-Porpington
at
your
service
resident
ghost
of
Gryffindor
Tower
i
know
who
you
are
said
Ron
suddenly
my
brothers
told
me
about
you
you're
Nearly
Headless
Nick
i
would
prefer
you
to
call
me
Sir
Nicholas
de
Mimsy
the
ghost
began
stiffly
but
sandy-haired
Seamus
Finnigan
interrupted
nearly
Headless
how
can
you
be
nearly
headless
sir
Nicholas
looked
extremely
miffed
as
if
their
little
chat
wasn't
going
at
all
the
way
he
wanted
like
this
he
said
irritably
he
seized
his
left
ear
and
pulled
his
whole
head
swung
off
his
neck
and
fell
onto
his
shoulder
as
if
it
was
on
a
hinge
someone
had
obviously
tried
to
behead
him
but
not
done
it
properly
looking
pleased
at
the
stunned
looks
on
their
faces
Nearly
Headless
Nick
flipped
his
head
back
onto
his
neck
coughed
and
said
So
new
Gryffindors
i
hope
you're
going
to
help
us
win
the
house
championship
this
year
gryffindors
have
never
gone
so
long
without
winning
slytherins
have
got
the
cup
six
years
in
a
row
the
Bloody
baron's
becoming
almost
unbearable
he's
the
Slytherin
ghost
harry
looked
over
at
the
Slytherin
table
and
saw
a
horrible
ghost
sitting
there
with
blank
staring
eyes
a
gaunt
face
and
robes
stained
with
silver
blood
he
was
right
next
to
Malfoy
who
Harry
was
pleased
to
see
didn't
look
too
pleased
with
the
seating
arrangements
how
did
he
get
covered
in
blood
asked
Seamus
with
great
interest
i've
never
asked
said
Nearly
Headless
Nick
delicately
when
everyone
had
eaten
as
much
as
they
could
the
remains
of
the
food
faded
from
the
plates
leaving
them
sparkling
clean
as
before
a
moment
later
the
desserts
appeared
blocks
of
ice
cream
in
every
flavor
you
could
think
of
apple
pies
treacle
tarts
chocolate
eclairs
and
jam
doughnuts
trifle
strawberries
jell-o
rice
pudding
as
Harry
helped
himself
to
a
treacle
tart
the
talk
turned
to
their
families
i'm
half-and-half
said
Seamus
me
dad's
a
Muggle
mom
didn't
tell
him
she
was
a
witch
til
after
they
were
married
bit
of
a
nasty
shock
for
him
the
others
laughed
what
about
you
Neville
said
Ron
well
my
gran
brought
me
up
and
she's
a
witch
said
Neville
but
the
family
thought
I
was
all
Muggle
for
ages
my
Great
Uncle
Algie
kept
trying
to
catch
me
off
my
guard
and
force
some
magic
out
of
me
he
pushed
me
off
the
end
of
Blackpool
pier
once
I
nearly
drowned
but
nothing
happened
until
I
was
eight
great
Uncle
Algie
came
round
for
dinner
and
he
was
hanging
me
out
of
an
upstairs
window
by
the
ankles
when
my
Great
Auntie
Enid
offered
him
a
meringue
and
he
accidentally
let
go
but
I
bounced
all
the
way
down
the
garden
and
into
the
road
they
were
all
really
pleased
Gran
was
crying
she
was
so
happy
and
you
should
have
seen
their
faces
when
I
got
in
here
they
thought
I
might
not
be
magic
enough
to
come
you
see
great
Uncle
Algie
was
so
pleased
he
bought
me
my
toad
on
harry's
other
side
Percy
Weasley
and
Hermione
were
talking
about
lessons
I
do
hope
they
start
right
away
there's
so
much
to
learn
i'm
particularly
interested
in
Transfiguration
you
know
turning
something
into
something
else
of
course
it's
supposed
to
be
very
difficult
you'll
be
starting
small
just
matches
into
needles
and
that
sort
of
thing
harry
who
was
starting
to
feel
warm
and
sleepy
looked
up
at
the
High
Table
again
hagrid
was
drinking
deeply
from
his
goblet
professor
McGonagall
was
talking
to
Professor
Dumbledore
professor
Quirrell
in
his
absurd
turban
was
talking
to
a
teacher
with
greasy
black
hair
a
hooked
nose
and
sallow
skin
it
happened
very
suddenly
the
hook-nosed
teacher
looked
past
quirrell's
turban
straight
into
harry's
eyes
and
a
sharp
hot
pain
shot
across
the
scar
on
harry's
forehead
ouch
harry
clapped
a
hand
to
his
head
what
is
it
asked
Percy
n-nothing
the
pain
had
gone
as
quickly
as
it
had
come
harder
to
shake
off
was
the
feeling
Harry
had
gotten
from
the
teacher's
look
a
feeling
that
he
didn't
like
Harry
at
all
who's
that
teacher
talking
to
Professor
Quirrell
he
asked
Percy
oh
you
know
Quirrell
already
do
you
no
wonder
he's
looking
so
nervous
that's
Professor
Snape
he
teaches
Potions
but
he
doesn't
want
to
everyone
knows
he's
after
quirrell's
job
knows
an
awful
lot
about
the
Dark
Arts
Snape
harry
watched
Snape
for
a
while
but
Snape
didn't
look
at
him
again
at
last
the
desserts
too
disappeared
and
Professor
Dumbledore
got
to
his
feet
again
the
hall
fell
silent
ahern
just
a
few
more
words
now
that
we
are
all
fed
and
watered
i
have
a
few
start-of-term
notices
to
give
you
first
years
should
note
that
the
forest
on
the
grounds
is
forbidden
to
all
pupils
and
a
few
of
our
older
students
would
do
well
to
remember
that
as
well
dumbledore's
twinkling
eyes
flashed
in
the
direction
of
the
Weasley
twins
i
have
also
been
asked
by
mr.
Filch
the
caretaker
to
remind
you
all
that
no
magic
should
be
used
between
classes
in
the
corridors
quidditch
trials
will
be
held
in
the
second
week
of
the
term
anyone
interested
in
playing
for
their
house
teams
should
contact
Madam
Hooch
and
finally
I
must
tell
you
that
this
year
the
third-floor
corridor
on
the
right-hand
side
is
out
of
bounds
to
everyone
who
does
not
wish
to
die
a
very
painful
death
harry
laughed
but
he
was
one
of
the
few
who
did
he's
not
serious
he
muttered
to
Percy
must
be
said
Percy
frowning
at
Dumbledore
it's
odd
because
he
usually
gives
us
a
reason
why
we're
not
allowed
to
go
somewhere
the
forest's
full
of
dangerous
beasts
everyone
knows
that
i
do
think
he
might
have
told
us
prefects
at
least
and
now
before
we
go
to
bed
let
us
sing
the
school
song
cried
Dumbledore
harry
noticed
that
the
other
teachers
smiles
had
become
rather
fixed
dumbledore
gave
his
wand
a
little
flick
as
if
he
was
trying
to
get
a
fly
off
the
end
and
a
long
golden
ribbon
flew
out
of
it
which
rose
high
above
the
tables
and
twisted
itself
snakelike
into
words
everyone
pick
their
favorite
tune
said
Dumbledore
and
off
we
go
and
the
school
bellowed
Hogwarts
Hogwarts
Hoggy
Warty
Hogwarts
Teach
us
something
please
Whether
we
be
old
and
bald
Or
young
with
scabby
knees
Our
heads
could
do
with
filling
With
some
interesting
stuff
For
now
they're
bare
and
full
of
air
Dead
flies
and
bits
of
fluff
So
teach
us
things
worth
knowing
Bring
back
what
we've
forgot
just
do
your
best
we'll
do
the
rest
And
learn
until
our
brains
all
rot
everybody
finished
the
song
at
different
times
at
last
only
the
Weasley
twins
were
left
singing
along
to
a
very
slow
funeral
march
dumbledore
conducted
their
last
few
lines
with
his
wand
and
when
they
had
finished
he
was
one
of
those
who
clapped
loudest
ah
music
he
said
wiping
his
eyes
a
magic
beyond
all
we
do
here
and
now
bedtime
off
you
trot
the
Gryffindor
first
years
followed
Percy
through
the
chattering
crowds
out
of
the
Great
Hall
and
up
the
marble
staircase
harry's
legs
were
like
lead
again
but
only
because
he
was
so
tired
and
full
of
food
he
was
too
sleepy
even
to
be
surprised
that
the
people
in
the
portraits
along
the
corridors
whispered
and
pointed
as
they
passed
or
that
twice
Percy
led
them
through
doorways
hidden
behind
sliding
panels
and
hanging
tapestries
they
climbed
more
staircases
yawning
and
dragging
their
feet
and
Harry
was
just
wondering
how
much
farther
they
had
to
go
when
they
came
to
a
sudden
halt
a
bundle
of
walking
sticks
was
floating
in
midair
ahead
of
them
and
as
Percy
took
a
step
toward
them
they
started
throwing
themselves
at
him
peeves
Percy
whispered
to
the
first
years
a
poltergeist
he
raised
his
voice
Peeves
show
yourself
a
loud
rude
sound
like
the
air
being
let
out
of
a
balloon
answered
do
you
want
me
to
go
to
the
Bloody
Baron
there
was
a
pop
and
a
little
man
with
wicked
dark
eyes
and
a
wide
mouth
appeared
floating
cross
legged
in
the
air
clutching
the
walking
sticks
oooooooh
he
said
with
an
evil
cackle
ickle
Firsties
what
fun
he
swooped
suddenly
at
them
they
all
ducked
go
away
Peeves
or
the
baron'll
hear
about
this
I
mean
it
barked
Percy
peeves
stuck
out
his
tongue
and
vanished
dropping
the
walking
sticks
on
neville's
head
they
heard
him
zooming
away
rattling
coats
of
armor
as
he
passed
you
want
to
watch
out
for
Peeves
said
Percy
as
they
set
off
again
the
Bloody
baron's
the
only
one
who
can
control
him
he
won't
even
listen
to
us
prefects
here
we
are
at
the
very
end
of
the
corridor
hung
a
portrait
of
a
very
fat
woman
in
a
pink
silk
dress
password
she
said
caput
Draconis
said
Percy
and
the
portrait
swung
forward
to
reveal
a
round
hole
in
the
wall
they
all
scrambled
through
it
Neville
needed
a
leg
up
and
found
themselves
in
the
Gryffindor
common
room
a
cozy
round
room
full
of
squashy
armchairs
percy
directed
the
girls
through
one
door
to
their
dormitory
and
the
boys
through
another
at
the
top
of
a
spiral
staircase
they
were
obviously
in
one
of
the
towers
they
found
their
beds
at
last
five
four-posters
hung
with
deep
red
velvet
curtains
their
trunks
had
already
been
brought
up
too
tired
to
talk
much
they
pulled
on
their
pajamas
and
fell
into
bed
great
food
isn't
it
ron
muttered
to
Harry
through
the
hangings
get
off
Scabbers
he's
chewing
my
sheets
harry
was
going
to
ask
Ron
if
he'd
had
any
of
the
treacle
tart
but
he
fell
asleep
almost
at
once
perhaps
Harry
had
eaten
a
bit
too
much
because
he
had
a
very
strange
dream
he
was
wearing
Professor
quirrell's
turban
which
kept
talking
to
him
telling
him
he
must
transfer
to
Slytherin
at
once
because
it
was
his
destiny
harry
told
the
turban
he
didn't
want
to
be
in
Slytherin
it
got
heavier
and
heavier
he
tried
to
pull
it
off
but
it
tightened
painfully
and
there
was
Malfoy
laughing
at
him
as
he
struggled
with
it
then
Malfoy
turned
into
the
hook-nosed
teacher
Snape
whose
laugh
became
high
and
cold
there
was
a
burst
of
green
light
and
Harry
woke
sweating
and
shaking
he
rolled
over
and
fell
asleep
again
and
when
he
woke
next
day
he
didn't
remember
the
dream
at
all
chapter
eight
the
potions
master
there
look
where
next
to
the
tall
kid
with
the
red
hair
wearing
the
glasses
did
you
see
his
face
did
you
see
his
scar
whispers
followed
Harry
from
the
moment
he
left
his
dormitory
the
next
day
people
lining
up
outside
classrooms
stood
on
tiptoe
to
get
a
look
at
him
or
doubled
back
to
pass
him
in
the
corridors
again
staring
harry
wished
they
wouldn't
because
he
was
trying
to
concentrate
on
finding
his
way
to
classes
there
were
a
hundred
and
forty-two
staircases
at
Hogwarts
wide
sweeping
ones
narrow
rickety
ones
some
that
led
somewhere
different
on
a
Friday
some
with
a
vanishing
step
halfway
up
that
you
had
to
remember
to
jump
then
there
were
doors
that
wouldn't
open
unless
you
asked
politely
or
tickled
them
in
exactly
the
right
place
and
doors
that
weren't
really
doors
at
all
but
solid
walls
just
pretending
it
was
also
very
hard
to
remember
where
anything
was
because
it
all
seemed
to
move
around
a
lot
the
people
in
the
portraits
kept
going
to
visit
each
other
and
Harry
was
sure
the
coats
of
armor
could
walk
the
ghosts
didn't
help
either
it
was
always
a
nasty
shock
when
one
of
them
glided
suddenly
through
a
door
you
were
trying
to
open
nearly
Headless
Nick
was
always
happy
to
point
new
Gryffindors
in
the
right
direction
but
Peeves
the
Poltergeist
was
worth
two
locked
doors
and
a
trick
staircase
if
you
met
him
when
you
were
late
for
class
he
would
drop
wastepaper
baskets
on
your
head
pull
rugs
from
under
your
feet
pelt
you
with
bits
of
chalk
or
sneak
up
behind
you
invisible
grab
your
nose
and
screech
got
your
conk
even
worse
than
Peeves
if
that
was
possible
was
the
caretaker
Argus
Filch
harry
and
Ron
managed
to
get
on
the
wrong
side
of
him
on
their
very
first
morning
filch
found
them
trying
to
force
their
way
through
a
door
that
unluckily
turned
out
to
be
the
entrance
to
the
out-of-bounds
corridor
on
the
third
floor
he
wouldn't
believe
they
were
lost
was
sure
they
were
trying
to
break
into
it
on
purpose
and
was
threatening
to
lock
them
in
the
dungeons
when
they
were
rescued
by
Professor
Quirrell
who
was
passing
filch
owned
a
cat
called
Mrs
norris
a
scrawny
dust-colored
creature
with
bulging
lamp
like
eyes
just
like
filch's
she
patrolled
the
corridors
alone
break
a
rule
in
front
of
her
put
just
one
toe
out
of
line
and
she'd
whisk
off
for
Filch
who'd
appear
wheezing
two
seconds
later
filch
knew
the
secret
passageways
of
the
school
better
than
anyone
except
perhaps
the
Weasley
twins
and
could
pop
up
as
suddenly
as
any
of
the
ghosts
the
students
all
hated
him
and
it
was
the
dearest
ambition
of
many
to
give
Mrs
norris
a
good
kick
and
then
once
you
had
managed
to
find
them
there
were
the
classes
themselves
there
was
a
lot
more
to
magic
as
Harry
quickly
found
out
than
waving
your
wand
and
saying
a
few
funny
words
they
had
to
study
the
night
skies
through
their
telescopes
every
Wednesday
at
midnight
and
learn
the
names
of
different
stars
and
the
movements
of
the
planets
three
times
a
week
they
went
out
to
the
greenhouses
behind
the
castle
to
study
Herbology
with
a
dumpy
little
witch
called
Professor
Sprout
where
they
learned
how
to
take
care
of
all
the
strange
plants
and
fungi
and
found
out
what
they
were
used
for
easily
the
most
boring
class
was
History
of
Magic
which
was
the
only
one
taught
by
a
ghost
professor
Binns
had
been
very
old
indeed
when
he
had
fallen
asleep
in
front
of
the
staff
room
fire
and
got
up
next
morning
to
teach
leaving
his
body
behind
him
binns
droned
on
and
on
while
they
scribbled
down
names
and
dates
and
got
Emetic
the
Evil
and
Uric
the
Oddball
mixed
up
professor
Flitwick
the
Charms
teacher
was
a
tiny
little
wizard
who
had
to
stand
on
a
pile
of
books
to
see
over
his
desk
at
the
start
of
their
first
class
he
took
the
roll
call
and
when
he
reached
harry's
name
he
gave
an
excited
squeak
and
toppled
out
of
sight
professor
McGonagall
was
again
different
harry
had
been
quite
right
to
think
she
wasn't
a
teacher
to
cross
strict
and
clever
she
gave
them
a
talking-to
the
moment
they
sat
down
in
her
first
class
transfiguration
is
some
of
the
most
complex
and
dangerous
magic
you
will
learn
at
Hogwarts
she
said
anyone
messing
around
in
my
class
will
leave
and
not
come
back
you
have
been
warned
then
she
changed
her
desk
into
a
pig
and
back
again
they
were
all
very
impressed
and
couldn't
wait
to
get
started
but
soon
realized
they
weren't
going
to
be
changing
the
furniture
into
animals
for
a
long
time
after
taking
a
lot
of
complicated
notes
they
were
each
given
a
match
and
started
trying
to
turn
it
into
a
needle
by
the
end
of
the
lesson
only
Hermione
Granger
had
made
any
difference
to
her
match
Professor
McGonagall
showed
the
class
how
it
had
gone
all
silver
and
pointy
and
gave
Hermione
a
rare
smile
the
class
everyone
had
really
been
looking
forward
to
was
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
but
quirrell's
lessons
turned
out
to
be
a
bit
of
a
joke
his
classroom
smelled
strongly
of
garlic
which
everyone
said
was
to
ward
off
a
vampire
he'd
met
in
Romania
and
was
afraid
would
be
coming
back
to
get
him
one
of
these
days
his
turban
he
told
them
had
been
given
to
him
by
an
African
prince
as
a
thank-you
for
getting
rid
of
a
troublesome
zombie
but
they
weren't
sure
they
believed
this
story
for
one
thing
when
Seamus
Finnigan
asked
eagerly
to
hear
how
Quirrell
had
fought
off
the
zombie
Quirrell
went
pink
and
started
talking
about
the
weather
for
another
they
had
noticed
that
a
funny
smell
hung
around
the
turban
and
the
Weasley
twins
insisted
that
it
was
stuffed
full
of
garlic
as
well
so
that
Quirrell
was
protected
wherever
he
went
harry
was
very
relieved
to
find
out
that
he
wasn't
miles
behind
everyone
else
lots
of
people
had
come
from
Muggle
families
and
like
him
hadn't
had
any
idea
that
they
were
witches
and
wizards
there
was
so
much
to
learn
that
even
people
like
Ron
didn't
have
much
of
a
head
start
friday
was
an
important
day
for
Harry
and
Ron
they
finally
managed
to
find
their
way
down
to
the
Great
Hall
for
breakfast
without
getting
lost
once
what
have
we
got
today
harry
asked
Ron
as
he
poured
sugar
on
his
porridge
double
Potions
with
the
Slytherins
said
Ron
snape's
Head
of
Slytherin
House
they
say
he
always
favors
them
we'll
be
able
to
see
if
it's
true
wish
McGonagall
favored
us
said
Harry
professor
McGonagall
was
head
of
Gryffindor
House
but
it
hadn't
stopped
her
from
giving
them
a
huge
pile
of
homework
the
day
before
just
then
the
mail
arrived
harry
had
gotten
used
to
this
by
now
but
it
had
given
him
a
bit
of
a
shock
on
the
first
morning
when
about
a
hundred
owls
had
suddenly
streamed
into
the
Great
Hall
during
breakfast
circling
the
tables
until
they
saw
their
owners
and
dropping
letters
and
packages
onto
their
laps
hedwig
hadn't
brought
Harry
anything
so
far
she
sometimes
flew
in
to
nibble
his
ear
and
have
a
bit
of
toast
before
going
off
to
sleep
in
the
owlery
with
the
other
school
owls
this
morning
however
she
fluttered
down
between
the
marmalade
and
the
sugar
bowl
and
dropped
a
note
onto
harry's
plate
harry
tore
it
open
at
once
it
said
in
a
very
untidy
scrawl
Dear
Harry
I
know
you
get
Friday
afternoons
off
so
would
you
like
to
come
and
have
a
cup
of
tea
with
me
around
three
i
want
to
hear
all
about
your
first
week
send
us
an
answer
back
with
Hedwig
hagrid
Harry
borrowed
ron's
quill
scribbled
Yes
please
see
you
later
on
the
back
of
the
note
and
sent
Hedwig
off
again
it
was
lucky
that
Harry
had
tea
with
Hagrid
to
look
forward
to
because
the
Potions
lesson
turned
out
to
be
the
worst
thing
that
had
happened
to
him
so
far
at
the
start-of-term
banquet
Harry
had
gotten
the
idea
that
Professor
Snape
disliked
him
by
the
end
of
the
first
Potions
lesson
he
knew
he'd
been
wrong
snape
didn't
dislike
Harry
he
hated
him
potions
lessons
took
place
down
in
one
of
the
dungeons
it
was
colder
here
than
up
in
the
main
castle
and
would
have
been
quite
creepy
enough
without
the
pickled
animals
floating
in
glass
jars
all
around
the
walls
snape
like
Flitwick
started
the
class
by
taking
the
roll
call
and
like
Flitwick
he
paused
at
harry's
name
ah
Yes
he
said
softly
Harry
Potter
our
new
celebrity
draco
Malfoy
and
his
friends
Crabbe
and
Goyle
sniggered
behind
their
hands
snape
finished
calling
the
names
and
looked
up
at
the
class
his
eyes
were
black
like
hagrid's
but
they
had
none
of
hagrid's
warmth
they
were
cold
and
empty
and
made
you
think
of
dark
tunnels
you
are
here
to
learn
the
subtle
science
and
exact
art
of
potionmaking
he
began
he
spoke
in
barely
more
than
a
whisper
but
they
caught
every
word
like
Professor
McGonagall
Snape
had
y
caught
every
word
like
Professor
McGonagall
Snape
had
the
gift
of
keeping
a
class
silent
without
effort
as
there
is
little
foolish
wand-waving
here
many
of
you
will
hardly
believe
this
is
magic
i
don't
expect
you
will
really
understand
the
beauty
of
the
softly
simmering
cauldron
with
its
shimmering
fumes
the
delicate
power
of
liquids
that
creep
through
human
veins
bewitching
the
mind
ensnaring
the
senses
i
can
teach
you
how
to
bottle
fame
brew
glory
even
stopper
death
if
you
aren't
as
big
a
bunch
of
dunderheads
as
I
usually
have
to
teach
more
silence
followed
this
little
speech
harry
and
Ron
exchanged
looks
with
raised
eyebrows
hermione
Granger
was
on
the
edge
of
her
seat
and
looked
desperate
to
start
proving
that
she
wasn't
a
dunderhead
potter
said
Snape
suddenly
what
would
I
get
if
I
added
powdered
root
of
asphodel
to
an
infusion
of
wormwood
powdered
root
of
what
to
an
infusion
of
what
harry
glanced
at
Ron
who
looked
as
stumped
as
he
was
hermione's
hand
had
shot
into
the
air
i
don't
know
sit
said
Harry
snape's
lips
curled
into
a
sneer
tut
tut
fame
clearly
isn't
everything
he
ignored
hermione's
hand
let's
try
again
potter
where
would
you
look
if
I
told
you
to
find
me
a
bezoar
hermione
stretched
her
hand
as
high
into
the
air
as
it
would
go
without
her
leaving
her
seat
but
Harry
didn't
have
the
faintest
idea
what
a
bezoar
was
he
tried
not
to
look
at
Malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
who
were
shaking
with
laughter
i
don't
know
sit
thought
you
wouldn't
open
a
book
before
coming
eh
Potter
harry
forced
himself
to
keep
looking
straight
into
those
cold
eyes
he
had
looked
through
his
books
at
the
Dursleys
but
did
Snape
expect
him
to
remember
everything
in
One
Thousand
Magical
Herbs
and
Fungi
snape
was
still
ignoring
hermione's
quivering
hand
what
is
the
difference
Potter
between
monkshood
and
wolfsbane
at
this
Hermione
stood
up
her
hand
stretching
toward
the
dungeon
ceiling
i
don't
know
said
Harry
quietly
i
think
Hermione
does
though
why
don't
you
try
her
a
few
people
laughed
Harry
caught
seamus's
eye
and
Seamus
winked
snape
however
was
not
pleased
sit
down
he
snapped
at
Hermione
for
your
information
Potter
asphodel
and
wormwood
make
a
sleeping
potion
so
powerful
it
is
known
as
the
Draught
of
Living
Death
a
bezoar
is
a
stone
taken
from
the
stomach
of
a
goat
and
it
will
save
you
from
most
poisons
as
for
monkshood
and
wolfsbane
they
are
the
same
plant
which
also
goes
by
the
name
of
aconite
well
why
aren't
you
all
copying
that
down
there
was
a
sudden
rummaging
for
quills
and
parchment
over
the
noise
Snape
said
And
a
point
will
be
taken
from
Gryffindor
House
for
your
cheek
Potter
things
didn't
improve
for
the
Gryffindors
as
the
Potions
lesson
continued
snape
put
them
all
into
pairs
and
set
them
to
mixing
up
a
simple
potion
to
cure
boils
he
swept
around
in
his
long
black
cloak
watching
them
weigh
dried
nettles
and
crush
snake
fangs
criticizing
almost
everyone
except
Malfoy
whom
he
seemed
to
like
he
was
just
telling
everyone
to
look
at
the
perfect
way
Malfoy
had
stewed
his
horned
slugs
when
clouds
of
acid
green
smoke
and
a
loud
hissing
filled
the
dungeon
neville
had
somehow
managed
to
melt
seamus's
cauldron
into
a
twisted
blob
and
their
potion
was
seeping
across
the
stone
floor
burning
holes
in
people's
shoes
within
seconds
the
whole
class
was
standing
on
their
stools
while
Neville
who
had
been
drenched
in
the
potion
when
the
cauldron
collapsed
moaned
in
pain
as
angry
red
boils
sprang
up
all
over
his
arms
and
legs
idiot
boy
snarled
Snape
clearing
the
spilled
potion
away
with
one
wave
of
his
wand
i
suppose
you
added
the
porcupine
quills
before
taking
the
cauldron
off
the
fire
neville
whimpered
as
boils
started
to
pop
up
all
over
his
nose
take
him
up
to
the
hospital
wing
Snape
spat
at
Seamus
then
he
rounded
on
Harry
and
Ron
who
had
been
working
next
to
Neville
you
Potter
why
didn't
you
tell
him
not
to
add
the
quills
thought
he'd
make
you
look
good
if
he
got
it
wrong
did
you
that's
another
point
you've
lost
for
Gryffindor
this
was
so
unfair
that
Harry
opened
his
mouth
to
argue
but
Ron
kicked
him
behind
their
cauldron
doi
push
it
he
muttered
i've
heard
Snape
can
turn
very
nasty
as
they
climbed
the
steps
out
of
the
dungeon
an
hour
later
harry's
mind
was
racing
and
his
spirits
were
low
he'd
lost
two
points
for
Gryffindor
in
his
very
first
week
why
did
Snape
hate
him
so
much
cheer
up
said
Ron
snape's
always
taking
points
off
Fred
and
George
can
I
come
and
meet
Hagrid
with
you
at
five
to
three
they
left
the
castle
and
made
their
way
across
the
grounds
hagrid
lived
in
a
small
wooden
house
on
the
edge
of
the
forbidden
forest
a
crossbow
and
a
pair
of
galoshes
were
outside
the
front
door
when
Harry
knocked
they
heard
a
frantic
scrabbling
from
inside
and
several
booming
barks
then
hagrid's
voice
rang
out
saying
Back
Fang
back
hagrid's
big
hairy
face
appeared
in
the
crack
as
he
pulled
the
door
open
hang
on
he
said
back
Fang
he
let
them
in
struggling
to
keep
a
hold
on
the
collar
of
an
enormous
black
boarhound
there
was
only
one
room
inside
hams
and
pheasants
were
hanging
from
the
ceiling
a
copper
kettle
was
boiling
on
the
open
fire
and
in
the
corner
stood
a
massive
bed
with
a
patchwork
quilt
over
it
make
yerselves
at
home
said
Hagrid
letting
go
of
Fang
who
bounded
straight
at
Ron
and
started
licking
his
ears
like
Hagrid
Fang
was
clearly
not
as
fierce
as
he
looked
this
is
Ron
Harry
told
Hagrid
who
was
pouring
boiling
water
into
a
large
teapot
and
putting
rock
cakes
onto
a
plate
another
Weasley
eh
said
Hagrid
glancing
at
ron's
freckles
i
spent
half
me
life
chasin
yer
twin
brothers
away
from
the
forest
the
rock
cakes
were
shapeless
lumps
with
raisins
that
almost
broke
their
teeth
but
Harry
and
Ron
pretended
to
be
enjoying
them
as
they
told
Hagrid
all
about
their
first
lessons
fang
rested
his
head
on
harry's
knee
and
drooled
all
over
his
robes
harry
and
Ron
were
delighted
to
hear
Hagrid
call
Fitch
that
old
git
an
as
fer
that
cat
Mrs
norris
i'd
like
ter
introduce
her
to
Fang
sometime
d'yeh
know
every
time
I
go
up
ter
the
school
she
follows
me
everywhere
can't
get
rid
of
her
Fitch
puts
her
up
to
it
harry
told
Hagrid
about
snape's
lesson
hagrid
like
Ron
told
Harry
not
to
worry
about
it
that
Snape
liked
hardly
any
of
the
students
but
he
seemed
to
really
hate
me
rubbish
said
Hagrid
why
should
he
yet
Harry
couldn't
help
thinking
that
Hagrid
didn't
quite
meet
his
eyes
when
he
said
that
how's
yer
brother
Charlie
hagrid
asked
Ron
i
liked
him
a
lot
great
with
animals
harry
wondered
if
Hagrid
had
changed
the
subject
on
purpose
while
Ron
told
Hagrid
all
about
charlie's
work
with
dragons
Harry
picked
up
a
piece
of
paper
that
was
lying
on
the
table
under
the
tea
cozy
it
was
a
cutting
from
the
Daily
Prophet
gringotts
break-in
latest
Investigations
continue
into
the
break-in
at
Gringotts
on
July
widely
believed
to
be
the
work
of
Dark
wizards
or
witches
unknown
gringotts
goblins
today
insisted
that
nothing
had
been
taken
the
vault
that
was
searched
had
in
fact
been
emptied
the
same
day
but
we're
not
telling
you
what
was
in
there
so
keep
your
noses
out
if
you
know
what's
good
for
you
said
a
Gringotts
spokesgoblin
this
afternoon
harry
remembered
Ron
telling
him
on
the
train
that
someone
had
tried
to
rob
Gringotts
but
Ron
hadn't
mentioned
the
date
hagrid
said
Harry
that
Gringotts
break-in
happened
on
my
birthday
it
might've
been
happening
while
we
were
there
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
Hagrid
definitely
didn't
meet
harry's
eyes
this
time
he
grunted
and
offered
him
another
rock
cake
harry
read
the
story
again
the
vault
that
was
searched
had
in
fact
been
emptied
earlier
that
same
day
hagrid
had
emptied
vault
seven
hundred
and
thirteen
if
you
could
call
it
emptying
taking
out
that
grubby
little
package
had
that
been
what
the
thieves
were
looking
for
as
Harry
and
Ron
walked
back
to
the
castle
for
dinner
their
pockets
weighed
down
with
rock
cakes
they'd
been
too
polite
to
refuse
Harry
thought
that
none
of
the
lessons
he'd
had
so
far
had
given
him
as
much
to
think
about
as
tea
with
Hagrid
had
Hagrid
collected
that
package
just
in
time
where
was
it
now
and
did
Hagrid
know
something
about
Snape
that
he
didn't
want
to
tell
Harry
chapter
nine
the
midnight
duel
harry
had
never
believed
he
would
meet
a
boy
he
hated
more
than
Dudley
but
that
was
before
he
met
Draco
Malfoy
still
first-year
Gryffindors
only
had
Potions
with
the
Slytherins
so
they
didn't
have
to
put
up
with
Malfoy
much
or
at
least
they
didn't
until
they
spotted
a
notice
pinned
up
in
the
Gryffindor
common
room
that
made
them
all
groan
flying
lessons
would
be
starting
on
Thursday
and
Gryffindor
and
Slytherin
would
be
learning
together
typical
said
Harry
darkly
just
what
I
always
wanted
to
make
a
fool
of
myself
on
a
broomstick
in
front
of
Malfoy
he
had
been
looking
forward
to
learning
to
fly
more
than
anything
else
you
don't
know
that
you'll
make
a
fool
of
yourself
said
Ron
reasonably
anyway
I
know
malfoy's
always
going
on
about
how
good
he
is
at
Quidditch
but
I
bet
that's
all
talk
malfay
certainly
did
talk
about
flying
a
lot
he
complained
loudly
about
first
years
never
getting
on
the
house
Quidditch
teams
and
told
long
boastful
stories
that
always
seemed
to
end
with
him
narrowly
escaping
Muggles
in
helicopters
he
wasn't
the
only
one
though
the
way
Seamus
Finnigan
told
it
he'd
spent
most
of
his
childhood
zooming
around
the
countryside
on
his
broomstick
even
Ron
would
tell
anyone
who'd
listen
about
the
time
he'd
almost
hit
a
hang
glider
on
charlie's
old
broom
everyone
from
wizarding
families
talked
about
Quidditch
constantly
ron
had
already
had
a
big
argument
with
Dean
Thomas
who
shared
their
dormitory
about
soccer
ron
couldn't
see
what
was
exciting
about
a
game
with
only
one
ball
where
no
one
was
allowed
to
fly
harry
had
caught
Ron
prodding
dean's
poster
of
West
Ham
soccer
team
trying
to
make
the
players
move
neville
had
never
been
on
a
broomstick
in
his
life
because
his
grandmother
had
never
let
him
near
one
privately
Harry
felt
she'd
had
good
reason
because
Neville
managed
to
have
an
extraordinary
number
of
accidents
even
with
both
feet
on
the
ground
hermione
Granger
was
almost
as
nervous
about
flying
as
Neville
was
this
was
something
you
couldn't
learn
by
heart
out
of
a
book
not
that
she
hadn't
tried
at
breakfast
on
Thursday
she
bored
them
all
stupid
with
flying
tips
she'd
gotten
out
of
a
library
book
called
Quidditch
Through
the
Ages
neville
was
hanging
on
to
her
every
word
desperate
for
anything
that
might
help
him
hang
on
to
his
broomstick
later
but
everybody
else
was
very
pleased
when
hermione's
lecture
was
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
the
mail
harry
hadn't
had
a
single
letter
since
hagrid's
note
something
that
Malfoy
had
been
quick
to
notice
of
course
malfoy's
eagle
owl
was
always
bringing
him
packages
of
sweets
from
home
which
he
opened
gloatingly
at
the
Slytherin
table
a
barn
owl
brought
Neville
a
small
package
from
his
grandmother
he
opened
it
excitedly
and
showed
them
a
glass
ball
the
size
of
a
large
marble
which
seemed
to
be
full
of
white
smoke
it's
a
Remembrall
he
explained
gran
knows
I
forget
things
this
tells
you
if
there's
something
you've
forgotten
to
do
look
you
hold
it
tight
like
this
and
if
it
turns
red
oh
his
face
fell
because
the
Remembrall
had
suddenly
glowed
scarlet
you've
forgotten
something
neville
was
trying
to
remember
what
he'd
forgotten
when
Draco
Malfoy
who
was
passing
the
Gryffindor
table
snatched
the
Remembrall
out
of
his
hand
harry
and
Ron
jumped
to
their
feet
they
were
half
hoping
for
a
reason
to
fight
Malfay
but
Professor
McGonagall
who
could
spot
trouble
quicker
than
any
teacher
in
the
school
was
there
in
a
flash
what's
going
on
malfoy's
got
my
Remembrall
Professor
scowling
Malfoy
quickly
dropped
the
Remembrall
back
on
the
table
just
looking
he
said
and
he
sloped
away
with
Crabbe
and
Goyle
behind
him
at
three-thirty
that
afternoon
Harry
Ron
and
the
other
Gryffindors
hurried
down
the
front
steps
onto
the
grounds
for
their
first
flying
lesson
it
was
a
clear
breezy
day
and
the
grass
rippled
under
their
feet
as
they
marched
down
the
sloping
lawns
toward
a
smooth
flat
lawn
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
grounds
to
the
forbidden
forest
whose
trees
were
swaying
darkly
in
the
distance
the
Slytherins
were
already
there
and
so
were
twenty
broomsticks
lying
in
neat
lines
on
the
ground
harry
had
heard
Fred
and
George
Weasley
complain
about
the
school
brooms
saying
that
some
of
them
started
to
vibrate
if
you
flew
too
high
or
always
flew
slightly
to
the
left
their
teacher
Madam
Hooch
arrived
she
had
short
gray
hair
and
yellow
eyes
like
a
hawk
well
what
are
you
all
waiting
for
she
barked
everyone
stand
by
a
broomstick
come
on
hurry
up
harry
glanced
down
at
his
broom
it
was
old
and
some
of
the
twigs
stuck
out
at
odd
angles
stick
out
your
right
hand
over
your
broom
called
Madam
Hooch
at
the
front
and
say
Up
upf
everyone
shouted
harry's
broom
jumped
into
his
hand
at
once
but
it
was
one
of
the
few
that
did
hermione
granger's
had
simply
rolled
over
on
the
ground
and
neville's
hadn't
moved
at
all
perhaps
brooms
like
horses
could
tell
when
you
were
afraid
thought
Harry
there
was
a
quaver
in
neville's
voice
that
said
only
too
clearly
that
he
wanted
to
keep
his
feet
on
the
ground
madam
Hooch
then
showed
them
how
to
mount
their
brooms
without
sliding
off
the
end
and
walked
up
and
down
the
rows
correcting
their
grips
harry
and
Ron
were
delighted
when
she
told
Malfoy
he'd
been
doing
it
wrong
for
years
now
when
I
blow
my
whistle
you
kick
off
from
the
ground
hard
said
Madam
Hooch
keep
your
brooms
steady
rise
a
few
feet
and
then
come
straight
back
down
by
leaning
forward
slightly
on
my
whistle
three
two
but
Neville
nervous
and
jumpy
and
frightened
of
being
left
on
the
ground
pushed
off
hard
before
the
whistle
had
touched
Madam
hooch's
lips
come
back
boy
she
shouted
but
Neville
was
rising
straight
up
like
a
cork
shot
out
of
a
bottle
twelve
feet
twenty
feet
harry
saw
his
scared
white
face
look
down
at
the
ground
falling
away
saw
him
gasp
slip
sideways
off
the
broom
and
wham
a
thud
and
a
nasty
crack
and
Neville
lay
facedown
on
the
grass
in
a
heap
his
broomstick
was
still
rising
higher
and
higher
and
started
to
drift
lazily
toward
the
forbidden
forest
and
out
of
sight
madam
Hooch
was
bending
over
Neville
her
face
as
white
as
his
broken
wrist
Harry
heard
her
mutter
come
on
boy
it's
all
right
up
you
get
she
turned
to
the
rest
of
the
class
none
of
you
is
to
move
while
I
take
this
boy
to
the
hospital
wing
you
leave
those
brooms
where
they
are
or
you'll
be
out
of
Hogwarts
before
you
can
say
Quidditch
come
on
dear
neville
his
face
tear-streaked
clutching
his
wrist
hobbled
off
with
Madam
Hooch
who
had
her
arm
around
him
no
sooner
were
they
out
of
earshot
than
Malfoy
burst
into
laughter
did
you
see
his
face
the
great
lump
the
other
Slytherins
joined
in
shut
up
Malfoy
snapped
Parvati
Patil
ooh
sticking
up
for
Longbottom
said
Pansy
Parkinson
a
hard-faced
Slytherin
girl
never
thought
you'd
like
fat
little
crybabies
Parvati
look
said
Malfoy
darting
forward
and
snatching
something
out
of
the
grass
it's
that
stupid
thing
longbottom's
gran
sent
him
the
Remembrall
glittered
in
the
sun
as
he
held
it
up
give
that
here
Malfoy
said
Harry
quietly
everyone
stopped
talking
to
watch
malfoy
smiled
nastily
i
think
i'll
leave
it
somewhere
for
Longbottom
to
find
how
about
up
a
tree
give
it
here
harry
yelled
but
Malfoy
had
leapt
onto
his
broomstick
and
taken
off
he
hadn't
been
lying
he
could
fly
well
hovering
level
with
the
topmost
branches
of
an
oak
he
called
Come
and
get
it
Potter
harry
grabbed
his
broom
no
shouted
Hermione
Granger
madam
Hooch
told
us
not
to
move
you'll
get
us
all
into
trouble
harry
ignored
her
blood
was
pounding
in
his
ears
he
mounted
the
broom
and
kicked
hard
against
the
ground
and
up
up
he
soared
air
rushed
through
his
hair
and
his
robes
whipped
out
behind
him
and
in
a
rush
of
fierce
joy
he
realized
he'd
found
something
he
could
do
without
being
taught
this
was
easy
this
was
wonderful
he
pulled
his
broomstick
up
a
little
to
take
it
even
higher
and
heard
screams
and
gasps
of
girls
back
on
the
ground
and
an
admiring
whoop
from
Ron
he
turned
his
broomstick
sharply
to
face
Malfoy
in
midair
malfoy
looked
stunned
give
it
here
Harry
called
or
i'll
knock
you
off
that
broom
oh
yeah
said
Malfoy
trying
to
sneer
but
looking
worried
harry
knew
somehow
what
to
do
he
leaned
forward
and
grasped
the
broom
tightly
in
both
hands
and
it
shot
toward
Malfay
like
a
javelin
malfoy
only
just
got
out
of
the
way
in
time
Harry
made
a
sharp
about-face
and
held
the
broom
steady
a
few
people
below
were
clapping
no
Crabbe
and
Goyle
up
here
to
save
your
neck
Malfoy
Harry
called
the
same
thought
seemed
to
have
struck
Malfoy
catch
it
if
you
can
then
he
shouted
and
he
threw
the
glass
ball
high
into
the
air
and
streaked
back
toward
the
ground
harry
saw
as
though
in
slow
motion
the
ball
rise
up
in
the
air
and
then
start
to
fall
he
leaned
forward
and
pointed
his
broom
handle
down
next
second
he
was
gathering
speed
in
a
steep
dive
racing
the
ball
wind
whistled
in
his
ears
mingled
with
the
screams
of
people
watching
he
stretched
out
his
hand
a
foot
from
the
ground
he
caught
it
just
in
time
to
pull
his
broom
straight
and
he
toppled
gently
onto
the
grass
with
the
Remembrall
clutched
safely
in
his
fist
harry
potter
his
heart
sank
faster
than
he'd
just
dived
professor
McGonagall
was
running
toward
them
he
got
to
his
feet
trembling
never
in
all
my
time
at
Hogwarts
professor
McGonagall
was
almost
speechless
with
shock
and
her
glasses
flashed
furiously
how
dare
you
might
have
broken
your
neck
it
wasn't
his
fault
Professor
be
quiet
Miss
Patil
But
Malfoy
that's
enough
mr.
Weasley
potter
follow
me
now
harry
caught
sight
of
Malfoy
Crabbe
and
goyle's
triumphant
faces
as
he
left
walking
numbly
in
Professor
mcgonagall's
wake
as
she
strode
toward
the
castle
he
was
going
to
be
expelled
he
just
knew
it
he
wanted
to
say
something
to
defend
himself
but
there
seemed
to
be
something
wrong
with
his
voice
professor
McGonagall
was
sweeping
along
without
even
looking
at
him
he
had
to
jog
to
keep
up
now
he'd
done
it
he
hadn't
even
lasted
two
weeks
he'd
be
packing
his
bags
in
ten
minutes
what
would
the
Dursleys
say
when
he
turned
up
on
the
doorstep
up
the
front
steps
up
the
marble
staircase
inside
and
still
Professor
McGonagall
didn't
say
a
word
to
him
she
wrenched
open
doors
and
marched
along
corridors
with
Harry
trotting
miserably
behind
her
maybe
she
was
taking
him
to
Dumbledore
he
thought
of
Hagrid
expelled
but
allowed
to
stay
on
as
gamekeeper
perhaps
he
could
be
hagrid's
assistant
his
stomach
twisted
as
he
imagined
it
watching
Ron
and
the
others
becoming
wizards
while
he
stumped
around
the
grounds
carrying
hagrid's
bag
professor
McGonagall
stopped
outside
a
classroom
she
opened
the
door
and
poked
her
head
inside
excuse
me
Professor
Flitwick
could
I
borrow
Wood
for
a
moment
wood
thought
Harry
bewildered
was
Wood
a
cane
she
was
going
to
use
on
him
but
Wood
turned
out
to
be
a
person
a
burly
fifth-year
boy
who
came
out
of
Flitwicles
class
looking
confused
follow
me
you
two
said
Professor
McGonagall
and
they
marched
on
up
the
corridor
Wood
looking
curiously
at
Harry
in
here
professor
McGonagall
pointed
them
into
a
classroom
that
was
empty
except
for
Peeves
who
was
busy
writing
rude
words
on
the
blackboard
out
Peeves
she
barked
peeves
threw
the
chalk
into
a
bin
which
clanged
loudly
and
he
swooped
out
cursing
professor
McGonagall
slammed
the
door
behind
him
and
turned
to
face
the
two
boys
potter
this
is
Oliver
Wood
wood
i've
found
you
a
Seeker
wood's
expression
changed
from
puzzlement
to
delight
are
you
serious
Professor
absolutely
said
Professor
McGonagall
crisply
the
boy's
a
natural
i've
never
seen
anything
like
it
was
that
your
first
time
on
a
broomstick
Potter
harry
nodded
silently
he
didn't
have
a
clue
what
was
going
on
but
he
didn't
seem
to
be
being
expelled
and
some
of
the
feeling
started
coming
back
to
his
legs
he
caught
that
thing
in
his
hand
after
a
fifty-foot
dive
Professor
McGonagall
told
Wood
didn't
even
scratch
himself
charlie
Weasley
couldn't
have
done
it
wood
was
now
looking
as
though
all
his
dreams
had
come
true
at
once
ever
seen
a
game
of
Quidditch
Potter
he
asked
excitedly
wood's
captain
of
the
Gryffindor
team
Professor
McGonagall
explained
he's
just
the
build
for
a
Seeker
too
said
Wood
now
walking
around
Harry
and
staring
at
him
light
speedy
we'll
have
to
get
him
a
decent
broom
Professor
a
Nimbus
Two
Thousand
or
a
Cleansweep
Seven
i'd
say
i
shall
speak
to
Professor
Dumbledore
and
see
if
we
can't
bend
the
first-year
rule
heaven
knows
we
need
a
better
team
than
last
year
flattened
in
that
last
match
by
Slytherin
I
couldn't
look
Severus
Snape
in
the
face
for
weeks
professor
McGonagall
peered
sternly
over
her
glasses
at
Harry
i
want
to
hear
you're
training
hard
Potter
or
I
may
change
my
mind
about
punishing
you
then
she
suddenly
smiled
your
father
would
have
been
proud
she
said
he
was
an
excellent
Quidditch
player
himself
you're
joking
it
was
dinnertime
harry
had
just
finished
telling
Ron
what
had
happened
when
he'd
left
the
grounds
with
Professor
McGonagall
ron
had
a
piece
of
steak
and
kidney
pie
halfway
to
his
mouth
but
he'd
forgotten
all
about
it
seeker
he
said
but
first
years
never
you
must
be
the
youngest
house
player
in
about
a
century
said
Harry
shoveling
pie
into
his
mouth
he
felt
particularly
hungry
after
the
excitement
of
the
afternoon
wood
told
me
ron
was
so
amazed
so
impressed
he
just
sat
and
gaped
at
Harry
i
start
training
next
week
said
Harry
only
don't
tell
anyone
Wood
wants
to
keep
it
a
secret
fred
and
George
Weasley
now
came
into
the
hall
spotted
Harry
and
hurried
over
well
done
said
George
in
a
low
voice
wood
told
us
we're
on
the
team
too
Beaters
i
tell
you
we're
going
to
win
that
Quidditch
cup
for
sure
this
year
said
Fred
we
haven't
won
since
Charlie
left
but
this
year's
team
is
going
to
be
brilliant
you
must
be
good
Harry
Wood
was
almost
skipping
when
he
told
us
anyway
we've
got
to
go
Lee
Jordan
reckons
he's
found
a
new
secret
passageway
out
of
the
school
bet
it's
that
one
behind
the
statue
of
Gregory
the
Smarmy
that
we
found
in
our
first
week
see
you
fred
and
George
had
hardly
disappeared
when
someone
far
less
welcome
turned
up
Malfoy
flanked
by
Crabbe
and
Goyle
having
a
last
meal
Potter
when
are
you
getting
the
train
back
to
the
Muggles
you're
a
lot
braver
now
that
you're
back
on
the
ground
and
you've
got
your
little
friends
with
you
said
Harry
coolly
there
was
of
course
nothing
at
all
little
about
Crabbe
and
Goyle
but
as
the
High
Table
was
full
of
teachers
neither
of
them
could
do
more
than
crack
their
knuckles
and
scowl
i'd
take
you
on
anytime
on
my
own
said
Malfoy
tonight
if
you
want
wizard's
duel
wands
only
no
contact
what's
the
matter
never
heard
of
a
wizard's
duel
before
I
suppose
of
course
he
has
said
Ron
wheeling
around
i'm
his
second
who's
yours
malfoy
looked
at
Crabbe
and
Goyle
sizing
them
up
crabbe
he
said
midnight
all
right
we'll
meet
you
in
the
trophy
room
that's
always
unlocked
when
Malfoy
had
gone
Ron
and
Harry
looked
at
each
other
what
is
a
wizard's
duel
said
Harry
and
what
do
you
mean
you're
my
second
well
a
second's
there
to
take
over
if
you
die
said
Ron
casually
getting
started
at
last
on
his
cold
pie
catching
the
look
on
harry's
face
he
added
quickly
But
people
only
die
in
proper
duels
you
know
with
real
wizards
the
most
you
and
malfoy'll
be
able
to
do
is
send
sparks
at
each
other
neither
of
you
knows
enough
magic
to
do
any
real
damage
i
bet
he
expected
you
to
refuse
anyway
and
what
if
I
wave
my
wand
and
nothing
happens
throw
it
away
and
punch
him
on
the
nose
Ron
suggested
excuse
me
they
both
looked
up
it
was
Hermione
Granger
can't
a
person
eat
in
peace
in
this
place
said
Ron
hermione
ignored
him
and
spoke
to
Harry
i
couldn't
help
overhearing
what
you
and
Malfoy
were
saying
bet
you
could
Ron
muttered
and
you
mustn't
go
wandering
around
the
school
at
night
think
of
the
points
you'll
lose
Gryffindor
if
you're
caught
and
you're
bound
to
be
it's
really
very
selfish
of
you
and
it's
really
none
of
your
business
said
Harry
good-bye
said
Ron
all
the
same
it
wasn't
what
you'd
call
the
perfect
end
to
the
day
Harry
thought
as
he
lay
awake
much
later
listening
to
Dean
and
Seamus
falling
asleep
Neville
wasn't
back
from
the
hospital
wing
ron
had
spent
all
evening
giving
him
advice
such
as
If
he
tries
to
curse
you
you'd
better
dodge
it
because
I
can't
remember
how
to
block
them
there
was
a
very
good
chance
they
were
going
to
get
caught
by
Filch
or
Mrs
norris
and
Harry
felt
he
was
pushing
his
luck
breaking
another
school
rule
today
on
the
other
hand
Malfoys
sneering
face
kept
looming
up
out
of
the
darkness
this
was
his
big
chance
to
beat
Malfoy
face-to-face
he
couldn't
miss
it
half-past
eleven
Ron
muttered
at
last
we'd
better
go
they
pulled
on
their
bathrobes
picked
up
their
wands
and
crept
across
the
tower
room
down
the
spiral
staircase
and
into
the
Gryffindor
common
room
a
few
embers
were
still
glowing
in
the
fireplace
turning
all
the
armchairs
into
hunched
black
shadows
they
had
almost
reached
the
portrait
hole
when
a
voice
spoke
from
the
chair
nearest
them
I
can't
believe
you're
going
to
do
this
Harry
a
lamp
flickered
on
it
was
Hermione
Granger
wearing
a
pink
bathrobe
and
a
frown
you
said
Ron
furiously
go
back
to
bed
i
almost
told
your
brother
Hermione
snapped
Percy
he's
a
prefect
he'd
put
a
stop
to
this
harry
couldn't
believe
anyone
could
be
so
interfering
come
on
he
said
to
Ron
he
pushed
open
the
portrait
of
the
Fat
Lady
and
climbed
through
the
hole
hermione
wasn't
going
to
give
up
that
easily
she
followed
Ron
through
the
portrait
hole
hissing
at
them
like
an
angry
goose
don't
you
care
about
Gryffindor
do
you
only
care
about
yourselves
I
don't
want
Slytherin
to
win
the
house
cup
and
you'll
lose
all
the
points
I
got
from
Professor
McGonagall
for
knowing
about
Switching
Spells
go
away
all
right
but
I
warned
you
you
just
remember
what
I
said
when
you're
on
the
train
home
tomorrow
you're
so
but
what
they
were
they
didn't
find
out
hermione
had
turned
to
the
portrait
of
the
Fat
Lady
to
get
back
inside
and
found
herself
facing
an
empty
painting
the
Fat
Lady
had
gone
on
a
nighttime
visit
and
Hermione
was
locked
out
of
Gryffindor
tower
now
what
am
I
going
to
do
she
asked
shrilly
that's
your
problem
said
Ron
we've
got
to
go
we
re
going
to
be
late
they
hadn't
even
reached
the
end
of
the
corridor
when
Hermione
caught
up
with
them
i'm
coming
with
you
she
said
you
are
not
d'you
think
i'm
going
to
stand
out
here
and
wait
for
Filch
to
catch
me
if
he
finds
all
three
of
us
i'll
tell
him
the
truth
that
I
was
trying
to
stop
you
and
you
can
back
me
up
you've
got
some
nerve
said
Ron
loudly
shut
up
both
of
you
said
Harry
sharply
i
heard
something
it
was
a
sort
of
snuffling
mrs
norris
breathed
Ron
squinting
through
the
dark
it
wasn't
Mrs
norris
it
was
Neville
he
was
curled
up
on
the
floor
fast
asleep
but
jerked
suddenly
awake
as
they
crept
nearer
thank
goodness
you
found
me
i've
been
out
here
for
hours
I
couldn't
remember
the
new
password
to
get
in
to
bed
keep
your
voice
down
Neville
the
password's
Pig
snout
but
it
won't
help
you
now
the
Fat
lady's
gone
off
somewhere
how's
your
arm
said
Harry
fine
said
Neville
showing
them
madam
Pomfrey
mended
it
in
about
a
minute
good
well
look
Neville
we've
got
to
be
somewhere
we'll
see
you
later
don't
leave
me
said
Neville
scrambling
to
his
feet
I
don't
want
to
stay
here
alone
the
Bloody
baron's
been
past
twice
already
ron
looked
at
his
watch
and
then
glared
furiously
at
Hermione
and
Neville
if
either
of
you
get
us
caught
i'll
never
rest
until
i've
learned
that
Curse
of
the
Bogies
Quirrell
told
us
about
and
used
it
on
you
hermione
opened
her
mouth
perhaps
to
tell
Ron
exactly
how
to
use
the
Curse
of
the
Bogies
but
Harry
hissed
at
her
to
be
quiet
and
beckoned
them
all
forward
they
flitted
along
corridors
striped
with
bars
of
moonlight
from
the
high
windows
at
every
turn
Harry
expected
to
run
into
Filch
or
Mrs
norris
but
they
were
lucky
they
sped
up
a
staircase
to
the
third
floor
and
tiptoed
toward
the
trophy
room
malfoy
and
Crabbe
weren't
there
yet
the
crystal
trophy
cases
glimmered
where
the
moonlight
caught
them
cups
shields
plates
and
statues
winked
silver
and
gold
in
the
darkness
they
edged
along
the
walls
keeping
their
eyes
on
the
doors
at
either
end
of
the
room
harry
took
out
his
wand
in
case
Malfoy
leapt
in
and
started
at
once
the
minutes
crept
by
he's
late
maybe
he's
chickened
out
Ron
whispered
then
a
noise
in
the
next
room
made
them
jump
harry
had
only
just
raised
his
wand
when
they
heard
someone
speak
and
it
wasn't
Malfoy
sniff
around
my
sweet
they
might
be
lurking
in
a
corner
it
was
Filch
speaking
to
Mrs
norris
horror-struck
Harry
waved
madly
at
the
other
three
to
follow
him
as
quickly
as
possible
they
scurried
silently
toward
the
door
away
from
filch's
voice
neville's
robes
had
barely
whipped
round
the
corner
when
they
heard
Filch
enter
the
trophy
room
they're
in
here
somewhere
they
heard
him
mutter
probably
hiding
this
way
harry
mouthed
to
the
others
and
petrified
they
began
to
creep
down
a
long
gallery
full
of
suits
of
armor
they
could
hear
Filch
getting
nearer
neville
suddenly
let
out
a
frightened
squeak
and
broke
into
a
run
he
tripped
grabbed
Ron
around
the
waist
and
the
pair
of
them
toppled
right
into
a
suit
of
armor
the
clanging
and
crashing
were
enough
to
wake
the
whole
castle
run
harry
yelled
and
the
four
of
them
sprinted
down
the
gallery
not
looking
back
to
see
whether
Filch
was
following
they
swung
around
the
doorpost
and
galloped
down
one
corridor
then
another
Harry
in
the
lead
without
any
idea
where
they
were
or
where
they
were
going
they
ripped
through
a
tapestry
and
found
themselves
in
a
hidden
passageway
hurtled
along
it
and
came
out
near
their
Charms
classroom
which
they
knew
was
miles
from
the
trophy
room
i
think
we've
lost
him
Harry
panted
leaning
against
the
cold
wall
and
wiping
his
forehead
neville
was
bent
double
wheezing
and
spluttering
i
told
you
Hermione
gasped
clutching
at
the
stitch
in
her
chest
I
told
you
we've
got
to
get
back
to
Gryffindor
tower
said
Ron
quickly
as
possible
malfoy
tricked
you
Hermione
said
to
Harry
you
realize
that
don't
you
he
was
never
going
to
meet
you
Filch
knew
someone
was
going
to
be
in
the
trophy
room
Malfoy
must
have
tipped
him
off
harry
thought
she
was
probably
right
but
he
wasn't
going
to
tell
her
that
let's
go
it
wasn't
going
to
be
that
simple
they
hadn't
gone
more
than
a
dozen
paces
when
a
doorknob
rattled
and
something
came
shooting
out
of
a
classroom
in
front
of
them
it
was
Peeves
he
caught
sight
of
them
and
gave
a
squeal
of
delight
shut
up
Peeves
please
you'll
get
us
thrown
out
peeves
cackled
wandering
around
at
midnight
Ickle
Firsties
tut
tut
tut
naughty
naughty
you'll
get
caughty
not
if
you
don't
give
us
away
Peeves
please
should
tell
Filch
I
should
said
Peeves
in
a
saintly
voice
but
his
eyes
glittered
wickedly
it's
for
your
own
good
you
know
get
out
of
the
way
snapped
Ron
taking
a
swipe
at
Peeves
this
was
a
big
mistake
students
out
of
bed
peeves
bellowed
students
out
of
bed
down
the
charms
corridor
ducking
under
Peeves
they
ran
for
their
lives
right
to
the
end
of
the
corridor
where
they
slammed
into
a
door
and
it
was
locked
this
is
it
ron
moaned
as
they
pushed
helplessly
at
the
door
we're
done
for
this
is
the
end
they
could
hear
footsteps
Filch
running
as
fast
as
he
could
toward
peeves's
shouts
oh
move
over
Hermione
snarled
she
grabbed
harry's
wand
tapped
the
lock
and
whispered
Alohomora
the
lock
clicked
and
the
door
swung
open
they
piled
through
it
shut
it
quickly
and
pressed
their
ears
against
it
listening
which
way
did
they
go
Peeves
filch
was
saying
quick
tell
me
say
please
don't
mess
with
me
Peeves
now
where
did
they
go
shan't
say
nothing
if
you
don't
say
please
said
Peeves
in
his
annoying
singsong
voice
all
right
please
nothing
ha
haaa
told
you
I
wouldn't
say
nothing
if
you
didn't
say
please
ha
ha
haaaaaa
and
they
heard
the
sound
of
Peeves
whooshing
away
and
Filch
cursing
in
rage
he
thinks
this
door
is
locked
Harry
whispered
i
think
we'll
be
okay
get
off
Neville
for
Neville
had
been
tugging
on
the
sleeve
of
harry's
bathrobe
for
the
last
minute
what
harry
turned
around
and
saw
quite
clearly
what
for
a
moment
he
was
sure
he'd
walked
into
a
nightmare
this
was
too
much
on
top
of
everything
that
had
happened
so
far
they
weren't
in
a
room
as
he
had
supposed
they
were
in
a
corridor
the
forbidden
corridor
on
the
third
floor
and
now
they
knew
why
it
was
forbidden
they
were
looking
straight
into
the
eyes
of
a
monstrous
dog
a
dog
that
filled
the
whole
space
between
ceiling
and
floor
it
had
three
heads
three
pairs
of
rolling
mad
eyes
three
noses
twitching
and
quivering
in
their
direction
three
drooling
mouths
saliva
hanging
in
slippery
ropes
from
yellowish
fangs
it
was
standing
quite
still
all
six
eyes
staring
at
them
and
Harry
knew
that
the
only
reason
they
weren't
already
dead
was
that
their
sudden
appearance
had
taken
it
by
surprise
but
it
was
quickly
getting
over
that
there
was
no
mistaking
what
those
thunderous
growls
meant
harry
groped
for
the
doorknob
between
Filch
and
death
he'd
take
Filch
they
fell
backward
Harry
slammed
the
door
shut
and
they
ran
they
almost
flew
back
down
the
corridor
filch
must
have
hurried
off
to
look
for
them
somewhere
else
because
they
didn't
see
him
anywhere
but
they
hardly
cared
all
they
wanted
to
do
was
put
as
much
space
as
possible
between
them
and
that
monster
they
didn't
stop
running
until
they
reached
the
portrait
of
the
Fat
Lady
on
the
seventh
floor
where
on
earth
have
you
all
been
she
asked
looking
at
their
bathrobes
hanging
off
their
shoulders
and
their
flushed
sweaty
faces
never
mind
that
pig
snout
pig
snout
panted
Harry
and
the
portrait
swung
forward
they
scrambled
into
the
common
room
and
collapsed
trembling
into
armchairs
it
was
a
while
before
any
of
them
said
anything
neville
indeed
looked
as
if
he'd
never
speak
again
what
do
they
think
they're
doing
keeping
a
thing
like
that
locked
up
in
a
school
said
Ron
finally
if
any
dog
needs
exercise
that
one
does
hermione
had
got
both
her
breath
and
her
bad
temper
back
again
you
don't
use
your
eyes
any
of
you
do
you
she
snapped
didn't
you
see
what
it
was
standing
on
the
floor
harry
suggested
i
wasn't
looking
at
its
feet
I
was
too
busy
with
its
heads
no
not
the
floor
it
was
standing
on
a
trapdoor
it's
obviously
guarding
something
she
stood
up
glaring
at
them
i
hope
you're
pleased
with
yourselves
we
could
all
have
been
killed
or
worse
expelled
now
if
you
don't
mind
i'm
going
to
bed
ron
stared
after
her
his
mouth
open
no
we
don't
mind
he
said
you'd
think
we
dragged
her
along
wouldn't
you
but
Hermione
had
given
Harry
something
else
to
think
about
as
he
climbed
back
into
bed
the
dog
was
guarding
something
what
had
Hagrid
said
gringotts
was
the
safest
place
in
the
world
for
something
you
wanted
to
hide
except
perhaps
Hogwarts
it
looked
as
though
Harry
had
found
out
where
the
grubby
littie
package
from
vault
seven
hundred
and
thirteen
was
chapter
ten
halloween
malfoy
couldn't
believe
his
eyes
when
he
saw
that
Harry
and
Ron
were
still
at
Hogwarts
the
next
day
looking
tired
but
perfectly
cheerful
indeed
by
the
next
morning
Harry
and
Ron
thought
that
meeting
the
three-headed
dog
had
been
an
excellent
adventure
and
they
were
quite
keen
to
have
another
one
in
the
meantime
Harry
filled
Ron
in
about
the
package
that
seemed
to
have
been
moved
from
Gringotts
to
Hogwarts
and
they
spent
a
lot
of
time
wondering
what
could
possibly
need
such
heavy
protection
it's
either
really
valuable
or
really
dangerous
said
Ron
or
both
said
Harry
but
as
all
they
knew
for
sure
about
the
mysterious
object
was
that
it
was
about
two
inches
long
they
didn't
have
much
chance
of
guessing
what
it
was
without
further
clues
neither
Neville
nor
Hermione
showed
the
slightest
interest
in
what
lay
underneath
the
dog
and
the
trapdoor
all
Neville
cared
about
was
never
going
near
the
dog
again
hermione
was
now
refusing
to
speak
to
Harry
and
Ron
but
she
was
such
a
bossy
know-it-all
that
they
saw
this
as
an
added
bonus
all
they
really
wanted
now
was
a
way
of
getting
back
at
Malfoy
and
to
their
great
delight
just
such
a
thing
arrived
in
the
mail
about
a
week
later
as
the
owls
flooded
into
the
Great
Hall
as
usual
everyone's
attention
was
caught
at
once
by
a
long
thin
package
carried
by
six
large
screech
owls
harry
was
just
as
interested
as
everyone
else
to
see
what
was
in
this
large
parcel
and
was
amazed
when
the
owls
soared
down
and
dropped
it
right
in
front
of
him
knocking
his
bacon
to
the
floor
they
had
hardly
fluttered
out
of
the
way
when
another
owl
dropped
a
letter
on
top
of
the
parcel
harry
ripped
open
the
letter
first
which
was
lucky
because
it
said
do
not
open
the
parcel
at
the
table
it
contains
your
new
Nimbus
Two
Thousand
but
I
don't
want
everybody
knowing
you've
got
a
broomstick
or
they'll
all
want
one
oliver
Wood
will
meet
you
tonight
on
the
Quidditch
field
at
seven
o'clock
for
your
first
training
session
professor
McGonagall
Harry
had
difficulty
hiding
his
glee
as
he
handed
the
note
to
Ron
to
read
a
Nimbus
Two
Thousand
ron
moaned
enviously
i've
never
even
touched
one
they
left
the
hall
quickly
wanting
to
unwrap
the
broomstick
in
private
before
their
first
class
but
halfway
across
the
entrance
hall
they
found
the
way
upstairs
barred
by
Crabbe
and
Goyle
malfoy
seized
the
package
from
Harry
and
felt
it
that's
a
broomstick
he
said
throwing
it
back
to
Harry
with
a
mixture
of
jealousy
and
spite
on
his
face
you'll
be
in
for
it
this
time
Potter
first
years
aren't
allowed
them
ron
couldn't
resist
it
it's
not
any
old
broomstick
he
said
it's
a
Nimbus
Two
Thousand
what
did
you
say
you've
got
at
home
Malfoy
a
Comet
Two
Sixty
ron
grinned
at
Harry
comets
look
flashy
but
they're
not
in
the
same
league
as
the
Nimbus
what
would
you
know
about
it
Weasley
you
couldn't
afford
half
the
handle
Malfoy
snapped
back
i
suppose
you
and
your
brothers
have
to
save
up
twig
by
twig
before
Ron
could
answer
Professor
Flitwick
appeared
at
malfoy's
elbow
not
arguing
I
hope
boys
he
squeaked
potter's
been
sent
a
broomstick
Professor
said
Malfoy
quickly
yes
yes
that's
right
said
Professor
Flitwick
beaming
at
Harry
professor
McGonagall
told
me
all
about
the
special
circumstances
Potter
and
what
model
is
it
a
Nimbus
Two
Thousand
sit
said
Harry
fighting
not
to
laugh
at
the
look
of
horror
on
malfoy's
face
and
it's
really
thanks
to
Malfoy
here
that
i've
got
it
he
added
harry
and
Ron
headed
upstairs
smothering
their
laughter
at
malfoy's
obvious
rage
and
confusion
well
it's
true
Harry
chortled
as
they
reached
the
top
of
the
marble
staircase
If
he
hadn't
stolen
neville's
Remembrall
I
wouln't
be
on
the
team
so
I
suppose
you
think
that's
a
reward
for
breaking
rules
came
an
angry
voice
from
just
behind
them
hermione
was
stomping
up
the
stairs
looking
disapprovingly
at
the
package
in
harry's
hand
i
thought
you
weren't
speaking
to
us
said
Harry
yes
don't
stop
now
said
Ron
it's
doing
us
so
much
good
hermione
marched
away
with
her
nose
in
the
air
harry
had
a
lot
of
trouble
keeping
his
mind
on
his
lessons
that
day
it
kept
wandering
up
to
the
dormitory
where
his
new
broomstick
was
lying
under
his
bed
or
straying
off
to
the
Quidditch
field
where
he'd
be
learning
to
play
that
night
he
bolted
his
dinner
that
evening
without
noticing
what
he
was
eating
and
then
rushed
upstairs
with
Ron
to
unwrap
the
Nimbus
Two
Thousand
at
last
wow
Ron
sighed
as
the
broomstick
rolled
onto
harry's
bedspread
even
Harry
who
knew
nothing
about
the
different
brooms
thought
it
looked
wonderful
sleek
and
shiny
with
a
mahogany
handle
it
had
a
long
tail
of
neat
straight
twigs
and
Nimbus
Two
Thousand
written
in
gold
near
the
top
as
seven
o'clock
drew
nearer
Harry
left
the
castle
and
set
off
in
the
dusk
toward
the
Quidditch
field
held
never
been
inside
the
stadium
before
hundreds
of
seats
were
raised
in
stands
around
the
field
so
that
the
spectators
were
high
enough
to
see
what
was
going
on
at
either
end
of
the
field
were
three
golden
poles
with
hoops
on
the
end
they
reminded
Harry
of
the
little
plastic
sticks
Muggle
children
blew
bubbles
through
except
that
they
were
fifty
feet
high
too
eager
to
fly
again
to
wait
for
Wood
Harry
mounted
his
broomstick
and
kicked
off
from
the
ground
what
a
feeling
he
swooped
in
and
out
of
the
goal
posts
and
then
sped
up
and
down
the
field
the
Nimbus
Two
Thousand
turned
wherever
he
wanted
at
his
lightest
touch
hey
Potter
come
down
oliver
Wood
had
arrived
fie
was
carrying
a
large
wooden
crate
under
his
arm
harry
landed
next
to
him
very
nice
said
Wood
his
eyes
glinting
i
see
what
McGonagall
meant
you
really
are
a
natural
i'm
just
going
to
teach
you
the
rules
this
evening
then
you'll
be
joining
team
practice
three
times
a
week
he
opened
the
crate
inside
were
four
different-sized
balls
right
said
Wood
now
Quidditch
is
easy
enough
to
understand
even
if
it's
not
too
easy
to
play
there
are
seven
players
on
each
side
three
of
them
are
called
Chasers
three
Chasers
Harry
repeated
as
Wood
took
out
a
bright
red
ball
about
the
size
of
a
soccer
ball
this
ball's
called
the
Quaffle
said
Wood
the
Chasers
throw
the
Quaffle
to
each
other
and
try
and
get
it
through
one
of
the
hoops
to
score
a
goal
ten
points
every
time
the
Quaffle
goes
through
one
of
the
hoops
follow
me
the
Chasers
throw
the
Quaffle
and
put
it
through
the
hoops
to
score
harry
recited
so
that's
sort
of
like
basketball
on
broomsticks
with
six
hoops
isn't
it
what's
basketball
said
Wood
curiously
never
mind
said
Harry
quickly
now
there's
another
player
on
each
side
who's
called
the
Keeper
i'm
Keeper
for
Gryffindor
i
have
to
fly
around
our
hoops
and
stop
the
other
team
from
scoring
three
Chasers
one
Keeper
said
Harry
who
was
determined
to
remember
it
all
and
they
play
with
the
Quaffle
okay
got
that
so
what
are
they
for
he
pointed
at
the
three
balls
left
inside
the
box
i'll
show
you
now
said
Wood
take
this
he
handed
Harry
a
small
club
a
bit
like
a
short
baseball
bat
i'm
going
to
show
you
what
the
Bludgers
do
Wood
said
these
two
are
the
Bludgers
he
showed
Harry
two
identical
balls
jet
black
and
slightly
smaller
than
the
red
Quaffle
harry
noticed
that
they
seemed
to
be
straining
to
escape
the
straps
holding
them
inside
the
box
stand
back
Wood
warned
Harry
he
bent
down
and
freed
one
of
the
Bludgers
at
once
the
black
ball
rose
high
in
the
air
and
then
pelted
straight
at
harry's
face
harry
swung
at
it
with
the
bat
to
stop
it
from
breaking
his
nose
and
sent
it
zigzagging
away
into
the
air
it
zoomed
around
their
heads
and
then
shot
at
Wood
who
dived
on
top
of
it
and
managed
to
pin
it
to
the
ground
see
wood
panted
forcing
the
struggling
Bludger
back
into
the
crate
and
strapping
it
down
safely
the
Bludgers
rocket
around
trying
to
knock
players
off
their
brooms
that's
why
you
have
two
Beaters
on
each
team
the
Weasley
twins
are
ours
it's
their
job
to
protect
their
side
from
the
Bludgers
and
try
and
knock
them
toward
the
other
team
so
think
you've
got
all
that
three
Chasers
try
and
score
with
the
Quaffle
the
Keeper
guards
the
goal
posts
the
Beaters
keep
the
Bludgers
away
from
their
team
Harry
reeled
off
very
good
said
Wood
er
have
the
Bludgers
ever
killed
anyone
harry
asked
hoping
he
sounded
offhand
never
at
Hogwarts
we've
had
a
couple
of
broken
jaws
but
nothing
worse
than
that
now
the
last
member
of
the
team
is
the
Seeker
that's
you
and
you
don't
have
to
worry
about
the
Quaffle
or
the
Bludgers
unless
they
crack
my
head
open
don't
worry
the
Weasleys
are
more
than
a
match
for
the
Bludgers
I
mean
they're
like
a
pair
of
human
Bludgers
themselves
wood
reached
into
the
crate
and
took
out
the
fourth
and
last
ball
compared
with
the
Quaffle
and
the
Bludgers
it
was
tiny
about
the
size
of
a
large
walnut
it
was
bright
gold
and
had
little
fluttering
silver
wings
this
said
Wood
is
the
Golden
Snitch
and
it's
the
most
important
ball
of
the
lot
it's
very
hard
to
catch
because
it's
so
fast
and
difficult
to
see
it's
the
seeker's
job
to
catch
it
you've
got
to
weave
in
and
out
of
the
Chasers
Beaters
Bludgers
and
Quaffle
to
get
it
before
the
other
team's
Seeker
because
whichever
Seeker
catches
the
Snitch
wins
his
team
an
extra
hundred
and
fifty
points
so
they
nearly
always
win
that's
why
Seekers
get
fouled
so
much
a
game
of
Quidditch
only
ends
when
the
Snitch
is
caught
so
it
can
go
on
for
ages
I
think
the
record
is
three
months
they
had
to
keep
bringing
on
substitutes
so
the
players
could
get
some
sleep
well
that's
it
any
questions
harry
shook
his
head
he
understood
what
he
had
to
do
all
right
it
was
doing
it
that
was
going
to
be
the
problem
we
won't
practice
with
the
Snitch
yet
said
Wood
carefully
shutting
it
back
inside
the
crate
it's
too
dark
we
might
lose
it
let's
try
you
out
with
a
few
of
these
he
pulled
a
bag
of
ordinary
golf
balls
out
of
his
pocket
and
a
few
minutes
later
he
and
Harry
were
up
in
the
air
Wood
throwing
the
golf
balls
as
hard
as
he
could
in
every
direction
for
Harry
to
catch
harry
didn't
miss
a
single
one
and
Wood
was
delighted
after
half
an
hour
night
had
really
fallen
and
they
couldn't
carry
on
that
Quidditch
cup'll
have
our
name
on
it
this
year
said
Wood
happily
as
they
trudged
back
up
to
the
castle
i
wouldn't
be
surprised
if
you
turn
out
better
than
Charlie
Weasley
and
he
could
have
played
for
England
if
he
hadn't
gone
off
chasing
dragons
perhaps
it
was
because
he
was
now
so
busy
what
with
Quidditch
practice
three
evenings
a
week
on
top
of
all
his
homework
but
Harry
could
hardly
believe
it
when
he
realized
that
he'd
already
been
at
Hogwarts
two
months
the
castle
felt
more
like
home
than
Privet
Drive
ever
had
his
lessons
too
were
becoming
more
and
more
interesting
now
that
they
had
mastered
the
basics
on
Halloween
morning
they
woke
to
the
delicious
smell
of
baking
pumpkin
wafting
through
the
corridors
even
better
Professor
Flitwick
announced
in
Charms
that
he
thought
they
were
ready
to
start
making
objects
fly
something
they
had
all
been
dying
to
try
since
they'd
seen
him
make
neville's
toad
zoom
around
the
classroom
professor
Flitwick
put
the
class
into
pairs
to
practice
harry's
partner
was
Seamus
Finnigan
which
was
a
relief
because
Neville
had
been
trying
to
catch
his
eye
ron
however
was
to
be
working
with
Hermione
Granger
it
was
hard
to
tell
whether
Ron
or
Hermione
was
angrier
about
this
she
hadn't
spoken
to
either
of
them
since
the
day
harry's
broomstick
had
arrived
now
don't
forget
that
nice
wrist
movement
we've
been
practicing
squeaked
Professor
Flitwick
perched
on
top
of
his
pile
of
books
as
usual
swish
and
flick
remember
swish
and
flick
and
saying
the
magic
words
properly
is
very
important
too
never
forget
Wizard
Baruffio
who
said
s
instead
of
f
and
found
himself
on
the
floor
with
a
buffalo
on
his
chest
it
was
very
difficult
harry
and
Seamus
swished
and
flicked
but
the
feather
they
were
supposed
to
be
sending
skyward
just
lay
on
the
desktop
seamus
got
so
impatient
that
he
prodded
it
with
his
wand
and
set
fire
to
it
Harry
had
to
put
it
out
with
his
hat
ron
at
the
next
table
wasn't
having
much
more
luck
wingardium
Leviosa
he
shouted
waving
his
long
arms
like
a
windmill
you're
saying
it
wrong
Harry
heard
Hermione
snap
it's
wing-gar-dium
levi-o-sa
make
the
gar
nice
and
long
you
do
it
then
if
you're
so
clever
Ron
snarled
hermione
rolled
up
the
sleeves
of
her
gown
flicked
her
wand
and
said
Wingardium
Leviosa
their
feather
rose
off
the
desk
and
hovered
about
four
feet
above
their
heads
oh
well
done
cried
Professor
Flitwick
clapping
everyone
see
here
Miss
granger's
done
it
ron
was
in
a
very
bad
mood
by
the
end
of
the
class
it's
no
wonder
no
one
can
stand
her
he
said
to
Harry
as
they
pushed
their
way
into
the
crowded
corridor
she's
a
nightmare
honestly
someone
knocked
into
Harry
as
they
hurried
past
him
it
was
Hermione
harry
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
face
and
was
startled
to
see
that
she
was
in
tears
i
think
she
heard
you
so
said
Ron
but
he
looked
a
bit
uncomfortable
she
must've
noticed
she's
got
no
friends
hermione
didn't
turn
up
for
the
next
class
and
wasn't
seen
all
afternoon
on
their
way
down
to
the
Great
Hall
for
the
Halloween
feast
Harry
and
Ron
overheard
Parvati
Patil
telling
her
friend
Lavender
that
Hermione
was
crying
in
the
girls
bathroom
and
wanted
to
be
left
alone
ron
looked
still
more
awkward
at
this
but
a
moment
later
they
had
entered
the
Great
Hall
where
the
Halloween
decorations
put
Hermione
out
of
their
minds
a
thousand
live
bats
fluttered
from
the
walls
and
ceiling
while
a
thousand
more
swooped
over
the
tables
in
low
black
clouds
making
the
candles
in
the
pumpkins
stutter
the
feast
appeared
suddenly
on
the
golden
plates
as
it
had
at
the
start-of-term
banquet
harry
was
just
helping
himself
to
a
baked
potato
when
Professor
Quirrell
came
sprinting
into
the
hall
his
turban
askew
and
terror
on
his
face
everyone
stared
as
he
reached
Professor
dumbledore's
chair
slumped
against
the
table
and
gasped
Troll
in
the
dungeons
thought
you
ought
to
know
he
then
sank
to
the
floor
in
a
dead
faint
there
was
an
uproar
it
took
several
purple
firecrackers
exploding
from
the
end
of
Professor
dumbledore's
wand
to
bring
silence
prefects
he
rumbled
lead
your
Houses
back
to
the
dormitories
immediately
percy
was
in
his
element
follow
me
stick
together
first
years
no
need
to
fear
the
troll
if
you
follow
my
orders
stay
close
behind
me
now
make
way
first
years
coming
through
excuse
me
i'm
a
prefect
how
could
a
troll
get
in
harry
asked
as
they
climbed
the
stairs
don't
ask
me
they're
supposed
to
be
really
stupid
said
Ron
maybe
Peeves
let
it
in
for
a
Halloween
joke
they
passed
different
groups
of
people
hurrying
in
different
directions
as
they
jostled
their
way
through
a
crowd
of
confused
Hufflepuffs
Harry
suddenly
grabbed
ron's
arm
i've
just
thought
Hermione
what
about
her
she
doesn't
know
about
the
troll
ron
bit
his
lip
oh
all
right
he
snapped
but
percy'd
better
not
see
us
ducking
down
they
joined
the
Hufflepuffs
going
the
other
way
slipped
down
a
deserted
side
corridor
and
hurried
off
toward
the
girls
bathroom
they
had
just
turned
the
corner
when
they
heard
quick
footsteps
behind
them
percy
hissed
Ron
pulling
Harry
behind
a
large
stone
griffin
peering
around
it
however
they
saw
not
Percy
but
Snape
he
crossed
the
corridor
and
disappeared
from
view
what's
he
doing
harry
whispered
why
isn't
he
down
in
the
dungeons
with
the
rest
of
the
teachers
search
me
quietly
as
possible
they
crept
along
the
next
corridor
after
snape's
fading
footsteps
he's
heading
for
the
third
floor
Harry
said
but
Ron
held
up
his
hand
can
you
smell
something
harry
sniffed
and
a
foul
stench
reached
his
nostrils
a
mixture
of
old
socks
and
the
kind
of
public
toilet
no
one
seems
to
clean
and
then
they
heard
it
a
low
grunting
and
the
shuffling
footfalls
of
gigantic
feet
ron
pointed
at
the
end
of
a
passage
to
the
left
something
huge
was
moving
toward
them
they
shrank
into
the
shadows
and
watched
as
it
emerged
into
a
patch
of
moonlight
it
was
a
horrible
sight
twelve
feet
tall
its
skin
was
a
dull
granite
gray
its
great
lumpy
body
like
a
boulder
with
its
small
bald
head
perched
on
top
like
a
coconut
it
had
short
legs
thick
as
tree
trunks
with
flat
horny
feet
the
smell
coming
from
it
was
incredible
it
was
holding
a
huge
wooden
club
which
dragged
along
the
floor
because
its
arms
were
so
long
the
troll
stopped
next
to
a
doorway
and
peered
inside
it
waggled
its
long
ears
making
up
its
tiny
mind
then
slouched
slowly
into
the
room
the
keys
in
the
lock
Harry
muttered
we
could
lock
it
in
good
idea
said
Ron
nervously
they
edged
toward
the
open
door
mouths
dry
praying
the
troll
wasn't
about
to
come
out
of
it
with
one
great
leap
Harry
managed
to
grab
the
key
slam
the
door
and
lock
it
yes
flushed
with
their
victory
they
started
to
run
back
up
the
passage
but
as
they
reached
the
corner
they
heard
something
that
made
their
hearts
stop
a
high
petrified
scream
and
it
was
coming
from
the
chamber
they'd
just
chained
up
oh
no
said
Ron
pale
as
the
Bloody
Baron
it's
the
girls
bathroom
harry
gasped
hermione
they
said
together
it
was
the
last
thing
they
wanted
to
do
but
what
choice
did
they
have
wheeling
around
they
sprinted
back
to
the
door
and
turned
the
key
fumbling
in
their
panic
harry
pulled
the
door
open
and
they
ran
inside
hermione
Granger
was
shrinking
against
the
wall
opposite
looking
as
if
she
was
about
to
faint
the
troll
was
advancing
on
her
knocking
the
sinks
off
the
walls
as
it
went
confuse
it
harry
said
desperately
to
Ron
and
seizing
a
tap
he
threw
it
as
hard
as
he
could
against
the
wall
the
troll
stopped
a
few
feet
from
Hermione
it
lumbered
around
blinking
stupidly
to
see
what
had
made
the
noise
its
mean
little
eyes
saw
Harry
it
hesitated
then
made
for
him
instead
lifting
its
club
as
it
went
oy
pea-brain
yelled
Ron
from
the
other
side
of
the
chamber
and
he
threw
a
metal
pipe
at
it
the
troll
didn't
even
seem
to
notice
the
pipe
hitting
its
shoulder
but
it
heard
the
yell
and
paused
again
turning
its
ugly
snout
toward
Ron
instead
giving
Harry
time
to
run
around
it
come
on
run
run
harry
yelled
at
Hermione
trying
to
pull
her
toward
the
door
but
she
couldn't
move
she
was
still
flat
against
the
wall
her
mouth
open
with
terror
the
shouting
and
the
echoes
seemed
to
be
driving
the
troll
berserk
it
roared
again
and
started
toward
Ron
who
was
nearest
and
had
no
way
to
escape
harry
then
did
something
that
was
both
very
brave
and
very
stupid
He
took
a
great
running
jump
and
managed
to
fasten
his
arms
around
the
troll's
neck
from
behind
the
troll
couldn't
feel
Harry
hanging
there
but
even
a
troll
will
notice
if
you
stick
a
long
bit
of
wood
up
its
nose
and
harry's
wand
had
still
been
in
his
hand
when
he'd
jumped
it
had
gone
straight
up
one
of
the
troll's
nostrils
howling
with
pain
the
troll
twisted
and
flailed
its
club
with
Harry
clinging
on
for
dear
life
any
second
the
troll
was
going
to
rip
him
off
or
catch
him
a
terrible
blow
with
the
club
hermione
had
sunk
to
the
floor
in
fright
Ron
pulled
out
his
own
wand
not
knowing
what
he
was
going
to
do
he
heard
himself
cry
the
first
spell
that
came
into
his
head
Wingardium
Leviosa
the
club
flew
suddenly
out
of
the
troll's
hand
rose
high
high
up
into
the
air
turned
slowly
over
and
dropped
with
a
sickening
crack
onto
its
owner's
head
the
troll
swayed
on
the
spot
and
then
fell
flat
on
its
face
with
a
thud
that
made
the
whole
room
tremble
harry
got
to
his
feet
he
was
shaking
and
out
of
breath
ron
was
standing
there
with
his
wand
still
raised
staring
at
what
he
had
done
it
was
Hermione
who
spoke
first
is
it
dead
i
don't
think
so
said
Harry
I
think
it's
just
been
knocked
out
he
bent
down
and
pulled
his
wand
out
of
the
troll's
nose
it
was
covered
in
what
looked
like
lumpy
gray
glue
urgh
troll
boogers
he
wiped
it
on
the
troll's
trousers
a
sudden
slamming
and
loud
footsteps
made
the
three
of
them
look
up
they
hadn't
realized
what
a
racket
they
had
been
making
but
of
course
someone
downstairs
must
have
heard
the
crashes
and
the
troll's
roars
a
moment
later
Professor
McGonagall
had
come
bursting
into
the
room
closely
followed
by
Snape
with
Quirrell
bringing
up
the
rear
quirrell
took
one
look
at
the
troll
let
out
a
faint
whimper
and
sat
quickly
down
on
a
toilet
clutching
his
heart
snape
bent
over
the
troll
professor
McGonagall
was
looking
at
Ron
and
Harry
harry
had
never
seen
her
look
so
angry
her
lips
were
white
hopes
of
winning
fifty
points
for
Gryffindor
faded
quickly
from
harry's
mind
what
on
earth
were
you
thinking
of
said
Professor
McGonagall
with
cold
fury
in
her
voice
harry
looked
at
Ron
who
was
still
standing
with
his
wand
in
the
air
you're
lucky
you
weren't
killed
why
aren't
you
in
your
dormitory
snape
gave
Harry
a
swift
piercing
look
harry
looked
at
the
floor
he
wished
Ron
would
put
his
wand
down
then
a
small
voice
came
out
of
the
shadows
please
Professor
McGonagall
they
were
looking
for
me
miss
Granger
hermione
had
managed
to
get
to
her
feet
at
last
i
went
looking
for
the
troll
because
I
I
thought
I
could
deal
with
it
on
my
own
you
know
because
i've
read
all
about
them
ron
dropped
his
wand
hermione
Granger
telling
a
downright
lie
to
a
teacher
if
they
hadn't
found
me
i'd
be
dead
now
harry
stuck
his
wand
up
its
nose
and
Ron
knocked
it
out
with
its
own
club
they
didn't
have
time
to
come
and
fetch
anyone
it
was
about
to
finish
me
off
when
they
arrived
harry
and
Ron
tried
to
look
as
though
this
story
wasn't
new
to
them
well
in
that
case
said
Professor
McGonagall
staring
at
the
three
of
them
Miss
Granger
you
foolish
girl
how
could
you
think
of
tackling
a
mountain
troll
on
your
own
hermione
hung
her
head
harry
was
speechless
hermione
was
the
last
person
to
do
anything
against
the
rules
and
here
she
was
pretending
she
had
to
get
them
out
of
trouble
it
was
as
if
Snape
had
started
handing
out
sweets
miss
Granger
five
points
will
be
taken
from
Gryffindor
for
this
said
Professor
McGonagall
i'm
very
disappointed
in
you
if
you're
not
hurt
at
all
you'd
better
get
off
to
Gryffindor
tower
students
are
finishing
the
feast
in
their
houses
hermione
left
professor
McGonagall
turned
to
Harry
and
Ron
well
I
still
say
you
were
lucky
but
not
many
first
years
could
have
taken
on
a
full-grown
mountain
troll
you
each
win
Gryffindor
five
points
professor
Dumbledore
will
be
informed
of
this
you
may
go
they
hurried
out
of
the
chamber
and
didn't
speak
at
all
until
they
had
climbed
two
floors
up
it
was
a
relief
to
be
away
from
the
smell
of
the
troll
quite
apart
from
anything
else
we
should
have
gotten
more
than
ten
points
Ron
grumbled
five
you
mean
once
she's
taken
off
hermione's
good
of
her
to
get
us
out
of
trouble
like
that
Ron
admitted
mind
you
we
did
save
her
she
might
not
have
needed
saving
if
we
hadn't
locked
the
thing
in
with
her
Harry
reminded
him
they
had
reached
the
portrait
of
the
Fat
Lady
pig
snout
they
said
and
entered
the
common
room
was
packed
and
noisy
everyone
was
eating
the
food
that
had
been
sent
up
hermione
however
stood
alone
by
the
door
waiting
for
them
there
was
a
very
embarrassed
pause
then
none
of
them
looking
at
each
other
they
all
said
Thanks
and
hurried
off
to
get
plates
but
from
that
moment
on
Hermione
Granger
became
their
friend
there
are
some
things
you
can't
share
without
ending
up
liking
each
other
and
knocking
out
a
twelve-foot
mountain
troll
is
one
of
them
chapter
eleven
quidditch
as
they
entered
November
the
weather
turned
very
cold
the
mountains
around
the
school
became
icy
gray
and
the
lake
like
chilled
steel
every
morning
the
ground
was
covered
in
frost
hagrid
could
be
seen
from
the
upstairs
windows
defrosting
broomsticks
on
the
Quidditch
field
bundled
up
in
a
long
moleskin
overcoat
rabbit
fur
gloves
and
enormous
beaverskin
boots
the
Quidditch
season
had
begun
on
Saturday
Harry
would
be
playing
in
his
first
match
after
weeks
of
training
Gryffindor
versus
Slytherin
if
Gryffindor
won
they
would
move
up
into
second
place
in
the
house
championship
hardly
anyone
had
seen
Harry
play
because
Wood
had
decided
that
as
their
secret
weapon
Harry
should
be
kept
well
secret
but
the
news
that
he
was
playing
Seeker
had
leaked
out
somehow
and
Harry
didn't
know
which
was
worse
people
telling
him
he'd
be
brilliant
or
people
telling
him
they'd
be
running
around
underneath
him
holding
a
mattress
it
was
really
lucky
that
Harry
now
had
Hermlone
as
a
friend
he
didn't
know
how
he'd
have
gotten
through
all
his
homework
without
her
what
with
all
the
last-minute
Quidditch
practice
Wood
was
making
them
do
she
had
also
tent
him
Quidditch
Through
the
Ages
which
turned
out
to
be
a
very
interesting
read
harry
learned
that
there
were
seven
hundred
ways
of
committing
a
Quidditch
foul
and
that
all
of
them
had
happened
during
a
World
Cup
match
in
that
Seekers
were
usually
the
smallest
and
fastest
players
and
that
most
serious
Quidditch
accidents
seemed
to
happen
to
them
that
although
people
rarely
died
playing
Quidditch
referees
had
been
known
to
vanish
and
turn
up
months
later
in
the
Sahara
Desert
hermione
had
become
a
bit
more
relaxed
about
breaking
rules
since
Harry
and
Ron
had
saved
her
from
the
mountain
troll
and
she
was
much
nicer
for
it
the
day
before
harry's
first
Quidditch
match
the
three
of
them
were
out
in
the
freezing
courtyard
during
break
and
she
had
conjured
them
up
a
bright
blue
fire
that
could
be
carried
around
in
a
jam
jar
they
were
standing
with
their
backs
to
it
getting
warm
when
Snape
crossed
the
yard
harry
noticed
at
once
that
Snape
was
limping
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
moved
closer
together
to
block
the
fire
from
view
they
were
sure
it
wouldn't
be
allowed
unfortunately
something
about
their
guilty
faces
caught
snape's
eye
he
limped
over
he
hadn't
seen
the
fire
but
he
seemed
to
be
looking
for
a
reason
to
tell
them
off
anyway
what's
that
you've
got
there
Potter
it
was
Quidditch
Through
the
Ages
harry
showed
him
library
books
are
not
to
be
taken
outside
the
school
said
Snape
give
it
to
me
five
points
from
Gryffindor
he's
just
made
that
rule
up
Harry
muttered
angrily
as
Snape
limped
away
wonder
what's
wrong
with
his
leg
dunno
but
I
hope
it's
really
hurting
him
said
Ron
bitterly
the
Gryffindor
common
room
was
very
noisy
that
evening
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
sat
together
next
to
a
window
hermione
was
checking
Harry
and
ron's
Charms
homework
for
them
she
would
never
let
them
copy
How
will
you
learn
but
by
asking
her
to
read
it
through
they
got
the
right
answers
anyway
harry
felt
restless
he
wanted
Quidditch
Through
the
Ages
back
to
take
his
mind
off
his
nerves
about
tomorrow
why
should
he
be
afraid
of
Snape
getting
up
he
told
Ron
and
Hermione
he
was
going
to
ask
Snape
if
he
could
have
it
better
you
than
me
they
said
together
but
Harry
had
an
idea
that
Snape
wouldn't
refuse
if
there
were
other
teachers
listening
he
made
his
way
down
to
the
staffroom
and
knocked
there
was
no
answer
he
knocked
again
nothing
perhaps
Snape
had
left
the
book
in
there
it
was
worth
a
try
he
pushed
the
door
ajar
and
peered
inside
and
a
horrible
scene
met
his
eyes
snape
and
Filch
were
inside
alone
snape
was
holding
his
robes
above
his
knees
one
of
his
legs
was
bloody
and
mangled
filch
was
handing
Snape
bandages
blasted
thing
Snape
was
saying
how
are
you
supposed
to
keep
your
eyes
on
all
three
heads
at
once
harry
tried
to
shut
the
door
quietly
but
potter
snape's
face
was
twisted
with
fury
as
he
dropped
his
robes
quickly
to
hide
his
leg
harry
gulped
i
just
wondered
if
I
could
have
my
book
back
get
out
out
harry
left
before
Snape
could
take
any
more
points
from
Gryffindor
he
sprinted
back
upstairs
did
you
get
it
ron
asked
as
Harry
joined
them
what's
the
matter
in
a
low
whisper
Harry
told
them
what
he'd
seen
you
know
what
this
means
he
finished
breathlessly
he
tried
to
get
past
that
three-headed
dog
at
Halloween
that's
where
he
was
going
when
we
saw
him
he's
after
whatever
it's
guarding
and
Id
bet
my
broomstick
he
let
that
troll
in
to
make
a
diversion
hermione's
eyes
were
wide
no
he
wouldn't
she
said
i
know
he's
not
very
nice
but
he
wouldn't
try
and
steal
something
Dumbledore
was
keeping
safe
honestly
Hermione
you
think
all
teachers
are
saints
or
something
snapped
Ron
i'm
with
Harry
i
wouldn't
put
anything
past
Snape
but
what's
he
after
what's
that
dog
guarding
harry
went
to
bed
with
his
head
buzzing
with
the
same
question
neville
was
snoring
loudly
but
Harry
couldn't
sleep
he
tried
to
empty
his
mind
he
needed
to
sleep
he
had
to
he
had
his
first
Quidditch
match
in
a
few
hours
but
the
expression
on
snape's
face
when
Harry
had
seen
his
leg
wasn't
easy
to
forget
the
next
morning
dawned
very
bright
and
cold
the
Great
Hall
was
full
of
the
delicious
smell
of
fried
sausages
and
the
cheer
ful
chatter
of
everyone
looking
forward
to
a
good
Quidditch
match
you've
got
to
eat
some
breakfast
i
don't
want
anything
just
a
bit
of
toast
wheedled
Hermione
i'm
not
hungry
harry
felt
terrible
in
an
hour's
time
he'd
be
walking
onto
the
field
harry
you
need
your
strength
said
Seamus
Finnigan
seekers
are
always
the
ones
who
get
clobbered
by
the
other
team
thanks
Seamus
said
Harry
watching
Seamus
pile
ketchup
on
his
sausages
by
eleven
o'clock
the
whole
school
seemed
to
be
out
in
the
stands
around
the
Quidditch
pitch
many
students
had
binoculars
the
seats
might
be
raised
high
in
the
air
but
it
was
still
difficult
to
see
what
was
going
on
sometimes
ron
and
Hermione
joined
Neville
Seamus
and
Dean
the
West
Ham
fan
up
in
the
top
row
as
a
surprise
for
Harry
they
had
painted
a
large
banner
on
one
of
the
sheets
Scabbers
had
ruined
it
said
Potter
for
President
and
Dean
who
was
good
at
drawing
had
done
a
large
Gryffindor
lion
underneath
then
Hermione
had
performed
a
tricky
little
charm
so
that
the
paint
flashed
different
colors
meanwhile
in
the
locker
room
Harry
and
the
rest
of
the
team
were
changing
into
their
scarlet
Quidditch
robes
Slytherin
would
be
playing
in
green
wood
cleared
his
throat
for
silence
okay
men
he
said
and
women
said
Chaser
Angelina
Johnson
and
women
Wood
agreed
this
is
it
the
big
one
said
Fred
Weasley
the
one
we've
all
been
waiting
for
said
George

oliver's
speech
by
heart
Fred
told
Harry
we
were
on
the
team
last
year

said
Wood

is
the
best
team
gryffindor's
had
in
years

going
to
win
i
know
it
he
glared
at
them
all
as
if
to
say
Or
else
right
it's
time
good
luck
all
of
you
harry
followed
Fred
and
George
out
of
the
locker
room
and
hoping
his
knees
weren't
going
to
give
way
walked
onto
the
field
to
loud
cheers
madam
Hooch
was
refereeing
she
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
field
waiting
for
the
two
teams
her
broom
in
her
hand
now
I
want
a
nice
fair
game
all
of
you
she
said
once
they
were
all
gathered
around
her
harry
noticed
that
she
seemed
to
be
speaking
particularly
to
the
Slytherin
Captain
Marcus
Flint
a
sixth
year
harry
thought
Flint
looked
as
if
he
had
some
troll
blood
in
him
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
he
saw
the
fluttering
banner
high
above
flashing
Potter
for
President
over
the
crowd
his
heart
skipped
he
felt
braver
mount
your
brooms
please
harry
clambered
onto
his
Nimbus
Two
Thousand
madam
Hooch
gave
a
loud
blast
on
her
silver
whistle
fifteen
brooms
rose
up
high
high
into
the
air
they
were
off
and
the
Quaffle
is
taken
immediately
by
Angelina
Johnson
of
Gryffindor

excellent
Chaser

Hagrid
patting
a
large
pair
of
binoculars
around
his
neck

said
Hagrid
raising
his
binoculars
and
peering
skyward
at
the
speck
that
was
Harry
way
up
above
them
Harry
was
gliding
over
the
game
squinting
about
for
some
sign
of
the
Snitch
this
was
part
of
his
and
wood's
game
plan
keep
out
of
the
way
until
you
catch
sight
of
the
Snitch
Wood

said
we

before
you
have
to
be
when
Angelina
had
scored
Harry
had
done
a
couple
of
loop-the-loops
to
let
off
his
feelings
now
he
was
back
to
staring
around
for
the
Snitch
once
he
caught
sight
of
a
flash
of
gold
but
it
was
just
a
reflection
from
one
of
the
Weasleys
wristwatches
and
once
a
Bludger
decided
to
come
pelting
his
way
more
like
a
cannonball
than
anything
but
Harry
dodged
it
and
Fred
Weasley
came
chasing
after
it
all
right
there
Harry
he
had
time
to
yell
as
he
beat
the
Bludger
furiously
toward
Marcus
Flint
slytherin
in
possession
Lee
Jordan
was
saying
Chaser
Pucey
ducks
two
Bludgers
two
Weasleys
and
Chaser
Bell
and
speeds
toward
the
wait
a
moment
was
that
the
Snitch
a
murmur
ran
through
the
crowd
as
Adrian
Pucey
dropped
the
Quaffle
too
busy
looking
over
his
shoulder
at
the
flash
of
gold
that
had
passed
his
left
ear
harry
saw
it
in
a
great
rush
of
excitement
he
dived
downward
after
the
streak
of
gold
slytherin
Seeker
Terence
Higgs
had
seen
it
too
neck
and
neck
they
hurtled
toward
the
Snitch
all
the
Chasers
seemed
to
have
forgotten
what
they
were
supposed
to
be
doing
as
they
hung
in
midair
to
watch
harry
was
faster
than
Higgs
he
could
see
the
little
round
ball
wings
fluttering
darting
up
ahead
he
put
on
an
extra
spurt
of
speed
wham
a
roar
of
rage
echoed
from
the
Gryffindors
below
Marcus
Flint
had
blocked
Harry
on
purpose
and
harry's
broom
spun
off
course
Harry
holding
on
for
dear
life
foul
screamed
the
Gryffindors
madam
Hooch
spoke
angrily
to
Flint
and
then
ordered
a
free
shot
at
the
goal
posts
for
Gryffindor
but
in
all
the
confusion
of
course
the
Golden
Snitch
had
disappeared
from
sight
again
down
in
the
stands
Dean
Thomas
was
yelling
Send
him
off
ref
red
card
what
are
you
talking
about
Dean
said
Ron
red
card
said
Dean
furiously
in
soccer
you
get
shown
the
red
card
and
you're
out
of
the
game
but
this
isn't
soccer
Dean
Ron
reminded
him
hagrid
however
was
on
dean's
side
they
oughta
change
the
rules
flint
coulda
knocked
Harry
outta
the
air
lee
Jordan
was
finding
it
difficult
not
to
take
sides
so
after
that
obvious
and
disgusting
bit
of
cheating
Jordan
growled
Professor
McGonagall
i
mean
after
that
open
and
revolting
foul
Jordan
i'm
warning
you
all
right
all
right
flint
nearly
kills
the
Gryffindor
Seeker
which
could
happen
to
anyone
i'm
sure
so
a
penalty
to
Gryffindor
taken
by
Spinner
who
puts
it
away
no
trouble
and
we
continue
play
Gryffindor
still
in
possession
it
was
as
Harry
dodged
another
Bludger
which
went
spinning
dangerously
past
his
head
that
it
happened
his
broom
gave
a
sudden
frightening
lurch
for
a
split
second
he
thought
he
was
going
to
fall
he
gripped
the
broom
tightly
with
both
his
hands
and
knees
he'd
never
felt
anything
like
that
it
happened
again
it
was
as
though
the
broom
was
trying
to
buck
him
off
but
Nimbus
Two
Thousands
did
not
suddenly
decide
to
buck
their
riders
off
harry
tried
to
turn
back
toward
the
Gryffindor
goal
posts
he
had
half
a
mind
to
ask
Wood
to
call
time-out
and
then
he
realized
that
his
broom
was
completely
out
of
his
control
he
couldn't
turn
it
he
couldn't
direct
it
at
all
it
was
zigzagging
through
the
air
and
every
now
and
then
making
violent
swishing
movements
that
almost
unseated
him
lee
was
still
commentating
slytherin
in
possession
Flint
with
the
Quaffle
passes
Spinnet
passes
Bell
hit
hard
in
the
face
by
a
Bludger
hope
it
broke
his
nose
only
joking
Professor
Slytherins
score
A
no
the
Slytherins
were
cheering
no
one
seemed
to
have
noticed
that
harry's
broom
was
behaving
strangely
it
was
carrying
him
slowly
higher
away
from
the
game
jerking
and
twitching
as
it
went
dunno
what
Harry
thinks
he's
doing
Hagrid
mumbled
he
stared
through
his
binoculars
if
I
didn
know
better
i'd
say
he'd
lost
control
of
his
broom
but
he
can't
have
suddenly
people
were
pointing
up
at
Harry
all
over
the
stands
his
broom
had
started
to
roll
over
and
over
with
him
only
just
managing
to
hold
on
then
the
whole
crowd
gasped
harry's
broom
had
given
a
wild
jerk
and
Harry
swung
off
it
he
was
now
dangling
from
it
holding
on
with
only
one
hand
did
something
happen
to
it
when
Flint
blocked
him
seamus
whispered
can't
have
Hagrid
said
his
voice
shaking
can't
nothing
interfere
with
a
broomstick
except
powerful
Dark
magic
no
kid
could
do
that
to
a
Nimbus
Two
Thousand
at
these
words
Hermione
seized
hagrid's
binoculars
but
instead
of
looking
up
at
Harry
she
started
looking
frantically
at
the
crowd
what
are
you
doing
moaned
Ron
gray-faced
i
knew
it
Hermione
gasped
Snape
look
ron
grabbed
the
binoculars
snape
was
in
the
middle
of
the
stands
opposite
them
he
had
his
eyes
fixed
on
Harry
and
was
muttering
nonstop
under
his
breath
he's
doing
something
jinxing
the
broom
said
Hermione
what
should
we
do
leave
it
to
me
before
Ron
could
say
another
word
Hermione
had
disappeared
ron
turned
the
binoculars
back
on
Harry
his
broom
was
vibrating
so
hard
it
was
almost
impossible
for
him
to
hang
on
much
longer
the
whole
crowd
was
on
its
feet
watching
terrified
as
the
Weasleys
flew
up
to
try
and
pull
Harry
safely
onto
one
of
their
brooms
but
it
was
no
good
every
time
they
got
near
him
the
broom
would
jump
higher
still
they
dropped
lower
and
circled
beneath
him
obviously
hoping
to
catch
him
if
he
fell
marcus
Flint
seized
the
Quaffle
and
scored
five
times
without
anyone
noticing
come
on
Hermione
Ron
muttered
desperately
hermione
had
fought
her
way
across
to
the
stand
where
Snape
stood
and
was
now
racing
along
the
row
behind
him
she
didn't
even
stop
to
say
sorry
as
she
knocked
Professor
Quirrell
headfirst
into
the
row
in
front
reaching
Snape
she
crouched
down
pulled
out
her
wand
and
whispered
a
few
well
chosen
words
bright
blue
flames
shot
from
her
wand
onto
the
hem
of
snape's
robes
it
took
perhaps
thirty
seconds
for
Snape
to
realize
that
he
was
on
fire
a
sudden
yelp
told
her
she
had
done
her
job
scooping
the
fire
off
him
into
a
little
jar
in
her
pocket
she
scrambled
back
along
the
row
Snape
would
never
know
what
had
happened
it
was
enough
up
in
the
air
Harry
was
suddenly
able
to
clamber
back
on
to
his
broom
neville
you
can
look
ron
said
neville
had
been
sobbing
into
hagrid's
jacket
for
the
last
five
minutes
harry
was
speeding
toward
the
ground
when
the
crowd
saw
him
clap
his
hand
to
his
mouth
as
though
he
was
about
to
be
sick
he
hit
the
field
on
all
fours
coughed
and
something
gold
fell
into
his
hand
i've
got
the
Snitch
he
shouted
waving
it
above
his
head
and
the
game
ended
in
complete
confusion
he
didn't
catch
it
he
nearly
swallowed
it
Flint
was
still
howling
twenty
minutes
later
but
it
made
no
difference
Harry
hadn't
broken
any
rules
and
Lee
Jordan
was
still
happily
shouting
the
results
Gryffindor
had
won
by
one
hundred
and
seventy
points
to
sixty
harry
heard
none
of
this
though
he
was
being
made
a
cup
of
strong
tea
back
in
hagrid's
hut
with
Ron
and
Hermione
it
was
Snape
Ron
was
explaining
Hermione
and
I
saw
him
he
was
cursing
your
broomstick
muttering
he
wouldn't
take
his
eyes
off
you
rubbish
said
Hagrid
who
hadn't
heard
a
word
of
what
had
gone
on
next
to
him
in
the
stands
why
would
Snape
do
somethin
like
that
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
looked
at
one
another
wondering
what
to
tell
him
harry
decided
on
the
truth
i
found
out
something
about
him
he
told
Hagrid
he
tried
to
get
past
that
three-headed
dog
on
Halloween
it
bit
him
we
think
he
was
trying
to
steal
whatever
it's
guarding
hagrid
dropped
the
teapot
how
do
you
know
about
Fluffy
he
said
fluffy
yeah
he's
mine
bought
him
off
a
Greek
chappie
I
met
in
the
pub
las
year
I
lent
him
to
Dumbledore
to
guard
the
Yes
said
Harry
eagerly
now
don't
ask
me
anymore
said
Hagrid
gruffly
that's
top
secret
that
is
but
snape's
trying
to
steal
it
rubbish
said
Hagrid
again
snape's
a
Hogwarts
teacher
he'd
do
nothin
of
the
sort
so
why
did
he
just
try
and
kill
Harry
cried
Hermione
the
afternoon's
events
certainly
seemed
to
have
changed
her
mind
about
Snape
i
know
a
jinx
when
I
see
one
Hagrid
i've
read
all
about
them
you've
got
to
keep
eye
contact
and
Snape
wasn't
blinking
at
all
I
saw
him
i'm
tellin
yeh
yer
wrong
said
Hagrid
hotly
i
don
know
why
harry's
broom
acted
like
that
but
Snape
wouldn
try
an
kill
a
student
now
listen
to
me
all
three
of
yeh
yer
meddlin
in
things
that
don
concern
yeh
it's
dangerous
you
forget
that
dog
an
you
forget
what
it's
guardin
that's
between
Professor
Dumbledore
an
Nicolas
Flamel
aha
said
Harry
so
there's
someone
called
Nicolas
Flamel
involved
is
there
hagrid
looked
furious
with
himself
chapter
twelve
the
mirror
of
erised
christmas
was
coming
one
morning
in
mid-December
Hogwarts
woke
to
find
itself
covered
in
several
feet
of
snow
the
lake
froze
solid
and
the
Weasley
twins
were
punished
for
bewitching
several
snowballs
so
that
they
followed
Quirrell
around
bouncing
off
the
back
of
his
turban
the
few
owls
that
managed
to
battle
their
way
through
the
stormy
sky
to
deliver
mail
had
to
be
nursed
back
to
health
by
Hagrid
before
they
could
fly
off
again
no
one
could
wait
for
the
holidays
to
start
while
the
Gryffindor
common
room
and
the
Great
Hall
had
roaring
fires
the
drafty
corridors
had
become
icy
and
a
bitter
wind
rattled
the
windows
in
the
classrooms
worst
of
all
were
Professor
snape's
classes
down
in
the
dungeons
where
their
breath
rose
in
a
mist
before
them
and
they
kept
as
close
as
possible
to
their
hot
cauldrons
i
do
feel
so
sorry
said
Draco
Malfoy
one
Potions
class
for
all
those
people
who
have
to
stay
at
Hogwarts
for
Christmas
because
they're
not
wanted
at
home
he
was
looking
over
at
Harry
as
he
spoke
crabbe
and
Goyle
chuckled
harry
who
was
measuring
out
powdered
spine
of
lionfish
ignored
them
malfoy
had
been
even
more
unpleasant
than
usual
since
the
Quidditch
match
disgusted
that
the
Slytherins
had
lost
he
had
tried
to
get
everyone
laughing
at
how
a
wide-mouthed
tree
frog
would
be
replacing
Harry
as
Seeker
next
then
he'd
realized
that
nobody
found
this
funny
because
they
were
all
so
impressed
at
the
way
Harry
had
managed
to
stay
on
his
bucking
broomstick
so
Malfoy
jealous
and
angry
had
gone
back
to
taunting
Harry
about
having
no
proper
family
it
was
true
that
Harry
wasn't
going
back
to
Privet
Drive
for
Christmas
professor
McGonagall
had
come
around
the
week
before
making
a
list
of
students
who
would
be
staying
for
the
holidays
and
Harry
had
signed
up
at
once
he
didn't
feel
sorry
for
himself
at
all
this
would
probably
be
the
best
Christmas
he'd
ever
had
ron
and
his
brothers
were
staying
too
because
mr.
and
Mrs
weasley
were
going
to
Romania
to
visit
Charlie
when
they
left
the
dungeons
at
the
end
of
Potions
they
found
a
large
fir
tree
blocking
the
corridor
ahead
two
enormous
feet
sticking
out
at
the
bottom
and
a
loud
puffing
sound
told
them
that
Hagrid
was
behind
it
hi
Hagrid
want
any
help
ron
asked
sticking
his
head
through
the
branches
nah
i'm
all
right
thanks
Ron
would
you
mind
moving
out
of
the
way
came
Malfoys
cold
drawl
from
behind
them
are
you
trying
to
earn
some
extra
money
Weasley
hoping
to
be
gamekeeper
yourself
when
you
leave
Hogwarts
I
suppose
that
hut
of
hagrid's
must
seem
like
a
palace
compared
to
what
your
family's
used
to
ron
dived
at
Malfoy
just
as
Snape
came
up
the
stairs
weasley
ron
let
go
of
the
front
of
malfoy's
robes
he
was
provoked
Professor
Snape
said
Hagrid
sticking
his
huge
hairy
face
out
from
behind
the
tree
malfoy
was
insultin
his
family
be
that
as
it
may
fighting
is
against
Hogwarts
rules
Hagrid
said
Snape
silkily
five
points
from
Gryffindor
Weasley
and
be
grateful
it
isn't
more
move
along
all
of
you
malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
pushed
roughly
past
the
tree
scattering
needles
everywhere
and
smirking
i'll
get
him
said
Ron
grinding
his
teeth
at
malfoy's
back
one
of
these
days
i'll
get
him
i
hate
them
both
said
Harry
Malfoy
and
Snape
come
on
cheer
up
it's
nearly
Christmas
said
Hagrid
tell
yeh
what
come
with
me
an
see
the
Great
Hall
looks
a
treat
so
the
three
of
them
followed
Hagrid
and
his
tree
off
to
the
Great
Hall
where
Professor
McGonagall
and
Professor
Flitwick
were
busy
with
the
Christmas
decorations
ah
Hagrid
the
last
tree
put
it
in
the
far
corner
would
you
the
hall
looked
spectacular
festoons
of
holly
and
mistletoe
hung
all
around
the
walls
and
no
less
than
twelve
towering
Christmas
trees
stood
around
the
room
some
sparkling
with
tiny
icicles
some
glittering
with
hundreds
of
candles
how
many
days
you
got
left
until
yer
holidays
hagrid
asked
just
one
said
Hermione
and
that
reminds
me
Harry
Ron
we've
got
half
an
hour
before
lunch
we
should
be
in
the
library
oh
yeah
you're
right
said
Ron
tearing
his
eyes
away
from
Professor
Flitwick
who
had
golden
bubbles
blossoming
out
of
his
wand
and
was
trailing
them
over
the
branches
of
the
new
tree
the
library
said
Hagrid
following
them
out
of
the
hall
just
before
the
holidays
bit
keen
aren't
yeh
oh
we're
not
working
Harry
told
him
brightly
ever
since
you
mentioned
Nicolas
Flamel
we've
been
trying
to
find
out
who
he
is
you
what
hagrid
looked
shocked
listen
here
i've
told
yeh
drop
it
it's
nothin
to
you
what
that
dog's
guardin
we
just
want
to
know
who
Nicolas
Flamel
is
that's
all
said
Hermione
unless
you'd
like
to
tell
us
and
save
us
the
trouble
harry
added
we
must've
been
through
hundreds
of
books
already
and
we
can't
find
him
anywhere
just
give
us
a
hint
I
know
i've
read
his
name
somewhere
i'm
sayin
nothin
said
Hagrid
flatly
just
have
to
find
out
for
ourselves
then
said
Ron
and
they
left
Hagrid
looking
disgruntled
and
hurried
off
to
the
library
they
had
indeed
been
searching
books
for
flamel's
name
ever
since
Hagrid
had
let
it
slip
because
how
else
were
they
going
to
find
out
what
Snape
was
trying
to
steal
the
trouble
was
it
was
very
hard
to
know
where
to
begin
not
knowing
what
Flamel
might
have
done
to
get
himself
into
a
book
he
wasn't
in
Great
Wizards
of
the
Twentieth
Century
or
Notable
Magical
Names
of
Our
Time
he
was
missing
too
from
Important
Modern
Magical
Discoveries
and
A
Study
of
Recent
Developments
in
Wizardry
and
then
of
course
there
was
the
sheer
size
of
the
library
tens
of
thousands
of
books
thousands
of
shelves
hundreds
of
narrow
rows
hermione
took
out
a
list
of
subjects
and
titles
she
had
decided
to
search
while
Ron
strode
off
down
a
row
of
books
and
started
pulling
them
off
the
shelves
at
random
harry
wandered
over
to
the
Restricted
Section
he
had
been
wondering
for
a
while
if
Flamel
wasn't
somewhere
in
there
unfortunately
you
needed
a
specially
signed
note
from
one
of
the
teachers
to
look
in
any
of
the
restricted
books
and
he
knew
he'd
never
get
one
these
were

what
are
you
looking
for
boy
nothing
said
Harry
madam
Pince
the
librarian
brandished
a
feather
duster
at
him
you'd
better
get
out
then
go
on
out
wishing
he'd
been
a
bit
quicker
at
thinking
up
some
story
Harry
left
the
library
he
Ron
and
Hermione
had
already
agreed
they'd
better
not
ask
Madam
Pince
where
they
could
find
Flamel
they
were
sure
she'd
be
able
to
tell
them
but
they
couldn't
risk
Snape
hearing
what
they
were
up
to
harry
waited
outside
in
the
corridor
to
see
if
the
other
two
had
found
anything
but
he
wasn't
very
hopeful
they
had
been
looking
for
two
weeks
after
A
but
as
they
only
had
odd
moments
between
lessons
it
wasn't
surprising
they'd
found
nothing
what
they
really
needed
was
a
nice
long
search
without
Madam
Pince
breathing
down
their
necks
five
minutes
later
Ron
and
Hermione
joined
him
shaking
their
heads
they
went
off
to
lunch
you
will
keep
looking
while
i'm
away
won't
you
said
Hermione
and
send
me
an
owl
if
you
find
anything
and
you
could
ask
your
parents
if
they
know
who
Flamel
is
said
Ron
it'd
be
safe
to
ask
them
very
safe
as
they're
both
dentists
said
Hermione
once
the
holidays
had
started
Ron
and
Harry
were
having
too
good
a
time
to
think
much
about
Flamel
they
had
the
dormitory
to
themselves
and
the
common
room
was
far
emptier
than
usual
so
they
were
able
to
get
the
good
armchairs
by
the
fire
they
sat
by
the
hour
eating
anything
they
could
spear
on
a
toasting
fork
bread
English
muffins
marshmallows
and
plotting
ways
of
getting
Malfoy
expelled
which
were
fun
to
talk
about
even
if
they
wouldn't
work
ron
also
started
teaching
Harry
wizard
chess
this
was
exactly
like
Muggle
chess
except
that
the
figures
were
alive
which
made
it
a
lot
like
directing
troops
in
battle
ron's
set
was
very
old
and
battered
like
everything
else
he
owned
it
had
once
belonged
to
someone
else
in
his
family
in
this
case
his
grandfather
however
old
chessmen
weren't
a
drawback
at
all
ron
knew
them
so
well
he
never
had
trouble
getting
them
to
do
what
he
wanted
harry
played
with
chessmen
Seamus
Finnigan
had
lent
him
and
they
didn't
trust
him
at
all
he
wasn't
a
very
good
player
yet
and
they
kept
shouting
different
bits
of
advice
at
him
which
was
confusing
don't
send
me
there
can't
you
see
his
knight
send
him
we
can
afford
to
lose
him
on
Christmas
Eve
Harry
went
to
bed
looking
forward
to
the
next
day
for
the
food
and
the
fun
but
not
expecting
any
presents
at
all
when
he
woke
early
in
the
morning
however
the
first
thing
he
saw
was
a
small
pile
of
packages
at
the
foot
of
his
bed
merry
Christmas
said
Ron
sleepily
as
Harry
scrambled
out
of
bed
and
pulled
on
his
bathrobe
you
too
said
Harry
will
you
look
at
this
i've
got
some
presents
what
did
you
expect
turnips
said
Ron
turning
to
his
own
pile
which
was
a
lot
bigger
than
harry's
harry
picked
up
the
top
parcel
it
was
wrapped
in
thick
brown
paper
and
scrawled
across
it
was
To
Harry
from
Hagrid
inside
was
a
roughly
cut
wooden
flute
hagrid
had
obviously
whittled
it
himself
harry
blew
it
it
sounded
a
bit
like
an
owl
a
second
very
small
parcel
contained
a
note
we
received
your
message
and
enclose
your
Christmas
present
from
Uncle
Vernon
and
Aunt
Petunia
taped
to
the
note
was
a
fifty-pence
piece
that's
friendly
said
Harry
ron
was
fascinated
by
the
fifty
pence
weird
he
said
NMat
a
shape
this
is
money
you
can
keep
it
said
Harry
laughing
at
how
pleased
Ron
was
hagrid
and
my
aunt
and
uncle
so
who
sent
these
i
think
I
know
who
that
one's
from
said
Ron
turning
a
bit
pink
and
pointing
to
a
very
lumpy
parcel
my
mom
i
told
her
you
didn't
expect
any
presents
and
oh
no
he
groaned
she's
made
you
a
Weasley
sweater
harry
had
torn
open
the
parcel
to
find
a
thick
hand-knitted
sweater
in
emerald
green
and
a
large
box
of
homemade
fudge
every
year
she
makes
us
a
sweater
said
Ron
unwrapping
his
own
and
mine's
always
maroon
that's
really
nice
of
her
said
Harry
trying
the
fudge
which
was
very
tasty
his
next
present
also
contained
candy
a
large
box
of
Chocolate
Frogs
from
Hermione
this
only
left
one
parcel
harry
picked
it
up
and
felt
it
it
was
very
light
he
unwrapped
it
something
fluid
and
silvery
gray
went
slithering
to
the
floor
where
it
lay
in
gleaming
folds
ron
gasped
i've
heard
of
those
he
said
in
a
hushed
voice
dropping
the
box
of
Every
Flavor
Beans
he'd
gotten
from
Hermione
if
that's
what
I
think
it
is
they're
really
rare
and
really
valuable
what
is
it
harry
picked
the
shining
silvery
cloth
off
the
floor
it
was
strange
to
the
touch
like
water
woven
into
material
it's
an
invisibility
cloak
said
Ron
a
look
of
awe
on
his
face
i'm
sure
it
is
try
it
on
harry
threw
the
cloak
around
his
shoulders
and
Ron
gave
a
yell
it
is
look
down
harry
looked
down
at
his
feet
but
they
were
gone
he
dashed
to
the
mirror
sure
enough
his
reflection
looked
back
at
him
just
his
head
suspended
in
midair
his
body
completely
invisible
he
pulled
the
cloak
over
his
head
and
his
reflection
vanished
completely
there's
a
note
said
Ron
suddenly
a
note
fell
out
of
it
harry
pulled
off
the
cloak
and
seized
the
letter
written
in
narrow
loopy
writing
he
had
never
seen
before
were
the
following
words
Your
father
left
this
in
my
possession
before
he
died
it
is
time
it
was
returned
to
you
use
it
well
a
Very
Merry
Christmas
to
you
there
was
no
signature
harry
stared
at
the
note
ron
was
admiring
the
cloak
i'd
give
anything
for
one
of
these
he
said
anything
what's
the
matter
nothing
said
Harry
he
felt
very
strange
who
had
sent
the
cloak
had
it
really
once
belonged
to
his
father
before
he
could
say
or
think
anything
else
the
dormitory
door
was
flung
open
and
Fred
and
George
Weasley
bounded
in
harry
stuffed
the
cloak
quickly
out
of
sight
he
didn't
feel
like
sharing
it
with
anyone
else
yet
merry
Christmas
hey
look
harry's
got
a
Weasley
sweater
too
fred
and
George
were
wearing
blue
sweaters
one
with
a
large
yellow
F
on
it
the
other
a
G
harry's
is
better
than
ours
though
said
Fred
holding
up
harry's
sweater
she
obviously
makes
more
of
an
effort
if
you're
not
family
why
aren't
you
wearing
yours
Ron
george
demanded
come
on
get
it
on
they're
lovely
and
warm
i
hate
maroon
Ron
moaned
halfheartedly
as
he
pulled
it
over
his
head
you
haven't
got
a
letter
on
yours
George
observed
i
suppose
she
thinks
you
don't
forget
your
name
but
we're
not
stupid
we
know
we're
called
Gred
and
Forge
what's
all
th
is
noise
percy
Weasley
stuck
his
head
through
the
door
looking
disapproving
he
had
clearly
gotten
halfway
through
unwrapping
his
presents
as
he
too
carried
a
lumpy
sweater
over
his
arm
which
Fred
seized
p
for
prefect
get
it
on
Percy
come
on
we're
all
wearing
ours
even
Harry
got
one
i
don't
want
said
Percy
thickly
as
the
twins
forced
the
sweater
over
his
head
knocking
his
glasses
askew
and
you're
not
sitting
with
the
prefects
today
either
said
George
christmas
is
a
time
for
family
they
frog-marched
Percy
from
the
room
his
arms
pinned
to
his
side
by
his
sweater
harry
had
never
in
all
his
life
had
such
a
Christmas
dinner
a
hundred
fat
roast
turkeys
mountains
of
roast
and
boiled
potatoes
platters
of
chipolatas
tureens
of
buttered
peas
silver
boats
of
thick
rich
gravy
and
cranberry
sauce
and
stacks
of
wizard
crackers
every
few
feet
along
the
table
these
fantastic
party
favors
were
nothing
like
the
feeble
Muggle
ones
the
Dursleys
usually
bought
with
their
little
plastic
toys
and
their
flimsy
paper
hats
inside
harry
pulled
a
wizard
cracker
with
Fred
and
it
didn't
just
bang
it
went
off
with
a
blast
like
a
cannon
and
engulfed
them
all
in
a
cloud
of
blue
smoke
while
from
the
inside
exploded
a
rear
admiral's
hat
and
several
live
white
mice
up
at
the
High
Table
Dumbledore
had
swapped
his
pointed
wizard's
hat
for
a
flowered
bonnet
and
was
chuckling
merrily
at
a
joke
Professor
Flitwick
had
just
read
him
flaming
Christmas
puddings
followed
the
turkey
percy
nearly
broke
his
teeth
on
a
silver
sickle
embedded
in
his
slice
harry
watched
Hagrid
getting
redder
and
redder
in
the
face
as
he
called
for
more
wine
finally
kissing
Professor
McGonagall
on
the
cheek
who
to
harry's
amazement
giggled
and
blushed
her
top
hat
lopsided
when
Harry
finally
left
the
table
he
was
laden
down
with
a
stack
of
things
out
of
the
crackers
including
a
pack
of
nonexplodable
luminous
balloons
a
Grow-Your-Own-Warts
kit
and
his
own
new
wizard
chess
set
the
white
mice
had
disappeared
and
Harry
had
a
nasty
feeling
they
were
going
to
end
up
as
Mrs
norris's
Christmas
dinner
harry
and
the
Weasleys
spent
a
happy
afternoon
having
a
furious
snowball
fight
on
the
grounds
then
cold
wet
and
gasping
for
breath
they
returned
to
the
fire
in
the
Gryffindor
common
room
where
Harry
broke
in
his
new
chess
set
by
losing
spectacularly
to
Ron
he
suspected
he
wouldn't
have
lost
so
badly
if
Percy
hadn't
tried
to
help
him
so
much
after
a
meal
of
turkey
sandwiches
crumpets
trifle
and
Christmas
cake
everyone
felt
too
full
and
sleepy
to
do
much
before
bed
except
sit
and
watch
Percy
chase
Fred
and
George
all
over
Gryffindor
tower
because
they'd
stolen
his
prefect
badge
it
had
been
harry's
best
Christmas
day
ever
yet
something
had
been
nagging
at
the
back
of
his
mind
all
day
not
until
he
climbed
into
bed
was
he
free
to
think
about
it
the
invisibility
cloak
and
whoever
had
sent
it
ron
full
of
turkey
and
cake
and
with
nothing
mysterious
to
bother
him
fell
asleep
almost
as
soon
as
he'd
drawn
the
curtains
of
his
four-poster
harry
leaned
over
the
side
of
his
own
bed
and
pulled
the
cloak
out
from
under
it
his
father's
this
had
been
his
father's
he
let
the
material
flow
over
his
hands
smoother
than
silk
light
as
air
use
it
well
the
note
had
said
he
had
to
try
it
now
he
slipped
out
of
bed
and
wrapped
the
cloak
around
himself
looking
down
at
his
legs
he
saw
only
moonlight
and
shadows
it
was
a
very
funny
feeling
use
it
well
suddenly
Harry
felt
wide-awake
the
whole
of
Hogwarts
was
open
to
him
in
this
cloak
excitement
flooded
through
him
as
he
stood
there
in
the
dark
and
silence
he
could
go
anywhere
in
this
anywhere
and
Filch
would
never
know
ron
grunted
in
his
sleep
should
Harry
wake
him
something
held
him
back
his
father's
cloak
he
felt
that
this
time
the
first
time
he
wanted
to
use
it
alone
he
crept
out
of
the
dormitory
down
the
stairs
across
the
common
room
and
climbed
through
the
portrait
hole
who's
there
squawked
the
Fat
Lady
harry
said
nothing
he
walked
quickly
down
the
corridor
where
should
he
go
he
stopped
his
heart
racing
and
thought
and
then
it
came
to
him
the
Restricted
Section
in
the
library
he'd
be
able
to
read
as
long
as
he
liked
as
long
as
it
took
to
find
out
who
Flamel
was
he
set
off
drawing
the
invisibility
cloak
tight
around
him
as
he
walked
the
library
was
pitch-black
and
very
eerie
harry
lit
a
lamp
to
see
his
way
along
the
rows
of
books
the
lamp
looked
as
if
it
was
floating
along
in
midair
and
even
though
Harry
could
feel
his
arm
supporting
it
the
sight
gave
him
the
creeps
the
Restricted
Section
was
right
at
the
back
of
the
library
step
ping
carefully
over
the
rope
that
separated
these
books
from
the
rest
of
the
library
he
held
up
his
lamp
to
read
the
titles
they
didn't
tell
him
much
their
peeling
faded
gold
letters
spelled
words
in
languages
Harry
couldn't
understand
some
had
no
title
at
all
one
book
had
a
dark
stain
on
it
that
looked
horribly
like
blood
the
hairs
on
the
back
of
harry's
neck
prickled
maybe
he
was
imagining
it
maybe
not
but
he
thought
a
faint
whispering
was
coming
from
the
books
as
though
they
knew
someone
was
there
who
shouldn't
be
he
had
to
start
somewhere
setting
the
lamp
down
carefully
on
the
floor
he
looked
along
the
bottom
shelf
for
an
interestinglooking
book
a
large
black
and
silver
volume
caught
his
eye
he
pulled
it
out
with
difficulty
because
it
was
very
heavy
and
balancing
it
on
his
knee
let
it
fall
open
a
piercing
bloodcurdling
shriek
split
the
silence
the
book
was
screaming
harry
snapped
it
shut
but
the
shriek
went
on
and
on
one
high
unbroken
earsplitting
note
he
stumbled
backward
and
knocked
over
his
lamp
which
went
out
at
once
panicking
he
heard
footsteps
coming
down
the
corridor
outside
stuffing
the
shrieking
book
back
on
the
shelf
he
ran
for
it
he
passed
Filch
in
the
doorway
filch's
pale
wild
eyes
looked
straight
through
him
and
Harry
slipped
under
filch's
outstretched
arm
and
streaked
off
up
the
corridor
the
book's
shrieks
still
ringing
in
his
ears
he
came
to
a
sudden
halt
in
front
of
a
tall
suit
of
armor
he
had
been
so
busy
getting
away
from
the
library
he
hadn't
paid
attention
to
where
he
was
going
perhaps
because
it
was
dark
he
didn't
recognize
where
he
was
at
all
there
was
a
suit
of
armor
near
the
kitchens
he
knew
but
he
must
be
five
floors
above
there
you
asked
me
to
come
directly
to
you
Professor
if
anyone
was
wandering
around
at
night
and
somebody's
been
in
the
library
Restricted
Section
harry
felt
the
blood
drain
out
of
his
face
wherever
he
was
Filch
must
know
a
shortcut
because
his
soft
greasy
voice
was
getting
nearer
and
to
his
horror
it
was
Snape
who
replied
The
Restricted
Section
well
they
can't
be
far
we'll
catch
them
harry
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
as
Filch
and
Snape
came
around
the
corner
ahead
they
couldn't
see
him
of
course
but
it
was
a
narrow
corridor
and
if
they
came
much
nearer
they'd
knock
right
into
him
the
cloak
didn't
stop
him
from
being
solid
he
backed
away
as
quietly
as
he
could
a
door
stood
ajar
to
his
left
it
was
his
only
hope
he
squeezed
through
it
holding
his
breath
trying
not
to
move
it
and
to
his
relief
he
managed
to
get
inside
the
room
without
their
noticing
anything
they
walked
straight
past
and
Harry
leaned
against
the
wall
breathing
deeply
listening
to
their
footsteps
dying
away
that
had
been
close
very
close
it
was
a
few
seconds
before
he
noticed
anything
about
the
room
he
had
hidden
in
it
looked
like
an
unused
classroom
the
dark
shapes
of
desks
and
chairs
were
piled
against
the
walls
and
there
was
an
upturned
wastepaper
basket
but
propped
against
the
wall
facing
him
was
something
that
didn't
look
as
if
it
belonged
there
something
that
looked
as
if
someone
had
just
put
it
there
to
keep
it
out
of
the
way
it
was
a
magnificent
mirror
as
high
as
the
ceiling
with
an
ornate
gold
frame
standing
on
two
clawed
feet
there
was
an
inscription
carved
around
the
top
Erised
stra
ehru
oyt
ube
cafru
oyt
on
wohsi
his
panic
fading
now
that
there
was
no
sound
of
Filch
and
Snape
Harry
moved
nearer
to
the
mirror
wanting
to
look
at
himself
but
see
no
reflection
again
he
stepped
in
front
of
it
he
had
to
clap
his
hands
to
his
mouth
to
stop
himself
from
screaming
he
whirled
around
his
heart
was
pounding
far
more
furiously
than
when
the
book
had
screamed
for
he
had
seen
not
only
himself
in
the
mirror
but
a
whole
crowd
of
people
standing
right
behind
him
but
the
room
was
empty
breathing
very
fast
he
turned
slowly
back
to
the
mirror
there
he
was
reflected
in
it
white
and
scared-looking
and
there
reflected
behind
him
were
at
least
ten
others
harry
looked
over
his
shoulder
but
still
no
one
was
there
or
were
they
all
invisible
too
was
he
in
fact
in
a
room
full
of
invisible
people
and
this
mirror's
trick
was
that
it
reflected
them
invisible
or
not
he
looked
in
the
mirror
again
a
woman
standing
right
behind
his
reflection
was
smiling
at
him
and
waving
he
reached
out
a
hand
and
felt
the
air
behind
him
if
she
was
really
there
he'd
touch
her
their
reflections
were
so
close
together
but
he
felt
only
air
she
and
the
others
existed
only
in
the
mirror
she
was
a
very
pretty
woman
she
had
dark
red
hair
and
her
eyes
her
eyes
are
just
like
mine
Harry
thought
edging
a
little
closer
to
the
glass
bright
green
exactly
the
same
shape
but
then
he
noticed
that
she
was
crying
smiling
but
crying
at
the
same
time
the
tall
thin
black-haired
man
standing
next
to
her
put
his
arm
around
her
he
wore
glasses
and
his
hair
was
very
untidy
it
stuck
up
at
the
back
just
as
harry's
did
harry
was
so
close
to
the
mirror
now
that
his
nose
was
nearly
touching
that
of
his
reflection
mom
he
whispered
dad
they
just
looked
at
him
smiling
and
slowly
Harry
looked
into
the
faces
of
the
other
people
in
the
mirror
and
saw
other
pairs
of
green
eyes
like
his
other
noses
like
his
even
a
little
old
man
who
looked
as
though
he
had
harry's
knobbly
knees
Harry
was
looking
at
his
family
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
the
Potters
smiled
and
waved
at
Harry
and
he
stared
hungrily
back
at
them
his
hands
pressed
flat
against
the
glass
as
though
he
was
hoping
to
fall
right
through
it
and
reach
them
he
had
a
powerful
kind
of
ache
inside
him
half
joy
half
terrible
sadness
how
long
he
stood
there
he
didn't
know
the
reflections
did
not
fade
and
he
looked
and
looked
until
a
distant
noise
brought
him
back
to
his
senses
he
couldn't
stay
here
he
had
to
find
his
way
back
to
bed
he
tore
his
eyes
away
from
his
mother's
face
whispered
i'll
come
back
and
hurried
from
the
room
you
could
have
woken
me
up
said
Ron
crossly
you
can
come
tonight
i'm
going
back
I
want
to
show
you
the
mirror
i'd
like
to
see
your
mom
and
dad
Ron
said
eagerly
and
I
want
to
see
all
your
family
all
the
Weasleys
you'll
be
able
to
show
me
your
other
brothers
and
everyone
you
can
see
them
any
old
time
said
Ron
just
come
round
my
house
this
summer
anyway
maybe
it
only
shows
dead
people
shame
about
not
finding
Flamel
though
have
some
bacon
or
something
why
aren't
you
eating
anything
harry
couldn't
eat
he
had
seen
his
parents
and
would
be
seeing
them
again
tonight
he
had
almost
forgotten
about
Flamel
it
didn't
seem
very
important
anymore
who
cared
what
the
three
headed
dog
was
guarding
what
did
it
matter
if
Snape
stole
it
really
are
you
all
right
said
Ron
you
look
odd
what
Harry
feared
most
was
that
he
might
not
be
able
to
find
the
mirror
room
again
with
Ron
covered
in
the
cloak
too
they
had
to
walk
much
more
slowly
the
next
night
they
tried
retracing
harry's
route
from
the
library
wandering
around
the
dark
passageways
for
nearly
an
hour
i'm
freezing
said
Ron
let's
forget
it
and
go
back
no
harry
hissed
i
know
it's
here
somewhere
they
passed
the
ghost
of
a
tall
witch
gliding
in
the
opposite
direction
but
saw
no
one
else
just
as
Ron
started
moaning
that
his
feet
were
dead
with
cold
Harry
spotted
the
suit
of
armor
it's
here
just
here
yes
they
pushed
the
door
open
harry
dropped
the
cloak
from
around
his
shoulders
and
ran
to
the
mirror
there
they
were
his
mother
and
father
beamed
at
the
sight
of
him
see
harry
whispered
i
can't
see
anything
look
look
at
them
all
there
are
loads
of
them
i
can
only
see
you
look
in
it
properly
go
on
stand
where
I
am
harry
stepped
aside
but
with
Ron
in
front
of
the
mirror
he
couldn't
see
his
family
anymore
just
Ron
in
his
paisley
pajamas
ron
though
was
staring
transfixed
at
his
image
look
at
me
he
said
can
you
see
all
your
family
standing
around
you
no
i'm
alone
but
i'm
different
I
look
older
and
i'm
head
boy
what
i
am
i'm
wearing
the
badge
like
Bill
used
to
and
i'm
holding
the
house
cup
and
the
Quidditch
cup
i'm
Quidditch
captain
too
ron
tore
his
eyes
away
from
this
splendid
sight
to
look
excitedly
at
Harry
do
you
think
this
mirror
shows
the
future
how
can
it
all
my
family
are
dead
let
me
have
another
look
you
had
it
to
yourself
all
last
night
give
me
a
bit
more
time
you're
only
holding
the
Quidditch
cup
what's
interesting
about
that
i
want
to
see
my
parents
don't
push
me
a
sudden
noise
outside
in
the
corridor
put
an
end
to
their
discussion
they
hadn't
realized
how
loudly
they
had
been
talking
quick
ron
threw
the
cloak
back
over
them
as
the
luminous
eyes
of
Mrs
norris
came
round
the
door
ron
and
Harry
stood
quite
still
both
thinking
the
same
thing
did
the
cloak
work
on
cats
after
what
seemed
an
age
she
turned
and
left
this
isn't
safe
she
might
have
gone
for
Filch
I
bet
she
heard
us
come
on
and
Ron
pulled
Harry
out
of
the
room
the
snow
still
hadn't
melted
the
next
morning
want
to
play
chess
Harry
said
Ron
no
why
don't
we
go
down
and
visit
Hagrid
no
you
go
i
know
what
you're
thinking
about
Harry
that
mirror
don't
go
back
tonight
why
not
i
dunno
i've
just
got
a
bad
feeling
about
it
and
anyway
you've
had
too
many
close
shaves
already
filch
Snape
and
Mrs
norris
are
wandering
around
so
what
if
they
can't
see
you
what
if
they
walk
into
you
what
if
you
knock
something
over
you
sound
like
Hermione
i'm
serious
Harry
don't
go
but
Harry
only
had
one
thought
in
his
head
which
was
to
get
back
in
front
of
the
mirror
and
Ron
wasn't
going
to
stop
him
that
third
night
he
found
his
way
more
quickly
than
before
he
was
walking
so
fast
he
knew
he
was
making
more
noise
than
was
wise
but
he
didn't
meet
anyone
and
there
were
his
mother
and
father
smiling
at
him
again
and
one
of
his
grandfathers
nodding
happily
harry
sank
down
to
sit
on
the
floor
in
front
of
the
mirror
there
was
nothing
to
stop
him
from
staying
here
all
night
with
his
family
nothing
at
all
except
So
back
again
Harry
harry
felt
as
though
his
insides
had
turned
to
ice
he
looked
behind
him
sitting
on
one
of
the
desks
by
the
wall
was
none
other
than
Albus
Dumbledore
harry
must
have
walked
straight
past
him
so
desperate
to
get
to
the
mirror
he
hadn't
noticed
him
I
didn't
see
you
sir
strange
how
nearsighted
being
invisible
can
make
you
said
Dumbledore
and
Harry
was
relieved
to
see
that
he
was
smiling
so
said
Dumbledore
slipping
off
the
desk
to
sit
on
the
floor
with
Harry
you
like
hundreds
before
you
have
discovered
the
delights
of
the
Mirror
of
Erised
i
didn't
know
it
was
called
that
Sir
but
I
expect
you've
realized
by
now
what
it
does
it
well
it
shows
me
my
family
and
it
showed
your
friend
Ron
himself
as
head
boy
how
did
you
know
i
don't
need
a
cloak
to
become
invisible
said
Dumbledore
gently
now
can
you
think
what
the
Mirror
of
Erised
shows
us
all
harry
shook
his
head
let
me
explain
the
happiest
man
on
earth
would
be
able
to
use
the
Mirror
of
Erised
like
a
normal
mirror
that
is
he
would
look
into
it
and
see
himself
exactly
as
he
is
does
that
help
harry
thought
then
he
said
slowly
It
shows
us
what
we
want
whatever
we
want
yes
and
no
said
Dumbledore
quietly
it
shows
us
nothing
more
or
less
than
the
deepest
most
desperate
desire
of
our
hearts
you
who
have
never
known
your
family
see
them
standing
around
you
ronald
Weasley
who
has
always
been
overshadowed
by
his
brothers
sees
himself
standing
alone
the
best
of
all
of
them
however
this
mirror
will
give
us
neither
knowledge
or
truth
men
have
wasted
away
before
it
entranced
by
what
they
have
seen
or
been
driven
mad
not
knowing
if
what
it
shows
is
real
or
even
possible
the
Mirror
will
be
moved
to
a
new
home
tomorrow
Harry
and
I
ask
you
not
to
go
looking
for
it
again
if
you
ever
do
run
across
it
you
will
now
be
prepared
it
does
not
do
to
dwell
on
dreams
and
forget
to
live
remember
that
now
why
don't
you
put
that
admirable
cloak
back
on
and
get
off
to
bed
harry
stood
up
sir
Professor
Dumbledore
can
I
ask
you
something
obviously
you've
just
done
so
Dumbledore
smiled
you
may
ask
me
one
more
thing
however
what
do
you
see
when
you
look
in
the
mirror
i
see
myself
holding
a
pair
of
thick
woolen
socks
harry
stared
one
can
never
have
enough
socks
said
Dumbledore
another
Christmas
has
come
and
gone
and
I
didn't
get
a
single
pair
people
will
insist
on
giving
me
books
it
was
only
when
he
was
back
in
bed
that
it
struck
Harry
that
Dumbledore
might
not
have
been
quite
truthful
but
then
he
thought
as
he
shoved
Scabbers
off
his
pillow
it
had
been
quite
a
personal
question
chapter
thirteen
nicolas
flamel
dumbledore
had
convinced
Harry
not
to
go
looking
for
the
Mirror
of
Erised
again
and
for
the
rest
of
the
Christmas
holidays
the
invisibility
cloak
stayed
folded
at
the
bottom
of
his
trunk
harry
wished
he
could
forget
what
he'd
seen
in
the
mirror
as
easily
but
he
couldn't
he
started
having
nightmares
over
and
over
again
he
dreamed
about
his
parents
disappearing
in
a
flash
of
green
light
while
a
high
voice
cackled
with
laughter
you
see
Dumbledore
was
right
that
mirror
could
drive
you
mad
said
Ron
when
Harry
told
him
about
these
drearns
hermione
who
came
back
the
day
before
term
started
took
a
different
view
of
things
she
was
torn
between
horror
at
the
idea
of
Harry
being
out
of
bed
roaming
the
school
three
nights
in
a
row
If
Filch
had
caught
you
and
disappointment
that
he
hadn't
at
least
found
out
who
Nicolas
Flamel
was
they
had
almost
given
up
hope
of
ever
finding
Flamel
in
a
li
brary
book
even
though
Harry
was
still
sure
he'd
read
the
name
somewhere
once
term
had
started
they
were
back
to
skimming
through
books
for
ten
minutes
during
their
breaks
harry
had
even
less
time
than
the
other
two
because
Quidditch
practice
had
started
again
wood
was
working
the
team
harder
than
ever
even
the
endless
rain
that
had
replaced
the
snow
couldn't
dampen
his
spirits
the
Weasleys
complained
that
Wood
was
becoming
a
fanatic
but
Harry
was
on
wood's
side
if
they
won
their
next
match
against
Hufflepuff
they
would
overtake
Slytherin
in
the
house
championship
for
the
first
time
in
seven
years
quite
apart
from
wanting
to
win
Harry
found
that
he
had
fewer
nightmares
when
he
was
tired
out
after
training
then
during
one
particularly
wet
and
muddy
practice
session
Wood
gave
the
team
a
bit
of
bad
news
he'd
just
gotten
very
angry
with
the
Weasleys
who
kept
dive-bombing
each
other
and
pretending
to
fall
off
their
brooms
will
you
stop
messing
around
he
yelled
that's
exactly
the
sort
of
thing
that'll
lose
us
the
match
snape's
refereeing
this
time
and
he'll
be
looking
for
any
excuse
to
knock
points
off
Gryffindor
george
Weasley
really
did
fall
off
his
broom
at
these
words
snape's
refereeing
he
spluttered
through
a
mouthful
of
mud
when's
he
ever
refereed
a
Quidditch
match
he's
not
going
to
be
fair
if
we
might
overtake
Slytherin
the
rest
of
the
team
landed
next
to
George
to
complain
too
it's
not
my
fault
said
Wood
we've
just
got
to
make
sure
we
play
a
clean
game
so
Snape
hasn't
got
an
excuse
to
pick
on
us
which
was
all
very
well
thought
Harry
but
he
had
another
reason
for
not
wanting
Snape
near
him
while
he
was
playing
Quidditch
the
rest
of
the
team
hung
back
to
talk
to
one
another
as
usual
at
the
end
of
practice
but
Harry
headed
straight
back
to
the
Gryffindor
common
room
where
he
found
Ron
and
Hermione
playing
chess
chess
was
the
only
thing
Hermione
ever
lost
at
something
Harry
and
Ron
thought
was
very
good
for
her
don't
talk
to
me
for
a
moment
said
Ron
when
Harry
sat
down
next
to
him
I
need
to
concen
He
caught
sight
of
harry's
face
what's
the
matter
with
you
you
look
terrible
speaking
quietly
so
that
no
one
else
would
hear
Harry
told
the
other
two
about
snape's
sudden
sinister
desire
to
be
a
Quidditch
referee
don't
play
said
Hermione
at
once
say
you're
ill
said
Ron
pretend
to
break
your
leg
Hermione
suggested
really
break
your
leg
said
Ron
i
can't
said
Harry
there
isn't
a
reserve
Seeker
if
I
back
out
Gryffindor
can't
play
at
all
at
that
moment
Neville
toppled
into
the
common
room
how
he
had
managed
to
climb
through
the
portrait
hole
was
anyone's
guess
because
his
legs
had
been
stuck
together
with
what
they
recognized
at
once
as
the
Leg-Locker
Curse
he
must
have
had
to
bunny
hop
all
the
way
up
to
Gryffindor
tower
everyone
fell
over
laughing
except
Hermione
who
leapt
up
and
performed
the
countercurse
neville's
legs
sprang
apart
and
he
got
to
his
feet
trembling
what
happened
hermione
asked
him
leading
him
over
to
sit
with
Harry
and
Ron
malfoy
said
Neville
shakily
i
met
him
outside
the
library
he
said
he'd
been
looking
for
someone
to
practice
that
on
go
to
Professor
McGonagall
hermione
urged
Neville
report
him
neville
shook
his
head
i
don't
want
more
trouble
he
mumbled
you've
got
to
stand
up
to
him
Neville
said
Ron
he's
used
to
walking
all
over
people
but
that's
no
reason
to
lie
down
in
front
of
him
and
make
it
easier
there's
no
need
to
tell
me
i'm
not
brave
enough
to
be
in
Gryffindor
malfoy's
already
done
that
Neville
choked
out
harry
felt
in
the
pocket
of
his
robes
and
pulled
out
a
Chocolate
Frog
the
very
last
one
from
the
box
Hermione
had
given
him
for
Christmas
he
gave
it
to
Neville
who
looked
as
though
he
might
cry
you're
worth
twelve
of
Malfoy
Harry
said
the
Sorting
Hat
chose
you
for
Gryffindor
didn't
it
and
where's
Malfoy
in
stinking
Slytherin
neville's
lips
twitched
in
a
weak
smile
as
he
unwrapped
the
frog
thanks
Harry
i
think
i'll
go
to
bed
d'you
want
the
card
you
collect
them
don't
you
as
Neville
walked
away
Harry
looked
at
the
Famous
Wizard
card
dumbledore
again
he
said
He
was
the
first
one
I
ever
he
gasped
he
stared
at
the
back
of
the
card
then
he
looked
up
at
Ron
and
Hermione
i've
found
him
he
whispered
i've
found
Flamel
i
told
you
i'd
read
the
name
somewhere
before
I
read
it
on
the
train
coming
here
listen
to
this
Dumbledore
is
particularly
famous
for
his
defeat
of
the
dark
wizard
Grindelwald
in
for
the
discovery
of
the
twelve
uses
of
dragon's
blood
and
his
work
on
alchemy
with
his
partner
Nicolas
Flamel
hermione
jumped
to
her
feet
she
hadn't
looked
so
excited
since
they'd
gotten
back
the
marks
for
their
very
first
piece
of
homework
stay
there
she
said
and
she
sprinted
up
the
stairs
to
the
girls
dormitories
harry
and
Ron
barely
had
time
to
exchange
mystified
looks
before
she
was
dashing
back
an
enormous
old
book
in
her
arms
i
never
thought
to
look
in
here
she
whispered
excitedly
i
got
this
out
of
the
library
weeks
ago
for
a
bit
of
light
reading
light
said
Ron
but
Hermione
told
him
to
be
quiet
until
she'd
looked
something
up
and
started
flicking
frantically
through
the
pages
muttering
to
herself
at
last
she
found
what
she
was
looking
for
i
knew
it
i
knew
it
are
we
allowed
to
speak
yet
said
Ron
grumpily
hermione
ignored
him
nicolas
Flamel
she
whispered
dramatically
is
the
only
known
maker
of
the
sorcerer's
Stone
this
didn't
have
quite
the
effect
she'd
expected
the
what
said
Harry
and
Ron
oh
honestly
don't
you
two
read
look
read
that
there
she
pushed
the
book
toward
them
and
Harry
and
Ron
read
The
ancient
study
of
alchemy
is
concerned
with
making
the
sorcerer's
Stone
a
legendary
substance
with
astonishing
powers
the
stone
will
transform
any
metal
into
pure
gold
it
also
produces
the
Elixir
of
Life
which
will
make
the
drinker
immortal
there
have
been
many
reports
of
the
sorcerer's
Stone
over
the
centuries
but
the
only
Stone
currently
in
existence
belongs
to
mr.
Nicolas
Flamel
the
noted
alchemist
and
opera
lover
mr.
Flamel
who
celebrated
his
six
hundred
and
sixty-fifth
birthday
last
year
enjoys
a
quiet
life
in
Devon
with
his
wife
Perenelle
six
hundred
and
fifty-eight
see
said
Hermione
when
Harry
and
Ron
had
finished
the
dog
must
be
guarding
flamel's
sorcerer's
Stone
i
bet
he
asked
Dumbledore
to
keep
it
safe
for
him
because
they're
friends
and
he
knew
someone
was
after
it
that's
why
he
wanted
the
Stone
moved
out
of
Gringotts
a
stone
that
makes
gold
and
stops
you
from
ever
dying
said
Harry
no
wonder
snape's
after
it
anyone
would
want
it
and
no
wonder
we
couldn't
find
Flamel
in
that
Study
of
Recent
Developments
in
Wizardry
said
Ron
he's
not
exactly
recent
if
he's
six
hundred
and
sixty-five
is
he
the
next
morning
in
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
while
copying
down
different
ways
of
treating
werewolf
bites
Harry
and
Ron
were
still
discussing
what
they'd
do
with
a
sorcerer's
Stone
if
they
had
one
it
wasn't
until
Ron
said
he'd
buy
his
own
Quidditch
team
that
Harry
remembered
about
Snape
and
the
coming
match
i'm
going
to
play
he
told
Ron
and
Hermione
if
I
don't
all
the
Slytherins
will
think
i'm
just
too
scared
to
face
Snape
i'll
show
them
it'll
really
wipe
the
smiles
off
their
faces
if
we
win
just
as
long
as
we're
not
wiping
you
off
the
field
said
Hermione
as
the
match
drew
nearer
however
Harry
became
more
and
more
nervous
whatever
he
told
Ron
and
Hermione
the
rest
of
the
team
wasn't
too
calm
either
the
idea
of
overtaking
Slytherin
in
the
house
championship
was
wonderful
no
one
had
done
it
for
seven
years
but
would
they
be
allowed
to
with
such
a
biased
referee
harry
didn't
know
whether
he
was
imagining
it
or
not
but
he
seemed
to
keep
running
into
Snape
wherever
he
went
at
times
he
even
wondered
whether
Snape
was
following
him
trying
to
catch
him
on
his
own
potions
lessons
were
turning
into
a
sort
of
weekly
torture
Snape
was
so
horrible
to
Harry
could
Snape
possibly
know
they'd
found
out
about
the
sorcerer's
Stone
harry
didn't
see
how
he
could
yet
he
sometimes
had
the
horrible
feeling
that
Snape
could
read
minds
harry
knew
when
they
wished
him
good
luck
outside
the
locker
rooms
the
next
afternoon
that
Ron
and
Hermione
were
wondering
whether
they'd
ever
see
him
alive
again
this
wasn't
what
you'd
call
comforting
harry
hardly
heard
a
word
of
wood's
pep
talk
as
he
pulled
on
his
Quidditch
robes
and
picked
up
his
Nimbus
Two
Thousand
ron
and
Hermione
meanwhile
had
found
a
place
in
the
stands
next
to
Neville
who
couldn't
understand
why
they
looked
so
grim
and
worried
or
why
they
had
both
brought
their
wands
to
the
match
little
did
Harry
know
that
Ron
and
Hermione
had
been
secretly
practicing
the
Leg-Locker
Curse
they'd
gotten
the
idea
from
Malfoy
using
it
on
Neville
and
were
ready
to
use
it
on
Snape
if
he
showed
any
sign
of
wanting
to
hurt
Harry
now
don't
forget
it's
Locomotor
Mortis
Hermione
muttered
as
Ron
slipped
his
wand
up
his
sleeve
i
know
Ron
snapped
don't
nag
back
in
the
locker
room
Wood
had
taken
Harry
aside
don't
want
to
pressure
you
Potter
but
if
we
ever
need
an
early
capture
of
the
Snitch
it's
now
finish
the
game
before
Snape
can
favor
Hufflepuff
too
much
the
whole
school's
out
there
said
Fred
Weasley
peering
out
of
the
door
even
blimey
dumbledore's
come
to
watch
harry's
heart
did
a
somersault
dumbledore
he
said
dashing
to
the
door
to
make
sure
fred
was
right
there
was
no
mistaking
that
silver
beard
harry
could
have
laughed
out
loud
with
relief
He
was
safe
there
was
simply
no
way
that
Snape
would
dare
to
try
to
hurt
him
if
Dumbledore
was
watching
perhaps
that
was
why
Snape
was
looking
so
angry
as
the
teams
marched
onto
the
field
something
that
Ron
noticed
too
i've
never
seen
Snape
look
so
mean
he
told
Hermione
look
they're
off
Ouch
someone
had
poked
Ron
in
the
back
of
the
head
it
was
Malfoy
oh
sorry
Weasley
didn't
see
you
there
malfoy
grinned
broadly
at
Crabbe
and
Goyle
wonder
how
long
potter's
going
to
stay
on
his
broom
this
time
anyone
want
a
bet
what
about
you
Weasley
ron
didn't
answer
Snape
had
just
awarded
Hufflepuff
a
penalty
because
George
Weasley
had
hit
a
Bludger
at
him
hermione
who
had
all
her
fingers
crossed
in
her
lap
was
squinting
fixedly
at
Harry
who
was
circling
the
game
like
a
hawk
looking
for
the
Snitch
you
know
how
I
think
they
choose
people
for
the
Gryffindor
team
said
Malfoy
loudly
a
few
minutes
later
as
Snape
awarded
Hufflepuff
another
penalty
for
no
reason
at
all
it's
people
they
feel
sorry
for
see
there's
Potter
who's
got
no
parents
then
there's
the
Weasleys
who've
got
no
money
you
should
be
on
the
team
Longbottom
you've
got
no
brains
neville
went
bright
red
but
turned
in
his
seat
to
face
Malfoy
i'm
worth
twelve
of
you
Malfoy
he
stammered
malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
howled
with
laughter
but
Ron
still
not
daring
to
take
his
eyes
from
the
game
said
You
tell
him
Neville
longbottom
if
brains
were
gold
you'd
be
poorer
than
Weasley
and
that's
saying
something
ron's
nerves
were
already
stretched
to
the
breaking
point
with
anxiety
about
Harry
i'm
warning
you
Malfoy
one
more
word
Ron
said
Hermione
suddenly
Harry
what
where
harry
had
suddenly
gone
into
a
spectacular
dive
which
drew
gasps
and
cheers
from
the
crowd
hermione
stood
up
her
crossed
fingers
in
her
mouth
as
Harry
streaked
toward
the
ground
like
a
bullet
you're
in
luck
Weasley
potter's
obviously
spotted
some
money
on
the
ground
said
Malfoy
ron
snapped
before
Malfoy
knew
what
was
happening
Ron
was
on
top
of
him
wrestling
him
to
the
ground
neville
hesitated
then
clambered
over
the
back
of
his
seat
to
help
come
on
Harry
hermione
screamed
leaping
onto
her
seat
to
watch
as
Harry
sped
straight
at
Snape
she
didn't
even
notice
Malfoy
and
Ron
rolling
around
under
her
seat
or
the
scuffles
and
yelps
coming
from
the
whirl
of
fists
that
was
Neville
Crabbe
and
Goyle
up
in
the
air
Snape
turned
on
his
broomstick
just
in
time
to
see
something
scarlet
shoot
past
him
missing
him
by
inches
the
next
second
Harry
had
pulled
out
of
the
dive
his
arm
raised
in
triumph
the
Snitch
clasped
in
his
hand
the
stands
erupted
it
had
to
be
a
record
no
one
could
ever
remember
the
Snitch
being
caught
so
quickly
ron
ron
where
are
you
the
game's
over
harry's
won
we've
won
gryffindor
is
in
the
lead
shrieked
Hermione
dancing
up
and
down
on
her
seat
and
hugging
Parvati
Patil
in
the
row
in
front
harry
jumped
off
his
broom
a
foot
from
the
ground
he
couldn't
believe
it
he'd
done
it
the
game
was
over
it
had
barely
lasted
five
minutes
as
Gryffindors
came
spilling
onto
the
field
he
saw
Snape
land
nearby
white-faced
and
tight-lipped
then
Harry
felt
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
looked
up
into
dumbledore's
smiling
face
well
done
said
Dumbledore
quietly
so
that
only
Harry
could
hear
nice
to
see
you
haven't
been
brooding
about
that
mirror
been
keeping
busy
excellent
snape
spat
bitterly
on
the
ground
harry
left
the
locker
room
alone
some
time
later
to
take
his
Nimbus
Two
Thousand
back
to
the
broomshed
he
couldn't
ever
remember
feeling
happier
he'd
really
done
something
to
be
proud
of
now
no
one
could
say
he
was
just
a
famous
name
any
more
the
evening
air
had
never
smelled
so
sweet
he
walked
over
the
damp
grass
reliving
the
last
hour
in
his
head
which
was
a
happy
blur
Gryffindors
running
to
lift
him
onto
their
shoulders
Ron
and
Hermione
in
the
distance
jumping
up
and
down
Ron
cheering
through
a
heavy
nosebleed
harry
had
reached
the
shed
he
leaned
against
the
wooden
door
and
looked
up
at
Hogwarts
with
its
windows
glowing
red
in
the
setting
sun
gryffindor
in
the
lead
he'd
done
it
he'd
shown
Snape
and
speaking
of
Snape
a
hooded
figure
came
swiftly
down
the
front
steps
of
the
castle
clearly
not
wanting
to
be
seen
it
walked
as
fast
as
possible
toward
the
forbidden
forest
harry's
victory
faded
from
his
mind
as
he
watched
he
recognized
the
figure's
prowling
walk
snape
sneaking
into
the
forest
while
everyone
else
was
at
dinner
what
was
going
on
harry
jumped
back
on
his
Nimbus
Two
Thousand
and
took
off
gliding
silently
over
the
castle
he
saw
Snape
enter
the
forest
at
a
run
he
followed
the
trees
were
so
thick
he
couldn't
see
where
Snape
had
gone
he
flew
in
circles
lower
and
lower
brushing
the
top
branches
of
trees
until
he
heard
voices
he
glided
toward
them
and
landed
noiselessly
in
a
towering
beech
tree
he
climbed
carefully
along
one
of
the
branches
holding
tight
to
his
broomstick
trying
to
see
through
the
leaves
below
in
a
shadowy
clearing
stood
Snape
but
he
wasn't
alone
quirrell
was
there
too
harry
couldn't
make
out
the
look
on
his
face
but
he
was
stuttering
worse
than
ever
harry
strained
to
catch
what
they
were
saying
d-don't
know
why
you
wanted
t-t-to
meet
here
of
all
p-places
Severus
oh
I
thought
we'd
keep
this
private
said
Snape
his
voice
icy
students
aren't
supposed
to
know
about
the
sorcerer's
Stone
after
all
harry
leaned
forward
quirrell
was
mumbling
something
snape
interrupted
him
have
you
found
out
how
to
get
past
that
beast
of
hagrid's
yet
b-b-but
Severus
I
you
don't
want
me
as
your
enemy
Quirrell
said
Snape
taking
a
step
toward
him
i-i
don't
know
what
you
You
know
perfectly
well
what
I
mean
an
owl
hooted
loudly
and
Harry
nearly
fell
out
of
the
tree
he
steadied
himself
in
time
to
hear
Snape
say
your
little
bit
of
hocus-pocus
i'm
waiting
b-but
I
d-d-don't
very
well
Snape
cut
in
we'll
have
another
little
chat
soon
when
you've
had
time
to
think
things
over
and
decided
where
your
loyalties
lie
he
threw
his
cloak
over
his
head
and
strode
out
of
the
clearing
it
was
almost
dark
now
but
Harry
could
see
Quirrell
standing
quite
still
as
though
he
was
petrified
harry
where
have
you
been
hermione
squeaked
we
won
you
won
we
won
shouted
Ron
thumping
Harry
on
the
back
and
I
gave
Malfoy
a
black
eye
and
Neville
tried
to
take
on
Crabbe
and
Goyle
single-handed
he's
still
out
cold
but
Madam
Pomftey
says
he'll
be
all
right
talk
about
showing
Slytherin
everyone's
waiting
for
you
in
the
common
room
we're
having
a
party
Fred
and
George
stole
some
cakes
and
stuff
from
the
kitchens
never
mind
that
now
said
Harry
breathlessly
let's
find
an
empty
room
you
wait
til
you
hear
this
he
made
sure
Peeves
wasn't
inside
before
shutting
the
door
behind
them
then
he
told
them
what
he'd
seen
and
heard
so
we
were
right
it
is
the
sorcerer's
Stone
and
snape's
trying
to
force
Quirrell
to
help
him
get
it
he
asked
if
he
knew
how
to
get
past
Fluffy
and
he
said
something
about
quirrell's
hocus
pocuss
I
reckon
there
are
other
things
guarding
the
stone
apart
from
Fluffy
loads
of
enchantments
probably
and
Quirrell
would
have
done
some
anti-Dark
Arts
spell
that
Snape
needs
to
break
through
so
you
mean
the
stone's
only
safe
as
long
as
Quirrell
stands
up
to
Snape
said
Hermione
in
alarm
it'll
be
gone
by
next
Tuesday
said
Ron
chapter
fourteen
norbert
the
norwegian
ridgeback
quirrell
however
must
have
been
braver
than
they'd
thought
in
the
weeks
that
followed
he
did
seem
to
be
getting
paler
and
thinner
but
it
didn't
look
as
though
he'd
cracked
yet
every
time
they
passed
the
third-floor
corridor
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
would
press
their
ears
to
the
door
to
check
that
Fluffy
was
still
growling
inside
snape
was
sweeping
about
in
his
usual
bad
temper
which
surely
meant
that
the
Stone
was
still
safe
whenever
Harry
passed
Quirrell
these
days
he
gave
him
an
encouraging
sort
of
smile
and
Ron
had
started
telling
people
off
for
laughing
at
quirrell's
stutter
hermione
however
had
more
on
her
mind
than
the
sorcerer's
Stone
she
had
started
drawing
up
study
schedules
and
colorcoding
all
her
notes
harry
and
Ron
wouldn't
have
minded
but
she
kept
nagging
them
to
do
the
same
hermione
the
exams
are
ages
away
ten
weeks
Hermione
snapped
that's
not
ages
that's
like
a
second
to
Nicolas
Flamel
but
we're
not
six
hundred
years
old
Ron
reminded
her
anyway
what
are
you
studying
for
you
already
know
it
A
what
am
I
studying
for
are
you
crazy
you
realize
we
need
to
pass
these
exams
to
get
into
the
second
year
they're
very
important
I
should
have
started
studying
a
month
ago
I
don't
know
what's
gotten
into
me
unfortunately
the
teachers
seemed
to
be
thinking
along
the
same
lines
as
Hermione
they
piled
so
much
homework
on
them
that
the
Easter
holidays
weren't
nearly
as
much
fun
as
the
Christmas
ones
it
was
hard
to
relax
with
Hermione
next
to
you
reciting
the
twelve
uses
of
dragon's
blood
or
practicing
wand
movements
moaning
and
yawning
Harry
and
Ron
spent
most
of
their
free
time
in
the
library
with
her
trying
to
get
through
all
their
extra
work
i'll
never
remember
this
Ron
burst
out
one
afternoon
throwing
down
his
quill
and
looking
longingly
out
of
the
library
window
it
was
the
first
really
fine
day
they'd
had
in
months
the
sky
was
a
clear
forget-me-not
blue
and
there
was
a
feeling
in
the
air
of
summer
coming
harry
who
was
looking
up
Dittany
in
One
Thousand
Magical
Herbs
and
Fungi
didn't
look
up
until
he
heard
Ron
say
Hagrid
what
are
you
doing
in
the
library
hagrid
shuffled
into
view
hiding
something
behind
his
back
he
looked
very
out
of
place
in
his
moleskin
overcoat
jus
lookin
he
said
in
a
shifty
voice
that
got
their
interest
at
once
an
what're
you
lot
up
ter
he
looked
suddenly
suspicious
yer
not
still
lookin

Nicolas
Flamel

ago
said
Ron
impressively
and
we
know
what
that
dog's
guarding

a
sorcerer's
St
shhhh
hagrid
looked
around
quickly
to
see
if
anyone
was
listening

go
shoutin
about
it
what's
the
matter
with
yeh
there
are
a
few
things
we
wanted
to

matter
of

said
Harry
about
what's

the
Stone
apart
from
Fluffy

said
Hagrid
again

then
said
Harry
hagrid
shuffled
off
what
was
he
hiding
behind
his
back
said
Hermione
thoughtfully
do
you
think
it
had
anything
to
do
with
the
Stone
i'm
going
to
see
what
section
he
was
in
said
Ron
who'd
had
enough
of
working
he
came
back
a
minute
later
with
a
pile
of
books
in
his
arms
and
slammed
them
down
on
the
table
dragons
he
whispered
hagrid
was
looking
up
stuff
about
dragons
look
at
these
Dragon
Species
of
Great
Britain
and
Ireland
From
Egg
to
Inferno
A
Dragon
keeper's
Guide
hagrid's
always
wanted
a
dragon
he
told
me
so
the
first
time
I
ever
met
him
said
Harry
but
it's
against
our
laws
said
Ron
dragon
breeding
was
outlawed
by
the
Warlocks
Convention
of
everyone
knows
that
it's
hard
to
stop
Muggles
from
noticing
us
if
we're
keeping
dragons
in
the
back
garden
anyway
you
can't
tame
dragons
it's
dangerous
you
should
see
the
burns
charlie's
got
off
wild
ones
in
Romania
but
there
aren't
wild
dragons
in
Britain
said
Harry
of
course
there
are
said
Ron
common
Welsh
Green
and
Hebridean
Blacks
the
Ministry
of
Magic
has
a
job
hushing
them
up
I
can
tell
you
our
kind
have
to
keep
putting
spells
on
Muggles
who've
spotted
them
to
make
them
forget
so
what
on
earths
Hagrid
up
to
said
Hermione
when
they
knocked
on
the
door
of
the
gamekeeper's
hut
an
hour
later
they
were
surprised
to
see
that
all
the
curtains
were
closed
hagrid
called
Who
is
it
before
he
let
them
in
and
then
shut
the
door
quickly
behind
them
it
was
stifling
hot
inside
even
though
it
was
such
a
warm
day
there
was
a
blazing
fire
in
the
grate
hagrid
made
them
tea
and
offered
them
stoat
sandwiches
which
they
refused
so
yeh
wanted
to
ask
me
somethin
yes
said
Harry
there
was
no
point
beating
around
the
bush
we
were
wondering
if
you
could
tell
us
what's
guarding
the
sorcerer's
Stone
apart
from
Fluffy
hagrid
frowned
at
him
course
I
cant
he
said
number
one
I
don
know
meself
number
two
yeh
know
too
much
already
so
I
wouldn
tell
yeh
if
I
could
that
stone's
here
fer
a
good
reason
it
Was
almost
stolen
outta
Gringotts
I
s'ppose
yeh've
worked
that
out
an
all
beats
me
how
yeh
even
know
abou
Fluffy
oh
come
on
Hagrid
you
might
not
want
to
tell
us
but
you
do
know
you
know
everything
that
goes
on
round
here
said
Hermione
in
a
warm
flattering
voice
hagrid's
beard
twitched
and
they
could
tell
he
was
smiling
we
only
wondered
who
had
done
the
guarding
really
hermione
went
on
we
wondered
who
Dumbledore
had
trusted
enough
to
help
him
apart
from
you
hagrid's
chest
swelled
at
these
last
words
harry
and
Ron
beamed
at
Hermione
well
I
don
s'pose
it
could
hurt
ter
tell
yeh
that
let's
see
he
borrowed
Fluffy
from
me
then
some
o
the
teachers
did
enchantments
professor
Sprout
Professor
Flitwick
Professor
McGonagall
he
ticked
them
off
on
his
fingers
Professor
Quirrell
an
Dumbledore
himself
did
somethin
o
course
hang
on
i've
forgotten
someone
oh
yeah
Professor
Snape
snape
yeah
yer
not
still
on
abou
that
are
yeh
look
Snape
helped
protect
the
Stone
he's
not
about
ter
steal
it
harry
knew
Ron
and
Hermione
were
thinking
the
same
as
he
was
if
Snape
had
been
in
on
protecting
the
Stone
it
must
have
been
easy
to
find
out
how
the
other
teachers
had
guarded
it
he
probably
knew
everything
except
it
seemed
quirrell's
spell
and
how
to
get
past
Fluffy
you're
the
only
one
who
knows
how
to
get
past
Fluffy
aren't
you
Hagrid
said
Harry
anxiously
and
you
wouldn't
tell
anyone
would
you
not
even
one
of
the
teachers
not
a
soul
knows
except
me
an
Dumbledore
said
Hagrid
proudly
well
that's
something
Harry
muttered
to
the
others
hagrid
can
we
have
a
window
open
i'm
boiling
can't
Harry
sorry
said
Hagrid
harry
noticed
him
glance
at
the
fire
harry
looked
at
it
too
hagrid
what's
that
but
he
already
knew
what
it
was
in
the
very
heart
of
the
fire
underneath
the
kettle
was
a
huge
black
egg
ah
said
Hagrid
fiddling
nervously
with
his
beard
that's
er
where
did
you
get
it
Hagrid
said
Ron
crouching
over
the
fire
to
get
a
closer
look
at
the
egg
it
must've
cost
you
a
fortune
won
it
said
Hagrid
las
night
i
was
down
in
the
village
havin
a
few
drinks
an
got
into
a
game
o
cards
with
a
stranger
think
he
was
quite
glad
ter
get
rid
of
it
ter
be
honest
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
it
when
it's
hatched
said
Hermione
well
i've
bin
doin
some
readin
said
Hagrid
pulling
a
large
book
from
under
his
pillow
got
this
outta
the
library
Dragon
Breeding
for
Pleasure
and
Profit
it's
a
bit
outta
date
o
course
but
it's
all
in
here
keep
the
egg
in
the
fire
cause
their
mothers
breathe
on
I
em
see
an
when
it
hatches
feed
it
on
a
bucket
o
brandy
mixed
with
chicken
blood
every
half
hour
an
see
here
how
ter
recognize
diff'rent
eggs
what
I
got
there's
a
Norwegian
Ridgeback
they're
rare
them
he
looked
very
pleased
with
himself
but
Hermione
didn't
hagrid
you
live
in
a
wooden
house
she
said
but
Hagrid
wasn't
listening
he
was
humming
merrily
as
he
stoked
the
fire
so
now
they
had
something
else
to
worry
about
what
might
happen
to
Hagrid
if
anyone
found
out
he
was
hiding
an
illegal
dragon
in
his
hut
wonder
what
it's
like
to
have
a
peaceful
life
Ron
sighed
as
evening
after
evening
they
struggled
through
all
the
extra
homework
they
were
getting
hermione
had
now
started
making
study
schedules
for
Harry
and
Ron
too
it
was
driving
them
nuts
then
one
breakfast
time
Hedwig
brought
Harry
another
note
from
Hagrid
he
had
written
only
two
words
it's
hatching
ron
wanted
to
skip
Herbology
and
go
straight
down
to
the
hut
hermione
wouldn't
hear
of
it
hermione
how
many
times
in
our
lives
are
we
going
to
see
a
dragon
hatching
we've
got
lessons
we'll
get
into
trouble
and
that's
nothing
to
what
hagrid's
going
to
be
in
when
someone
finds
out
what
he's
doing
shut
up
harry
whispered
malfoy
was
only
a
few
feet
away
and
he
had
stopped
dead
to
listen
how
much
had
he
heard
harry
didn't
like
the
look
on
malfoy's
face
at
all
ron
and
Hermione
argued
all
the
way
to
Herbology
and
in
the
end
Hermione
agreed
to
run
down
to
hagrid's
with
the
other
two
during
morning
break
when
the
bell
sounded
from
the
castle
at
the
end
of
their
lesson
the
three
of
them
dropped
their
trowels
at
once
and
hurried
through
the
grounds
to
the
edge
of
the
forest
hagrid
greeted
them
looking
flushed
and
excited
it's
nearly
out
he
ushered
them
inside
the
egg
was
lying
on
the
table
there
were
deep
cracks
in
it
something
was
moving
inside
a
funny
clicking
noise
was
coming
from
it
they
all
drew
their
chairs
up
to
the
table
and
watched
with
bated
breath
all
at
once
there
was
a
scraping
noise
and
the
egg
split
open
the
baby
dragon
flopped
onto
the
table
it
wasn't
exactly
pretty
Harry
thought
it
looked
like
a
crumpled
black
umbrella
its
spiny
wings
were
huge
compared
to
its
skinny
jet
body
it
had
a
long
snout
with
wide
nostrils
the
stubs
of
horns
and
bulging
orange
eyes
it
sneezed
a
couple
of
sparks
flew
out
of
its
snout
isn't
he
beautiful
hagrid
murmured
he
reached
out
a
hand
to
stroke
the
dragon's
head
it
snapped
at
his
fingers
showing
pointed
fangs
bless
him
look
he
knows
his
mommy
said
Hagrid
hagrid
said
Hermione
how
fast
do
Norwegian
Ridgebacks
grow
exactly
hagrid
was
about
to
answer
when
the
color
suddenly
drained
from
his
face
he
leapt
to
his
feet
and
ran
to
the
window
what's
the
matter
someone
was
lookin
through
the
gap
in
the
curtains
it's
a
kid
he's
runnin
back
up
ter
the
school
harry
bolted
to
the
door
and
looked
out
even
at
a
distance
there
was
no
mistaking
him
malfoy
had
seen
the
dragon
something
about
the
smile
lurking
on
malfoy's
face
during
the
next
week
made
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
very
nervous
they
spent
most
of
their
free
time
in
hagrid's
darkened
hut
trying
to
reason
with
him
just
let
him
go
Harry
urged
set
him
free
i
can't
said
Hagrid
he's
too
little
he'd
die
they
looked
at
the
dragon
it
had
grown
three
times
in
length
in
just
a
week
smoke
kept
furling
out
of
its
nostrils
hagrid
hadn't
been
doing
his
gamekeeping
duties
because
the
dragon
was
keeping
him
so
busy
there
were
empty
brandy
bottles
and
chicken
feathers
all
over
the
floor
i've
decided
to
call
him
Norbert
said
Hagrid
looking
at
the
dragon
with
misty
eyes
he
really
knows
me
now
watch
norbert
norbert
where's
Mommy
he's
lost
his
marbles
Ron
muttered
in
harry's
ear
hagrid
said
Harry
loudly
give
it
two
weeks
and
norbert's
going
to
be
as
long
as
your
house
malfoy
could
go
to
Dumbledore
at
any
moment
hagrid
bit
his
lip
i
I
know
I
can't
keep
him
forever
but
I
can't
jus
dump
him
I
can't
harry
suddenly
turned
to
Ron
charlie
he
said
you're
losing
it
too
said
Ron
i'm
Ron
remember
no
Charlie
your
brother
Charlie
in
Romania
studying
dragons
we
could
send
Norbert
to
him
charlie
can
take
care
of
him
and
then
put
him
back
in
the
wild
brilliant
said
Ron
how
about
it
Hagrid
and
in
the
end
Hagrid
agreed
that
they
could
send
an
owl
to
Charlie
to
ask
him
the
following
week
dragged
by
wednesday
night
found
Hermione
and
Harry
sitting
alone
in
the
common
room
long
after
everyone
else
had
gone
to
bed
the
clock
on
the
wall
had
just
chimed
midnight
when
the
portrait
hole
burst
open
ron
appeared
out
of
nowhere
as
he
pulled
off
harry's
invisibility
cloak
he
had
been
down
at
hagrid's
hut
helping
him
feed
Norbert
who
was
now
eating
dead
rats
by
the
crate
it
bit
me
he
said
showing
them
his
hand
which
was
wrapped
in
a
bloody
handkerchief
i'm
not
going
to
be
able
to
hold
a
quill
for
a
week
i
tell
you
that
dragon's
the
most
horrible
animal
i've
ever
met
but
the
way
Hagrid
goes
on
about
it
you'd
think
it
was
a
fluffy
little
bunny
rabbit
when
it
bit
me
he
told
me
off
for
frightening
it
and
when
I
left
he
was
singing
it
a
lullaby
there
was
a
tap
on
the
dark
window
it's
Hedwig
said
Harry
hurrying
to
let
her
in
she'll
have
charlie's
answer
the
three
of
them
put
their
heads
together
to
read
the
note
dear
Ron
how
are
you
thanks
for
the
letter
i'd
be
glad
to
take
the
Norwegian
Ridgeback
but
it
won't
be
easy
getting
him
here
i
think
the
best
thing
will
be
to
send
him
over
with
some
friends
of
mine
who
are
coming
to
visit
me
next
week
trouble
is
they
mustn't
be
seen
carrying
an
illegal
dragon
could
you
get
the
Ridgeback
up
the
tallest
tower
at
midnight
on
Saturday
they
can
meet
you
there
and
take
him
away
while
it's
still
dark
send
me
an
answer
as
soon
as
possible
love
charlie
they
looked
at
one
another
we've
got
the
invisibility
cloak
said
Harry
it
shouldn't
be
too
difficult
I
think
the
cloaks
big
enough
to
cover
two
of
us
and
Norbert
it
was
a
mark
of
how
bad
the
last
week
had
been
that
the
other
two
agreed
with
him
anything
to
get
rid
of
Norbert
and
Malfoy
there
was
a
hitch
by
the
next
morning
ron's
bitten
hand
had
swollen
to
twice
its
usual
size
he
didn't
know
whether
it
was
safe
to
go
to
Madam
Pomfrey
would
she
recognize
a
dragon
bite
by
the
afternoon
though
he
had
no
choice
the
cut
had
turned
a
nasty
shade
of
green
it
looked
as
if
norbert's
fangs
were
poisonous
harry
and
Hermione
rushed
up
to
the
hospital
wing
at
the
end
of
the
day
to
find
Ron
in
a
terrible
state
in
bed
it's
not
just
my
hand
he
whispered
although
that
feels
like
it's
about
to
fall
off
malfoy
told
Madam
Pomfrey
he
wanted
to
borrow
one
of
my
books
so
he
could
come
and
have
a
good
laugh
at
me
he
kept
threatening
to
tell
her
what
really
bit
me
i've
told
her
it
was
a
dog
but
I
don't
think
she
believes
me
I
shouldn't
have
hit
him
at
the
Quidditch
match
that's
why
he's
doing
this
harry
and
Hermione
tried
to
calm
Ron
down
it'll
all
be
over
at
midnight
on
Saturday
said
Hermione
but
this
didn't
soothe
Ron
at
all
on
the
contrary
he
sat
bolt
upright
and
broke
into
a
sweat
midnight
on
Saturday
he
said
in
a
hoarse
voice
oh
no
oh
no
i've
just
remembered
charlie's
letter
was
in
that
book
Malfoy
took
he's
going
to
know
we're
getting
rid
of
Norbert
harry
and
Hermione
didn't
get
a
chance
to
answer
madam
Pomfrey
came
over
at
that
moment
and
made
them
leave
saying
Ron
needed
sleep
it's
too
late
to
change
the
plan
now
Harry
told
Hermione
we
haven't
got
time
to
send
Charlie
another
owl
and
this
could
be
our
only
chance
to
get
rid
of
Norbert
we'll
have
to
risk
it
and
we
have
got
the
invisibility
cloak
Malfoy
doesn't
know
about
that
they
found
Fang
the
boarhound
sitting
outside
with
a
bandaged
tail
when
they
went
to
tell
Hagrid
who
opened
a
window
to
talk
to
them
i
won't
let
you
in
he
puffed
norbert's
at
a
tricky
stage
nothin
I
can't
handle
when
they
told
him
about
charlie's
letter
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
although
that
might
have
been
because
Norbert
had
just
bitten
him
on
the
leg
aargh
it's
all
right
he
only
got
my
boot
jus
playin
he's
only
a
baby
after
all
the
baby
banged
its
tail
on
the
wall
making
the
windows
rattle
harry
and
Hermione
walked
back
to
the
castle
feeling
Saturday
couldn't
come
quickly
enough
they
would
have
felt
sorry
for
Hagrid
when
the
time
came
for
him
to
say
good-bye
to
Norbert
if
they
hadn't
been
so
worried
about
what
they
had
to
do
it
was
a
very
dark
cloudy
night
and
they
were
a
bit
late
arriving
at
hagrid's
hut
because
they'd
had
to
wait
for
Peeves
to
get
out
of
their
way
in
the
entrance
hall
where
he'd
been
playing
tennis
against
the
wall
hagrid
had
Norbert
packed
and
ready
in
a
large
crate
he's
got
lots
o
rats
an
some
brandy
fer
the
journey
said
Hagrid
in
a
muffled
voice
an
i've
packed
his
teddy
bear
in
case
he
gets
lonely
from
inside
the
crate
came
ripping
noises
that
sounded
to
Harry
as
though
the
teddy
was
having
his
head
torn
off
bye-bye
Norbert
hagrid
sobbed
as
Harry
and
Hermione
covered
the
crate
with
the
invisibility
cloak
and
stepped
underneath
it
themselves
mommy
will
never
forget
you
how
they
managed
to
get
the
crate
back
up
to
the
castle
they
never
knew
midnight
ticked
nearer
as
they
heaved
Norbert
up
the
marble
staircase
in
the
entrance
hall
and
along
the
dark
corridors
up
another
staircase
then
another
even
one
of
harry's
shortcuts
didn't
make
the
work
much
easier
nearly
there
harry
panted
as
they
reached
the
corridor
beneath
the
tallest
tower
then
a
sudden
movement
ahead
of
them
made
them
almost
drop
the
crate
forgetting
that
they
were
already
invisible
they
shrank
into
the
shadows
staring
at
the
dark
outlines
of
two
people
grappling
with
each
other
ten
feet
away
a
lamp
flared
professor
McGonagall
in
a
tartan
bathrobe
and
a
hair
net
had
Malfoy
by
the
ear
detention
she
shouted
and
twenty
points
from
Slytherin
wandering
around
in
the
middle
of
the
night
how
dare
you
you
don't
understand
Professor
harry
potter's
coming
he's
got
a
dragon
what
utter
rubbish
how
dare
you
tell
such
lies
come
on
I
shall
see
Professor
Snape
about
you
Malfoy
the
steep
spiral
staircase
up
to
the
top
of
the
tower
seemed
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
after
that
not
until
they'd
stepped
out
into
the
cold
night
air
did
they
throw
off
the
cloak
glad
to
be
able
to
breathe
properly
again
hermione
did
a
sort
of
jig
malfoy's
got
detention
i
could
sing
don't
Harry
advised
her
chuckling
about
Malfoy
they
waited
Norbert
thrashing
about
in
his
crate
about
ten
minutes
later
four
broomsticks
came
swooping
down
out
of
the
darkness
charlie's
friends
were
a
cheery
lot
they
showed
Harry
and
Hermione
the
harness
they'd
rigged
up
so
they
could
suspend
Norbert
between
them
they
all
helped
buckle
Norbert
safely
into
it
and
then
Harry
and
Hermione
shook
hands
with
the
others
and
thanked
them
very
much
at
last
Norbert
was
going
going
gone
they
slipped
back
down
the
spiral
staircase
their
hearts
as
light
as
their
hands
now
that
Norbert
was
off
them
no
more
dragon
Malfoy
in
detention
what
could
spoil
their
happiness
the
answer
to
that
was
waiting
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
as
they
stepped
into
the
corridor
filch's
face
loomed
suddenly
out
of
the
darkness
well
well
well
he
whispered
we
are
in
trouble
they'd
left
the
invisibility
cloak
on
top
of
the
tower
chapter
fifteen
the
foribidden
forest
things
couldn't
have
been
worse
filch
took
them
down
to
Professor
mcgonagall's
study
on
the
first
floor
where
they
sat
and
waited
without
saying
a
word
to
each
other
hermione
was
trembling
excuses
alibis
and
wild
cover
up
stories
chased
each
other
around
harry's
brain
each
more
feeble
than
the
last
he
couldn't
see
how
they
were
going
to
get
out
of
trouble
this
time
they
were
cornered
how
could
they
have
been
so
stupid
as
to
forget
the
cloak
there
was
no
reason
on
earth
that
Professor
McGonagall
would
accept
for
their
being
out
of
bed
and
creeping
around
the
school
in
the
dead
of
night
let
alone
being
up
the
tallest
astronomy
tower
which
was
out-of-bounds
except
for
classes
add
Norbert
and
the
invisibility
cloak
and
they
might
as
well
be
packing
their
bags
already
had
Harry
thought
that
things
couldn't
have
been
worse
he
was
wrong
when
Professor
McGonagall
appeared
she
was
leading
Neville
harry
neville
burst
Out
the
moment
he
saw
the
other
two
i
was
trying
to
find
you
to
warn
you
I
heard
Malfoy
saying
he
was
going
to
catch
you
he
said
you
had
a
drag
harry
shook
his
head
violently
to
shut
Neville
up
but
Professor
McGonagall
had
seen
she
looked
more
likely
to
breathe
fire
than
Norbert
as
she
towered
over
the
three
of
them
i
would
never
have
believed
it
of
any
of
you
mr.
Filch
says
you
were
up
in
the
astronomy
tower
it's
one
o'clock
in
the
morning
explain
yourselves
it
was
the
first
time
Hermione
had
ever
failed
to
answer
a
teacher's
question
she
was
staring
at
her
slippers
as
still
as
a
statue
i
think
i've
got
a
good
idea
of
what's
been
going
on
said
Professor
McGonagall
it
doesn't
take
a
genius
to
work
it
out
you
fed
Draco
Malfoy
some
cock-and-bull
story
about
a
dragon
trying
to
get
him
out
of
bed
and
into
trouble
i've
already
caught
him
i
suppose
you
think
it's
funny
that
Longbottom
here
heard
the
story
and
believed
it
too
harry
caught
neville's
eye
and
tried
to
tell
him
without
words
that
this
wasn't
true
because
Neville
was
looking
stunned
and
hurt
poor
blundering
Neville
Harry
knew
what
it
must
have
cost
him
to
try
and
find
them
in
the
dark
to
warn
them
i'm
disgusted
said
Professor
McGonagall
four
students
out
of
bed
in
one
night
i've
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
before
you
Miss
Granger
I
thought
you
had
more
sense
as
for
you
mr.
Potter
I
thought
Gryffindor
meant
more
to
you
than
this
all
three
of
you
will
receive
detentions
yes
you
too
mr.
Longbottom
nothing
gives
you
the
right
to
walk
around
school
at
night
especially
these
days
it's
very
dangerous
and
fifty
points
will
be
taken
from
Gryffindor
fifty
harry
gasped
they
would
lose
the
lead
the
lead
he'd
won
in
the
last
Quidditch
match
fifty
points
each
said
Professor
McGonagall
breathing
heavily
through
her
long
pointed
nose
professor
please
You
can't
don't
tell
me
what
I
can
and
can't
do
Potter
now
get
back
to
bed
all
of
you
i've
never
been
more
ashamed
of
Gryffindor
students
a
hundred
and
fifty
points
lost
that
put
Gryffindor
in
last
place
in
one
night
they'd
ruined
any
chance
Gryffindor
had
had
for
the
house
cup
harry
felt
as
though
the
bottom
had
dropped
out
of
his
stomach
how
could
they
ever
make
up
for
this
harry
didn't
sleep
all
night
he
could
hear
Neville
sobbing
into
his
pillow
for
what
seemed
like
hours
harry
couldn't
think
of
anything
to
say
to
comfort
him
he
knew
Neville
like
himself
was
dreading
the
dawn
what
would
happen
when
the
rest
of
Gryffindor
found
out
what
they'd
done
at
first
Gryffindors
passing
the
giant
hourglasses
that
recorded
the
house
points
the
next
day
thought
there'd
been
a
mistake
how
could
they
suddenly
have
a
hundred
and
fifty
points
fewer
than
yesterday
and
then
the
story
started
to
spread
Harry
Potter
the
famous
Harry
Potter
their
hero
of
two
Quidditch
matches
had
lo
st
them
all
those
points
him
and
a
couple
of
other
stupid
first
years
from
being
one
of
the
most
popular
and
admired
people
at
the
school
Harry
was
suddenly
the
most
hated
even
Ravenclaws
and
Hufflepuffs
turned
on
him
because
everyone
had
been
longing
to
see
Slytherin
lose
the
house
cup
everywhere
Harry
went
people
pointed
and
didn't
trouble
to
lower
their
voices
as
they
insulted
him
slytherins
on
the
other
hand
clapped
as
he
walked
past
them
whistling
and
cheering
Thanks
Potter
we
owe
you
one
only
Ron
stood
by
him
they'll
all
forget
this
in
a
few
weeks
fred
and
George
have
lost
loads
of
points
in
all
the
time
they've
been
here
and
people
still
like
them
they've
never
lost
a
hundred
and
fifty
points
in
one
go
though
have
they
said
Harry
miserably
well
no
Ron
admitted
it
was
a
bit
late
to
repair
the
damage
but
Harry
swore
to
himself
not
to
meddle
in
things
that
weren't
his
business
from
now
on
he'd
had
it
with
sneaking
around
and
spying
he
felt
so
ashamed
of
himself
that
he
went
to
Wood
and
offered
to
resign
from
the
Quidditch
team
resign
wood
thundered
what
good'll
that
do
how
are
we
going
to
get
any
points
back
if
we
can't
win
at
Quidditch
but
even
Quidditch
had
lost
its
fun
the
rest
of
the
team
wouldn't
speak
to
Harry
during
practice
and
if
they
had
to
speak
about
him
they
called
him
the
Seeker
hermione
and
Neville
were
suffering
too
they
didn't
have
as
bad
a
time
as
Harry
because
they
weren't
as
well-known
but
nobody
would
speak
to
them
either
hermione
had
stopped
drawing
attention
to
herself
in
class
keeping
her
head
down
and
working
in
silence
harry
was
almost
glad
that
the
exams
weren't
far
away
all
the
studying
he
had
to
do
kept
his
mind
off
his
misery
he
Ron
and
Hermione
kept
to
themselves
working
late
into
the
night
trying
to
remember
the
ingredients
in
complicated
potions
learn
charms
and
spells
by
heart
memorize
the
dates
of
magical
discoveries
and
goblin
rebellions
then
about
a
week
before
the
exams
were
due
to
start
harry's
new
resolution
not
to
interfere
in
anything
that
didn't
concern
him
was
put
to
an
unexpected
test
walking
back
from
the
library
on
his
own
one
afternoon
he
heard
somebody
whimpering
from
a
classroom
up
ahead
as
he
drew
closer
he
heard
quirrell's
voice
no
no
not
again
please
it
sounded
as
though
someone
was
threatening
him
harry
moved
closer
all
right
all
right
he
heard
Quirrell
sob
next
second
Quirrell
came
hurrying
out
of
the
classroom
straightening
his
turban
he
was
pale
and
looked
as
though
he
was
about
to
cry
he
strode
out
of
sight
Harry
didn't
think
Quirrell
had
even
noticed
him
he
waited
until
quirrell's
footsteps
had
disappeared
then
peered
into
the
classroom
it
was
empty
but
a
door
stood
ajar
at
the
other
end
harry
was
halfway
toward
it
before
he
remembered
what
he'd
promised
himself
about
not
meddling
all
the
same
he'd
have
gambled
twelve
sorcerer's
Stones
that
Snape
had
just
left
the
room
and
from
what
Harry
had
just
heard
Snape
would
be
walking
with
a
new
spring
in
his
step
Quirrell
seemed
to
have
given
in
at
last
harry
went
back
to
the
library
where
Hermione
was
testing
Ron
on
Astronomy
harry
told
them
what
he'd
heard
snape's
done
it
then
said
Ron
if
quirrell's
told
him
how
to
break
his
Anti-Dark
Force
spell
there's
still
Fluffy
though
said
Hermione
maybe
snape's
found
out
how
to
get
past
him
without
asking
Hagrid
said
Ron
looking
up
at
the
thousands
of
books
surrounding
them
i
bet
there's
a
book
somewhere
in
here
telling
you
how
to
get
past
a
giant
three-headed
dog
so
what
do
we
do
Harry
the
light
of
adventure
was
kindling
again
in
ron's
eyes
but
Hermione
answered
before
Harry
could
go
to
Dumbledore
that's
what
we
should
have
done
ages
ago
if
we
try
anything
ourselves
we'll
be
thrown
out
for
sure
but
we've
got
no
proof
said
Harry
quirrell's
too
scared
to
back
us
up
snape's
only
got
to
say
he
doesn't
know
how
the
troll
got
in
at
Halloween
and
that
he
was
nowhere
near
the
third
floor
who
do
you
think
they'll
believe
him
or
us
it's
not
exactly
a
secret
we
hate
him
dumbledore'll
think
we
made
it
up
to
get
him
sacked
filch
wouldn't
help
us
if
his
life
depended
on
it
he's
too
friendly
with
Snape
and
the
more
students
get
thrown
out
the
better
he'll
think
and
don't
forget
we're
not
supposed
to
know
about
the
Stone
or
Fluffy
that'll
take
a
lot
of
explaining
hermione
looked
convinced
but
Ron
didn't
if
we
just
do
a
bit
of
poking
around
no
said
Harry
flatly
we've
done
enough
poking
around
he
pulled
a
map
of
Jupiter
toward
him
and
started
to
learn
the
names
of
its
moons
the
following
morning
notes
were
delivered
to
Harry
Hermione
and
Neville
at
the
breakfast
table
they
were
all
the
same
Your
detention
will
take
place
at
eleven
o'clock
tonight
meet
mr.
Filch
in
the
entrance
hall
professor
McGonagall
Harry
had
forgotten
they
still
had
detentions
to
do
in
the
furor
over
the
points
they'd
lost
he
half
expected
Hermione
to
complain
that
this
was
a
whole
night
of
studying
lost
but
she
didn't
say
a
word
like
Harry
she
felt
they
deserved
what
they'd
got
at
eleven
o'clock
that
night
they
said
good-bye
to
Ron
in
the
common
room
and
went
down
to
the
entrance
hall
with
Neville
filch
was
already
there
and
so
was
Malfoy
harry
had
also
forgotten
that
Malfoy
had
gotten
a
detention
too
follow
me
said
Filch
lighting
a
lamp
and
leading
them
outside
i
bet
you'll
think
twice
about
breaking
a
school
rule
again
won't
you
eh
he
said
leering
at
them
oh
yes
hard
work
and
pain
are
the
best
teachers
if
you
ask
me
it's
just
a
pity
they
let
the
old
punishments
die
out
hang
you
by
your
wrists
from
the
ceiling
for
a
few
days
i've
got
the
chains
still
in
my
office
keep
em
well
oiled
in
case
they're
ever
needed
right
off
we
go
and
don't
think
of
running
off
now
it'll
be
worse
for
you
if
you
do
they
marched
off
across
the
dark
grounds
neville
kept
sniffing
harry
wondered
what
their
punishment
was
going
to
be
it
must
be
something
really
horrible
or
Filch
wouldn't
be
sounding
so
delighted
the
moon
was
bright
but
clouds
scudding
across
it
kept
throwing
them
into
darkness
ahead
Harry
could
see
the
lighted
windows
of
hagrid's
hut
then
they
heard
a
distant
shout
is
that
you
Filch
hurry
up
I
want
ter
get
started
harry's
heart
rose
if
they
were
going
to
be
working
with
Hagrid
it
wouldn't
be
so
bad
his
relief
must
have
showed
in
his
face
because
Filch
said
I
suppose
you
think
you'll
be
enjoying
yourself
with
that
oaf
well
think
again
boy
it's
into
the
forest
you're
going
and
i'm
much
mistaken
if
you'll
all
come
out
in
one
piece
at
this
Neville
let
out
a
little
moan
and
Malfoy
stopped
dead
in
his
tracks
the
forest
he
repeated
and
he
didn't
sound
quite
as
cool
as
usual
we
can't
go
in
there
at
night
there's
all
sorts
of
things
in
there
werewolves
I
heard
neville
clutched
the
sleeve
of
harry's
robe
and
made
a
choking
noise
that's
your
problem
isn't
it
said
Filch
his
voice
cracking
with
glee
should've
thought
of
them
werewolves
before
you
got
in
trouble
shouldn't
you
hagrid
came
striding
toward
them
out
of
the
dark
Fang
at
his
heel
he
was
carrying
his
large
crossbow
and
a
quiver
of
arrows
hung
over
his
shoulder
abou
time
he
said
i

fer
half
an
hour
already
all
right
Harry
Hermione
i
shouldn't
be
too
friendly
to
them
Hagrid
said
Filch
coldly
they're
here
to
be
punished
after
all
that's
why
yer
late
is
it
said
Hagrid
frowning
at
Filch
bin
lecturin
them

bit
i'll

dawn
said
Filch
for
what's
left
of
them
he
added
nastily
and
he
turned
and
started
back
toward
the
castle
his
lamp
bobbing
away
in
the
darkness
malfoy
now
turned
to
Hagrid
i'm
not
going
in
that
forest
he
said
and
Harry
was
pleased
to
hear
the
note
of
panic
in
his
voice
yeh
are
if
yeh
want
ter
stay
at
Hogwarts
said
Hagrid
fiercely
yeh've
done
wrong
an
now
yehve
got
ter
pay
fer
it
but
this
is
servant
stuff
it's
not
for
students

copying
lines
or
something
if
my
father
knew
I
was
doing
this
he'd
tell
yer
that's
how

Hogwarts
Hagrid
growled
copyin

what
good's
that
ter
anyone

do
summat
useful
or
yeh'll
get
out
if
yeh
think
yer
father'd
rather
you
were
expelled
then
get
back
off
ter
the
castle
an
pack
go
on
Malfoy
didn't
move
he
looked
at
Hagrid
furiously
but
then
dropped
his
gaze
right
then
said
Hagrid
now
listen
carefully
cause
it's
dangerous
what
we're
gonna
do
tonight
an
I
don
want
no
one
takin
risks
follow
me
over
here
a
moment
he
led
them
to
the
very
edge
of
the
forest
holding
his
lamp
up
high
he
pointed
down
a
narrow
winding
earth
track
that
disappeared
into
the
thick
black
trees
a
light
breeze
lifted
their
hair
as
they
looked
into
the
forest
look
there
said
Hagrid
see
that
stuff
shinin
on
the
ground
silvery
stuff
that's
unicorn
blood
there's
a
unicorn
in
there
bin
hurt
badly
by
summat
this
is
the
second
time
in
a
week
i
found
one
dead
last
Wednesday
we're
gonna
try
an
find
the
poor
thing
we
might
have
ter
put
it
out
of
its
misery
and
what
if
whatever
hurt
the
unicorn
finds
us
first
said
Malfoy
unable
to
keep
the
fear
out
of
his
voice
there's
nothin
that
lives
in
the
forest
that'll
hurt
yeh
if
yer
with
me
or
Fang
said
Hagrid
an
keep
ter
the
path
right
now
we're
gonna
split
inter
two
parties
an
follow
the
trail
in
diff'rent
directions
there's
blood
all
over
the
place
it
must've
bin
staggerin
around
since
last
night
at
least
i
want
Fang
said
Malfoy
quickly
looking
at
fang's
long
teeth
all
right
but
I
warn
yeh
he's
a
coward
said
Hagrid
so
me
Harry
an
hermione'll
go
one
way
an
Draco
Neville
an
fang'll
go
the
other
now
if
any
of
us
finds
the
unicorn
we'll
send
up
green
sparks
right

yer
wands
out

practice
now
that's
it
an
if
anyone
gets
in
trouble
send
up
red
sparks
an
we'll
all
come
an
find
yeh
so
be
careful
let's
go
the
forest
was
black
and
silent
a
little
way
into
it
they
reached
a
fork
in
the
earth
path
and
Harry
Hermione
and
Hagrid
took
the
left
path
while
Malfoy
Neville
and
Fang
took
the
right
they
walked
in
silence
their
eyes
on
the
ground
every
now
and
then
a
ray
of
moonlight
through
the
branches
above
lit
a
spot
of
silver-blue
blood
on
the
fallen
leaves
harry
saw
that
Hagrid
looked
very
worried
could
a
werewolf
be
killing
the
unicorns
harry
asked
not
fast
enough
said
Hagrid
it's
not
easy
ter
catch
a
unicorn
they're
powerful
magic
creatures
i
never
knew
one
ter
be
hurt
before
they
walked
past
a
mossy
tree
stump
harry
could
hear
running
water
there
must
be
a
stream
somewhere
close
by
there
were
still
spots
of
unicorn
blood
here
and
there
along
the
winding
path
you
all
right
Hermione
hagrid
whispered
don
worry
it
can't've
gone
far
if
it's
this
badly
hurt
an
then
we'll
be
able
ter
get
behind
that
tree
hagrid
seized
Harry
and
Hermione
and
hoisted
them
off
the
path
behind
a
towering
oak
he
pulled
out
an
arrow
and
fitted
it
into
his
crossbow
raising
it
ready
to
fire
the
three
of
them
listened
something
was
slithering
over
dead
leaves
nearby
it
sounded
like
a
cloak
trailing
along
the
ground
hagrid
was
squinting
up
the
dark
path
but
after
a
few
seconds
the
sound
faded
away
i
knew
it
he
murmured
there's
summat
in
here
that
shouldn
be
a
werewolf
harry
suggested
that
wasn
no
werewolf
an
it
wasn
no
unicorn
neither
said
Hagrid
grimly
right
follow
me
but
careful
now
they
walked
more
slowly
ears
straining
for
the
faintest
sound
suddenly
in
a
clearing
ahead
something
definitely
moved
who's
there
hagrid
called
show
yerself
i'm
armed
and
into
the
clearing
came
was
it
a
man
or
a
horse
to
the
waist
a
man
with
red
hair
and
beard
but
below
that
was
a
horse's
gleaming
chestnut
body
with
a
long
reddish
tail
harry
and
hermione's
jaws
dropped
oh
it's
you
Ronan
said
Hagrid
in
relief
how
are
yeh
he
walked
forward
and
shook
the
centaur's
hand
good
evening
to
you
Hagrid
said
Ronan
he
had
a
deep
sorrowful
voice
were
you
going
to
shoot
me
can't
be
too
careful
Ronan
said
Hagrid
patting
his
crossbow
there's
summat
bad
loose
in
this
forest
this
is
Harry
Potter
an
Hermione
Granger
by
the
way
students
up
at
the
school
an
this
is
Ronan
you
two
he's
a
centaur
we'd
noticed
said
Hermione
faintly
good
evening
said
Ronan
students
are
you
and
do
you
learn
much
up
at
the
school
erm
a
bit
said
Hermione
timidly
a
bit
well
that's
something
ronan
sighed
he
flung
back
his
head
and
stared
at
the
sky
mars
is
bright
tonight
yeah
said
Hagrid
glancing
up
too
listen
i'm
glad
we've
run
inter
yeh
Ronan
cause
there's
a
unicorn
bin
hurt
you
seen
anythin
ronan
didn't
answer
immediately
he
stared
unblinkingly
upward
then
sighed
again
always
the
innocent
are
the
first
victims
he
said
so
it
has
been
for
ages
past
so
it
is
now
yeah
said
Hagrid
but
have
yeh
seen
anythin
Ronan
anythin
unusual
mars

bright
tonight
Ronan
repeated
while
Hagrid
watched
him
impatiently
unusually
bright
yeah
but
I
was
meanin
anythin
unusual
a
bit
nearer
home
said
Hagrid
so
yeh
haven't
noticed
anythin
strange
yet
again
Ronan
took
a
while
to
answer
at
last
he
said
The
forest
hides
many
secrets
a
movement
in
the
trees
behind
Ronan
made
Hagrid
raise
his
bow
again
but
it
was
only
a
second
centaur
black-haired
and
bodied
and
wilder-looking
than
Ronan
hullo
Bane
said
Hagrid
all
right
good
evening
Hagrid
I
hope
you
are
well
well
enough
look
i've
jus
bin
askin
Ronan
you
seen
anythin
odd
in
here
lately
there's
a
unicorn
bin
injured
would
yeh
know
anythin
about
it
bane
walked
over
to
stand
next
to
Ronan
he
looked
skyward
mars
is
bright
tonight
he
said
simply
we've
heard
said
Hagrid
grumpily
well
if
either
of
you
do
see
anythin
let
me
know
won't
yeh
we'll
be
off
then
harry
and
Hermione
followed
him
out
of
the
clearing
staring
over
their
shoulders
at
Ronan
and
Bane
until
the
trees
blocked
their
view
never
said
Hagrid
irritably
try
an
get
a
straight
answer
out
of
a
centaur
ruddy
stargazers
not
interested
in
anythin
closer'n
the
moon
are
there
many
of
them
in
here
asked
Hermione
oh
a
fair
few
keep
themselves
to
themselves
mostly
but
they're
good
enough
about
turnin
up
if
ever
I
want
a
word
they're
deep
mind
centaurs
they
know
things
jus
don
let
on
much
d'you
think
that
was
a
centaur
we
heard
earlier
said
Harry
did
that
sound
like
hooves
to
you
nah
if
yeh
ask
me
that
was
what's
bin
killin
the
unicorns
never
heard
anythin
like
it
before
they
walked
on
through
the
dense
dark
trees
harry
kept
looking
nervously
over
his
shoulder
he
had
the
nasty
feeling
they
were
being
watched
he
was
very
glad
they
had
Hagrid
and
his
crossbow
with
them
they
had
just
passed
a
bend
in
the
path
when
Hermione
grabbed
hagrid's
arm
hagrid
look
red
sparks
the
others
are
in
trouble
you
two
wait
here
hagrid
shouted
stay
on
the
path
i'll
come
back
for
yeh
they
heard
him
crashing
away
through
the
undergrowth
and
stood
looking
at
each
other
very
scared
until
they
couldn't
hear
anything
but
the
rustling
of
leaves
around
them
you
don't
think
they've
been
hurt
do
you
whispered
Hermione
i
don't
care
if
Malfoy
has
but
if
something's
got
Neville
it's
our
fault
he's
here
in
the
first
place
the
minutes
dragged
by
their
ears
seemed
sharper
than
usual
harry's
seemed
to
be
picking
up
every
sigh
of
the
wind
every
cracking
twig
what
was
going
on
where
were
the
others
at
last
a
great
crunching
noise
announced
hagrid's
return
malfoy
Neville
and
Fang
were
with
him
hagrid
was
fuming
malfoy
it
seemed
had
sneaked
up
behind
Neville
and
grabbed
him
as
a
joke
neville
had
panicked
and
sent
up
the
sparks
we'll
be
lucky
ter
catch
anythin
now
with
the
racket
you
two
were
makin
right
we're
changin
groups
Neville
you
stay
with
me
an
Hermione
Harry
you
go
with
Fang
an
this
idiot
i'm
sorry
Hagrid
added
in
a
whisper
to
Harry
but
he'll
have
a
harder
time
frightenin
you
an
we've
gotta
get
this
done
so
Harry
set
off
into
the
heart
of
the
forest
with
Malfoy
and
Fang
they
walked
for
nearly
half
an
hour
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
forest
until
the
path
became
almost
impossible
to
follow
because
the
trees
were
so
thick
harry
thought
the
blood
seemed
to
be
getting
thicker
there
were
splashes
on
the
roots
of
a
tree
as
though
the
poor
creature
had
been
thrashing
around
in
pain
close
by
harry
could
see
a
clearing
ahead
through
the
tangled
branches
of
an
ancient
oak
look
he
murmured
holding
out
his
arm
to
stop
Malfoy
something
bright
white
was
gleaming
on
the
ground
they
inched
closer
it
was
the
unicorn
all
right
and
it
was
dead
harry
had
never
seen
anything
so
beautiful
and
sad
its
long
slender
legs
were
stuck
out
at
odd
angles
where
it
had
fallen
and
its
mane
was
spread
pearly-white
on
the
dark
leaves
harry
had
taken
one
step
toward
it
when
a
slithering
sound
made
him
freeze
where
he
stood
a
bush
on
the
edge
of
the
clearing
quivered
then
out
of
the
shadows
a
hooded
figure
came
crawling
across
the
ground
like
some
stalking
beast
harry
Malfoy
and
Fang
stood
transfixed
the
cloaked
figure
reached
the
unicorn
lowered
its
head
over
the
wound
in
the
animal's
side
and
began
to
drink
its
blood
aaaaaaaaaargh
malfoy
let
out
a
terrible
scream
and
bolted
so
did
Fang
the
hooded
figure
raised
its
head
and
looked
right
at
Harry
unicorn
blood
was
dribbling
down
its
front
it
got
to
its
feet
and
came
swiftly
toward
Harry
he
couldn't
move
for
fear
then
a
pain
like
he'd
never
felt
before
pierced
his
head
it
was
as
though
his
scar
were
on
fire
half
blinded
he
staggered
backward
he
heard
hooves
behind
him
galloping
and
something
jumped
clean
over
Harry
charging
at
the
figure
the
pain
in
harry's
head
was
so
bad
he
fell
to
his
knees
it
took
a
minute
or
two
to
pass
when
he
looked
up
the
figure
had
gone
a
centaur
was
standing
over
him
not
Ronan
or
Bane
this
one
looked
younger
he
had
white-blond
hair
and
a
palomino
body
are
you
all
right
said
the
centaur
pulling
Harry
to
his
feet
yes
thank
you
what
was
that
the
centaur
didn't
answer
he
had
astonishingly
blue
eyes
like
pale
sapphires
he
looked
carefully
at
Harry
his
eyes
lingering
on
the
scar
that
stood
out
livid
on
harry's
forehead
you
are
the
Potter
boy
he
said
you
had
better
get
back
to
Hagrid
the
forest
is
not
safe
at
this
time
especially
for
you
can
you
ride
it
will
be
quicker
this
way
my
name
is
Firenze
he
added
as
he
lowered
himself
on
to
his
front
legs
so
that
Harry
could
clamber
onto
his
back
there
was
suddenly
a
sound
of
more
galloping
from
the
other
side
of
the
clearing
ronan
and
Bane
came
bursting
through
the
trees
their
flanks
heaving
and
sweaty
firenze
bane
thundered
what
are
you
doing
you
have
a
human
on
your
back
have
you
no
shame
are
you
a
common
mule
do
you
realize
who
this
is
said
Firenze
this
is
the
Potter
boy
the
quicker
he
leaves
this
forest
the
better
what
have
you
been
telling
him
growled
Bane
remember
Firenze
we
are
sworn
not
to
set
ourselves
against
the
heavens
have
we
not
read
what
is
to
come
in
the
movements
of
the
planets
ronan
pawed
the
ground
nervously
i'm
sure
Firenze
thought
he
was
acting
for
the
best
he
said
in
his
gloomy
voice
bane
kicked
his
back
legs
in
anger
for
the
best
what
is
that
to
do
with
us
centaurs
are
concerned
with
what
has
been
foretold
it
is
not
our
business
to
run
around
like
donkeys
after
stray
humans
in
our
forest
firenze
suddenly
reared
on
to
his
hind
legs
in
anger
so
that
Harry
had
to
grab
his
shoulders
to
stay
on
do
you
not
see
that
unicorn
firenze
bellowed
at
Bane
do
you
not
understand
why
it
was
killed
or
have
the
planets
not
let
you
in
on
that
secret
i
set
myself
against
what
is
lurking
in
this
forest
Bane
yes
with
humans
alongside
me
if
I
must
and
Firenze
whisked
around
with
Harry
clutching
on
as
best
he
could
they
plunged
off
into
the
trees
leaving
Ronan
and
Bane
behind
them
harry
didn't
have
a
clue
what
was
going
on
why's
Bane
so
angry
he
asked
what
was
that
thing
you
saved
me
from
anyway
firenze
slowed
to
a
walk
warned
Harry
to
keep
his
head
bowed
in
case
of
low-hanging
branches
but
did
not
answer
harry's
question
they
made
their
way
through
the
trees
in
silence
for
so
long
that
Harry
thought
Firenze
didn't
want
to
talk
to
him
anymore
they
were
passing
through
a
particularly
dense
patch
of
trees
however
when
Firenze
suddenly
stopped
harry
Potter
do
you
know
what
unicorn
blood
is
used
for
no
said
Harry
startled
by
the
odd
question
we've
only
used
the
horn
and
tail
hair
in
Potions
that
is
because
it
is
a
monstrous
thing
to
slay
a
unicorn
said
Firenze
only
one
who
has
nothing
to
lose
and
everything
to
gain
would
commit
such
a
crime
the
blood
of
a
unicorn
will
keep
you
alive
even
if
you
are
an
inch
from
death
but
at
a
terrible
price
you
have
slain
something
pure
and
defenseless
to
save
yourself
and
you
will
have
but
a
half-life
a
cursed
life
from
the
moment
the
blood
touches
your
lips
harry
stared
at
the
back
of
firenze's
head
which
was
dappled
silver
in
the
moonlight
but
who'd
be
that
desperate
he
wondered
aloud
if
you're
going
to
be
cursed
forever
deaths
better
isn't
it
it
is
Firenze
agreed
unless
all
you
need
is
to
stay
alive
long
enough
to
drink
something
else
something
that
will
bring
you
back
to
full
strength
and
power
something
that
will
mean
you
can
never
die
mr.
Potter
do
you
know
what
is
hidden
in
the
school
at
this
very
moment
the
sorcerer's
Stone
of
course
the
Elixir
of
Life
but
I
don't
understand
who
can
you
think
of
nobody
who
has
waited
many
years
to
return
to
power
who
has
clung
to
life
awaiting
their
chance
it
was
as
though
an
iron
fist
had
clenched
suddenly
around
harry's
heart
over
the
rustling
of
the
trees
he
seemed
to
hear
once
more
what
Hagrid
had
told
him
on
the
night
they
had
met
Some
say
he
died
codswallop
in
my
opinion
dunno
if
he
had
enough
human
left
in
him
to
die
do
you
mean
Harry
croaked
that
was
Vol
harry
harry
are
you
all
right
hermione
was
running
toward
them
down
the
path
Hagrid
puffing
along
behind
her
i'm
fine
said
Harry
hardly
knowing
what
he
was
saying
the
unicorn's
dead
Hagrid
it's
in
that
clearing
back
there
this
is
where
I
leave
you
Firenze
murmured
as
Hagrid
hurried
off
to
examine
the
unicorn
you
are
safe
now
harry
slid
off
his
back
good
luck
Harry
Potter
said
Firenze
the
planets
have
been
read
wrongly
before
now
even
by
centaurs
i
hope
this
is
one
of
those
times
he
turned
and
cantered
back
into
the
depths
of
the
forest
leaving
Harry
shivering
behind
him
ron
had
fallen
asleep
in
the
dark
common
room
waiting
for
them
to
return
he
shouted
something
about
Quidditch
fouls
when
Harry
roughly
shook
him
awake
in
a
matter
of
seconds
though
he
was
wide-eyed
as
Harry
began
to
tell
him
and
Hermione
what
had
happened
in
the
forest
harry
couldn't
sit
down
he
paced
up
and
down
in
front
of
the
fire
he
was
still
shaking
snape
wants
the
stone
for
Voldemort
and
voldemort's
waiting
in
the
forest
and
all
this
time
we
thought
Snape
just
wanted
to
get
rich
stop
saying
the
name
said
Ron
in
a
terrified
whisper
as
if
he
thought
Voldemort
could
hear
them
harry
wasn't
listening
firenze
saved
me
but
he
shouldn't
have
done
so
bane
was
furious
he
was
talking
about
interfering
with
what
the
planets
say
is
going
to
happen
they
must
show
that
voldemort's
coming
back
bane
thinks
Firenze
should
have
let
Voldemort
kill
me
i
suppose
that's
written
in
the
stars
as
well
will
you
stop
saying
the
name
ron
hissed
so
all
i've
got
to
wait
for
now
is
Snape
to
steal
the
Stone
Harry
went
on
feverishly
then
Voldemort
will
be
able
to
come
and
finish
me
off
well
I
suppose
bane'll
be
happy
hermione
looked
very
frightened
but
she
had
a
word
of
comfort
harry
everyone
says
dumbledore's
the
only
one
You-Know-Who
was
ever
afraid
of
With
Dumbledore
around
You-Know-Who
won't
touch
you
anyway
who
says
the
centaurs
are
right
it
sounds
like
fortune-telling
to
me
and
Professor
McGonagall
says
that's
a
very
imprecise
branch
of
magic
the
sky
had
turned
light
before
they
stopped
talking
they
went
to
bed
exhausted
their
throats
sore
but
the
night's
surprises
weren't
over
when
Harry
pulled
back
his
sheets
he
found
his
invisibility
cloak
folded
neatly
underneath
them
there
was
a
note
pinned
to
it
Just
in
case
chapter
sixteen
through
the
trapdoor
in
years
to
come
Harry
would
never
quite
remember
how
he
had
managed
to
get
through
his
exams
when
he
half
expected
Voldemort
to
come
bursting
through
the
door
at
any
moment
yet
the
days
crept
by
and
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
Fluffy
was
still
alive
and
well
behind
the
locked
door
it
was
sweltering
hot
especially
in
the
large
classroom
where
they
did
their
written
papers
they
had
been
given
special
new
quills
for
the
exams
which
had
been
bewitched
with
an
AntiCheating
spell
they
had
practical
exams
as
well
professor
Flitwick
called
them
one
by
one
into
his
class
to
see
if
they
could
make
a
pineapple
tapdance
across
a
desk
professor
McGonagall
watched
them
turn
a
mouse
into
a
snuffbox
points
were
given
for
how
pretty
the
snuffbox
was
but
taken
away
if
it
had
whiskers
snape
made
them
all
nervous
breathing
down
their
necks
while
they
tried
to
remember
how
to
make
a
Forgetfulness
potion
harry
did
the
best
he
could
trying
to
ignore
the
stabbing
pains
in
his
forehead
which
had
been
bothering
him
ever
since
his
trip
into
the
forest
neville
thought
Harry
had
a
bad
case
of
exam
nerves
because
Harry
couldn't
sleep
but
the
truth
was
that
Harry
kept
being
woken
by
his
old
nightmare
except
that
it
was
now
worse
than
ever
because
there
was
a
hooded
figure
dripping
blood
in
it
maybe
it
was
because
they
hadn't
seen
what
Harry
had
seen
in
the
forest
or
because
they
didn't
have
scars
burning
on
their
foreheads
but
Ron
and
Hermione
didn't
seem
as
worried
about
the
Stone
as
Harry
the
idea
of
Voldemort
certainly
scared
them
but
he
didn't
keep
visiting
them
in
dreams
and
they
were
so
busy
with
their
studying
they
didn't
have
much
time
to
fret
about
what
Snape
or
anyone
else
might
be
up
to
their
very
last
exam
was
History
of
Magic
one
hour
of
answering
questions
about
batty
old
wizards
who'd
invented
selfstirring
cauldrons
and
they'd
be
free
free
for
a
whole
wonderful
week
until
their
exam
results
came
out
when
the
ghost
of
Professor
Binns
told
them
to
put
down
their
quills
and
roll
up
their
parchment
Harry
couldn't
help
cheering
with
the
rest
that
was
far
easier
than
I
thought
it
would
be
said
Hermione
as
they
joined
the
crowds
flocking
out
onto
the
sunny
grounds
i
needn't
have
learned
about
the
Werewolf
Code
of
Conduct
or
the
uprising
of
Elfric
the
Eager
hermione
always
liked
to
go
through
their
exam
papers
afterward
but
Ron
said
this
made
him
feel
ill
so
they
wandered
down
to
the
lake
and
flopped
under
a
tree
the
Weasley
twins
and
Lee
Jordan
were
tickling
the
tentacles
of
a
giant
squid
which
was
basking
in
the
warm
shallows
no
more
studying
Ron
sighed
happily
stretching
out
on
the
grass
you
could
look
more
cheerful
Harry
we've
got
a
week
before
we
find
out
how
badly
we've
done
there's
no
need
to
worry
yet
harry
was
rubbing
his
forehead
i
wish
I
knew
what
this
means
he
burst
out
angrily
my
scar
keeps
hurting
it's
happened
before
but
never
as
often
as
this
go
to
Madam
Pomfrey
Hermione
suggested
i'm
not
ill
said
Harry
i
think
it's
a
warning
it
means
danger's
coming
ron
couldn't
get
worked
up
it
was
too
hot
harry
relax
hermione's
right
the
stone's
safe
as
long
as
dumbledore's
around
anyway
we've
never
had
any
proof
Snape
found
out
how
to
get
past
Fluffy
he
nearly
had
his
leg
ripped
off
once
he's
not
going
to
try
it
again
in
a
hurry
and
Neville
will
play
Quidditch
for
England
before
Hagrid
lets
Dumbledore
down
harry
nodded
but
he
couldn't
shake
off
a
lurking
feeling
that
there
was
something
he'd
forgotten
to
do
something
important
when
he
tried
to
explain
this
Hermione
said
that's
just
the
exams
i
woke
up
last
night
and
was
halfway
through
my
Transfiguration
notes
before
I
remembered
we'd
done
that
one
harry
was
quite
sure
the
unsettled
feeling
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
work
though
he
watched
an
owl
flutter
toward
the
school
across
the
bright
blue
sky
a
note
clamped
in
its
mouth
hagrid
was
the
only
one
who
ever
sent
him
letters
hagrid
would
never
betray
Dumbledore
hagrid
would
never
tell
anyone
how
to
get
past
Fluffy
never
but
Harry
suddenly
jumped
to
his
feet
where're
you
going
said
Ron
sleepily
i've
just
thought
of
something
said
Harry
he
had
turned
white
we've
got
to
go
and
see
Hagrid
now
why
panted
Hermione
hurrying
to
keep
up
don't
you
think
it's
a
bit
odd
said
Harry
scrambling
up
the
grassy
slope
that
what
Hagrid
wants
more
than
anything
else
is
a
dragon
and
a
stranger
turns
up
who
just
happens
to
have
an
egg
in
his
pocket
how
many
people
wander
around
with
dragon
eggs
if
it's
against
wizard
law
lucky
they
found
Hagrid
don't
you
think
why
didn't
I
see
it
before
what
are
you
talking
about
said
Ron
but
Harry
sprinting
across
the
grounds
toward
the
forest
didn't
answer
hagrid
was
sitting
in
an
armchair
outside
his
house
his
trousers
and
sleeves
were
rolled
up
and
he
was
shelling
peas
into
a
large
bowl
hullo
he
said
smiling
finished
yer
exams
got
time
fer
a
drink
yes
please
said
Ron
but
Harry
cut
him
off
no
we're
in
a
hurry
hagrid
i've
got
to
ask
you
something
you
know
that
night
you
won
Norbert
what
did
the
stranger
you
were
playing
cards
with
look
like
dunno
said
Hagrid
casually
he
wouldn
take
his
cloak
off
he
saw
the
three
of
them
look
stunned
and
raised
his
eyebrows
it's
not
that
unusual
yeh
get
a
lot
o
funny
folk
in
the
hog's
Head
that's
the
pub
down
in
the
village
mighta
bin
a
dragon
dealer
mightn
he
i
never
saw
his
face
he
kept
his
hood
up
harry
sank
down
next
to
the
bowl
of
peas
what
did
you
talk
to
him
about
Hagrid
did
you
mention
Hogwarts
at
all
mighta
come
up
said
Hagrid
frowning
as
he
tried
to
remember
yeah
he
asked
what
I
did
an
I
told
him
I
was
gamekeeper
here
he
asked
a
bit
about
the
sorta
creatures
I
took
after
so
I
told
him
an
I
said
what
i'd
always
really
wanted
was
a
dragon
an
then
i
can
remember
too
well
cause
he
kept
buyin
me
drinks
let's
see
yeah
then
he
said
he
had
the
dragon
egg
an
we
could
play
cards
fer
it
if
I
wanted
but
he
had
ter
be
sure
I
could
handle
it
he
didn
want
it
ter
go
ter
any
old
home
so
I
told
him
after
Fluffy
a
dragon
would
be
easy
and
did
he
did
he
seem
interested
in
Fluffy
harry
asked
try
ing
to
keep
his
voice
calm
well
yeah
how
many
three-headed
dogs
d'yeh
meet
even
around
Hogwarts
so
I
told
him
fluffy's
a
piece
o
cake
if
yeh
know
how
to
calm
him
down
jus
play
him
a
bit
o
music
an
he'll
go
straight
off
ter
sleep
hagrid
suddenly
looked
horrified
i
shouldn'ta
told
yeh
that
he
blurted
out
forget
I
said
it
hey
where're
yeh
goin
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
didn't
speak
to
each
other
at
all
until
they
came
to
a
halt
in
the
entrance
hall
which
seemed
very
cold
and
gloomy
after
the
grounds
we've
got
to
go
to
Dumbledore
said
Harry
hagrid
told
that
stranger
how
to
get
past
Fluffy
and
it
was
either
Snape
or
Voldemort
under
that
cloak
it
must've
been
easy
once
he'd
got
Hagrid
drunk
i
just
hope
Dumbledore
believes
us
firenze
might
back
us
up
if
Bane
doesn't
stop
him
where's
dumbledore's
office
they
looked
around
as
if
hoping
to
see
a
sign
pointing
them
in
the
right
direction
they
had
never
been
told
where
Dumbledore
lived
nor
did
they
know
anyone
who
had
been
sent
to
see
him
we'll
just
have
to
Harry
began
but
a
voice
suddenly
rang
across
the
hall
what
are
you
three
doing
inside
it
was
Professor
McGonagall
carrying
a
large
pile
of
books
we
want
to
see
Professor
Dumbledore
said
Hermione
rather
bravely
Harry
and
Ron
thought
see
Professor
Dumbledore
professor
McGonagall
repeated
as
though
this
was
a
very
fishy
thing
to
want
to
do
why
harry
swallowed
now
what
it's
sort
of
secret
he
said
but
he
wished
at
once
he
hadn't
because
Professor
mcgonagall's
nostrils
flared
professor
Dumbledore
left
ten
minutes
ago
she
said
coldly
he
received
an
urgent
owl
from
the
Ministry
of
Magic
and
flew
off
for
London
at
once
he's
gone
said
Harry
frantically
now
professor
Dumbledore
is
a
very
great
wizard
Potter
he
has
many
demands
on
his
time
But
this
is
important
something
you
have
to
say
is
more
important
than
the
Ministry
of
Magic
Potter
look
said
Harry
throwing
caution
to
the
winds
Professor
it's
about
the
sorcerer's
tone
whatever
Professor
McGonagall
had
expected
it
wasn't
that
the
books
she
was
carrying
tumbled
out
of
her
arms
but
she
didn't
pick
them
up
how
do
you
know
she
spluttered
professor
I
think
I
know
that
Sn
that
someone's
going
to
try
and
steal
the
Stone
i've
got
to
talk
to
Professor
Dumbledore
she
eyed
him
with
a
mixture
of
shock
and
suspicion
professor
Dumbledore
will
be
back
tomorrow
she
said
finally
i
don't
know
how
you
found
out
about
the
Stone
but
rest
assured
no
one
can
possibly
steal
it
it's
too
well
protected
but
Professor
potter
I
know
what
i'm
talking
about
she
said
shortly
she
bent
down
and
gathered
up
the
fallen
books
i
suggest
you
all
go
back
outside
and
enjoy
the
sunshine
but
they
didn't
it's
tonight
said
Harry
once
he
was
sure
Professor
McGonagall
was
out
of
earshot
snape's
going
through
the
trapdoor
tonight
he's
found
out
everything
he
needs
and
now
he's
got
Dumbledore
out
of
the
way
he
sent
that
note
I
bet
the
Ministry
of
Magic
will
get
a
real
shock
when
Dumbledore
turns
up
but
what
can
we
hermione
gasped
harry
and
Ron
wheeled
round
snape
was
standing
there
good
afternoon
he
said
smoothly
they
stared
at
him
you
shouldn't
be
inside
on
a
day
like
this
he
said
with
an
odd
twisted
smile
we
were
Harry
began
without
any
idea
what
he
was
going
to
say
you
want
to
be
more
careful
said
Snape
hanging
around
like
this
people
will
think
you're
up
to
something
and
Gryffindor
really
can't
afford
to
lose
any
more
points
can
it
harry
flushed
they
turned
to
go
outside
but
Snape
called
them
back
be
warned
Potter
any
more
nighttime
wanderings
and
I
will
personally
make
sure
you
are
expelled
good
day
to
you
he
strode
off
in
the
direction
of
the
staffroom
out
on
the
stone
steps
Harry
turned
to
the
others
right
here's
what
we've
got
to
do
he
whispered
urgently
one
of
us
has
got
to
keep
an
eye
on
Snape
wait
outside
the
staff
room
and
follow
him
if
he
leaves
it
hermione
you'd
better
do
that
why
me
it's
obvious
said
Ron
you
can
pretend
to
be
waiting
for
Professor
Flitwick
you
know
he
put
on
a
high
voice
Oh
Professor
Flitwick
i'm
so
worried
I
think
I
got
question
fourteen
b
wrong
oh
shut
up
said
Hermione
but
she
agreed
to
go
and
watch
out
for
Snape
and
we'd
better
stay
outside
the
third-floor
corridor
Harry
told
Ron
come
on
but
that
part
of
the
plan
didn't
work
no
sooner
had
they
reached
the
door
separating
Fluffy
from
the
rest
of
the
school
than
Professor
McGonagall
turned
up
again
and
this
time
she
lost
her
temper
i
suppose
you
think
you're
harder
to
get
past
than
a
pack
of
enchantments
she
stormed
enough
of
this
nonsense
if
I
hear
you
ve
come
anywhere
near
here
again
i'll
take
another
fifty
points
from
Gryffindor
yes
Weasley
from
my
own
house
harry
and
Ron
went
back
to
the
common
room
Harry
had
just
said
At
least
hermione's
on
snape's
tail
when
the
portrait
of
the
Fat
Lady
swung
open
and
Hermione
came
in
i'm
sorry
Harry
she
wailed
snape
came
out
and
asked
me
what
I
was
doing
so
I
said
I
was
waiting
for
Flitwick
and
Snape
went
to
get
him
and
i've
only
just
got
away
I
don't
know
where
Snape
went
well
that's
it
then
isn't
it
harry
said
the
other
two
stared
at
him
he
was
pale
and
his
eyes
were
glittering
i'm
going
out
of
here
tonight
and
i'm
going
to
try
and
get
to
the
Stone
first
you're
mad
said
Ron
you
can't
said
Hermione
after
what
McGonagall
and
Snape
have
said
you'll
be
expelled
so
whap
Harry
shouted
don't
you
understand
if
Snape
gets
hold
of
the
Stone
voldemort's
coming
back
haven't
you
heard
what
it
was
like
when
he
was
trying
to
take
over
there
won't
be
any
Hogwarts
to
get
expelled
from
he'll
flatten
it
or
turn
it
into
a
school
for
the
Dark
Arts
losing
points
doesn't
matter
anymore
can't
you
see
d'you
think
he'll
leave
you
and
your
families
alone
if
Gryffindor
wins
the
house
cup
if
I
get
caught
before
I
can
get
to
the
Stone
well
i'll
have
to
go
back
to
the
Dursleys
and
wait
for
Voldemort
to
find
me
there
it's
only
dying
a
bit
later
than
I
would
have
because
i'm
never
going
over
to
the
Dark
Side
i'm
going
through
that
trapdoor
tonight
and
nothing
you
two
say
is
going
to
stop
me
voldemort
killed
my
parents
remember
he
glared
at
them
you're
right
Harry
said
Hermione
in
a
small
voice
i'll
use
the
invisibility
cloak
said
Harry
it's
just
lucky
I
got
it
back
but
will
it
cover
all
three
of
us
said
Ron
all
all
three
of
us
oh
come
off
it
you
don't
think
we'd
let
you
go
alone
of
course
not
said
Hermione
briskly
how
do
you
think
you'd
get
to
the
Stone
without
us
i'd
better
go
and
took
through
my
books
there
might
be
something
useful
but
if
we
get
caught
you
two
will
be
expelled
too
not
if
I
can
help
it
said
Hermione
grimly
flitwick
told
me
in
secret
that
I
got
a
hundred
and
twelve
percent
on
his
exam
they're
not
throwing
me
out
after
that
after
dinner
the
three
of
them
sat
nervously
apart
in
the
common
room
nobody
bothered
them
none
of
the
Gryffindors
had
anything
to
say
to
Harry
any
more
after
all
this
was
the
first
night
he
hadn't
been
upset
by
it
hermione
was
skimming
through
all
her
notes
hoping
to
come
across
one
of
the
enchantments
they
were
about
to
try
to
break
harry
and
Ron
didn't
talk
much
both
of
them
were
thinking
about
what
they
were
about
to
do
slowly
the
room
emptied
as
people
drifted
off
to
bed
better
get
the
cloak
Ron
muttered
as
Lee
Jordan
finally
left
stretching
and
yawning
harry
ran
upstairs
to
their
dark
dormitory
he
putted
out
the
cloak
and
then
his
eyes
fell
on
the
flute
Hagrid
had
given
him
for
Christmas
he
pocketed
it
to
use
on
Fluffy
he
didn't
feel
much
like
singing
he
ran
back
down
to
the
common
room
we'd
better
put
the
cloak
on
here
and
make
sure
it
covers
all
three
of
us
if
Filch
spots
one
of
our
feet
wandering
along
on
its
own
what
are
you
doing
said
a
voice
from
the
corner
of
the
room
neville
appeared
from
behind
an
armchair
clutching
Trevor
the
toad
who
looked
as
though
he'd
been
making
another
bid
for
freedom
nothing
Neville
nothing
said
Harry
hurriedly
putting
the
cloak
behind
his
back
neville
stared
at
their
guilty
faces
you're
going
out
again
he
said
no
no
no
said
Hermione
no
we're
not
why
don't
you
go
to
bed
Neville
harry
looked
at
the
grandfather
clock
by
the
door
they
couldn't
afford
to
waste
any
more
time
Snape
might
even
now
be
playing
Fluffy
to
sleep
you
can't
go
out
said
Neville
you'll
be
caught
again
gryffindor
will
be
in
even
more
trouble
you
don't
understand
said
Harry
this
is
important
but
Neville
was
clearly
steeling
himself
to
do
something
desperate
i
won't
let
you
do
it
he
said
hurrying
to
stand
in
front
of
the
portrait
hole
i'll
i'll
fight
you
neville
Ron
exploded
get
away
from
that
hole
and
don't
be
an
idiot
don't
you
call
me
an
idiot
said
Neville
i
don't
think
you
should
be
breaking
any
more
rules
and
you
were
the
one
who
told
me
to
stand
up
to
people
yes
but
not
to
us
said
Ron
in
exasperation
neville
you
don't
know
what
you're
doing
he
took
a
step
forward
and
Neville
dropped
Trevor
the
toad
who
leapt
out
of
sight
go
on
then
try
and
hit
me
said
Neville
raising
his
fists
i'm
ready
harry
turned
to
Hermione
do
something
he
said
desperately
hermione
stepped
forward
neville
she
said
i'm
really
really
sorry
about
this
she
raised
her
wand
petrificus
Totalus
she
cried
pointing
it
at
Neville
neville's
arms
snapped
to
his
sides
his
legs
sprang
together
his
whole
body
rigid
he
swayed
where
he
stood
and
then
fell
flat
on
his
face
stiff
as
a
board
hermione
ran
to
turn
him
over
neville's
jaws
were
jammed
together
so
he
couldn't
speak
only
his
eyes
were
moving
looking
at
them
in
horror
what've
you
done
to
him
harry
whispered
it's
the
full
Body-Bind
said
Hermione
miserably
oh
Neville
i'm
so
sorry
we
had
to
Neville
no
time
to
explain
said
Harry
you'll
understand
later
Neville
said
Ron
as
they
stepped
over
him
and
pulled
on
the
invisibility
cloak
but
leaving
Neville
lying
motionless
on
the
floor
didn't
feel
like
a
very
good
omen
in
their
nervous
state
every
statue's
shadow
looked
like
Filch
every
distant
breath
of
wind
sounded
like
Peeves
swooping
down
on
them
at
the
foot
of
the
first
set
of
stairs
they
spotted
Mrs
norris
skulking
near
the
top
oh
let's
kick
her
just
this
once
Ron
whispered
in
harry's
ear
but
Harry
shook
his
head
as
they
climbed
carefully
around
her
Mrs
norris
turned
her
lamplike
eyes
on
them
but
didn't
do
anything
they
didn't
meet
anyone
else
until
they
reached
the
staircase
up
to
the
third
floor
peeves
was
bobbing
halfway
up
loosening
the
carpet
so
that
people
would
trip
who's
there
he
said
suddenly
as
they
climbed
toward
him
he
narrowed
his
wicked
black
eyes
know
you're
there
even
if
I
can't
see
you
are
you
ghoulie
or
ghostie
or
wee
student
beastie
he
rose
up
in
the
air
and
floated
there
squinting
at
them
should
call
Filch
I
should
if
something's
a-creeping
around
unseen
harry
had
a
sudden
idea
peeves
he
said
in
a
hoarse
whisper
the
Bloody
Baron
has
his
own
reasons
for
being
invisible
peeves
almost
fell
out
of
the
air
in
shock
he
caught
himself
in
time
and
hovered
about
a
foot
off
the
stairs
so
sorry
your
bloodiness
mr.
Baron
Sir
he
said
greasily
my
mistake
my
mistake
I
didn't
see
you
of
course
I
didn't
you're
invisible
forgive
old
Peevsie
his
little
joke
sir
i
have
business
here
Peeves
croaked
Harry
stay
away
from
this
place
tonight
i
will
sir
I
most
certainly
will
said
Peeves
rising
up
in
the
air
again
hope
your
business
goes
well
Baron
i'll
not
bother
you
and
he
scooted
off
Brilliant
Harry
whispered
Ron
a
few
seconds
later
they
were
there
outside
the
third-floor
corridor
and
the
door
was
already
ajar
well
there
you
are
Harry
said
quietly
snape's
already
got
past
Fluffy
seeing
the
open
door
somehow
seemed
to
impress
upon
all
three
of
them
what
was
facing
them
underneath
the
cloak
Harry
turned
to
the
other
two
if
you
want
to
go
back
I
won't
blame
you
he
said
you
can
take
the
cloak
I
won't
need
it
now
don't
be
stupid
said
Ron
we're
coming
said
Hermione
harry
pushed
the
door
open
as
the
door
creaked
low
rumbling
growls
met
their
ears
all
three
of
the
dog's
noses
sniffed
madly
in
their
direction
even
though
it
couldn't
see
them
what's
that
at
its
feet
hermione
whispered
looks
like
a
harp
said
Ron
snape
must
have
left
it
there
it
must
wake
up
the
moment
you
stop
playing
said
Harry
well
here
goes
he
put
hagrid's
flute
to
his
lips
and
blew
it
wasn't
really
a
tune
but
from
the
first
note
the
beast's
eyes
began
to
droop
harry
hardly
drew
breath
slowly
the
dog's
growls
ceased
it
tottered
on
its
paws
and
fell
to
its
knees
then
it
slumped
to
the
ground
fast
asleep
keep
playing
Ron
warned
Harry
as
they
slipped
out
of
the
cloak
and
crept
toward
the
trapdoor
they
could
feel
the
dog's
hot
smelly
breath
as
they
approached
the
giant
heads
i
think
we'll
be
able
to
pull
the
door
open
said
Ron
peering
over
the
dog's
back
want
to
go
first
Hermione
no
I
don't
all
right
ron
gritted
his
teeth
and
stepped
carefully
over
the
dog's
legs
he
bent
and
pulled
the
ring
of
the
trapdoor
which
swung
up
and
open
what
can
you
see
hermione
said
anxiously
nothing
just
black
there's
no
way
of
climbing
down
we'll
just
have
to
drop
harry
who
was
still
playing
the
flute
waved
at
Ron
to
get
his
attention
and
pointed
at
himself
you
want
to
go
first
are
you
sure
said
Ron
i
don't
know
how
deep
this
thing
goes
give
the
flute
to
Hermione
so
she
can
keep
him
asleep
harry
handed
the
flute
over
in
the
few
seconds
silence
the
dog
growled
and
twitched
but
the
moment
Hermione
began
to
play
it
fell
back
into
its
deep
sleep
harry
climbed
over
it
and
looked
down
through
the
trapdoor
there
was
no
sign
of
the
bottom
he
lowered
himself
through
the
hole
until
he
was
hanging
on
by
his
fingertips
then
he
looked
up
at
Ron
and
said
If
anything
happens
to
me
don't
follow
go
straight
to
the
owlery
and
send
Hedwig
to
Dumbledore
right
right
said
Ron
see
you
in
a
minute
I
hope
and
Harry
let
go
cold
damp
air
rushed
past
him
as
he
fell
down
down
down
and
flump
with
a
funny
muffled
sort
of
thump
he
landed
on
something
soft
he
sat
up
and
felt
around
his
eyes
not
used
to
the
gloom
it
felt
as
though
he
was
sitting
on
some
sort
of
plant
it's
okay
he
called
up
to
the
light
the
size
of
a
postage
stamp
which
was
the
open
trapdoor
it's
a
soft
landing
you
can
jump
ron
followed
right
away
he
landed
sprawled
next
to
Harry
what's
this
stuff
were
his
first
words
dunno
some
sort
of
plant
thing
i
suppose
it's
here
to
break
the
fall
come
on
Hermione
the
distant
music
stopped
there
was
a
loud
bark
from
the
dog
but
Hermione
had
already
jumped
she
landed
on
harry's
other
side
we
must
be
miles
under
the
school
she
said
lucky
this
plant
thing's
here
really
said
Ron
lucky
shrieked
Hermione
look
at
you
both
she
leapt
up
and
struggled
toward
a
damp
wall
she
had
to
struggle
because
the
moment
she
had
landed
the
plant
had
started
to
twist
snakelike
tendrils
around
her
ankles
as
for
Harry
and
Ron
their
legs
had
already
been
bound
tightly
in
long
creepers
without
their
noticing
hermione
had
managed
to
free
herself
before
the
plant
got
a
firm
grip
on
her
now
she
watched
in
horror
as
the
two
boys
fought
to
pull
the
plant
off
them
but
the
more
they
strained
against
it
the
tighter
and
faster
the
plant
wound
around
them
stop
moving
hermione
ordered
them
i
know
what
this
is
it's
devil's
Snare
oh
i'm
so
glad
we
know
what
it's
called
that's
a
great
help
snarled
Ron
leaning
back
trying
to
stop
the
plant
from
curling
around
his
neck
shut
up
i'm
trying
to
remember
how
to
kill
it
said
Hermione
well
hurry
up
I
can't
breathe
harry
gasped
wrestling
with
it
as
it
curled
around
his
chest
devil's
Snare
devil's
Snare
what
did
Professor
Sprout
say
it
likes
the
dark
and
the
damp
So
light
a
fire
harry
choked
yes
of
course
but
there's
no
wood
hermione
cried
wringing
her
hands
have
you
gone
mad
ron
bellowed
are
you
A
witch
or
not
oh
right
said
Hermione
and
she
whipped
out
her
wand
waved
it
muttered
something
and
sent
a
jet
of
the
same
bluebell
flames
she
had
used
on
Snape
at
the
plant
in
a
matter
of
seconds
the
two
boys
felt
it
loosening
its
grip
as
it
cringed
away
from
the
light
and
warmth
wriggling
and
flailing
it
unraveled
itself
from
their
bodies
and
they
were
able
to
pull
free
lucky
you
pay
attention
in
Herbology
Hermione
said
Harry
as
he
joined
her
by
the
wall
wiping
sweat
off
his
face
yeah
said
Ron
and
lucky
Harry
doesn't
lose
his
head
in
a
crisis
there's
no
wood
honestly
this
way
said
Harry
pointing
down
a
stone
passageway
which
was
the
only
way
forward
all
they
could
hear
apart
from
their
footsteps
was
the
gentle
drip
of
water
trickling
down
the
walls
the
passageway
sloped
downward
and
Harry
was
reminded
of
Gringotts
with
an
unpleasant
jolt
of
the
heart
he
remembered
the
dragons
said
to
be
guarding
vaults
in
the
wizards
bank
if
they
met
a
dragon
a
fully-grown
dragon
Norbert
had
been
bad
enough
can
you
hear
something
ron
whispered
harry
listened
a
soft
rustling
and
clinking
seemed
to
be
coming
from
up
ahead
do
you
think
it's
a
ghost
i
don't
know
sounds
like
wings
to
me
there's
light
ahead
I
can
see
something
moving
they
reached
the
end
of
the
passageway
and
saw
before
them
a
brilliantly
lit
chamber
its
ceiling
arching
high
above
them
it
was
full
of
small
jewel-bright
birds
fluttering
and
tumbling
all
around
the
room
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
chamber
was
a
heavy
wooden
door
do
you
think
they'll
attack
us
if
we
cross
the
room
said
Ron
probably
said
Harry
they
don't
look
very
vicious
but
I
suppose
if
they
all
swooped
down
at
once
well
there's
no
other
choice
i'll
run
he
took
a
deep
breath
covered
his
face
with
his
arms
and
sprinted
across
the
room
he
expected
to
feel
sharp
beaks
and
claws
tearing
at
him
any
second
but
nothing
happened
he
reached
the
door
untouched
he
pulled
the
handle
but
it
was
locked
the
other
two
followed
him
they
tugged
and
heaved
at
the
door
but
it
wouldn't
budge
not
even
when
Hermione
tried
her
Alohomora
charm
now
what
said
Ron
these
birds
they
can't
be
here
just
for
decoration
said
Hermione
they
watched
the
birds
soaring
overhead
glittering
glittering
they're
not
birds
harry
said
suddenly
they're
keys
winged
keys
look
carefully
so
that
must
mean
he
looked
around
the
chamber
while
the
other
two
squinted
up
at
the
flock
of
keys
yes
look
broomsticks
we've
got
to
catch
the
key
to
the
door
but
there
are
hundreds
of
them
ron
examined
the
lock
on
the
door
we're
looking
for
a
big
old-fashioned
one
probably
silver
like
the
handle
they
each
seized
a
broomstick
and
kicked
off
into
the
air
soaring
into
the
midst
of
the
cloud
of
keys
they
grabbed
and
snatched
but
the
bewitched
keys
darted
and
dived
so
quickly
it
was
almost
impossible
to
catch
one
not
for
nothing
though
was
Harry
the
youngest
Seeker
in
a
century
he
had
a
knack
for
spotting
things
other
people
didn't
after
a
minute's
weaving
about
through
the
whirl
of
rainbow
feathers
he
noticed
a
large
silver
key
that
had
a
bent
wing
as
if
it
had
already
been
caught
and
stuffed
roughly
into
the
keyhole
that
one
he
called
to
the
others
that
big
one
there
no
there
with
bright
blue
wings
the
feathers
are
all
crumpled
on
one
side
ron
went
speeding
in
the
direction
that
Harry
was
pointing
crashed
into
the
ceiling
and
nearly
fell
off
his
broom
we've
got
to
close
in
on
it
harry
called
not
taking
his
eyes
off
the
key
with
the
damaged
wing
ron
you
come
at
it
from
above
Hermione
stay
below
and
stop
it
from
going
down
and
i'll
try
and
catch
it
right
now
ron
dived
Hermione
rocketed
upward
the
key
dodged
them
both
and
Harry
streaked
after
it
it
sped
toward
the
wall
Harry
leaned
forward
and
with
a
nasty
crunching
noise
pinned
it
against
the
stone
with
one
hand
ron
and
hermione's
cheers
echoed
around
the
high
chamber
they
landed
quickly
and
Harry
ran
to
the
door
the
key
struggling
in
his
hand
he
rammed
it
into
the
lock
and
turned
it
worked
the
moment
the
lock
had
clicked
open
the
key
took
flight
again
looking
very
battered
now
that
it
had
been
caught
twice
ready
harry
asked
the
other
two
his
hand
on
the
door
handle
they
nodded
he
pulled
the
door
open
the
next
chamber
was
so
dark
they
couldn't
see
anything
at
all
but
as
they
stepped
into
it
light
suddenly
flooded
the
room
to
reveal
an
astonishing
sight
they
were
standing
on
the
edge
of
a
huge
chessboard
behind
the
black
chessmen
which
were
all
taller
than
they
were
and
carved
from
what
looked
like
black
stone
facing
them
way
across
the
chamber
were
the
white
pieces
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
shivered
slightly
the
towering
white
chessmen
had
no
faces
now
what
do
we
do
harry
whispered
it's
obvious
isn't
it
said
Ron
we've
got
to
play
our
way
across
the
room
behind
the
white
pieces
they
could
see
another
door
how
said
Hermione
nervously
i
think
said
Ron
we're
going
to
have
to
be
chessmen
he
walked
up
to
a
black
knight
and
put
his
hand
out
to
touch
the
knight's
horse
at
once
the
stone
sprang
to
life
the
horse
pawed
the
ground
and
the
knight
turned
his
helmeted
head
to
look
down
at
Ron
do
we
er
have
to
join
you
to
get
across
the
black
knight
nodded
ron
turned
to
the
other
two
this
needs
thinking
about
he
said
i
suppose
we've
got
to
take
the
place
of
three
of
the
black
pieces
harry
and
Hermione
stayed
quiet
watching
Ron
think
finally
he
said
Now
don't
be
offended
or
anything
but
neither
of
you
are
that
good
at
chess
we're
not
offended
said
Harry
quickly
just
tell
us
what
to
do
well
Harry
you
take
the
place
of
that
bishop
and
Hermione
you
next
to
him
instead
of
that
castle
what
about
you
i'm
going
to
be
a
knight
said
Ron
the
chessmen
seemed
to
have
been
listening
because
at
these
words
a
knight
a
bishop
and
a
castle
turned
their
backs
on
the
white
pieces
and
walked
off
the
board
leaving
three
empty
squares
that
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
took
white
always
plays
first
in
chess
said
Ron
peering
across
the
board
yes
look
a
white
pawn
had
moved
forward
two
squares
ron
started
to
direct
the
black
pieces
they
moved
silently
wherever
he
sent
them
harry's
knees
were
trembling
what
if
they
lost
harry
move
diagonally
four
squares
to
the
right
their
first
real
shock
came
when
their
other
knight
was
taken
the
white
queen
smashed
him
to
the
floor
and
dragged
him
off
the
board
where
he
lay
quite
still
facedown
had
to
let
that
happen
said
Ron
looking
shaken
leaves
you
free
to
take
that
bishop
Hermione
go
on
every
time
one
of
their
men
was
lost
the
white
pieces
showed
no
mercy
soon
there
was
a
huddle
of
limp
black
players
slumped
along
the
wall
twice
Ron
only
just
noticed
in
time
that
Harry
and
Hermione
were
in
danger
he
himself
darted
around
the
board
taking
almost
as
many
white
pieces
as
they
had
lost
black
ones
we're
nearly
there
he
muttered
suddenly
let
me
think
let
me
think
the
white
queen
turned
her
blank
face
toward
him
yes
said
Ron
softly
it's
the
only
way
i've
got
to
be
taken
nof
Harry
and
Hermione
shouted
that's
chess
snapped
Ron
you've
got
to
make
some
sacrifices
i
take
one
step
forward
and
she'll
take
me
that
leaves
you
free
to
checkmate
the
king
Harry
but
do
you
want
to
stop
Snape
or
not
ron
look
if
you
don't
hurry
up
he'll
already
have
the
Stone
there
was
no
alternative
ready
ron
called
his
face
pale
but
determined
here
I
go
now
don't
hang
around
once
you've
won
he
stepped
forward
and
the
white
queen
pounced
she
struck
Ron
hard
across
the
head
with
her
stone
arm
and
he
crashed
to
the
floor
Hermione
screamed
but
stayed
on
her
square
the
white
queen
dragged
Ron
to
one
side
he
looked
as
if
he'd
been
knocked
out
shaking
Harry
moved
three
spaces
to
the
left
the
white
king
took
off
his
crown
and
threw
it
at
harry's
feet
they
had
won
the
chessmen
parted
and
bowed
leaving
the
door
ahead
clear
with
one
last
desperate
look
back
at
Ron
Harry
and
Hermione
charged
through
the
door
and
up
the
next
passageway
what
if
he's
he'll
be
all
right
said
Harry
trying
to
convince
himself
what
do
you
reckon's
next
we've
had
sprout's
that
was
the
devil's
Snare
Flitwick
must've
put
charms
on
the
keys
McGonagall
transfigured
the
chessmen
to
make
them
alive
that
leaves
quirrell's
spell
and
snape's
they
had
reached
another
door
all
right
harry
whispered
go
on
harry
pushed
it
open
a
disgusting
smell
filled
their
nostrils
making
both
of
them
pull
their
robes
up
over
their
noses
eyes
watering
they
saw
flat
on
the
floor
in
front
of
them
a
troll
even
larger
than
the
one
they
had
tackled
out
cold
with
a
bloody
lump
on
its
head
i'm
glad
we
didn't
have
to
fight
that
one
Harry
whispered
as
they
stepped
carefully
over
one
of
its
massive
legs
come
on
I
can't
breathe
he
pulled
open
the
next
door
both
of
them
hardly
daring
to
look
at
what
came
next
but
there
was
nothing
very
frightening
in
here
just
a
table
with
seven
differently
shaped
bottles
standing
on
it
in
a
line
snape's
said
Harry
what
do
we
have
to
do
they
stepped
over
the
threshold
and
immediately
a
fire
sprang
up
behind
them
in
the
doorway
it
wasn't
ordinary
fire
either
it
was
purple
at
the
same
instant
black
flames
shot
up
in
the
doorway
leading
onward
they
were
trapped
look
hermione
seized
a
roll
of
paper
lying
next
to
the
bottles
harry
looked
over
her
shoulder
to
read
it
Danger
lies
before
you
while
safety
lies
behind
Two
of
us
will
help
you
which
ever
you
would
find
One
among
us
seven
will
let
you
move
ahead
Another
will
transport
the
drinker
back
instead
Two
among
our
number
hold
only
nettle
wine
Three
of
us
are
killers
waiting
bidden
in
line
choose
unless
you
wish
to
stay
here
forevermore
To
help
you
in
your
choice
we
give
you
these
clues
four
First
however
slyly
the
poison
tries
to
hide
You
will
always
find
some
on
nettle
wine's
left
side
Second
different
are
those
who
stand
at
either
end
But
if
you
would
move
onward
neither
is
your
friend
Third
as
you
see
clearly
all
are
different
size
Neither
dwarf
nor
giant
holds
death
in
their
insides
Fourth
the
second
left
and
the
second
on
the
right
Are
twins
once
you
taste
them
though
different
at
first
sight
hermione
let
out
a
great
sigh
and
Harry
amazed
saw
that
she
was
smiling
the
very
last
thing
he
felt
like
doing
brilliant
said
Hermione
this
isn't
magic
it's
logic
a
puzzle
a
lot
of
the
greatest
wizards
haven't
got
an
ounce
of
logic
they'd
be
stuck
in
here
forever
but
so
will
we
won't
we
of
course
not
said
Hermione
everything
we
need
is
here
on
this
paper
seven
bottles
three
are
poison
two
are
wine
one
will
get
us
safely
through
the
black
fire
and
one
will
get
us
back
through
the
purple
but
how
do
we
know
which
to
drink
give
me
a
minute
hermione
read
the
paper
several
times
then
she
walked
up
and
down
the
line
of
bottles
muttering
to
herself
and
pointing
at
them
at
last
she
clapped
her
hands
got
it
she
said
the
smallest
bottle
will
get
us
through
the
black
fire
toward
the
Stone
harry
looked
at
the
tiny
bottle
there's
only
enough
there
for
one
of
us
he
said
that's
hardly
one
swallow
they
looked
at
each
other
which
one
will
get
you
back
through
the
purple
flames
hermione
pointed
at
a
rounded
bottle
at
the
right
end
of
the
line
you
drink
that
said
Harry
no
listen
get
back
and
get
Ron
grab
brooms
from
the
flying
key
room
they'll
get
you
out
of
the
trapdoor
and
past
Fluffy
go
straight
to
the
owlery
and
send
Hedwig
to
Dumbledore
we
need
him
i
might
be
able
to
hold
Snape
off
for
a
while
but
i'm
no
match
for
him
really
but
Harry
what
if
you-know-who's
with
him
well
I
was
lucky
once
wasn't
I
said
Harry
pointing
at
his
scar
i
might
get
lucky
again
hermione's
lip
trembled
and
she
suddenly
dashed
at
Harry
and
threw
her
arms
around
him
hermione
harry
you're
a
great
wizard
you
know
i'm
not
as
good
as
you
said
Harry
very
embarrassed
as
she
let
go
of
him
me
said
Hermione
books
and
cleverness
there
are
more
important
things
friendship
and
bravery
and
oh
Harry
be
careful
you
drink
first
said
Harry
you
are
sure
which
is
which
aren't
you
positive
said
Hermione
she
took
a
long
drink
from
the
round
bottle
at
the
end
and
shuddered
it's
not
poison
said
Harry
anxiously
no
but
it's
like
ice
quick
go
before
it
wears
off
good
luck
take
care
go
hermione
turned
and
walked
straight
through
the
purple
fire
harry
took
a
deep
breath
and
picked
up
the
smallest
bottle
he
turned
to
face
the
black
flames
here
I
come
he
said
and
he
drained
the
little
bottle
in
one
gulp
it
was
indeed
as
though
ice
was
flooding
his
body
he
put
the
bottle
down
and
walked
forward
he
braced
himself
saw
the
black
flames
licking
his
body
but
couldn't
feel
them
for
a
moment
he
could
see
nothing
but
dark
fire
then
he
was
on
the
other
side
in
the
last
chamber
there
was
already
someone
there
but
it
wasn't
Snape
it
wasn't
even
Voldemort
chapter
seventeen
the
man
with
two
faces
It
was
Quirrell
you
gasped
Harry
quirrell
smiled
his
face
wasn't
twitching
at
all
me
he
said
calmly
i
wondered
whether
i'd
be
meeting
you
here
Potter
but
I
thought
Snape
severus
quirrell
laughed
and
it
wasn't
his
usual
quivering
treble
either
but
cold
and
sharp
yes
Severus
does
seem
the
type
doesn't
he
so
useful
to
have
him
swooping
around
like
an
overgrown
bat
next
to
him
who
would
suspect
p-p-poor
st-stuttering
P-Professor
Quirrell
harry
couldn't
take
it
in
this
couldn't
be
true
it
couldn't
but
Snape
tried
to
kill
me
no
no
no
i
tried
to
kill
you
your
friend
Miss
Granger
accidentally
knocked
me
over
as
she
rushed
to
set
fire
to
Snape
at
that
Quidditch
match
she
broke
my
eye
contact
with
you
another
few
seconds
and
i'd
have
got
you
off
that
broom
i'd
have
managed
it
before
then
if
Snape
hadn't
been
muttering
a
countercurse
trying
to
save
you
snape
was
trying
to
save
me
of
course
said
Quirrell
coolly
Why
do
you
think
he
wanted
to
referee
your
next
match
he
was
trying
to
make
sure
I
didn't
do
it
again
funny
really
he
needn't
have
bothered
i
couldn't
do
anything
with
Dumbledore
watching
all
the
other
teachers
thought
Snape
was
trying
to
stop
Gryffindor
from
winning
he
did
make
himself
unpopular
and
what
a
waste
of
time
when
after
all
that
i'm
going
to
kill
you
tonight
quirrell
snapped
his
fingers
ropes
sprang
out
of
thin
air
and
wrapped
themselves
tightly
around
Harry
you're
too
nosy
to
live
Potter
scurrying
around
the
school
on
Halloween
like
that
for
all
I
knew
you'd
seen
me
coming
to
look
at
what
was
guarding
the
Stone
you
let
the
troll
in
certainly
i
have
a
special
gift
with
trolls
you
must
have
seen
what
I
did
to
the
one
in
the
chamber
back
there
unfortunately
while
everyone
else
was
running
around
looking
for
it
Snape
who
already
suspected
me
went
straight
to
the
third
floor
to
head
me
off
and
not
only
did
my
troll
fail
to
beat
you
to
death
that
three-headed
dog
didn't
even
manage
to
bite
snape's
leg
off
properly
now
wait
quietly
Potter
i
need
to
examine
this
interesting
mirror
it
was
only
then
that
Harry
realized
what
was
standing
behind
Quirrell
it
was
the
Mirror
of
Erised
this
mirror
is
the
key
to
finding
the
Stone
Quirrell
murmured
tapping
his
way
around
the
frame
trust
Dumbledore
to
come
up
with
something
like
this
but
he's
in
London
i'll
be
far
away
by
the
time
he
gets
back
all
Harry
could
think
of
doing
was
to
keep
Quirrell
talking
and
stop
him
from
concentrating
on
the
mirror
i
saw
you
and
Snape
in
the
forest
he
blurted
out
yes
said
Quirrell
idly
walking
around
the
mirror
to
look
at
the
back
he
was
on
to
me
by
that
time
trying
to
find
out
how
far
i'd
got
he
suspected
me
all
along
tried
to
frighten
me
as
though
he
could
when
I
had
Lord
Voldemort
on
my
side
quirrell
came
back
out
from
behind
the
mirror
and
stared
hungrily
into
it
i
see
the
Stone
i'm
presenting
it
to
my
master
but
where
is
it
harry
struggled
against
the
ropes
binding
him
but
they
didn't
give
he
had
to
keep
Quirrell
from
giving
his
whole
attention
to
the
mirror
but
Snape
always
seemed
to
hate
me
so
much
oh
he
does
said
Quirrell
casually
heavens
yes
he
was
at
Hogwarts
with
your
father
didn't
you
know
they
loathed
each
other
but
he
never
wanted
you
dead
but
I
heard
you
a
few
days
ago
sobbing
I
thought
Snape
was
threatening
you
for
the
first
time
a
spasm
of
fear
flitted
across
quirrell's
face
sometimes
he
said
I
find
it
hard
to
follow
my
master's
instructions
he
is
a
great
wizard
and
I
am
weak
you
mean
he
was
there
in
the
classroom
with
you
harry
gasped
he
is
with
me
wherever
I
go
said
Quirrell
quietly
i
met
him
when
I
traveled
around
the
world
a
foolish
young
man
I
was
then
full
of
ridiculous
ideas
about
good
and
evil
lord
Voldemort
showed
me
how
wrong
I
was
there
is
no
good
and
evil
there
is
only
power
and
those
too
weak
to
seek
it
since
then
I
have
served
him
faithfully
although
I
have
let
him
down
many
times
he
has
had
to
be
very
hard
on
me
quirrell
shivered
suddenly
he
does
not
forgive
mistakes
easily
when
I
failed
to
steal
the
stone
from
Gringotts
he
was
most
displeased
he
punished
me
decided
he
would
have
to
keep
a
closer
watch
on
me
quirrell's
voice
trailed
away
harry
was
remembering
his
trip
to
Diagon
Alley
how
could
he
have
been
so
stupid
he'd
seen
Quirrell
there
that
very
day
shaken
hands
with
him
in
the
Leaky
Cauldron
quirrell
cursed
under
his
breath
i
don't
understand
is
the
Stone
inside
the
mirror
should
I
break
it
harry's
mind
was
racing
what
I
want
more
than
anything
else
in
the
world
at
the
moment
he
thought
is
to
find
the
Stone
before
Quirrell
does
so
if
I
look
in
the
mirror
I
should
see
myseff
finding
it
which
means
i'll
see
where
it's
hidden
but
how
can
I
look
without
Quirrell
realizing
what
i'm
up
to
he
tried
to
edge
to
the
left
to
get
in
front
of
the
glass
without
Quirrell
noticing
but
the
ropes
around
his
ankles
were
too
tight
he
tripped
and
fell
over
quirrell
ignored
him
he
was
still
talking
to
himself
what
does
this
mirror
do
how
does
it
work
help
me
Master
and
to
harry's
horror
a
voice
answered
and
the
voice
seemed
to
come
from
Quirrell
himself
Use
the
boy
use
the
boy
quirrell
rounded
on
Harry
yes
Potter
come
here
he
clapped
his
hands
once
and
the
ropes
binding
Harry
fell
off
harry
got
slowly
to
his
feet
come
here
Quirrell
repeated
look
in
the
mirror
and
tell
me
what
you
see
harry
walked
toward
him
i
must
lie
he
thought
desperately
i
must
look
and
lie
about
what
I
see
that's
all
quirrell
moved
close
behind
him
harry
breathed
in
the
funny
smell
that
seemed
to
come
from
quirrell's
turban
he
closed
his
eyes
stepped
in
front
of
the
mirror
and
opened
them
again
he
saw
his
reflection
pale
and
scared-looking
at
first
but
a
moment
later
the
reflection
smiled
at
him
it
put
its
hand
into
its
pocket
and
pulled
out
a
blood-red
stone
it
winked
and
put
the
Stone
back
in
its
pocket
and
as
it
did
so
Harry
felt
something
heavy
drop
into
his
real
pocket
somehow
incredibly
he'd
gotten
the
Stone
well
said
Quirrell
impatiently
what
do
you
see
harry
screwed
up
his
courage
i
see
myself
shaking
hands
with
Dumbledore
he
invented
i
i've
won
the
house
cup
for
Gryffindor
quirrell
cursed
again
get
out
of
the
way
he
said
as
Harry
moved
aside
he
felt
the
sorcerer's
Stone
against
his
leg
dare
he
make
a
break
for
it
but
he
hadn't
walked
five
paces
before
a
high
voice
spoke
though
Quirrell
wasn't
moving
his
lips
he
lies
he
lies
potter
come
back
here
quirrell
shouted
tell
me
the
truth
what
did
you
just
see
the
high
voice
spoke
again
let
me
speak
to
him
face-to-face
master
you
are
not
strong
enough
i
have
strength
enough
for
this
harry
felt
as
if
devil's
Snare
was
rooting
him
to
the
spot
he
couldn't
move
a
muscle
petrified
he
watched
as
Quirrell
reached
up
and
began
to
unwrap
his
turban
what
was
going
on
the
turban
fell
away
quirrell's
head
looked
strangely
small
without
it
then
he
turned
slowly
on
the
spot
harry
would
have
screamed
but
he
couldn't
make
a
sound
where
there
should
have
been
a
back
to
quirrell's
head
there
was
a
face
the
most
terrible
face
Harry
had
ever
seen
it
was
chalk
white
with
glaring
red
eyes
and
slits
for
nostrils
like
a
snake
harry
Potter
it
whispered
harry
tried
to
take
a
step
backward
but
his
legs
wouldn't
move
see
what
I
have
become
the
face
said
mere
shadow
and
vapor
i
have
form
only
when
I
can
share
another's
body
but
there
have
always
been
those
willing
to
let
me
into
their
hearts
and
minds
unicorn
blood
has
strengthened
me
these
past
weeks
you
saw
faithful
Quirrell
drinking
it
for
me
in
the
forest
and
once
I
have
the
Elixir
of
Life
I
will
be
able
to
create
a
body
of
my
own
now
why
don't
you
give
me
that
Stone
in
your
pocket
so
he
knew
the
feeling
suddenly
surged
back
into
harry's
legs
he
stumbled
backward
don't
be
a
fool
snarled
the
face
better
save
your
own
life
and
join
me
or
you'll
meet
the
same
end
as
your
parents
they
died
begging
me
for
mercy
liar
harry
shouted
suddenly
quirrell
was
walking
backward
at
him
so
that
Voldemort
could
still
see
him
the
evil
face
was
now
smiling
how
touching
it
hissed
i
always
value
bravery
yes
boy
your
parents
were
brave
i
killed
your
father
first
and
he
put
up
a
courageous
fight
but
your
mother
needn't
have
died
she
was
trying
to
protect
you
now
give
me
the
Stone
unless
you
want
her
to
have
died
in
vain
never
harry
sprang
toward
the
flame
door
but
Voldemort
screamed
seize
him
and
the
next
second
Harry
felt
quirrell's
hand
close
on
his
wrist
at
once
a
needle-sharp
pain
seared
across
harry's
scar
his
head
felt
as
though
it
was
about
to
split
in
two
he
yelled
struggling
with
all
his
might
and
to
his
surprise
Quirrell
let
go
of
him
the
pain
in
his
head
lessened
he
looked
around
wildly
to
see
where
Quirrell
had
gone
and
saw
him
hunched
in
pain
looking
at
his
fingers
they
were
blistering
before
his
eyes
seize
him
seize
him
shrieked
Voldemort
again
and
Quirrell
lunged
knocking
Harry
clean
off
his
feet
landing
on
top
of
him
both
hands
around
harry's
neck
harry's
scar
was
almost
blinding
him
with
pain
yet
he
could
see
Quirrell
howling
in
agony
master
I
cannot
hold
him
my
hands
my
hands
and
Quirrell
though
pinning
Harry
to
the
ground
with
his
knees
let
go
of
his
neck
and
stared
bewildered
at
his
own
palms
Harry
could
see
they
looked
burned
raw
red
and
shiny
then
kill
him
fool
and
be
done
screeched
Voldemort
quirrell
raised
his
hand
to
perform
a
deadly
curse
but
Harry
by
instinct
reached
up
and
grabbed
quirrell's
face
aaaargh
quirrell
rolled
off
him
his
face
blistering
too
and
then
Harry
knew
Quirrell
couldn't
touch
his
bare
skin
not
without
suffering
terrible
pain
his
only
chance
was
to
keep
hold
of
Quirrell
keep
him
in
enough
pain
to
stop
him
from
doing
a
curse
harry
jumped
to
his
feet
caught
Quirrell
by
the
arm
and
hung
on
as
tight
as
he
could
quirrell
screamed
and
tried
to
throw
Harry
off
the
pain
in
harry's
head
was
building
he
couldn't
see
he
could
only
hear
quirrell's
terrible
shrieks
and
voldemort's
yells
of
kill
him
kill
him
and
other
voices
maybe
in
harry's
own
head
crying
Harry
harry
he
felt
quirrell's
arm
wrenched
from
his
grasp
knew
all
was
lost
and
fell
into
blackness
down
down
down
something
gold
was
glinting
just
above
him
the
Snitch
he
tried
to
catch
it
but
his
arms
were
too
heavy
he
blinked
it
wasn't
the
Snitch
at
all
it
was
a
pair
of
glasses
how
strange
he
blinked
again
the
smiling
face
of
Albus
Dumbledore
swam
into
view
above
him
good
afternoon
Harry
said
Dumbledore
harry
stared
at
him
then
he
remembered
Sir
the
Stone
it
was
Quirrell
he's
got
the
Stone
sir
quick
calm
yourself
dear
boy
you
are
a
little
behind
the
times
said
Dumbledore
quirrell
does
not
have
the
Stone
then
who
does
sir
I
harry
please
relax
or
Madam
Pomfrey
will
have
me
thrown
out
harry
swallowed
and
looked
around
him
he
realized
he
must
be
in
the
hospital
wing
he
was
lying
in
a
bed
with
white
linen
sheets
and
next
to
him
was
a
table
piled
high
with
what
looked
like
half
the
candy
shop
tokens
from
your
friends
and
admirers
said
Dumbledore
beaming
what
happened
down
in
the
dungeons
between
you
and
Professor
Quirrell
is
a
complete
secret
so
naturally
the
whole
school
knows
i
believe
your
friends
Misters
Fred
and
George
Weasley
were
responsible
for
trying
to
send
you
a
toilet
seat
no
doubt
they
thought
it
would
amuse
you
madam
Pomfrey
however
felt
it
might
not
be
very
hygienic
and
confiscated
it
how
long
have
I
been
in
here
three
days
mr.
Ronald
Weasley
and
Miss
Granger
will
be
most
relieved
you
have
come
round
they
have
been
extremely
worried
but
sit
the
Stone
I
see
you
are
not
to
be
distracted
very
well
the
Stone
professor
Quirrell
did
not
manage
to
take
it
from
you
i
arrived
in
time
to
prevent
that
although
you
were
doing
very
well
on
your
own
I
must
say
you
got
there
you
got
hermione's
owl
we
must
have
crossed
in
midair
no
sooner
had
I
reached
London
than
it
became
clear
to
me
that
the
place
I
should
be
was
the
one
I
had
just
left
i
arrived
just
in
time
to
pull
Quirrell
off
you
it
was
you
i
feared
I
might
be
too
late
you
nearly
were
I
couldn't
have
kept
him
off
the
Stone
much
longer
not
the
Stone
boy
you
the
effort
involved
nearly
killed
you
for
one
terrible
moment
there
I
was
afraid
it
had
as
for
the
Stone
it
has
been
destroyed
destroyed
said
Harry
blankly
but
your
friend
Nicolas
Flamel
oh
you
know
about
Nicolas
said
Dumbledore
sounding
quite
delighted
you
did
do
the
thing
properly
didn't
you
well
Nicolas
and
I
have
had
a
little
chat
and
agreed
it's
all
for
the
best
but
that
means
he
and
his
wife
will
die
won't
they
they
have
enough
Elixir
stored
to
set
their
affairs
in
order
and
then
yes
they
will
die
dumbledore
smiled
at
the
look
of
amazement
on
harry's
face
to
one
as
young
as
you
i'm
sure
it
seems
incredible
but
to
Nicolas
and
Perenelle
it
really
is
like
going
to
bed
after
a
very
very
long
day
after
all
to
the
well-organized
mind
death
is
but
the
next
great
adventure
you
know
the
Stone
was
really
not
such
a
wonderful
thing
as
much
money
and
life
as
you
could
want
the
two
things
most
human
beings
would
choose
above
all
the
trouble
is
humans
do
have
a
knack
of
choosing
precisely
those
things
that
are
worst
for
them
harry
lay
there
lost
for
words
dumbledore
hummed
a
little
and
smiled
at
the
ceiling
sir
said
Harry
i've
been
thinking
sir
even
if
the
stone's
gone
Vol
I
mean
You-Know
Who
call
him
Voldemort
Harry
always
use
the
proper
name
for
things
fear
of
a
name
increases
fear
of
the
thing
itself
yes
sir
well
voldemort's
going
to
try
other
ways
of
coming
back
isn't
he
i
mean
he
hasn't
gone
has
he
no
Harry
he
has
not
he
is
still
out
there
somewhere
perhaps
looking
for
another
body
to
share
not
being
truly
alive
he
cannot
be
killed
he
left
Quirrell
to
die
he
shows
just
as
little
mercy
to
his
followers
as
his
enemies
nevertheless
Harry
while
you
may
only
have
delayed
his
return
to
power
it
will
merely
take
someone
else
who
is
prepared
to
fight
what
seems
a
losing
battle
next
time
and
if
he
is
delayed
again
and
again
why
he
may
never
return
to
power
harry
nodded
but
stopped
quickly
because
it
made
his
head
hurt
then
he
said
Sir
there
are
some
other
things
i'd
like
to
know
if
you
can
tell
me
things
I
want
to
know
the
truth
about
the
truth
dumbledore
sighed
it
is
a
beautiful
and
terrible
thing
and
should
therefore
be
treated
with
great
caution
however
I
shall
answer
your
questions
unless
I
have
a
very
good
reason
not
to
in
which
case
I
beg
you'll
forgive
me
i
shall
not
of
course
lie
well
voldemort
said
that
he
only
killed
my
mother
because
she
tried
to
stop
him
from
killing
me
but
why
would
he
want
to
kill
me
in
the
first
place
dumbledore
sighed
very
deeply
this
time
alas
the
first
thing
you
ask
me
I
cannot
tell
you
not
today
not
now
you
will
know
one
day
put
it
from
your
mind
for
now
Harry
when
you
are
older
i
know
you
hate
to
hear
this
when
you
are
ready
you
will
know
and
Harry
knew
it
would
be
no
good
to
argue
but
why
couldn't
Quirrell
touch
me
your
mother
died
to
save
you
if
there
is
one
thing
Voldemort
cannot
understand
it
is
love
he
didn't
realize
that
love
as
powerful
as
your
mother's
for
you
leaves
its
own
mark
not
a
scar
no
visible
sign
to
have
been
loved
so
deeply
even
though
the
person
who
loved
us
is
gone
will
give
us
some
protection
forever
it
is
in
your
very
skin
quirrell
full
of
hatred
greed
and
ambition
sharing
his
soul
with
Voldemort
could
not
touch
you
for
this
reason
it
was
agony
to
touch
a
person
marked
by
something
so
good
dumbledore
now
became
very
interested
in
a
bird
out
on
the
windowsill
which
gave
Harry
time
to
dry
his
eyes
on
the
sheet
when
he
had
found
his
voice
again
Harry
said
And
the
invisibility
cloak
do
you
know
who
sent
it
to
me
ah
your
father
happened
to
leave
it
in
my
possession
and
I
thought
you
might
like
it
dumbledore's
eyes
twinkled
useful
things
your
father
used
it
mainly
for
sneaking
off
to
the
kitchens
to
steal
food
when
he
was
here
and
there's
something
else
fire
away
quirrell
said
Snape
professor
Snape
Harry
yes
him
Quirrell
said
he
hates
me
because
he
hated
my
father
is
that
true
well
they
did
rather
detest
each
other
not
unlike
yourself
and
mr.
Malfoy
and
then
your
father
did
something
Snape
could
never
forgive
what
he
saved
his
life
what
yes
said
Dumbledore
dreamily
funny
the
way
people's
minds
work
isn't
it
professor
Snape
couldn't
bear
being
in
your
father's
debt
i
do
believe
he
worked
so
hard
to
protect
you
this
year
because
he
felt
that
would
make
him
and
your
father
even
then
he
could
go
back
to
hating
your
father's
memory
in
peace
harry
tried
to
understand
this
but
it
made
his
head
pound
so
he
stopped
and
sir
there's
one
more
thing
just
the
one
how
did
I
get
the
Stone
out
of
the
mirror
ah
now
i'm
glad
you
asked
me
that
it
was
one
of
my
more
brilliant
ideas
and
between
you
and
me
that's
saying
something
you
see
only
one
who
wanted
to
find
the
Stone
find
it
but
not
use
it
would
be
able
to
get
it
otherwise
they'd
just
see
themselves
making
gold
or
drinking
Elixir
of
Life
my
brain
surprises
even
me
sometimes
now
enough
questions
i
suggest
you
make
a
start
on
these
sweets
ah
bettie
bott's
Every
Flavor
Beans
i
was
unfortunate
enough
in
my
youth
to
come
across
a
vomitflavored
one
and
since
then
i'm
afraid
i've
rather
lost
my
liking
for
them
but
I
think
i'll
be
safe
with
a
nice
toffee
don't
you
he
smiled
and
popped
the
golden-brown
bean
into
his
mouth
then
he
choked
and
said
Alas
ear
wax
madam
Pomfrey
the
nurse
was
a
nice
woman
but
very
strict
just
five
minutes
Harry
pleaded
absolutely
not
you
let
Professor
Dumbledore
in
well
of
course
that
was
the
headmaster
quite
different
you
need
rest
i
am
resting
look
lying
down
and
everything
oh
go
on
Madam
Pomfrey
oh
very
well
she
said
but
five
minutes
only
and
she
let
Ron
and
Hermione
in
harry
hermione
looked
ready
to
fling
her
arms
around
him
again
but
Harry
was
glad
she
held
herself
in
as
his
head
was
still
very
sore
oh
Harry
we
were
sure
you
were
going
to
Dumbledore
was
so
worried
the
whole
school's
talking
about
it
said
Ron
what
really
happened
it
was
one
of
those
rare
occasions
when
the
true
story
is
even
more
strange
and
exciting
than
the
wild
rumors
harry
told
them
everything
Quirrell
the
mirror
the
Stone
and
Voldemort
ron
and
Hermione
were
a
very
good
audience
they
gasped
in
all
the
right
places
and
when
Harry
told
them
what
was
under
quirrell's
turban
Hermione
screamed
out
loud
so
the
stone's
gone
said
Ron
finally
flamel's
just
going
to
die
that's
what
I
said
but
Dumbledore
thinks
that
what
was
it
to
the
well-organized
mind
death
is
but
the
next
great
adventure
i
always
said
he
was
off
his
rocker
said
Ron
looking
quite
impressed
at
how
crazy
his
hero
was
so
what
happened
to
you
two
said
Harry
well
I
got
back
all
right
said
Hermione
i
brought
Ron
round
that
took
a
while
and
we
were
dashing
up
to
the
owlery
to
contact
Dumbledore
when
we
met
him
in
the
entrance
hall
he
already
knew
he
just
said
harry's
gone
after
him
hasn't
he
and
hurtled
off
to
the
third
floor
d'you
think
he
meant
you
to
do
it
said
Ron
sending
you
your
father's
cloak
and
everything
well
Hermione
exploded
if
he
did
I
mean
to
say
that's
terrible
you
could
have
been
killed
no
it
isn't
said
Harry
thoughtfully
he's
a
funny
man
Dumbledore
i
think
he
sort
of
wanted
to
give
me
a
chance
i
think
he
knows
more
or
less
everything
that
goes
on
here
you
know
i
reckon
he
had
a
pretty
good
idea
we
were
going
to
try
and
instead
of
stopping
us
he
just
taught
us
enough
to
help
i
don't
think
it
was
an
accident
he
let
me
find
out
how
the
mirror
worked
it's
almost
like
he
thought
I
had
the
right
to
face
Voldemort
if
I
could
yeah
dumbledore's
off
his
rocker
all
right
said
Ron
proudly
listen
you've
got
to
be
up
for
the
end-of-year
feast
tomorrow
the
points
are
all
in
and
Slytherin
won
of
course
you
missed
the
last
Quidditch
match
we
were
steamrollered
by
Ravenclaw
without
you
but
the
food'll
be
good
at
that
moment
Madam
Pomfrey
bustled
over
you've
had
nearly
fifteen
minutes
now
out
she
said
firmly
after
a
good
night's
sleep
Harry
felt
nearly
back
to
normal
i
want
to
go
to
the
feast
he
told
Madam
Pomfrey
as
she
straightened
his
many
candy
boxes
i
can
can't
I
professor
Dumbledore
says
you
are
to
be
allowed
to
go
she
said
stiffily
as
though
in
her
opinion
Professor
Dumbledore
didn't
realize
how
risky
feasts
could
be
and
you
have
another
visitor
oh
good
said
Harry
who
is
it
hagrid
sidled
through
the
door
as
he
spoke
as
usual
when
he
was
indoors
Hagrid
looked
too
big
to
be
allowed
he
sat
down
next
to
Harry
took
one
look
at
him
and
burst
into
tears
it's
all
my
ruddy
fault
he
sobbed
his
face
in
his
hands
i
told
the
evil
git
how
ter
get
past
Fluffy
i
told
him
it
was
the
only
thing
he
didn't
know
an
I
told
him
yeh
could've
died
all
fer
a
dragon
egg
i'll
never
drink
again
i
should
be
chucked
out
an
made
ter
live
as
a
Muggle
hagrid
said
Harry
shocked
to
see
Hagrid
shaking
with
grief
and
remorse
great
tears
leaking
down
into
his
beard
hagrid
he'd
have
found
out
somehow
this
is
Voldemort
we're
talking
about
he'd
have
found
out
even
if
you
hadn't
told
him
yeh
could've
died
sobbed
Hagrid
an
don
say
the
name
voldemort
harry
bellowed
and
Hagrid
was
so
shocked
he
stopped
crying
i've
met
him
and
i'm
calling
him
by
his
name
please
cheer
up
Hagrid
we
saved
the
Stone
it's
gone
he
can't
use
it
have
a
Chocolate
Frog
i've
got
loads
hagrid
wiped
his
nose
on
the
back
of
his
hand
and
said
That
reminds
me
i've
got
yeh
a
present
it's
not
a
stoat
sandwich
is
it
said
Harry
anxiously
and
at
last
Hagrid
gave
a
weak
chuckle
nah
dumbledore
gave
me
the
day
off
yesterday
ter
fix
it
course
he
shoulda
sacked
me
instead
anyway
got
yeh
this
it
seemed
to
be
a
handsome
leather-covered
book
harry
opened
it
curiously
it
was
full
of
wizard
photographs
smiling
and
waving
at
him
from
every
page
were
his
mother
and
father
sent
owls
off
ter
all
yer
parents
old
school
friends
askin
fer
photos
knew
yeh
didn
have
any
d'yeh
like
it
harry
couldn't
speak
but
Hagrid
understood
harry
made
his
way
down
to
the
end-of-year
feast
alone
that
night
he
had
been
held
up
by
Madam
pomfrey's
fussing
about
insisting
on
giving
him
one
last
checkup
so
the
Great
Hall
was
already
full
it
was
decked
out
in
the
Slytherin
colors
of
green
and
silver
to
celebrate
slytherin's
winning
the
house
cup
for
the
seventh
year
in
a
row
a
huge
banner
showing
the
Slytherin
serpent
covered
the
wall
behind
the
High
Table
when
Harry
walked
in
there
was
a
sudden
hush
and
then
everybody
started
talking
loudly
at
once
he
slipped
into
a
seat
between
Ron
and
Hermione
at
the
Gryffindor
table
and
tried
to
ignore
the
fact
that
people
were
standing
up
to
look
at
him
fortunately
Dumbledore
arrived
moments
later
the
babble
died
away
another
year
gone
dumbledore
said
cheerfully
and
I
must
trouble
you
with
an
old
man's
wheezing
waffle
before
we
sink
our
teeth
into
our
delicious
feast
what
a
year
it
has
been
hopefully
your
heads
are
all
a
little
fuller
than
they
were
you
have
the
whole
summer
ahead
to
get
them
nice
and
empty
before
next
year
starts
now
as
I
understand
it
the
house
cup
here
needs
awarding
and
the
points
stand
thus
In
fourth
place
Gryffindor
with
three
hundred
and
twelve
points
in
third
Hufflepuff
with
three
hundred
and
fifty-two
Ravenclaw
has
four
hundred
and
twenty-six
and
Slytherin
four
hundred
and
seventy
two
a
storm
of
cheering
and
stamping
broke
out
from
the
Slytherin
table
harry
could
see
Draco
Malfoy
banging
his
goblet
on
the
table
it
was
a
sickening
sight
yes
Yes
well
done
Slytherin
said
Dumbledore
however
recent
events
must
be
taken
into
account
the
room
went
very
still
the
Slytherins
smiles
faded
a
little
ahem
said
Dumbledore
i
have
a
few
last-minute
points
to
dish
out
let
me
see
yes
first
to
mr.
Ronald
Weasley
ron
went
purple
in
the
face
he
looked
like
a
radish
with
a
bad
sunburn
for
the
best-played
game
of
chess
Hogwarts
has
seen
in
many
years
I
award
Gryffindor
house
fifty
points
gryffindor
cheers
nearly
raised
the
bewitched
ceiling
the
stars
overhead
seemed
to
quiver
percy
could
be
heard
telling
the
other
prefects
My
brother
you
know
my
youngest
brother
got
past
mcgonagall's
giant
chess
set
at
last
there
was
silence
again
second
to
Miss
Hermione
Granger
for
the
use
of
cool
logic
in
the
face
of
fire
I
award
Gryffindor
house
fifty
points
hermione
buried
her
face
in
her
arms
Harry
strongly
suspected
she
had
burst
into
tears
gryffindors
up
and
down
the
table
were
beside
themselves
they
were
a
hundred
points
up
third
to
mr.
Harry
Potter
said
Dumbledore
the
room
went
deadly
quiet
for
pure
nerve
and
outstanding
courage
I
award
Gryffindor
house
sixty
points
the
din
was
deafening
those
who
could
add
up
while
yelling
themselves
hoarse
knew
that
Gryffindor
now
had
four
hundred
and
seventy-two
points
exactly
the
same
as
Slytherin
they
had
tied
for
the
house
cup
if
only
Dumbledore
had
given
Harry
just
one
more
point
dumbledore
raised
his
hand
the
room
gradually
fell
silent
there
are
all
kinds
of
courage
said
Dumbledore
smiling
it
takes
a
great
deal
of
bravery
to
stand
up
to
our
enemies
but
just
as
much
to
stand
up
to
our
friends
i
therefore
award
ten
points
to
mr.
Neville
Longbottom
someone
standing
outside
the
Great
Hall
might
well
have
thought
some
sort
of
explosion
had
taken
place
so
loud
was
the
noise
that
erupted
from
the
Gryffindor
table
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
stood
up
to
yell
and
cheer
as
Neville
white
with
shock
disappeared
under
a
pile
of
people
hugging
him
he
had
never
won
so
much
as
a
point
for
Gryffindor
before
harry
still
cheering
nudged
Ron
in
the
ribs
and
pointed
at
Malfoy
who
couldn't
have
looked
more
stunned
and
horrified
if
he'd
just
had
the
Body-Bind
Curse
put
on
him
which
means
Dumbledore
called
over
the
storm
of
applause
for
even
Ravenclaw
and
Hufflepuff
were
celebrating
the
downfall
of
Slytherin
we
need
a
little
change
of
decoration
he
clapped
his
hands
in
an
instant
the
green
hangings
became
scarlet
and
the
silver
became
gold
the
huge
Slytherin
serpent
vanished
and
a
towering
Gryffindor
lion
took
its
place
snape
was
shaking
Professor
mcgonagall's
hand
with
a
horrible
forced
smile
he
caught
harry's
eye
and
Harry
knew
at
once
that
snape's
feelings
toward
him
hadn't
changed
one
jot
this
didn't
worry
Harry
it
seemed
as
though
life
would
be
back
to
normal
next
year
or
as
normal
as
it
ever
was
at
Hogwarts
it
was
the
best
evening
of
harry's
life
better
than
winning
at
Quidditch
or
Christmas
or
knocking
out
mountain
trolls
he
would
never
ever
forget
tonight
harry
had
almost
forgotten
that
the
exam
results
were
still
to
come
but
come
they
did
to
their
great
surprise
both
he
and
Ron
passed
with
good
marks
Hermione
of
course
had
the
best
grades
of
the
first
years
even
Neville
scraped
through
his
good
Herbology
mark
making
up
for
his
abysmal
Potions
one
they
had
hoped
that
Goyle
who
was
almost
as
stupid
as
he
was
mean
might
be
thrown
out
but
he
had
passed
too
it
was
a
shame
but
as
Ron
said
you
couldn't
have
everything
in
life
and
suddenly
their
wardrobes
were
empty
their
trunks
were
packed
neville's
toad
was
found
lurking
in
a
corner
of
the
toilets
notes
were
handed
out
to
all
students
warning
them
not
to
use
magic
over
the
holidays
I
always
hope
they'll
forget
to
give
us
these
said
Fred
Weasley
sadly
Hagrid
was
there
to
take
them
down
to
the
fleet
of
boats
that
sailed
across
the
lake
they
were
boarding
the
Hogwarts
Express
talking
and
laughing
as
the
countryside
became
greener
and
tidier
eating
Bettie
bott's
Every
Flavor
Beans
as
they
sped
past
Muggle
towns
pulling
off
their
wizard
robes
and
putting
on
jackets
and
coats
pulling
into
platform
nine
and
three-quarters
at
king's
Cross
Station
it
took
quite
a
while
for
them
all
to
get
off
the
platform
a
wizened
old
guard
was
up
by
the
ticket
barrier
letting
them
go
through
the
gate
in
twos
and
threes
so
they
didn't
attract
attention
by
all
bursting
out
of
a
solid
wall
at
once
and
alarming
the
Muggles
you
must
come
and
stay
this
summer
said
Ron
both
of
you
i'll
send
you
an
owl
thanks
said
Harry
i'll
need
something
to
look
forward
to
people
jostled
them
as
they
moved
forward
toward
the
gateway
back
to
the
Muggle
world
some
of
them
called
Bye
Harry
see
you
Potter
still
famous
said
Ron
grinning
at
him
not
where
i'm
going
I
promise
you
said
Harry
he
Ron
and
Hermione
passed
through
the
gateway
together
there
he
is
Mom
there
he
is
look
it
was
Ginny
Weasley
ron's
younger
sister
but
she
wasn't
pointing
at
Ron
harry
Potter
she
squealed
look
Mom
i
can
see
Be
quiet
Ginny
and
it's
rude
to
point
mrs
weasley
smiled
down
at
them
busy
year
she
said
very
said
Harry
thanks
for
the
fudge
and
the
sweater
Mrs
weasley
oh
it
was
nothing
dear
ready
are
you
it
was
Uncle
Vernon
still
purple-faced
still
mustached
still
looking
furious
at
the
nerve
of
Harry
carrying
an
owl
in
a
cage
in
a
station
full
of
ordinary
people
behind
him
stood
Aunt
Petunia
and
Dudley
looking
terrified
at
the
very
sight
of
Harry
you
must
be
harry's
family
said
Mrs
weasley
in
a
manner
of
speaking
said
Uncle
Vernon
hurry
up
boy
we
haven't
got
all
day
he
walked
away
harry
hung
back
for
a
last
word
with
Ron
and
Hermione
see
you
over
the
summer
then
hope
you
have
er
a
good
holiday
said
Hermione
looking
uncertainly
after
Uncle
Vernon
shocked
that
anyone
could
be
so
unpleasant
oh
I
will
said
Harry
and
they
were
surprised
at
the
grin
that
was
spreading
over
his
face
they
don't
know
we're
not
allowed
to
use
magic
at
home
i'm
going
to
have
a
lot
of
fun
with
Dudley
this
summer
the
end
