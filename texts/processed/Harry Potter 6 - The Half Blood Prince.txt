The
Other
Minister
it
was
nearing
midnight
and
the
Prime
Minister
was
sitting
alone
in
his
office
reading
a
long
memo
that
was
slipping
through
his
brain
without
leaving
the
slightest
trace
of
meaning
behind
he
was
waiting
for
a
call
from
the
President
of
a
far
distant
country
and
between
wondering
when
the
wretched
man
would
telephone
and
trying
to
suppress
unpleasant
memories
of
what
had
been
a
very
long
tiring
and
difficult
week
there
was
not
much
space
in
his
head
for
anything
else
the
more
he
attempted
to
focus
on
the
print
on
the
page
before
him
the
more
clearly
the
Prime
Minister
could
see
the
gloating
face
of
one
of
his
political
opponents
this
particular
opponent
had
appeared
on
the
news
that
very
day
not
only
to
enumerate
all
the
terrible
things
that
had
happened
in
the
last
week
as
though
anyone
needed
reminding
but
also
to
explain
why
each
and
every
one
of
them
was
the
government's
fault
the
Prime
minister's
pulse
quickened
at
the
very
thought
of
these
accusations
for
they
were
neither
fair
nor
true
how
on
earth
was
his
government
supposed
to
have
stopped
that
bridge
collapsing
it
was
outrageous
for
anybody
to
suggest
that
they
were
not
spending
enough
on
bridges
the
bridge
was
fewer
than
ten
years
old
and
the
best
experts
were
at
a
loss
to
explain
why
it
had
snapped
cleanly
in
two
sending
a
dozen
cars
into
the
watery
depths
of
the
river
below
and
how
dare
anyone
suggest
that
it
was
lack
of
policemen
that
had
resulted
in
those
two
very
nasty
and
well-publicized
murders
or
that
the
government
should
have
somehow
foreseen
the
freak
hurricane
in
the
West
Country
that
had
caused
so
much
damage
to
both
people
and
property
and
was
it
his
fault
that
one
of
his
Junior
ministers
Herbert
Chorley
had
chosen
this
week
to
act
so
peculiarly
that
he
was
now
going
to
be
spending
a
lot
more
time
with
his
family
a
grim
mood
has
gripped
the
country
the
opponent
had
concluded
barely
concealing
his
own
broad
grin
and
unfortunately
this
was
perfectly
true
the
Prime
Minister
felt
it
himself
people
really
did
seem
more
miserable
than
usual
even
the
weather
was
dismal
all
this
chilly
mist
in
the
middle
of
July
it
wasn't
right
it
wasn't
normal
he
turned
over
the
second
page
of
the
memo
saw
how
much
longer
it
went
on
and
gave
it
up
as
a
bad
job
stretching
his
arms
above
his
head
he
looked
around
his
office
mournfully
it
was
a
handsome
room
with
a
fine
marble
fireplace
facing
the
long
sash
windows
firmly
closed
against
the
unseasonable
chill
with
a
slight
shiver
the
Prime
Minister
got
up
and
moved
over
to
the
window
looking
out
at
the
thin
mist
that
was
pressing
itself
against
the
glass
it
was
then
as
he
stood
with
his
back
to
the
room
that
he
heard
a
soft
cough
behind
him
he
froze
nose
to
nose
with
his
own
scared-looking
reflection
in
the
dark
glass
he
knew
that
cough
he
had
heard
it
before
he
turned
very
slowly
to
face
the
empty
room
hello
he
said
trying
to
sound
braver
than
he
felt
for
a
brief
moment
he
allowed
himself
the
impossible
hope
that
nobody
would
answer
him
however
a
voice
responded
at
once
a
crisp
decisive
voice
that
sounded
as
though
it
were
reading
a
prepared
statement
it
was
coming
as
the
Prime
Minister
had
known
at
the
first
cough
from
the
froglike
little
man
wearing
a
long
silver
wig
who
was
depicted
in
a
small
dirty
oil
painting
in
the
far
corner
of
the
room
to
the
Prime
Minister
of
Muggles
urgent
we
meet
kindly
respond
immediately
sincerely
Fudge
the
man
in
the
painting
looked
inquiringly
at
the
Prime
Minister
er
said
the
Prime
Minister
listen
it's
not
a
very
good
time
for
me
i'm
waiting
for
a
telephone
call
you
see
from
the
President
of
that
can
be
rearranged
said
the
portrait
at
once
the
Prime
minister's
heart
sank
he
had
been
afraid
of
that
but
I
really
was
rather
hoping
to
speak
we
shall
arrange
for
the
President
to
forget
to
call
he
will
telephone
tomorrow
night
instead
said
the
little
man
kindly
respond
immediately
to
mr.
Fudge
oh
very
well
said
the
Prime
Minister
weakly
yes
i'll
see
Fudge
he
hurried
back
to
his
desk
straightening
his
tie
as
he
went
he
had
barely
resumed
his
seat
and
arranged
his
face
into
what
he
hoped
was
a
relaxed
and
unfazed
expression
when
bright
green
flames
burst
into
life
in
the
empty
grate
beneath
his
marble
mantelpiece
he
watched
trying
not
to
betray
a
flicker
of
surprise
or
alarm
as
a
portly
man
appeared
within
the
flames
spinning
as
fast
as
a
top
seconds
later
he
had
climbed
out
onto
a
rather
fine
antique
rug
brushing
ash
from
the
sleeves
of
his
long
pin-striped
cloak
a
lime-green
bowler
hat
in
his
hand
ah
prime
Minister
said
Cornelius
Fudge
striding
forward
with
his
hand
outstretched
good
to
see
you
again
the
Prime
Minister
could
not
honestly
return
this
compliment
so
said
nothing
at
all
he
was
not
remotely
pleased
to
see
Fudge
whose
occasional
appearances
apart
from
being
downright
alarming
in
themselves
generally
meant
that
he
was
about
to
hear
some
very
bad
news
furthermore
Fudge
was
looking
distinctly
careworn
he
was
thinner
balder
and
grayer
and
his
face
had
a
crumpled
look
the
Prime
Minister
had
seen
that
kind
of
look
in
politicians
before
and
it
never
boded
well
how
can
I
help
you
he
said
shaking
fudge's
hand
very
briefly
and
gesturing
toward
the
hardest
of
the
chairs
in
front
of
the
desk
difficult
to
know
where
to
begin
muttered
Fudge
pulling
up
the
chair
sitting
down
and
placing
his
green
bowler
upon
his
knees
what
a
week
what
a
week
had
a
bad
one
too
have
you
asked
the
Prime
Minister
stiffly
hoping
to
convey
by
this
that
he
had
quite
enough
on
his
plate
already
without
any
extra
helpings
from
Fudge
yes
of
course
said
Fudge
rubbing
his
eyes
wearily
and
looking
morosely
at
the
Prime
Minister
i've
been
having
the
same
week
you
have
Prime
Minister
the
Brockdale
Bridge
the
Bones
and
Vance
murders
not
to
mention
the
ruckus
in
the
West
Country
youeryouri
mean
to
say
some
of
your
people
werewere
involved
in
thosethose
things
were
they
fudge
fixed
the
Prime
Minister
with
a
rather
stern
look
of
course
they
were
he
said
Surely
you've
realized
what's
going
on
hesitated
the
Prime
Minister
it
was
precisely
this
sort
of
behavior
that
made
him
dislike
fudge's
visits
so
much
he
was
after
all
the
Prime
Minister
and
did
not
appreciate
being
made
to
feel
like
an
ignorant
schoolboy
but
of
course
it
had
been
like
this
from
his
very
first
meeting
with
Fudge
on
his
very
first
evening
as
Prime
Minister
he
remembered
it
as
though
it
were
yesterday
and
knew
it
would
haunt
him
until
his
dying
day
he
had
been
standing
alone
in
this
very
office
savoring
the
triumph
that
was
his
after
so
many
years
of
dreaming
and
scheming
when
he
had
heard
a
cough
behind
him
just
like
tonight
and
turned
to
find
that
ugly
little
portrait
talking
to
him
announcing
that
the
Minister
of
Magic
was
about
to
arrive
and
introduce
himself
naturally
he
had
thought
that
the
long
campaign
and
the
strain
of
the
election
had
caused
him
to
go
mad
he
had
been
utterly
terrified
to
find
a
portrait
talking
to
him
though
this
had
been
nothing
to
how
he
felt
when
a
self-proclaimed
wizard
had
bounced
out
of
the
fireplace
and
shaken
his
hand
he
had
remained
speechless
throughout
fudge's
kindly
explanation
that
there
were
witches
and
wizards
still
living
in
secret
all
over
the
world
and
his
reassurances
that
he
was
not
to
bother
his
head
about
them
as
the
Ministry
of
Magic
took
responsibility
for
the
whole
Wizarding
community
and
prevented
the
non-magical
population
from
getting
wind
of
them
it
was
said
Fudge
a
difficult
job
that
encompassed
everything
from
regulations
on
responsible
use
of
broomsticks
to
keeping
the
dragon
population
under
control
the
Prime
Minister
remembered
clutching
the
desk
for
support
at
this
point
fudge
had
then
patted
the
shoulder
of
the
still-dumbstruck
Prime
Minister
in
a
fatherly
sort
of
way
not
to
worry
he
had
said
it's
odds-on
you'll
never
see
me
again
i'll
only
bother
you
if
there's
something
really
serious
going
on
our
end
something
that's
likely
to
affect
the
Mugglesthe
non-magical
population
I
should
say
otherwise
it's
live
and
let
live
and
I
must
say
you're
taking
it
a
lot
better
than
your
predecessor
he
tried
to
throw
me
out
the
window
thought
I
was
a
hoax
planned
by
the
opposition
at
this
the
Prime
Minister
had
found
his
voice
at
last
you'reyou're
not
a
hoax
then
it
had
been
his
last
desperate
hope
no
said
Fudge
gently
no
i'm
afraid
i'm
not
look
and
he
had
turned
the
Prime
minister's
teacup
into
a
gerbil
but
said
the
Prime
Minister
breathlessly
watching
his
teacup
chewing
on
the
corner
of
his
next
speech
but
whywhy
has
nobody
told
me
the
Minister
of
Magic
only
reveals
himor
herself
to
the
Muggle
Prime
Minister
of
the
day
said
Fudge
poking
his
wand
back
inside
his
jacket
we
find
it
the
best
way
to
maintain
secrecy
but
then
bleated
the
Prime
Minister
why
hasn't
a
former
Prime
Minister
warned
me
at
this
Fudge
had
actually
laughed
my
dear
Prime
Minister
are
you
ever
going
to
tell
anybody
still
chortling
Fudge
had
thrown
some
powder
into
the
fireplace
stepped
into
the
emerald
flames
and
vanished
with
a
whooshing
sound
the
Prime
Minister
had
stood
there
quite
motionless
and
realized
that
he
would
never
as
long
as
he
lived
dare
mention
this
encounter
to
a
living
soul
for
who
in
the
wide
world
would
believe
him
the
shock
had
taken
a
little
while
to
wear
off
for
a
time
he
had
tried
to
convince
himself
that
Fudge
had
indeed
been
a
hallucination
brought
on
by
lack
of
sleep
during
his
grueling
election
campaign
in
a
vain
attempt
to
rid
himself
of
all
reminders
of
this
uncomfortable
encounter
he
had
given
the
gerbil
to
his
delighted
niece
and
instructed
his
private
secretary
to
take
down
the
portrait
of
the
ugly
little
man
who
had
announced
fudge's
arrival
to
the
Prime
minister's
dismay
however
the
portrait
had
proved
impossible
to
remove
when
several
carpenters
a
builder
or
two
an
art
historian
and
the
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
had
all
tried
unsuccessfully
to
pry
it
from
the
wall
the
Prime
Minister
had
abandoned
the
attempt
and
simply
resolved
to
hope
that
the
thing
remained
motionless
and
silent
for
the
rest
of
his
term
in
office
occasionally
he
could
have
sworn
he
saw
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
the
occupant
of
the
painting
yawning
or
else
scratching
his
nose
even
once
or
twice
simply
walking
out
of
his
frame
and
leaving
nothing
but
a
stretch
of
muddy-brown
canvas
behind
however
he
had
trained
himself
not
to
look
at
the
picture
very
much
and
always
to
tell
himself
firmly
that
his
eyes
were
playing
tricks
on
him
when
anything
like
this
happened
then
three
years
ago
on
a
night
very
like
tonight
the
Prime
Minister
had
been
alone
in
his
office
when
the
portrait
had
once
again
announced
the
imminent
arrival
of
Fudge
who
had
burst
out
of
the
fireplace
sopping
wet
and
in
a
state
of
considerable
panic
before
the
Prime
Minister
could
ask
why
he
was
dripping
all
over
the
Axminster
Fudge
had
started
ranting
about
a
prison
the
Prime
Minister
had
never
heard
of
a
man
named
Serious
Black
something
that
sounded
like
Hogwarts
and
a
boy
called
Harry
Potter
none
of
which
made
the
remotest
sense
to
the
Prime
Minister
i've
just
come
from
Azkaban
Fudge
had
panted
tipping
a
large
amount
of
water
out
of
the
rim
of
his
bowler
hat
into
his
pocket
middle
of
the
North
Sea
you
know
nasty
flight
the
dementors
are
in
uproarhe
shudderedthey've
never
had
a
breakout
before
anyway
I
had
to
come
to
you
Prime
Minister
black's
a
known
Muggle
killer
and
may
be
planning
to
rejoin
You-Know-Who
but
of
course
you
don't
even
know
who
You-Know-Who
is
he
had
gazed
hopelessly
at
the
Prime
Minister
for
a
moment
then
said
Well
sit
down
sit
down
i'd
better
fill
you
in
have
a
whiskey
the
Prime
Minister
rather
resented
being
told
to
sit
down
in
his
own
office
let
alone
offered
his
own
whiskey
but
he
sat
nevertheless
fudge
pulled
out
his
wand
conjured
two
large
glasses
full
of
amber
liquid
out
of
thin
air
pushed
one
of
them
into
the
Prime
minister's
hand
and
drew
up
a
chair
fudge
had
talked
for
more
than
an
hour
at
one
point
he
had
refused
to
say
a
certain
name
aloud
and
wrote
it
instead
on
a
piece
of
parchment
which
he
had
thrust
into
the
Prime
minister's
whiskey-free
hand
when
at
last
Fudge
had
stood
up
to
leave
the
Prime
Minister
had
stood
up
too
so
you
think
that
he
had
squinted
down
at
the
name
in
his
left
hand
lord
Vol
he-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
snarled
Fudge
i'm
sorry
you
think
that
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
is
still
alive
then
well
Dumbledore
says
he
is
said
Fudge
as
he
had
fastened
his
pin-striped
cloak
under
his
chin
but
we've
never
found
him
if
you
ask
me
he's
not
dangerous
unless
he's
got
support
so
it's
Black
we
ought
to
be
worrying
about
you'll
put
out
that
warning
then
excellent
well
I
hope
we
don't
see
each
other
again
Prime
Minister
good
night
but
they
had
seen
each
other
again
less
than
a
year
later
a
harassed-looking
Fudge
had
appeared
out
of
thin
air
in
the
cabinet
room
to
inform
the
Prime
Minister
that
there
had
been
a
spot
of
bother
at
the
Kwidditch
or
that
was
what
it
had
sounded
like
World
Cup
and
that
several
Muggles
had
been
involved
but
that
the
Prime
Minister
was
not
to
worry
the
fact
that
you-know-who's
Mark
had
been
seen
again
meant
nothing
Fudge
was
sure
it
was
an
isolated
incident
and
the
Muggle
Liaison
Office
was
dealing
with
all
memory
modifications
as
they
spoke
oh
and
I
almost
forgot
Fudge
had
added
we're
importing
three
foreign
dragons
and
a
sphinx
for
the
Triwizard
Tournament
quite
routine
but
the
Department
for
the
Regulation
and
Control
of
Magical
Creatures
tells
me
that
its
down
in
the
rule
book
that
we
have
to
notify
you
if
we're
bringing
highly
dangerous
creatures
into
the
country
iwhatdragons
spluttered
the
Prime
Minister
yes
three
said
Fudge
and
a
sphinx
well
good
day
to
you
the
Prime
Minister
had
hoped
beyond
hope
that
dragons
and
sphinxes
would
be
the
worst
of
it
but
no
less
than
two
years
later
Fudge
had
erupted
out
of
the
fire
yet
again
this
time
with
the
news
that
there
had
been
a
mass
breakout
from
Azkaban
a
mass
breakout
repeated
the
Prime
Minister
hoarsely
no
need
to
worry
no
need
to
worry
shouted
Fudge
already
with
one
foot
in
the
flames
we'll
have
them
rounded
up
in
no
timejust
thought
you
ought
to
know
and
before
the
Prime
Minister
could
shout
Now
wait
just
one
moment
fudge
had
vanished
in
a
shower
of
green
sparks
whatever
the
press
and
the
opposition
might
say
the
Prime
Minister
was
not
a
foolish
man
it
had
not
escaped
his
notice
that
despite
fudge's
assurances
at
their
first
meeting
they
were
now
seeing
rather
a
lot
of
each
other
nor
that
Fudge
was
becoming
more
flustered
with
each
visit
little
though
he
liked
to
think
about
the
Minister
of
Magic
or
as
he
always
called
Fudge
in
his
head
the
Other
Minister
the
Prime
Minister
could
not
help
but
fear
that
the
next
time
Fudge
appeared
it
would
be
with
graver
news
still
the
site
therefore
of
Fudge
stepping
out
of
the
fire
once
more
looking
disheveled
and
fretful
and
sternly
surprised
that
the
Prime
Minister
did
not
know
exactly
why
he
was
there
was
about
the
worst
thing
that
had
happened
in
the
course
of
this
extremely
gloomy
week
how
should
I
know
what's
going
on
in
theerWizarding
community
snapped
the
Prime
Minister
now
i
have
a
country
to
run
and
quite
enough
concerns
at
the
moment
without
we
have
the
same
concerns
Fudge
interrupted
the
brock-dale
Bridge
didn't
wear
out
that
wasn't
really
a
hurricane
those
murders
were
not
the
work
of
Muggles
and
Herbert
chorley's
family
would
be
safer
without
him
we
are
currently
making
arrangements
to
have
him
transferred
to
st.
mungo's
Hospital
for
Magical
Maladies
and
Injuries
the
move
should
be
affected
tonight
what
do
you
i'm
afraid
I
what
blustered
the
Prime
Minister
fudge
took
a
great
deep
breath
and
said
Prime
Minister
I
am
very
sorry
to
have
to
tell
you
that
he's
back
he-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
is
back
back
when
you
say
back
he's
alive
i
mean
the
Prime
Minister
groped
in
his
memory
for
the
details
of
that
horrible
conversation
of
three
years
previously
when
Fudge
had
told
him
about
the
wizard
who
was
feared
above
all
others
the
wizard
who
had
committed
a
thousand
terrible
crimes
before
his
mysterious
disappearance
fifteen
years
earlier
yes
alive
said
Fudge
that
isi
don't
knowis
a
man
alive
if
he
can't
be
killed
i
don't
really
understand
it
and
Dumbledore
won't
explain
properlybut
anyway
he's
certainly
got
a
body
and
is
walking
and
talking
and
killing
so
I
suppose
for
the
purposes
of
our
discussion
yes
he's
alive
the
Prime
Minister
did
not
know
what
to
say
to
this
but
a
persistent
habit
of
wishing
to
appear
well-informed
on
any
subject
that
came
up
made
him
cast
around
for
any
details
he
could
remember
of
their
previous
conversations
is
Serious
Black
witherHe-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
black
black
said
Fudge
distractedly
turning
his
bowler
rapidly
in
his
fingers
sirius
Black
you
mean
merlin's
beard
no
black's
dead
turns
out
we
wereermistaken
about
Black
he
was
innocent
after
all
and
he
wasn't
in
league
with
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
either
i
mean
he
added
defensively
spinning
the
bowler
hat
still
faster
all
the
evidence
pointedwe
had
more
than
fifty
eyewitnessesbut
anyway
as
I
say
he's
dead
murdered
as
a
matter
of
fact
on
Ministry
of
Magic
premises
there's
going
to
be
an
inquiry
actually
to
his
great
surprise
the
Prime
Minister
felt
a
fleeting
stab
of
pity
for
Fudge
at
this
point
it
was
however
eclipsed
almost
immediately
by
a
glow
of
smugness
at
the
thought
that
deficient
though
he
himself
might
be
in
the
area
of
materializing
out
of
fireplaces
there
had
never
been
a
murder
in
any
of
the
government
departments
under
his
charge
not
yet
anyway
while
the
Prime
Minister
surreptitiously
touched
the
wood
of
his
desk
Fudge
continued
But
Blacks
by-the-by
now
the
point
is
we're
at
war
Prime
Minister
and
steps
must
be
taken
at
war
repeated
the
Prime
Minister
nervously
surely
that's
a
little
bit
of
an
overstatement
he-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
has
now
been
joined
by
those
of
his
followers
who
broke
out
of
Azkaban
in
January
said
Fudge
speaking
more
and
more
rapidly
and
twirling
his
bowler
so
fast
that
it
was
a
lime-green
blur
since
they
have
moved
into
the
open
they
have
been
wreaking
havoc
the
Brockdale
Bridgehe
did
it
Prime
Minister
he
threatened
a
mass
Muggle
killing
unless
I
stood
aside
for
him
and
good
grief
so
it's
your
fault
those
people
were
killed
and
i'm
having
to
answer
questions
about
rusted
rigging
and
corroded
expansion
joints
and
I
don't
know
what
else
said
the
Prime
Minister
furiously
my
fault
said
Fudge
coloring
up
are
you
saying
you
would
have
caved
in
to
blackmail
like
that
maybe
not
said
the
Prime
Minister
standing
up
and
striding
about
the
room
but
I
would
have
put
all
my
efforts
into
catching
the
blackmailer
before
he
committed
any
such
atrocity
do
you
really
think
I
wasn't
already
making
every
effort
demanded
Fudge
heatedly
every
Auror
in
the
Ministry
wasand
istrying
to
find
him
and
round
up
his
followers
but
we
happen
to
be
talking
about
one
of
the
most
powerful
wizards
of
all
time
a
wizard
who
has
eluded
capture
for
almost
three
decades
so
I
suppose
you're
going
to
tell
me
he
caused
the
hurricane
in
the
West
Country
too
said
the
Prime
Minister
his
temper
rising
with
every
pace
he
took
it
was
infuriating
to
discover
the
reason
for
all
these
terrible
disasters
and
not
to
be
able
to
tell
the
public
almost
worse
than
it
being
the
government's
fault
after
all
that
was
no
hurricane
said
Fudge
miserably
excuse
me
barked
the
Prime
Minister
now
positively
stamping
up
and
down
trees
uprooted
roofs
ripped
off
lampposts
bent
horrible
injuries
it
was
the
Death
Eaters
said
Fudge
he-who-must-not-be-named's
followers
and
and
we
suspect
giant
involvement
the
Prime
Minister
stopped
in
his
tracks
as
though
he
had
hit
an
invisible
wall
what
involvement
fudge
grimaced
he
used
giants
last
time
when
he
wanted
to
go
for
the
grand
effect
he
said
the
Office
of
Misinformation
has
been
working
around
the
clock
we've
had
teams
of
Obliviators
out
trying
to
modify
the
memories
of
all
the
Muggles
who
saw
what
really
happened
we've
got
most
of
the
Department
for
the
Regulation
and
Control
of
Magical
Creatures
running
around
Somerset
but
we
can't
find
the
giantit's
been
a
disaster
you
don't
say
said
the
Prime
Minister
furiously
i
won't
deny
that
morale
is
pretty
low
at
the
Ministry
said
Fudge
what
with
all
that
and
then
losing
Amelia
Bones
losing
who
amelia
Bones
head
of
the
Department
of
Magical
Law
Enforcement
we
think
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
may
have
murdered
her
in
person
because
she
was
a
very
gifted
witch
andand
all
the
evidence
was
that
she
put
up
a
real
fight
fudge
cleared
his
throat
and
with
an
effort
it
seemed
stopped
spinning
his
bowler
hat
but
that
murder
was
in
the
newspapers
said
the
Prime
Minister
momentarily
diverted
from
his
anger
our
newspapers
amelia
Bones
it
just
said
she
was
a
middle-aged
woman
who
lived
alone
it
was
aa
nasty
killing
wasn't
it
it's
had
rather
a
lot
of
publicity
the
police
are
baffled
you
see
fudge
sighed
well
of
course
they
are
he
said
killed
in
a
room
that
was
locked
from
the
inside
wasn't
she
we
on
the
other
hand
know
exactly
who
did
it
not
that
that
gets
us
any
further
toward
catching
him
and
then
there
was
Emmeline
Vance
maybe
you
didn't
hear
about
that
one
oh
yes
I
did
said
the
Prime
Minister
it
happened
just
around
the
corner
from
here
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
papers
had
a
field
day
with
it
breakdown
of
law
and
order
in
the
Prime
minister's
backyard
and
as
if
all
that
wasn't
enough
said
Fudge
barely
listening
to
the
Prime
Minister
we've
got
dementors
swarming
all
over
the
place
attacking
people
left
right
and
center
once
upon
a
happier
time
this
sentence
would
have
been
unintelligible
to
the
Prime
Minister
but
he
was
wiser
now
i
thought
dementors
guard
the
prisoners
in
Azkaban
he
said
cautiously
they
did
said
Fudge
wearily
but
not
anymore
they've
deserted
the
prison
and
joined
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
i
won't
pretend
that
wasn't
a
blow
but
said
the
Prime
Minister
with
a
sense
of
dawning
horror
didn't
you
tell
me
they're
the
creatures
that
drain
hope
and
happiness
out
of
people
that's
right
and
they're
breeding
that's
what's
causing
all
this
mist
the
Prime
Minister
sank
weak-kneed
into
the
nearest
chair
the
idea
of
invisible
creatures
swooping
through
the
towns
and
countryside
spreading
despair
and
hopelessness
in
his
voters
made
him
feel
quite
faint
now
see
here
fudgeyou've
got
to
do
something
it's
your
responsibility
as
Minister
of
Magic
my
dear
Prime
Minister
you
can't
honestly
think
i'm
still
Minister
of
Magic
after
all
this
i
was
sacked
three
days
ago
the
whole
Wizarding
community
has
been
screaming
for
my
resignation
for
a
fortnight
i've
never
known
them
so
united
in
my
whole
term
of
office
said
Fudge
with
a
brave
attempt
at
a
smile
the
Prime
Minister
was
momentarily
lost
for
words
despite
his
indignation
at
the
position
into
which
he
had
been
placed
he
still
rather
felt
for
the
shrunken-looking
man
sitting
opposite
him
i'm
very
sorry
he
said
finally
if
there's
anything
I
can
do
it's
very
kind
of
you
Prime
Minister
but
there
is
nothing
i
was
sent
here
tonight
to
bring
you
up
to
date
on
recent
events
and
to
introduce
you
to
my
successor
i
rather
thought
he'd
be
here
by
now
but
of
course
he's
very
busy
at
the
moment
with
so
much
going
on
fudge
looked
around
at
the
portrait
of
the
ugly
little
man
wearing
the
long
curly
silver
wig
who
was
digging
in
his
ear
with
the
point
of
a
quill
catching
fudge's
eye
the
portrait
said
he'll
be
here
in
a
moment
he's
just
finishing
a
letter
to
Dumbledore
i
wish
him
luck
said
Fudge
sounding
bitter
for
the
first
time
i've
been
writing
to
Dumbledore
twice
a
day
for
the
past
fortnight
but
he
won't
budge
if
he'd
just
been
prepared
to
persuade
the
boy
I
might
still
be
well
maybe
Scrimgeour
will
have
more
success
fudge
subsided
into
what
was
clearly
an
aggrieved
silence
but
it
was
broken
almost
immediately
by
the
portrait
which
suddenly
spoke
in
its
crisp
official
voice
to
the
Prime
Minister
of
Muggles
requesting
a
meeting
urgent
kindly
respond
immediately
rufus
Scrimgeour
Minister
of
Magic
yes
yes
fine
said
the
Prime
Minister
distractedly
and
he
barely
flinched
as
the
flames
in
the
grate
turned
emerald
green
again
rose
up
and
revealed
a
second
spinning
wizard
in
their
heart
disgorging
him
moments
later
onto
the
antique
rug
fudge
got
to
his
feet
and
after
a
moment's
hesitation
the
Prime
Minister
did
the
same
watching
the
new
arrival
straighten
up
dust
down
his
long
black
robes
and
look
around
the
Prime
minister's
first
foolish
thought
was
that
Rufus
Scrimgeour
looked
rather
like
an
old
lion
there
were
streaks
of
gray
in
his
mane
of
tawny
hair
and
his
bushy
eyebrows
he
had
keen
yellowish
eyes
behind
a
pair
of
wire-rimmed
spectacles
and
a
certain
rangy
loping
grace
even
though
he
walked
with
a
slight
limp
there
was
an
immediate
impression
of
shrewdness
and
toughness
the
Prime
Minister
thought
he
understood
why
the
Wizarding
community
preferred
Scrimgeour
to
Fudge
as
a
leader
in
these
dangerous
times
how
do
you
do
said
the
Prime
Minister
politely
holding
out
his
hand
scrimgeour
grasped
it
briefly
his
eyes
scanning
the
room
then
pulled
out
a
wand
from
under
his
robes
fudge
told
you
everything
he
asked
striding
over
to
the
door
and
tapping
the
keyhole
with
his
wand
the
Prime
Minister
heard
the
lock
click
eryes
said
the
Prime
Minister
and
if
you
don't
mind
i'd
rather
that
door
remained
unlocked
i'd
rather
not
be
interrupted
said
Scrimgeour
shortly
or
watched
he
added
pointing
his
wand
at
the
windows
so
that
the
curtains
swept
across
them
right
well
i'm
a
busy
man
so
let's
get
down
lo
business
first
of
all
we
need
to
discuss
your
security
the
Prime
Minister
drew
himself
up
to
his
fullest
height
and
replied
I
am
perfectly
happy
with
the
security
i've
already
got
thank
you
very
well
we're
not
Scrimgeour
cut
in
it'll
be
a
poor
lookout
for
the
Muggles
if
their
Prime
Minister
gets
put
under
the
Imperius
Curse
the
new
secretary
in
your
outer
office
i'm
not
getting
rid
of
Kingsley
Shacklebolt
if
that's
what
you're
suggesting
said
the
Prime
Minister
hotly
he's
highly
efficient
gets
through
twice
the
work
the
rest
of
them
that's
because
he's
a
wizard
said
Scrimgeour
without
a
flicker
of
a
smile
a
highly
trained
Auror
who
has
been
assigned
to
you
for
your
protection
now
wait
a
moment
declared
the
Prime
Minister
you
can't
just
put
your
people
into
my
office
I
decide
who
works
for
me
i
thought
you
were
happy
with
Shacklebolt
said
Scrimgeour
coldly
i
amthat's
to
say
I
was
then
there's
no
problem
is
there
said
Scrimgeour
well
as
long
as
shacklebolt's
work
continues
to
be
er
excellent
said
the
Prime
Minister
lamely
but
Scrimgeour
barely
seemed
to
hear
him
now
about
Herbert
Chorley
your
Junior
Minister
he
continued
the
one
who
has
been
entertaining
the
public
by
impersonating
a
duck
what
about
him
asked
the
Prime
Minister
he
has
clearly
reacted
to
a
poorly
performed
Imperius
Curse
said
Scrimgeour
it's
addled
his
brains
but
he
could
still
be
dangerous
he's
only
quacking
said
the
Prime
Minister
weakly
surely
a
bit
of
a
rest
maybe
go
easy
on
the
drink
a
team
of
Healers
from
st.
mungo's
Hospital
for
Magical
Maladies
and
Injuries
are
examining
him
as
we
speak
so
far
he
has
attempted
to
strangle
three
of
them
said
Scrimgeour
i
think
it
best
that
we
remove
him
from
Muggle
society
for
a
while
well
he'll
be
all
right
won't
he
said
the
Prime
Minister
anxiously
scrimgeour
merely
shrugged
already
moving
back
toward
the
fireplace
well
that's
really
all
I
had
to
say
i
will
keep
you
posted
of
developments
Prime
Ministeror
at
least
I
shall
probably
be
too
busy
to
come
personally
in
which
case
I
shall
send
Fudge
here
he
has
consented
to
stay
on
in
an
advisory
capacity
fudge
attempted
to
smile
but
was
unsuccessful
he
merely
looked
as
though
he
had
a
toothache
scrimgeour
was
already
rummaging
in
his
pocket
for
the
mysterious
powder
that
turned
the
fire
green
the
Prime
Minister
gazed
hopelessly
at
the
pair
of
them
for
a
moment
then
the
words
he
had
fought
to
suppress
all
evening
burst
from
him
at
last
but
for
heaven's
sakeyou're
wizards
you
can
do
magic
surely
you
can
sort
outwellanything
scrimgeour
turned
slowly
on
the
spot
and
exchanged
an
incredulous
look
with
Fudge
who
really
did
manage
a
smile
this
time
as
he
said
kindly
The
trouble
is
the
other
side
can
do
magic
too
Prime
Minister
and
with
that
the
two
wizards
stepped
one
after
the
other
into
the
bright
green
fire
and
vanished
chapter
spinner's
End
many
miles
away
the
chilly
mist
that
had
pressed
against
the
Prime
minister's
windows
drifted
over
a
dirty
river
that
wound
between
overgrown
rubbish-strewn
banks
an
immense
chimney
relic
of
a
disused
mill
reared
up
shadowy
and
ominous
there
was
no
sound
apart
from
the
whisper
of
the
black
water
and
no
sign
of
life
apart
from
a
scrawny
fox
that
had
slunk
down
the
bank
to
nose
hopefully
at
some
old
fish-and-chip
wrappings
in
the
tall
grass
but
then
with
a
very
faint
pop
a
slim
hooded
figure
appeared
out
of
thin
air
on
the
edge
of
the
river
the
fox
froze
wary
eyes
fixed
upon
this
strange
new
phenomenon
the
figure
seemed
to
take
its
bearings
for
a
few
moments
then
set
off
with
light
quick
strides
its
long
cloak
rustling
over
the
grass
with
a
second
and
louder
pop
another
hooded
figure
materialized
wait
the
harsh
cry
startled
the
fox
now
crouching
almost
flat
in
the
undergrowth
it
leapt
from
its
hiding
place
and
up
the
bank
there
was
a
flash
of
green
light
a
yelp
and
the
fox
fell
back
to
the
ground
dead
the
second
figure
turned
over
the
animal
with
its
toe
just
a
fox
said
a
woman's
voice
dismissively
from
under
the
hood
i
thought
perhaps
an
AurorCissy
wait
but
her
quarry
who
had
paused
and
looked
back
at
the
flash
of
light
was
already
scrambling
up
the
bank
the
fox
had
just
fallen
down
cissyNarcissalisten
to
me
the
second
woman
caught
the
first
and
seized
her
arm
but
the
other
wrenched
it
away
go
back
Bella
you
must
listen
to
me
i've
listened
already
i've
made
my
decision
leave
me
alone
the
woman
named
Narcissa
gained
the
top
of
the
bank
where
a
line
of
old
railings
separated
the
river
from
a
narrow
cobbled
street
the
other
woman
Bella
followed
at
once
side
by
side
they
stood
looking
across
the
road
at
the
rows
and
rows
of
dilapidated
brick
houses
their
windows
dull
and
blind
in
the
darkness
he
lives
here
asked
Bella
in
a
voice
of
contempt
here
in
this
Muggle
dunghill
we
must
be
the
first
of
our
kind
ever
to
set
foot
but
Narcissa
was
not
listening
she
had
slipped
through
a
gap
in
the
rusty
railings
and
was
already
hurrying
across
the
road
cissy
waitl
bella
followed
her
cloak
streaming
behind
and
saw
Narcissa
darting
through
an
alley
between
the
houses
into
a
second
almost
identical
street
some
of
the
streetlamps
were
broken
the
two
women
were
running
between
patches
of
light
and
deep
darkness
the
pursuer
caught
up
with
her
prey
just
as
she
turned
another
corner
this
time
succeeding
in
catching
hold
of
her
arm
and
swinging
her
around
so
that
they
faced
each
other
cissy
you
must
not
do
this
you
can't
trust
him
the
Dark
Lord
trusts
him
doesn't
he
the
Dark
Lord
is
i
believe
mistaken
Bella
panted
and
her
eyes
gleamed
momentarily
under
her
hood
as
she
looked
around
to
check
that
they
were
indeed
alone
in
any
case
we
were
told
not
to
speak
of
the
plan
to
anyone
this
is
a
betrayal
of
the
Dark
lord's
let
go
Bella
snarled
Narcissa
and
she
drew
a
wand
from
beneath
her
cloak
holding
it
threateningly
in
the
other's
face
bella
merely
laughed
cissy
your
own
sister
you
wouldn't
there
is
nothing
I
wouldn't
do
anymore
narcissa
breathed
a
note
of
hysteria
in
her
voice
and
as
she
brought
down
the
wand
like
a
knife
there
was
another
flash
of
light
bella
let
go
of
her
sister's
arm
as
though
burned
narcissa
but
Narcissa
had
rushed
ahead
rubbing
her
hand
her
pursuer
followed
again
keeping
her
distance
now
as
they
moved
deeper
into
the
deserted
labyrinth
of
brick
houses
at
last
Narcissa
hurried
up
a
street
named
spinner's
End
over
which
the
towering
mill
chimney
seemed
to
hover
like
a
giant
admonitory
finger
her
footsteps
echoed
on
the
cobbles
as
she
passed
boarded
and
broken
windows
until
she
reached
the
very
last
house
where
a
dim
light
glimmered
through
the
curtains
in
a
downstairs
room
she
had
knocked
on
the
door
before
Bella
cursing
under
her
breath
had
caught
up
together
they
stood
waiting
panting
slightly
breathing
in
the
smell
of
the
dirty
river
that
was
carried
to
them
on
the
night
breeze
after
a
few
seconds
they
heard
movement
behind
the
door
and
it
opened
a
crack
a
sliver
of
a
man
could
be
seen
looking
out
at
them
a
man
with
long
black
hair
parted
in
curtains
around
a
sallow
face
and
black
eyes
narcissa
threw
back
her
hood
she
was
so
pale
that
she
seemed
to
shine
in
the
darkness
the
long
blonde
hair
streaming
down
her
back
gave
her
the
look
of
a
drowned
person
narcissa
said
the
man
opening
the
door
a
little
wider
so
that
the
light
fell
upon
her
and
her
sister
too
what
a
pleasant
surprise
severus
she
said
in
a
strained
whisper
may
I
speak
to
you
it's
urgent
but
of
course
he
stood
back
to
allow
her
to
pass
him
into
the
house
her
still-hooded
sister
followed
without
invitation
snape
she
said
curtly
as
she
passed
him
bellatrix
he
replied
his
thin
mouth
curling
into
a
slightly
mocking
smile
as
he
closed
the
door
with
a
snap
behind
them
they
had
stepped
directly
into
a
tiny
sitting
room
which
had
the
feeling
of
a
dark
padded
cell
the
walls
were
completely
covered
in
books
most
of
them
bound
in
old
black
or
brown
leather
a
threadbare
sofa
an
old
armchair
and
a
rickety
table
stood
grouped
together
in
a
pool
of
dim
light
cast
by
a
candle-filled
lamp
hung
from
the
ceiling
the
place
had
an
air
of
neglect
as
though
it
was
not
usually
inhabited
snape
gestured
Narcissa
to
the
sofa
she
threw
off
her
cloak
cast
it
aside
and
sat
down
staring
at
her
white
and
trembling
hands
clasped
in
her
lap
bellatrix
lowered
her
hood
more
slowly
dark
as
her
sister
was
fair
with
heavily
lidded
eyes
and
a
strong
jaw
she
did
not
take
her
gaze
from
Snape
as
she
moved
to
stand
behind
Narcissa
so
what
can
I
do
for
you
snape
asked
settling
himself
in
the
armchair
opposite
the
two
sisters
we
we
are
alone
aren't
we
narcissa
asked
quietly
yes
of
course
well
wormtail's
here
but
we're
not
counting
vermin
are
we
he
pointed
his
wand
at
the
wall
of
books
behind
him
and
with
a
bang
a
hidden
door
flew
open
revealing
a
narrow
staircase
upon
which
a
small
man
stood
frozen
as
you
have
clearly
realized
Wormtail
we
have
guests
said
Snape
lazily
the
man
crept
hunchbacked
down
the
last
few
steps
and
moved
into
the
room
he
had
small
watery
eyes
a
pointed
nose
and
wore
an
unpleasant
simper
his
left
hand
was
caressing
his
right
which
looked
as
though
it
was
encased
in
a
bright
silver
glove
narcissa
he
said
in
a
squeaky
voice
and
Bellatrix
how
charming
wormtail
will
get
us
drinks
if
you'd
like
them
said
Snape
and
then
he
will
return
to
his
bedroom
wormtail
winced
as
though
Snape
had
thrown
something
at
him
i
am
not
your
servant
he
squeaked
avoiding
snape's
eye
really
i
was
under
the
impression
that
the
Dark
Lord
placed
you
here
to
assist
me
to
assist
yesbut
not
to
make
you
drinks
andand
clean
your
house
i
had
no
idea
Wormtail
that
you
were
craving
more
dangerous
assignments
said
Snape
silkily
this
can
be
easily
arranged
I
shall
speak
to
the
Dark
Lord
i
can
speak
to
him
myself
if
I
want
to
of
course
you
can
said
Snape
sneering
but
in
the
meantime
bring
us
drinks
some
of
the
elf-made
wine
will
do
wormtail
hesitated
for
a
moment
looking
as
though
he
might
argue
but
then
turned
and
headed
through
a
second
hidden
door
they
heard
banging
and
a
clinking
of
glasses
within
seconds
he
was
back
bearing
a
dusty
bottle
and
three
glasses
upon
a
tray
he
dropped
these
on
the
rickety
table
and
scurried
from
their
presence
slamming
the
book-covered
door
behind
him
snape
poured
out
three
glasses
of
bloodred
wine
and
handed
two
of
them
to
the
sisters
narcissa
murmured
a
word
of
thanks
whilst
Bellatrix
said
nothing
but
continued
to
glower
at
Snape
this
did
not
seem
to
discompose
him
on
the
contrary
he
looked
rather
amused
the
Dark
Lord
he
said
raising
his
glass
and
draining
it
the
sisters
copied
him
snape
refilled
their
glasses
as
Narcissa
took
her
second
drink
she
said
in
a
rush
Severus
i'm
sorry
to
come
here
like
this
but
I
had
to
see
you
i
think
you
are
the
only
one
who
can
help
me
snape
held
up
a
hand
to
stop
her
then
pointed
his
wand
again
at
the
concealed
staircase
door
there
was
a
loud
bang
and
a
squeal
followed
by
the
sound
of
Wormtail
scurrying
back
up
the
stairs
my
apologies
said
Snape
he
has
lately
taken
to
listening
at
doors
I
don't
know
what
he
means
by
it
you
were
saying
Narcissa
she
took
a
great
shuddering
breath
and
started
again
severus
I
know
I
ought
not
to
be
here
I
have
been
told
to
say
nothing
to
anyone
but
then
you
ought
to
hold
your
tongue
snarled
Bellatrix
particularly
in
present
company
present
company
repeated
Snape
sardonically
and
what
am
I
to
understand
by
that
Bellatrix
that
I
don't
trust
you
Snape
as
you
very
well
know
narcissa
let
out
a
noise
that
might
have
been
a
dry
sob
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
snape
set
his
glass
down
upon
the
table
and
sat
back
again
his
hands
upon
the
arms
of
his
chair
smiling
into
bellatrix's
glowering
face
narcissa
I
think
we
ought
to
hear
what
Bellatrix
is
bursting
to
say
it
will
save
tedious
interruptions
well
continue
Bellatrix
said
Snape
why
is
it
that
you
do
not
trust
me
a
hundred
reasons
she
said
loudly
striding
out
from
behind
the
sofa
to
slam
her
glass
upon
the
table
where
to
start
where
were
you
when
the
Dark
Lord
fell
why
did
you
never
make
any
attempt
to
find
him
when
he
vanished
what
have
you
been
doing
all
these
years
that
you've
lived
in
dumbledore's
pocket
why
did
you
stop
the
Dark
Lord
procuring
the
sorcerer's
Stone
why
did
you
not
return
at
once
when
the
Dark
Lord
was
reborn
where
were
you
a
few
weeks
ago
when
we
battled
to
retrieve
the
prophecy
for
the
Dark
Lord
and
why
Snape
is
Harry
Potter
still
alive
when
you
have
had
him
at
your
mercy
for
five
years
she
paused
her
chest
rising
and
falling
rapidly
the
color
high
in
her
cheeks
behind
her
Narcissa
sat
motionless
her
face
still
hidden
in
her
hands
snape
smiled
before
I
answer
you
oh
yes
Bellatrix
I
am
going
to
answer
you
can
carry
my
words
back
to
the
others
who
whisper
behind
my
back
and
carry
false
tales
of
my
treachery
to
the
Dark
Lord
before
I
answer
you
I
say
let
me
ask
a
question
in
turn
do
you
really
think
that
the
Dark
Lord
has
not
asked
me
each
and
every
one
of
those
questions
and
do
you
really
think
that
had
I
not
been
able
to
give
satisfactory
answers
I
would
be
sitting
here
talking
to
you
she
hesitated
i
know
he
believes
you
but
you
think
he
is
mistaken
or
that
I
have
somehow
hoodwinked
him
fooled
the
Dark
Lord
the
greatest
wizard
the
most
accomplished
Legilimens
the
world
has
ever
seen
bellatrix
said
nothing
but
looked
for
the
first
time
a
little
discomfited
snape
did
not
press
the
point
he
picked
up
his
drink
again
sipped
it
and
continued
You
ask
where
I
was
when
the
Dark
Lord
fell
i
was
where
he
had
ordered
me
to
be
at
Hogwarts
School
of
Witchcraft
and
Wizardry
because
he
wished
me
to
spy
upon
Albus
Dumbledore
you
know
I
presume
that
it
was
on
the
Dark
lord's
orders
that
I
took
up
the
post
she
nodded
almost
imperceptibly
and
then
opened
her
mouth
but
Snape
forestalled
her
you
ask
why
I
did
not
attempt
to
find
him
when
he
vanished
for
the
same
reason
that
Avery
Yaxley
the
Carrows
Greyback
Lucius
he
inclined
his
head
slightly
to
Narcissa
and
many
others
did
not
attempt
to
find
him
i
believed
him
finished
i
am
not
proud
of
it
I
was
wrong
but
there
it
is
if
he
had
not
forgiven
we
who
lost
faith
at
that
time
he
would
have
very
few
followers
left
he'd
have
me
said
Bellatrix
passionately
i
who
spent
many
years
in
Azkaban
for
him
yes
indeed
most
admirable
said
Snape
in
a
bored
voice
of
i
nurse
you
weren't
a
lot
of
use
to
him
in
prison
but
the
gesture
was
undoubtedly
fine
gesture
she
shrieked
in
her
fury
she
looked
slightly
mad
while
I
endured
the
dementors
you
remained
at
Hogwarts
com-lortably
playing
dumbledore's
pet
not
quite
said
Snape
calmly
he
wouldn't
give
me
the
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
job
you
know
seemed
to
think
it
might
ah
bring
about
a
relapse
tempt
me
into
my
old
ways
this
was
your
sacrifice
for
the
Dark
Lord
not
to
teach
your
favorite
subject
she
jeered
why
did
you
stay
there
all
that
time
Snape
still
spying
on
Dumbledore
for
a
master
you
believed
dead
hardly
said
Snape
although
the
Dark
Lord
is
pleased
that
I
never
deserted
my
post
I
had
sixteen
years
of
information
on
Dumbledore
to
give
him
when
he
returned
a
rather
more
useful
welcome-back
present
than
endless
reminiscences
of
how
unpleasant
Azkaban
is
but
you
stayed
yes
Bellatrix
I
stayed
said
Snape
betraying
a
hint
of
impatience
for
the
first
time
i
had
a
comfortable
job
that
I
preferred
to
a
stint
in
Azkaban
they
were
rounding
up
the
Death
Eaters
you
know
dumbledore's
protection
kept
me
out
of
jail
it
was
most
convenient
and
I
used
it
i
repeat
The
Dark
Lord
does
not
complain
that
I
stayed
so
I
do
not
see
why
you
do
i
think
you
next
wanted
to
know
he
pressed
on
i
little
more
loudly
for
Bellatrix
showed
every
sign
of
interrupting
why
I
stood
between
the
Dark
Lord
and
the
sorcerer's
Stone
that
is
easily
answered
he
did
not
know
whether
he
could
trust
me
he
thought
like
you
that
I
had
turned
from
faithful
Death
Eater
to
dumbledore's
stooge
he
was
in
a
pitiable
condition
very
weak
sharing
the
body
of
a
mediocre
wizard
he
did
not
dare
reveal
himself
to
a
former
ally
if
that
ally
might
turn
him
over
to
Dumbledore
or
the
Ministry
i
deeply
regret
that
he
did
not
trust
me
he
would
have
returned
to
power
three
years
sooner
as
it
was
I
saw
only
greedy
and
unworthy
Quirrell
attempting
to
steal
the
stone
and
I
admit
I
did
all
I
could
to
thwart
him
bellatrix's
mouth
twisted
as
though
she
had
taken
an
unpleasant
dose
of
medicine
but
you
didn't
return
when
he
came
back
you
didn't
fly
back
to
him
at
once
when
you
felt
the
Dark
Mark
burn
correct
i
returned
two
hours
later
i
returned
on
dumbledore's
orders
on
dumbledore's
she
began
in
tones
of
outrage
think
said
Snape
impatient
again
think
by
waiting
two
hours
just
two
hours
I
ensured
that
I
could
remain
at
Hogwarts
as
a
spy
by
allowing
Dumbledore
to
think
that
I
was
only
returning
to
the
Dark
lord's
side
because
I
was
ordered
to
I
have
been
able
to
pass
information
on
Dumbledore
and
the
Order
of
the
Phoenix
ever
since
consider
Bellatrix
The
Dark
Mark
had
been
growing
stronger
for
months
i
knew
he
must
be
about
to
return
all
the
Death
Eaters
knew
i
had
plenty
of
time
to
think
about
what
I
wanted
to
do
to
plan
my
next
move
to
escape
like
Karkaroff
didn't
I
the
Dark
lord's
initial
displeasure
at
my
lateness
vanished
entirely
assure
you
when
I
explained
that
remained
faithful
although
Dumbledore
thought
I
was
his
man
yes
the
Dark
Lord
thought
that
I
had
left
him
forever
but
he
was
wrong
but
what
use
have
you
been
sneered
Bellatrix
what
useful
information
have
we
had
from
you
my
information
has
been
conveyed
directly
to
the
Dark
Lord
said
Snape
if
he
chooses
not
to
share
it
with
you
he
shares
everything
with
me
said
Bellatrix
firing
up
at
once
he
calls
me
his
most
loyal
his
most
faithful
does
he
said
Snape
his
voice
delicately
inflected
to
suggest
his
disbelief
does
he
still
after
the
fiasco
at
the
Ministry
that
was
not
my
fault
said
Bellatrix
flushing
the
Dark
Lord
has
in
the
past
entrusted
me
with
his
most
precious
if
Lucius
hadn't
don't
you
dare
don't
you
dare
blame
my
husband
said
Narcissa
in
a
low
and
deadly
voice
looking
up
at
her
sister
there
is
no
point
apportioning
blame
said
Snape
smoothly
what
is
done
is
done
but
not
by
you
said
Bellatrix
furiously
no
you
were
once
again
absent
while
the
rest
of
us
ran
dangers
were
you
not
Snape
my
orders
were
to
remain
behind
said
Snape
perhaps
you
disagree
with
the
Dark
Lord
perhaps
you
think
that
Dumbledore
would
not
have
noticed
if
I
had
joined
forces
with
the
Death
Eaters
to
fight
the
Order
of
the
Phoenix
and
forgive
me
you
speak
of
dangers
you
were
facing
six
teenagers
were
you
not
they
were
joined
as
you
very
well
know
by
half
of
the
Order
before
long
snarled
Bellatrix
and
while
we
are
on
the
subject
of
the
Order
you
still
claim
you
cannot
reveal
the
whereabouts
of
their
headquarters
don't
you
i
am
not
the
Secret-Keeper
I
cannot
speak
the
name
of
the
place
you
understand
how
the
enchantment
works
I
think
the
Dark
Lord
is
satisfied
with
the
information
I
have
passed
him
on
the
Order
it
led
as
perhaps
you
have
guessed
to
the
recent
capture
and
murder
of
Emmeline
Vance
and
it
certainly
helped
dispose
of
Sirius
Black
though
I
give
you
full
credit
for
finishing
him
off
he
inclined
his
head
and
toasted
her
her
expression
did
nor
soften
you
are
avoiding
my
last
question
Snape
harry
Potter
you
could
have
killed
him
at
any
point
in
the
past
five
years
you
have
not
done
it
why
have
you
discussed
this
matter
with
the
Dark
Lord
asked
Snape
he
lately
we
i
am
asking
you
Snape
if
I
had
murdered
Harry
Potter
the
Dark
Lord
could
not
have
used
his
blood
to
regenerate
making
him
invincible
you
claim
you
foresaw
his
use
of
the
boy
she
jeered
i
do
not
claim
it
I
had
no
idea
of
his
plans
I
have
already
confessed
that
I
thought
the
Dark
Lord
dead
i
am
merely
trying
to
explain
why
the
Dark
Lord
is
not
sorry
that
Potter
survived
at
least
until
a
year
ago
but
why
did
you
keep
him
alive
have
you
not
understood
me
it
was
only
dumbledore's
protection
that
was
keeping
me
out
of
Azkaban
do
you
disagree
that
murdering
his
favorite
student
might
have
turned
him
against
me
but
there
was
more
to
it
than
that
i
should
remind
you
that
when
Potter
first
arrived
at
Hogwarts
there
were
still
many
stories
circulating
about
him
rumors
that
he
himself
was
a
great
Dark
wizard
which
was
how
he
had
survived
the
Dark
lord's
attack
indeed
many
of
the
Dark
Lords
old
followers
thought
Potter
might
be
a
standard
around
which
we
could
all
rally
once
more
i
was
curious
admit
it
and
not
at
all
inclined
to
murder
him
the
moment
he
set
fool
in
the
castle
of
course
it
became
apparent
to
me
very
quickly
that
he
had
no
extraordinary
talent
at
all
he
has
fought
his
way
out
of
a
number
of
tight
corners
by
a
simple
combination
of
sheer
luck
and
more
talented
friends
he
is
mediocre
to
the
last
degree
though
as
obnoxious
and
self-satisfied
as
was
his
father
before
him
i
have
done
my
utmost
to
have
him
thrown
out
of
Hogwarts
where
I
believe
he
scarcely
belongs
but
kill
him
or
allow
him
to
be
killed
in
front
of
me
i
would
have
been
a
fool
to
risk
it
with
Dumbledore
close
at
hand
and
through
all
this
we
are
supposed
to
believe
Dumbledore
has
never
suspected
you
asked
Bellatrix
he
has
no
idea
of
your
true
allegiance
he
trusts
you
implicitly
still
i
have
played
my
part
well
said
Snape
and
you
overlook
dumbledore's
greatest
weakness
He
has
to
believe
the
best
of
people
i
spun
him
a
tale
of
deepest
remorse
when
I
joined
his
staff
fresh
from
my
Death
eater
days
and
he
embraced
me
with
open
arms
though
as
I
say
never
allowing
me
nearer
the
Dark
Arts
than
he
could
help
dumbledore
has
been
a
great
wizard
oh
yes
he
has
for
Bellatrix
had
made
a
scathing
noise
the
Dark
Lord
acknowledges
it
i
am
pleased
to
say
however
that
Dumbledore
is
growing
old
the
duel
with
the
Dark
Lord
last
month
shook
him
he
has
since
sustained
a
serious
injury
because
his
reactions
are
slower
than
they
once
were
but
through
all
these
years
he
has
never
stopped
trusting
Severus
Snape
and
therein
lies
my
great
value
to
the
Dark
Lord
bellatrix
still
looked
unhappy
though
she
appeared
unsure
how
best
to
attack
Snape
next
taking
advantage
of
her
silence
Snape
turned
to
her
sister
now
you
came
to
ask
me
for
help
Narcissa
narcissa
looked
up
at
him
her
face
eloquent
with
despair
yes
Severus
i
I
think
you
are
the
only
one
who
can
help
me
I
have
nowhere
else
to
turn
lucius
is
in
jail
and
she
closed
her
eyes
and
two
large
tears
seeped
from
beneath
her
eyelids
the
Dark
Lord
has
forbidden
me
to
speak
of
it
Narcissa
continued
her
eyes
still
closed
he
wishes
none
to
know
of
the
plan
it
is
very
secret
but
if
he
has
forbidden
it
you
ought
not
to
speak
said
Snape
at
once
the
Dark
lord's
word
is
law
narcissa
gasped
as
though
he
had
doused
her
with
cold
water
bellatrix
looked
satisfied
for
the
first
time
since
she
had
entered
the
house
there
she
said
triumphantly
to
her
sister
even
Snape
says
so
You
were
told
not
to
talk
so
hold
your
silence
but
Snape
had
gotten
to
his
feet
and
strode
to
the
small
window
peered
through
the
curtains
at
the
deserted
street
then
closed
them
again
with
a
jerk
he
turned
around
to
face
Narcissa
frowning
it
so
happens
that
I
know
of
the
plan
he
said
in
a
low
voice
i
am
one
of
the
few
the
Dark
Lord
has
told
nevertheless
had
I
not
been
in
on
the
secret
Narcissa
you
would
have
been
guilty
of
great
treachery
to
the
Dark
Lord
i
thought
you
must
know
about
it
said
Narcissa
breathing
more
freely
he
trusts
you
so
Severus
you
know
about
the
plan
said
Bellatrix
her
fleeting
expression
of
satisfaction
replaced
by
a
look
of
outrage
you
know
certainly
said
Snape
but
what
help
do
you
require
nar-cissa
if
you
are
imagining
I
can
persuade
the
Dark
Lord
to
change
his
mind
I
am
afraid
there
is
no
hope
none
at
all
severus
she
whispered
tears
sliding
down
her
pale
cheeks
my
son
my
only
son
draco
should
be
proud
said
Bellatrix
indifferently
the
Dark
I
ord
is
granting
him
a
great
honor
and
I
will
say
this
for
Draco
I
Ic
isn't
shrinking
away
from
his
duty
he
seems
glad
of
a
chance
to
prove
himself
excited
at
the
prospect
narcissa
began
to
cry
in
earnest
gazing
beseechingly
all
the
while
at
Snape
that's
because
he
is
sixteen
and
has
no
idea
what
lies
in
store
why
Severus
why
my
son
it
is
too
dangerous
this
is
vengeance
lor
lucius's
mistake
I
know
it
snape
said
nothing
he
looked
away
from
the
sight
of
her
tears
as
though
they
were
indecent
but
he
could
not
pretend
not
to
hear
her
that's
why
he's
chosen
Draco
isn't
it
she
persisted
to
punish
Lucius
if
Draco
succeeds
said
Snape
still
looking
away
from
her
he
will
be
honored
above
all
others
but
he
won't
succeed
sobbed
Narcissa
how
can
he
when
the
Dark
Lord
himself
bellatrix
gasped
Narcissa
seemed
to
lose
her
nerve
i
only
meant
that
nobody
has
yet
succeeded
severus
please
you
are
you
have
always
been
draco's
favorite
teacher
you
are
lucius's
old
friend
i
beg
you
you
are
the
Dark
lord's
favorite
his
most
trusted
advisor
will
you
speak
to
him
persuade
him
the
Dark
Lord
will
not
be
persuaded
and
I
am
not
stupid
enough
to
attempt
it
said
Snape
flatly
i
cannot
pretend
that
the
Dark
Lord
is
not
angry
with
Lucius
lucius
was
supposed
to
be
in
charge
he
got
himself
captured
along
with
how
many
others
and
failed
to
retrieve
the
prophecy
into
the
bargain
yes
the
Dark
Lord
is
angry
Narcissa
very
angry
indeed
then
I
am
right
he
has
chosen
Draco
in
revenge
choked
Narcissa
he
does
not
mean
him
to
succeed
he
wants
him
to
be
killed
trying
when
Snape
said
nothing
Narcissa
seemed
to
lose
what
little
self-restraint
she
still
possessed
standing
up
she
staggered
to
Snape
and
seized
the
front
of
his
robes
her
face
close
to
his
her
tears
falling
onto
his
chest
she
gasped
You
could
do
it
you
could
do
it
instead
of
Draco
Severus
you
would
succeed
of
course
you
would
and
he
would
reward
you
beyond
all
of
us
snape
caught
hold
of
her
wrists
and
removed
her
clutching
hands
looking
down
into
her
tearstained
face
he
said
slowly
He
intends
me
to
do
it
in
the
end
I
think
but
he
is
determined
that
Draco
should
try
first
you
see
in
the
unlikely
event
that
Draco
succeeds
I
shall
be
able
to
remain
at
Hogwarts
a
little
longer
fulfilling
my
useful
role
as
spy
in
other
words
it
doesn't
matter
to
him
if
Draco
is
killed
the
Dark
Lord
is
very
angry
repeated
Snape
quietly
he
failed
to
hear
the
prophecy
you
know
as
well
as
I
do
Narcissa
that
he
does
not
forgive
easily
she
crumpled
falling
at
his
feet
sobbing
and
moaning
on
the
loor
my
only
son
my
only
son
you
should
be
proud
said
Bellatrix
ruthlessly
if
I
had
sons
I
would
be
glad
to
give
them
up
to
the
service
of
the
Dark
Lord
narcissa
gave
a
little
scream
of
despair
and
clutched
at
her
long
blonde
hair
snape
stooped
seized
her
by
the
arms
lifted
her
up
iind
steered
her
back
onto
the
sofa
he
then
poured
her
more
wine
iind
forced
the
glass
into
her
hand
narcissa
that's
enough
drink
this
listen
to
me
she
quieted
a
little
slopping
wine
down
herself
she
took
a
shaky
sip
it
might
be
possible
for
me
to
help
Draco
she
sat
up
her
face
paper-white
her
eyes
huge
severus
oh
Severus
you
would
help
him
would
you
look
after
him
see
he
comes
to
no
harm
i
can
try
she
flung
away
her
glass
it
skidded
across
the
table
as
she
slid
off
the
sofa
into
a
kneeling
position
at
snape's
feet
seized
his
hand
in
both
of
hers
and
pressed
her
lips
to
it
if
you
are
there
to
protect
him
severus
will
you
swear
it
will
you
make
the
Unbreakable
Vow
the
Unbreakable
Vow
snape's
expression
was
blank
unreadable
bellatrix
however
let
out
a
cackle
of
triumphant
laughter
aren't
you
listening
Narcissa
oh
he'll
try
i'm
sure
the
usual
empty
words
the
usual
slithering
out
of
action
oh
on
the
Dark
lord's
orders
of
course
snape
did
not
look
at
Bellatrix
his
black
eyes
were
fixed
upon
narcissa's
tear-filled
blue
ones
as
she
continued
to
clutch
his
hand
certainly
Narcissa
I
shall
make
the
Unbreakable
Vow
he
said
quietly
perhaps
your
sister
will
consent
to
be
our
Bonder
bellatrix's
mouth
fell
open
snape
lowered
himself
so
that
he
was
kneeling
opposite
Narcissa
beneath
bellatrix's
astonished
gaze
they
grasped
right
hands
you
will
need
your
wand
Bellatrix
said
Snape
coldly
she
drew
it
still
looking
astonished
and
you
will
need
to
move
a
little
closer
he
said
she
stepped
forward
so
that
she
stood
over
them
and
placed
the
tip
of
her
wand
on
their
linked
hands
narcissa
spoke
will
you
Severus
watch
over
my
son
Draco
as
he
attempts
ta
fulfill
the
Dark
lord's
wishes
i
will
said
Snape
a
thin
tongue
of
brilliant
flame
issued
from
the
wand
and
wound
its
way
around
their
hands
like
a
red-hot
wire
and
will
you
to
the
best
of
your
ability
protect
him
from
harm
i
will
said
Snape
a
second
tongue
of
flame
shot
from
the
wand
and
interlinked
with
the
first
making
a
fine
glowing
chain
and
should
it
prove
necessary
if
it
seems
Draco
will
fail
whispered
Narcissa
snape's
hand
twitched
within
hers
but
he
did
not
draw
away
will
you
carry
out
the
deed
that
the
Dark
Lord
has
ordered
Draco
to
perform
there
was
a
moment's
silence
bellatrix
watched
her
wand
upon
their
clasped
hands
her
eyes
wide
i
will
said
Snape
bellatrix's
astounded
face
glowed
red
in
the
blaze
of
a
third
unique
flame
which
shot
from
the
wand
twisted
with
the
others
and
bound
itself
thickly
around
their
clasped
hands
like
a
fiery
snake

was
snoring
loudly
he
had
been
sitting
in
a
chair
beside
his
bedroom
window
for
the
best
part
of
four
hours
staring
out
at
the
darkening
street
and
had
finally
fallen
asleep
with
one
side
of
his
face
pressed
against
the
cold

his

askew
and
his

wide
open
the

his
breath
had
left

sparkled
in
the

glare
of

the
artificial
light
drained
his
face
of

so
that
he
looked
ghostly
beneath

the

a

smattering
of

nevertheless
highly
placed
sources
within

Ministry
have
confirmed
that
the
disturbance
centered
on
the
fabled
Hall
of
Prophecy
though
Ministry
spokeswizards
have
hitherto
refused
even
to
confirm
the
existence
of
such
a
place
a
growing
number
of
the
Wizarding
community
believe
that
the
Death
Eaters
now
serving
sentences
in
Azkaban
for
trespass
and
attempted
theft
were
attempting
to
steal
a
prophecy
the
nature
of
that
prophecy
is
unknown
although
speculation
is
rife
that
it
concerns
Harry
Potter
the

person
ever
known
to
have
survived
the
Killing
Curse
and
who
is
also
known
to
have
been
at

Ministry
on

night
in
question
some
are
going
so
far
as
to
call
Potter
the

believing
that
the
prophecy
names
him
as
the
only
one
who
will
be
able
to
rid
us

rumors
of
a
rift
between
the
new
Minister
and
Albus
Dumbledore
newly
reinstated
Chief
Warlock
of
the
Wizengamot
surfaced
within
hours
of
Scrimgeour
taking
office
scrimgeours
representatives
admitted
that
he
had
met
with
Dumbledore
at
once
upon
taking
possession
of
the

refused

page
column
to

of
this
paper
sat
another
which
had
been
folded
so
that
a
story
bearing
the
title
ministry
guarantees
students
sapety
was
visible
newly
appointed
Minister
of
Magic
Rufus
Scrimgeour
spoke
today
of
the
tough
new
measures
taken
by
his
Ministry
to
ensure
the
safety
of
students
returning
to
Hogwarts
School
of
Witchcraft
and
Wizardry
this
autumn
for
obvious
reasons
the
Ministry
will
not
be
going
into
detail
about
its
stringent
new
security
plans
said
the
Minister
although
an
insider
confirmed
that
measures
include
defensive
spells
and
charms
a
complex
array
of
countercurses
and
a
small
task
force
of
Aurors
dedicated
solely
to
the
protection
of
Hogwarts
School
most
seem
reassured
by
the
new
minister's
tough
stand
on
student
safety
said
Mrs
augusta
Longbottom
My
grandson
Neville
a
good
friend
of
harry
potter's
incidentally
who
fought
the
Death
Eaters
alongside
him
at
the
Ministry
in
June
and
but
the
rest
of
this
story
was
obscured
by
the
large
birdcage
standing
on
top
of
it
inside
it
was
a
magnificent
snowy
owl
her
amber
eyes
surveyed
the
room
imperiously
her
head
swiveling
occasionally
to
gaze
at
her
snoring
master
once
or
twice
she
clicked
her
beak
impatiently
but
Harry
was
too
deeply
asleep
to
hear
her
a
large
trunk
stood
in
the
very
middle
of
the
room
its
lid
was
open
it
looked
expectant
yet
it
was
almost
empty
but
for
a
residue
of
old
underwear
sweets
empty
ink
bottles
and
broken
quills
that
coated
the
very
bottom
nearby
on
the
floor
lay
a
purple
leaflet
emblazoned
with

of

immediately
harry
grunted
in
his
sleep
and
his
face
slid
down
the
window
an
inch
or
so
making
his
glasses
still
more
lopsided
but
he
did
not
wake
up
an
alarm
clock
repaired
by
Harry
several
years
ago
ticked
loudly
on
the
sill
showing
one
minute
to
eleven
beside
it
held
in
place
by
harry's
relaxed
hand
was
a
piece
of
parchment
covered
in
thin
slanting
writing
harry
had
read
this
letter
so
often
since
its
arrival
three
days
ago
that
although
it
had
been
delivered
in
a
tightly
furled
scroll
it
now
lay
quite
flat
dear
Harry
if
it
is
convenient
to
you
I
shall
call
at
number
four
Privet
Drive
this
coming
Friday
at
eleven
p
m.
to
escort
you
to
the
Burrow
where
you
have
been
invited
to
spend
the
remainder
of
your
school
holidays
if
you
are
agreeable
I
should
also
be
glad
of
your
assistance
in
a
matter
to
which
I
hope
to
attend
on
the
way
to
the
Burrow
i
shall
explain
this
more
fully
when
I
see
you
kindly
send
your
answer
by
return
of
this
owl
hoping
to
see
you
this
Friday
i
am
yours
most
sincerely
albus
Dumbledore
though
he
already
knew
it
by
heart
Harry
had
been
stealing
glances
at
this
missive
every
few
minutes
since
seven
o'clock
that
evening
when
he
had
first
taken
up
his
position
beside
his
bedroom
window
which
had
a
reasonable
view
of
both
ends
of
Privet
Drive
he
knew
it
was
pointless
to
keep
rereading
dumbledore's
words
Harry
had
sent
back
his
yes
with
the
delivering
owl
as
requested
and
all
he
could
do
now
was
wait
Either
Dumbledore
was
going
to
come
or
he
was
not
but
Harry
had
not
packed
it
just
seemed
too
good
to
be
true
that
he
was
going
to
be
rescued
from
the
Dursleys
after
a
mere
fortnight
of
their
company
he
could
not
shrug
off
the
feeling
that
something
was
going
to
go
wrong
his
reply
to
dumbledore's
letter
might
have
gone
astray
Dumbledore
could
be
prevented
from
collecting
him
the
letter
might
turn
out
not
to
be
from
Dumbledore
at
all
but
a
trick
or
joke
or
trap
harry
had
not
been
able
to
face
packing
and
then
being
let
down
and
having
to
unpack
again
the
only
gesture
he
had
made
to
the
possibility
of
a
journey
was
to
shut
his
snowy
owl
Hedwig
safely
in
her
cage
the
minute
hand
on
the
alarm
clock
reached
the
number
twelve
and
at
that
precise
moment
the
street-lamp
outside
the
window
went
out
harry
awoke
as
though
the
sudden
darkness
were
an
alarm
hastily
straightening
his
glasses
and
unsticking
his
cheek
from
the
glass
he
pressed
his
nose
against
the
window
instead
and
squinted
down
at
the
pavement
a
tall
figure
in
a
long
billowing
cloak
was
walking
up
the
garden
path
harry
jumped
up
as
though
he
had
received
an
electric
shock
knocked
over
his
chair
and
started
snatching
anything
and
everything
within
reach
from
the
floor
and
throwing
it
into
the
trunk
then
as
he
lobbed
a
set
of
robes
two
spellbooks
and
a
packet
of
clasps
across
the
room
the
doorbell
rang
downstairs
in
the
living
room
his
Uncle
Vernon
shouted
Who
the
blazes
is
calling
at
this
lime
of
night
harry
froze
with
a
brass
telescope
in
one
hand
and
a
pair
of
trainers
in
the
other
he
had
completely
forgotten
to
warn
the
Dursleys
that
Dumbledore
might
be
coming
feeling
both
panicky
mid
close
to
laughter
he
clambered
over
the
trunk
and
wrenched
open
his
bedroom
door
in
time
to
hear
a
deep
voice
say
Good
evening
you
must
be
mr.
Dursley
i
daresay
Harry
has
told
you
I
would
be
coming
for
him
harry
ran
down
the
stairs
two
at
a
time
coming
to
an
abrupt
halt
several
steps
from
the
bottom
as
long
experience
had
taught
him
to
remain
out
of
arm's
reach
of
his
uncle
whenever
possible
there
in
the
doorway
stood
a
tall
thin
man
with
waist-length
silver
hair
and
beard
half-moon
spectacles
were
perched
on
his
crooked
nose
and
he
was
wearing
a
long
black
traveling
cloak
and
pointed
hat
vernon
Dursley
whose
mustache
was
quite
as
bushy
as
dumbledore's
though
black
and
who
was
wearing
a
puce
dress-ing
gown
was
staring
at
the
visitor
as
though
he
could
not
believe
his
tiny
eyes
judging
by
your
look
of
stunned
disbelief
Harry
did
not
warn
you
that
I
was
coming
said
Dumbledore
pleasantly
however
let
us
assume
that
you
have
invited
me
warmly
into
your
house
it
is
unwise
to
linger
overlong
on
doorsteps
in
these
troubled
times
he
stepped
smartly
over
the
threshold
and
closed
the
front
door
behind
him
it
is
a
long
time
since
my
last
visit
said
Dumbledore
peering
down
his
crooked
nose
at
Uncle
Vernon
i
must
say
your
agapanthus
are
flourishing
vernon
Dursley
said
nothing
at
all
harry
did
not
doubt
that
speech
would
return
to
him
and
soon
the
vein
pulsing
in
his
uncles
temple
was
reaching
danger
point
but
something
about
Dumbledore
seemed
to
have
robbed
him
temporarily
of
breath
it
might
have
been
the
blatant
wizardishness
of
his
appearance
but
it
might
too
have
been
that
even
Uncle
Vernon
could
sense
that
here
was
a
man
whom
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
bully
ah
good
evening
Harry
said
Dumbledore
looking
up
at
him
through
his
half-moon
glasses
with
a
most
satisfied
expression
excellent
excellent
these
words
seemed
to
rouse
Uncle
Vernon
it
was
clear
that
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
any
man
who
could
look
at
Harry
and
say
excellent
was
a
man
with
whom
he
could
never
see
eye
to
eye
i
don't
mean
to
be
rude
he
began
in
a
tone
that
threatened
rudeness
in
every
syllable
yet
sadly
accidental
rudeness
occurs
alarmingly
often
Dumbledore
finished
the
sentence
gravely
best
to
say
nothing
at
all
my
dear
man
ah
and
this
must
be
Petunia
the
kitchen
door
had
opened
and
there
stood
harry's
aunt
wearing
rubber
gloves
and
a
housecoat
over
her
nightdress
clearly
halfway
through
her
usual
pre-bedtime
wipe-down
of
all
the
kitchen
surfaces
her
rather
horsey
face
registered
nothing
but
shock
albus
Dumbledore
said
Dumbledore
when
Uncle
Vernon
failed
to
effect
an
introduction
we
have
corresponded
of
course
harry
thought
this
an
odd
way
of
reminding
Aunt
Petunia
that
he
had
once
sent
her
an
exploding
letter
but
Aunt
Petunia
did
not
challenge
the
term
and
this
must
be
your
son
Dudley
dudley
had
that
moment
peered
round
the
living
room
door
his
large
blond
head
rising
out
of
the
stripy
collar
of
his
pajamas
looked
oddly
disembodied
his
mouth
gaping
in
astonishment
and
I
car
dumbledore
waited
a
moment
or
two
apparently
to
see
whether
any
of
the
Dursleys
were
going
to
say
anything
but
as
the
ilcncc
stretched
on
he
smiled
shall
we
assume
that
you
have
invited
me
into
your
sitting
room
dudley
scrambled
out
of
the
way
as
Dumbledore
passed
him
i
lurry
still
clutching
the
telescope
and
trainers
jumped
the
last
lew
stairs
and
followed
Dumbledore
who
had
settled
himself
in
i
he
armchair
nearest
the
fire
and
was
taking
in
the
surroundings
wilh
an
expression
of
benign
interest
he
looked
quite
extraordinarily
out
of
place
aren't
aren't
we
leaving
sir
harry
asked
anxiously
yes
indeed
we
are
but
there
are
a
few
matters
we
need
to
dis-i
us
s
first
said
Dumbledore
and
I
would
prefer
not
to
do
so
in
he
open
we
shall
trespass
upon
your
aunt
and
uncle's
hospitality
only
a
little
longer
you
will
will
you
vernon
Dursley
had
entered
the
room
Petunia
at
his
shoulder
iind
Dudley
skulking
behind
them
both
yes
said
Dumbledore
simply
I
shall
he
drew
his
wand
so
rapidly
that
Harry
barely
saw
it
with
a
casual
flick
the
sofa
zoomed
forward
and
knocked
the
knees
out
from
under
all
three
of
the
Dursleys
so
that
they
collapsed
upon
it
in
a
heap
another
flick
of
the
wand
and
the
sofa
zoomed
back
to
its
original
position
we
may
as
well
be
comfortable
said
Dumbledore
pleasantly
as
he
replaced
his
wand
in
his
pocket
Harry
saw
that
his
hand
was
blackened
and
shriveled
it
looked
as
though
his
flesh
had
been
burned
away
sir
what
happened
to
your
later
Harry
said
Dumbledore
please
sit
down
harry
took
the
remaining
armchair
choosing
not
to
look
at
the
Dursleys
who
seemed
stunned
into
silence
i
would
assume
that
you
were
going
to
offer
me
refreshment
Dumbledore
said
to
Uncle
Vernon
but
the
evidence
so
far
suggests
that
that
would
be
optimistic
to
the
point
of
foolishness
a
third
twitch
of
the
wand
and
a
dusty
bottle
and
five
glasses
appeared
in
midair
the
bottle
tipped
and
poured
a
generous
measure
of
honey-colored
liquid
into
each
of
the
glasses
which
then
floated
to
each
person
in
the
room
madam
Rosmertas
finest
oak-matured
mead
said
Dumbledore
raising
his
glass
to
Harry
who
caught
hold
of
his
own
and
sipped
he
had
never
tasted
anything
like
it
before
but
enjoyed
it
immensely
the
Dursleys
after
quick
scared
looks
at
one
another
tried
to
ignore
their
glasses
completely
a
difficult
feat
as
they
were
nudging
them
gently
on
the
sides
of
their
heads
harry
could
not
suppress
a
suspicion
that
Dumbledore
was
rather
enjoying
himself
well
Harry
said
Dumbledore
turning
toward
him
a
difficulty
has
arisen
which
I
hope
you
will
be
able
to
solve
for
us
by
us
I
mean
the
Order
of
the
Phoenix
but
first
of
all
I
must
tell
you
that
sirius's
will
was
discovered
a
week
ago
and
that
he
left
you
every-ihing
he
owned
over
on
the
sofa
Uncle
Vernons
head
turned
but
Harry
did
not
look
at
him
nor
could
he
think
of
anything
to
say
except
oh.
Right
this
is
in
the
main
fairly
straightforward
Dumbledore
went
on
you
add
a
reasonable
amount
of
gold
to
your
account
at
iringotts
and
you
inherit
all
of
sirius's
personal
possessions
the
slightly
problematic
part
of
the
legacy
his
godfather's
dead
said
Uncle
Vernon
loudly
from
the
sofa
umbledore
and
Harry
both
turned
to
look
at
him
the
glass
of
mead
was
now
knocking
quite
insistently
on
the
side
of
Vernons
head
he
attempted
to
beat
it
away
he's
dead
his
godfather
yes
said
Dumbledore
he
did
not
ask
Harry
why
he
had
not
confided
in
the
Dursleys
our
problem
he
continued
to
Harry
as
if
there
had
been
no
interruption
is
that
Sirius
also
left
you
number
twelve
Grimmauld
Place
he's
been
left
a
house
said
Uncle
Vernon
greedily
his
small
eyes
narrowing
but
nobody
answered
him
you
can
keep
using
it
as
headquarters
said
Harry
i
don't
care
you
can
have
it
I
don't
really
want
it
harry
never
wanted
to
set
foot
in
number
twelve
Grimmauld
Place
again
if
he
could
help
it
he
thought
he
would
be
haunted
forever
by
the
memory
of
Sirius
prowling
its
dark
musty
rooms
alone
imprisoned
within
the
place
he
had
wanted
so
desperately
to
leave
that
is
generous
said
Dumbledore
we
have
however
vacated
the
building
temporarily
why
well
said
Dumbledore
ignoring
the
mutterings
of
Uncle
Vernon
who
was
now
being
rapped
smartly
over
the
head
by
the
persistent
glass
of
mead
Black
family
tradition
decreed
that
the
house
was
handed
down
the
direct
line
to
the
next
male
with
the
name
of
Black
sirius
was
the
very
last
of
the
line
as
his
younger
brother
Regulus
predeceased
him
and
both
were
childless
while
his
will
makes
it
perfectly
plain
that
he
wants
you
to
have
the
house
it
is
nevertheless
possible
that
some
spell
or
enchantment
has
been
set
upon
the
place
to
ensure
that
it
cannot
be
owned
by
anyone
other
than
a
pureblood
a
vivid
image
of
the
shrieking
spitting
portrait
of
sirius's
mother
that
hung
in
the
hall
of
number
twelve
Grimmauld
Place
flashed
into
harry's
mind
i
bet
there
has
he
said
quite
said
Dumbledore
and
if
such
an
enchantment
exists
then
the
ownership
of
the
house
is
most
likely
to
pass
to
the
eldest
of
sirius's
living
relatives
which
would
mean
his
cousin
Bellatrix
Lestrange
without
realizing
what
he
was
doing
Harry
sprang
to
his
feet
the
telescope
and
trainers
in
his
lap
rolled
across
the
floor
bellatrix
Lestrange
sirius's
killer
inherit
his
house
no
he
said
well
obviously
we
would
prefer
that
she
didn't
get
it
either
said
Dumbledore
calmly
the
situation
is
fraught
with
complications
we
do
not
know
whether
the
enchantments
we
ourselves
have
placed
upon
it
for
example
making
it
Unplottable
will
hold
now
that
ownership
has
passed
from
sirius's
hands
it
might
be
that
Bellatrix
will
arrive
on
the
doorstep
at
any
moment
naturally
we
had
to
move
out
until
such
time
as
we
have
clarified
the
position
but
how
are
you
going
to
find
out
if
i'm
allowed
to
own
it
fortunately
said
Dumbledore
there
is
a
simple
test
he
placed
his
empty
glass
on
a
small
table
beside
his
chair
but
before
he
could
do
anything
else
Uncle
Vernon
shouted
Will
you
get
these
ruddy
things
off
us
harry
looked
around
all
three
of
the
Dursleys
were
cowering
with
their
arms
over
their
heads
as
their
glasses
bounced
up
and
down
on
their
skulls
their
contents
flying
everywhere
oh
i'm
so
sorry
said
Dumbledore
politely
and
he
raised
his
wand
again
all
three
glasses
vanished
but
it
would
have
been
better
manners
to
drink
it
you
know
it
looked
as
though
Uncle
Vernon
was
bursting
with
any
number
of
unpleasant
retorts
but
he
merely
shrank
back
into
the
cushions
with
Aunt
Petunia
and
Dudley
and
said
nothing
keeping
his
small
piggy
eyes
on
dumbledore's
wand
you
see
Dumbledore
said
turning
back
to
Harry
and
again
speaking
as
though
Uncle
Vernon
had
not
uttered
if
you
have
indeed
inherited
the
house
you
have
also
inherited
he
flicked
his
wand
for
a
fifth
time
there
was
a
loud
crack
and
a
house-elf
appeared
with
a
snout
for
a
nose
giant
bat's
ears
and
enormous
bloodshot
eyes
crouching
on
the
Dursleys
shag
carpet
and
covered
in
grimy
rags
aunt
Petunia
let
out
a
hair-raising
shriek
nothing
this
filthy
had
entered
her
house
in
living
memory
dudley
drew
his
large
bare
pink
feet
off
the
floor
and
sat
with
them
raised
almost
above
his
head
as
though
he
thought
the
creature
might
run
up
his
pajama
trousers
and
Uncle
Vernon
bellowed
What
the
hell
is
that
kreacher
finished
Dumbledore
kreacher
wont
Kreacher
won't
Kreacher
wont
croaked
the
house-elf
quite
as
loudly
as
Uncle
Vernon
stamping
his
long
gnarled
feet
and
pulling
lii
s
ears
kreacher
belongs
to
Miss
Bellatrix
oh
yes
Kreacher
belongs
to
the
Blacks
Kreacher
wants
his
new
mistress
Kreacher
won't
go
to
the
Potter
brat
Kreacher
won't
won't
wont
as
you
can
see
Harry
said
Dumbledore
loudly
over
kreacher's
continued
croaks
of
wont
won't
won't
Kreacher
is
showing
a
certain
reluctance
to
pass
into
your
ownership
i
don't
care
said
Harry
again
looking
with
disgust
at
the
writhing
stamping
house-elf
i
don't
want
him
won't
wont
won't
won't
you
would
prefer
him
to
pass
into
the
ownership
of
Bellatrix
Lestrange
bearing
in
mind
that
he
has
lived
at
the
headquarters
of
the
Order
of
the
Phoenix
for
the
past
year
won't
won't
wont
won't
harry
stared
at
Dumbledore
he
knew
that
Kreacher
could
not
be
permitted
to
go
and
live
with
Bellatrix
Lestrange
but
the
idea
of
owning
him
of
having
responsibility
for
the
creature
that
had
betrayed
Sirius
was
repugnant
give
him
an
order
said
Dumbledore
if
he
has
passed
into
your
ownership
he
will
have
to
obey
if
not
then
we
shall
have
to
think
of
some
other
means
of
keeping
him
from
his
rightful
mistress
won't
won't
wont
won't
kreacher's
voice
had
risen
to
a
scream
harry
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
except
Kreacher
shut
up
it
looked
for
a
moment
as
though
Kreacher
was
going
to
choke
he
grabbed
his
throat
his
mouth
still
working
furiously
his
eyes
bulging
after
a
few
seconds
of
frantic
gulping
he
threw
himself
face
forward
onto
the
carpet
Aunt
Petunia
whimpered
and
beat
the
floor
with
his
hands
and
feet
giving
himself
over
to
a
violent
but
entirely
silent
tantrum
well
that
simplifies
matters
said
Dumbledore
cheerfully
it
means
that
Sirius
knew
what
he
was
doing
you
are
the
rightful
owner
of
number
twelve
Grimmauld
Place
and
of
Kreacher
do
I
do
I
have
to
keep
him
with
me
harry
asked
aghast
us
Kreacher
thrashed
around
at
his
feet
not
if
you
don't
want
to
said
Dumbledore
if
I
might
make
ii
suggestion
you
could
send
him
to
Hogwarts
to
work
in
the
kitchen
there
in
that
way
the
other
house-elves
could
keep
an
eye
on
him
yeah
said
Harry
in
relief
yeah
i'll
do
that
er
Kreacher
I
want
you
to
go
to
Hogwarts
and
work
in
the
kitchens
there
with
the
other
house-elves
kreacher
who
was
now
lying
flat
on
his
back
with
his
arms
and
legs
in
the
air
gave
Harry
one
upside-down
look
of
deepest
loathing
and
with
another
loud
crack
vanished
good
said
Dumbledore
there
is
also
the
matter
of
the
hip-pogriff
Buckbeak
hagrid
has
been
looking
after
him
since
Sirius
died
but
Buckbeak
is
yours
now
so
if
you
would
prefer
to
make
different
arrangements
no
said
Harry
at
once
he
can
stay
with
Hagrid
i
think
Buckbeak
would
prefer
that
hagrid
will
be
delighted
said
Dumbledore
smiling
he
was
thrilled
to
see
Buckbeak
again
incidentally
we
have
decided
in
the
interests
of
buckbeak's
safety
to
rechristen
him
Witherwings
for
the
time
being
though
I
doubt
that
the
Ministry
would
ever
guess
he
is
the
hippogriff
they
once
sentenced
to
death
now
Harry
is
your
trunk
packed
erm
doubtful
that
I
would
turn
up
dumbledore
suggested
shrewdly
i'll
just
go
and
er
finish
off
said
Harry
hastily
hurrying
to
pick
up
his
fallen
telescope
and
trainers
it
took
him
a
little
over
ten
minutes
to
track
down
everything
he
needed
at
last
he
had
managed
to
extract
his
Invisibility
Cloak
from
under
the
bed
screwed
the
top
back
on
his
jar
of
color-change
ink
and
forced
the
lid
of
his
trunk
shut
on
his
cauldron
then
heaving
his
trunk
in
one
hand
and
holding
hedwig's
cage
in
the
other
he
made
his
way
back
downstairs
he
was
disappointed
to
discover
that
Dumbledore
was
not
waiting
in
the
hall
which
meant
that
he
had
to
return
to
the
living
room
nobody
was
talking
dumbledore
was
humming
quietly
apparently
quite
at
his
ease
but
the
atmosphere
was
thicker
than
cold
custard
and
Harry
did
not
dare
look
at
the
Dursleys
as
he
said
Professor
i'm
ready
now
good
said
Dumbledore
just
one
last
thing
then
and
he
turned
to
speak
to
the
Dursleys
once
more
as
you
will
no
doubt
be
aware
Harry
comes
of
age
in
a
years
time
no
said
Aunt
Petunia
speaking
for
the
first
time
since
dumbledore's
arrival
i'm
sorry
said
Dumbledore
politely
no
he
doesn't
he's
a
month
younger
than
Dudley
and
Dudders
doesn't
turn
eighteen
until
the
year
after
next
ah
said
Dumbledore
pleasantly
but
in
the
Wizarding
world
we
come
of
age
at
seventeen
uncle
Vernoii
muttered
Preposterous
but
Dumbledore
ignored
him
now
as
you
already
know
the
wizard
called
Lord
Voldemort
Was
returned
to
this
country
the
Wizarding
community
is
currently
in
a
state
of
open
warfare
harry
whom
Lord
Voldemort
has
already
attempted
to
kill
on
a
number
of
occasions
is
in
even
greater
danger
now
than
the
day
when
I
left
him
upon
your
doorstep
fifteen
years
ago
with
a
letter
explaining
about
his
parents
murder
and
expressing
the
hope
that
you
would
care
for
him
is
though
he
were
your
own
dumbledore
paused
and
although
his
voice
remained
light
and
calm
and
he
gave
no
obvious
sign
of
anger
Harry
felt
a
kind
of
chill
emanating
from
him
and
noticed
that
the
Dursleys
drew
very
slightly
closer
together
you
did
not
do
as
I
asked
you
have
never
treated
Harry
as
a
son
he
has
known
nothing
but
neglect
and
often
cruelty
at
your
hands
the
best
that
can
be
said
is
that
he
has
at
least
escaped
the
appalling
damage
you
have
inflicted
upon
the
unfortunate
boy
sitting
between
you
both
Aunt
Petunia
and
Uncle
Vernon
looked
around
instinc-lively
as
though
expecting
to
see
someone
other
than
Dudley
squeezed
between
them
us
mistreat
Dudders
what
d'you
began
Uncle
Vernon
furiously
but
Dumbledore
raised
his
ringer
for
silence
a
silence
which
fell
as
though
he
had
struck
Uncle
Vernon
dumb
the
magic
I
evoked
fifteen
years
ago
means
that
Harry
has
powerful
protection
while
he
can
still
call
this
house
home
however
miserable
he
has
been
here
however
unwelcome
however
badly
treated
you
have
at
least
grudgingly
allowed
him
houseroom
this
magic
will
cease
to
operate
the
moment
that
Harry
turns
seventeen
in
other
words
at
the
moment
he
becomes
a
man
i
ask
only
this
that
you
allow
Harry
to
return
once
more
to
this
house
before
his
seventeenth
birthday
which
will
ensure
that
the
protection
continues
until
that
time
none
of
the
Dursleys
said
anything
dudley
was
frowning
slightly
as
though
he
was
still
trying
to
work
out
when
he
had
ever
been
mistreated
uncle
Vernon
looked
as
though
he
had
something
stuck
in
his
throat
Aunt
Petunia
however
was
oddly
flushed
well
Harry
time
for
us
to
be
off
said
Dumbledore
at
last
standing
up
and
straightening
his
long
black
cloak
until
we
meet
again
he
said
to
the
Dursleys
who
looked
as
though
that
moment
could
wait
forever
as
far
as
they
were
concerned
and
after
doffing
his
hat
he
swept
from
the
room
bye
said
Harry
hastily
to
the
Dursleys
and
followed
Dumbledore
who
paused
beside
harry's
trunk
upon
which
hedwig's
cage
was
perched
we
do
not
want
to
be
encumbered
by
these
just
now
he
said
pulling
out
his
wand
again
i
shall
send
them
to
the
Burrow
to
await
us
there
however
I
would
like
you
to
bring
your
Invisibility
Cloak
just
in
case
harry
extracted
his
cloak
from
his
trunk
with
some
difficulty
trying
not
to
show
Dumbledore
the
mess
within
when
he
had
stuffed
it
into
an
inside
pocket
of
his
jacket
Dumbiedore
waved
his
wand
and
the
trunk
cage
and
Hedwig
vanished
dumbledore
then
waved
his
wand
again
and
the
front
door
opened
onto
cool
misty
darkness
and
now
Harry
let
us
step
out
into
the
night
and
pursue
that
flighty
temptress
adventure
chapter
Horace
Slughorn
despite
the
fact
that
he
had
spent
every
waking
moment
of
the
past
few
days
hoping
desperately
that
Dumbledore
would
indeed
come
to
fetch
him
Harry
felt
distinctly
awkward
as
they
set
off
down
Privet
Drive
together
he
had
never
had
a
proper
conversation
with
the
headmaster
outside
of
Hogwarts
before
there
was
usually
a
desk
between
them
the
memory
of
their
last
face-to-face
encounter
kept
intruding
too
and
it
rather
heightened
harry's
sense
of
embarrassment
he
had
shouted
a
lot
on
that
occasion
not
to
mention
done
his
best
to
smash
several
of
dumbledore's
most
prized
possessions
dumbledore
however
seemed
completely
relaxed
keep
your
wand
at
the
ready
Harry
he
said
brightly
but
I
thought
i'm
not
allowed
to
use
magic
outside
school
sir
if
there
is
an
attack
said
Dumbledore
I
give
you
permission
to
use
any
counterjinx
or
curse
that
might
occur
to
you
however
I
do
not
think
you
need
worry
about
being
attacked
tonight
why
not
sir
you
are
with
me
said
Dumbledore
simply
this
will
do
Harry
he
came
to
an
abrupt
halt
at
the
end
of
Privet
Drive
you
have
not
of
course
passed
your
Apparition
Test
he
said
no
said
Harry
i
thought
you
had
to
be
seventeen
you
do
said
Dumbledore
so
you
will
need
to
hold
on
to
my
arm
very
tightly
my
left
if
you
don't
mind
as
you
have
noticed
my
wand
arm
is
a
little
fragile
at
the
moment
harry
gripped
Dumbledores
proffered
forearm
very
good
said
Dumbledore
well
here
we
go
harry
felt
Dumbledores
arm
twist
away
from
him
and
redoubled
his
grip
the
next
thing
he
knew
everything
went
black
he
was
being
pressed
very
hard
from
all
directions
he
could
not
breathe
there
were
iron
bands
tightening
around
his
chest
his
eyeballs
were
being
forced
back
into
his
head
his
eardrums
were
being
pushed
deeper
into
his
skull
and
then
he
gulped
great
lungfulls
of
cold
night
air
and
opened
his
streaming
eyes
he
felt
as
though
he
had
just
been
forced
through
a
very
tight
rubber
tube
it
was
a
few
seconds
before
he
realized
that
Privet
Drive
had
vanished
he
and
Dumbledore
were
now
standing
in
what
appeared
to
be
a
deserted
village
square
in
the
center
of
which
stood
an
old
war
memorial
and
a
few
benches
his
comprehension
catching
up
with
his
senses
Harry
realized
that
he
had
just
Apparated
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
are
you
all
right
asked
Dumbledore
looking
down
at
him
solicitously
the
sensation
does
take
some
getting
used
to
i'm
fine
said
Harry
rubbing
his
ears
which
felt
as
though
they
had
left
Privet
Drive
rather
reluctantly
but
I
think
I
might
prefer
brooms
dumbledore
smiled
drew
his
traveling
cloak
a
little
more
lightly
around
his
neck
and
said
This
way
he
set
off
at
a
brisk
pace
past
an
empty
inn
and
a
few
houses
according
to
a
clock
on
a
nearby
church
it
was
almost
midnight
so
tell
me
Harry
said
Dumbledore
your
scar
has
it
been
hurting
at
all
harry
raised
a
hand
unconsciously
to
his
forehead
and
rubbed
i
he
lightning-shaped
mark
no
he
said
and
i've
been
wondering
about
that
i
thought
it
would
be
burning
all
the
time
now
voldemort's
getting
so
powerful
again
he
glanced
up
at
Dumbledore
and
saw
that
he
was
wearing
a
satisfied
expression
i
on
the
other
hand
thought
otherwise
said
Dumbledore
lord
Voldemort
has
finally
realized
the
dangerous
access
to
his
thoughts
and
feelings
you
have
been
enjoying
it
appears
that
he
is
now
employing
Occlumency
against
you
well
i'm
not
complaining
said
Harry
who
missed
neither
the
disturbing
dreams
nor
the
startling
flashes
of
insight
into
voldemort's
mind
they
turned
a
corner
passing
a
telephone
box
and
a
bus
shelter
harry
looked
sideways
at
Dumbledore
again
professor
harry
er
where
exactly
are
we
this
Harry
is
the
charming
village
of
Budleigh
Babberton
and
what
are
we
doing
here
ah
yes
of
course
I
haven't
told
you
said
Dumbledore
well
I
have
lost
count
of
the
number
of
times
I
have
said
this
in
recent
years
but
we
are
once
again
one
member
of
staff
short
we
are
here
to
persuade
an
old
colleague
of
mine
to
come
out
of
retirement
and
return
to
Hogwarts
how
can
I
help
with
that
sir
oh
I
think
we'll
find
a
use
for
you
said
Dumbledore
vaguely
left
here
Harry
they
proceeded
up
a
steep
narrow
street
lined
with
houses
all
the
windows
were
dark
the
odd
chill
that
had
lain
over
Privet
Drive
for
two
weeks
persisted
here
too
thinking
of
dementors
Harry
cast
a
look
over
his
shoulder
and
grasped
his
wand
reassuringly
in
his
pocket
professor
why
couldn't
we
just
Apparate
directly
into
your
old
colleague's
house
because
it
would
be
quite
as
rude
as
kicking
down
the
front
door
said
Dumbledore
courtesy
dictates
that
we
offer
fellow
wizards
the
opportunity
of
denying
us
entry
in
any
case
most
Wizarding
dwellings
are
magically
protected
from
unwanted
Apparators
at
Hogwarts
for
instance
you
can't
Apparate
anywhere
inside
the
buildings
or
grounds
said
Harry
quickly
hermione
Granger
told
me
and
she
is
quite
right
we
turn
left
again
the
church
clock
chimed
midnight
behind
them
harry
wondered
why
Dumbledore
did
not
consider
it
rude
to
call
on
his
old
colleague
so
late
but
now
that
conversation
had
been
established
he
had
more
pressing
questions
to
ask
sir
I
saw
in
the
Daily
Prophet
that
Fudge
has
been
sacked
correct
said
Dumbledore
now
turning
up
a
steep
side
street
he
has
been
replaced
as
am
sure
you
also
saw
by
Rufus
Scrimgeour
who
used
to
be
Head
of
the
Auror
office
is
he
do
you
think
he's
good
asked
Harry
an
interesting
question
said
Dumbledore
he
is
able
certainly
a
more
decisive
and
forceful
personality
than
Cornelius
yes
but
I
meant
i
know
what
you
meant
rufus
is
a
man
of
action
and
having
fought
Dark
wizards
for
most
of
his
working
life
does
not
under-estimate
Lord
Voldemort
harry
waited
but
Dumbledore
did
not
say
anything
about
the
disagreement
with
Scrimgeour
that
the
Daily
Prophet
had
reported
and
he
did
not
have
the
nerve
to
pursue
the
subject
so
he
changed
ii
and
sir
i
saw
about
Madam
Bones
yes
said
Dumbledore
quietly
a
terrible
loss
she
was
a
great
witch
just
up
here
I
think
ouch
he
had
pointed
with
his
injured
hand
professor
what
happened
to
your
i
have
no
time
to
explain
now
said
Dumbledore
it
is
a
thrilling
tale
I
wish
to
do
it
justice
he
smiled
at
Harry
who
understood
that
he
was
not
being
snubbed
and
that
he
had
permission
to
keep
asking
questions
sir
I
got
a
Ministry
of
Magic
leaflet
by
owl
about
security
measures
we
should
all
take
against
the
Death
Eaters
yes
I
received
one
myself
said
Dumbledore
still
smiling
did
you
find
it
useful
not
really
no
I
thought
not
you
have
not
asked
me
for
instance
what
is
my
favorite
flavor
of
jam
to
check
that
I
am
indeed
Professor
Dumbledore
and
not
an
impostor
i
didn't
harry
began
not
entirely
sure
whether
he
was
being
reprimanded
or
not
for
future
reference
Harry
it
is
raspberry
although
of
course
if
I
were
a
Death
Eater
I
would
have
been
sure
to
research
my
own
jam
preferences
before
impersonating
myself
er
right
said
Harry
well
on
that
leaflet
it
said
something
about
Inferi
what
exactly
are
they
the
leaflet
wasn't
very
clear
they
are
corpses
said
Dumbledore
calmly
dead
bodies
that
have
been
bewitched
to
do
a
Dark
wizard's
bidding
inferi
have
not
been
seen
for
a
long
time
however
not
since
Voldemort
was
last
powerful
he
killed
enough
people
to
make
an
army
of
them
of
course
this
is
the
place
Harry
just
here
they
were
nearing
a
small
neat
stone
house
set
in
its
own
garden
harry
was
too
busy
digesting
the
horrible
idea
of
Inferi
to
have
much
attention
left
for
anything
else
but
as
they
reached
the
front
gate
Dumbledore
stopped
dead
and
Harry
walked
into
him
oh
dear
oh
dear
dear
dear
harry
followed
his
gaze
up
the
carefully
tended
front
path
and
felt
his
heart
sink
the
front
door
was
hanging
off
its
hinges
dumbledore
glanced
up
and
down
the
street
it
seemed
quite
deserted
wand
out
and
follow
me
Harry
he
said
quietly
he
opened
the
gate
and
walked
swiftly
and
silently
up
the
garden
path
Harry
at
his
heels
then
pushed
the
front
door
very
slowly
his
wand
raised
and
at
the
ready
lumos
dumbledore's
wand
tip
ignited
casting
its
light
up
a
narrow
hallway
to
the
left
another
door
stood
open
holding
his
illuminated
wand
aloft
Dumbledore
walked
into
the
sitting
room
with
Harry
right
behind
him
a
scene
of
total
devastation
met
their
eyes
a
grandfather
clock
lay
splintered
at
their
feet
its
face
cracked
its
pendulum
lying
a
little
farther
away
like
a
dropped
sword
a
piano
was
on
its
side
its
keys
strewn
across
the
floor
the
wreckage
of
a
fallen
chandelier
flittered
nearby
cushions
lay
deflated
feathers
oozing
from
slashes
in
their
sides
fragments
of
glass
and
china
lay
like
powder
over
everything
dumbledore
raised
his
wand
even
higher
so
that
its
light
was
thrown
upon
the
walls
where
something
darkly
red
and
glutinous
was
spattered
over
the
wallpaper
harry's
small
intake
of
breath
made
Dumbledore
look
around
not
pretty
is
it
he
said
heavily
yes
something
horrible
has
happened
here
dumbledore
moved
carefully
into
the
middle
of
the
room
scrutinizing
the
wreckage
at
his
feet
harry
followed
gazing
around
half-scared
of
what
he
might
see
hidden
behind
the
wreck
of
the
piano
or
the
overturned
sofa
but
there
was
no
sign
of
a
body
maybe
there
was
a
fight
and
and
they
dragged
him
off
Professor
harry
suggested
trying
not
to
imagine
how
badly
wounded
a
man
would
have
to
be
to
leave
those
stains
spattered
halfway
up
the
walls
i
don't
think
so
said
Dumbledore
quietly
peering
behind
an
overstuffed
armchair
lying
on
its
side
you
mean
he's
still
here
somewhere
yes
and
without
warning
Dumbledore
swooped
plunging
the
tip
of
his
wand
into
the
seat
of
the
overstuffed
armchair
which
yelled
Ouch
good
evening
Horace
said
Dumbledore
straightening
up
again
harrys
jaw
dropped
where
a
split
second
before
there
had
been
an
armchair
there
now
crouched
an
enormously
fat
bald
old
man
who
was
massaging
his
lower
belly
and
squinting
up
at
Dumbledore
with
an
aggrieved
and
watery
eye
there
was
no
need
to
stick
the
wand
in
that
hard
he
said
gruffly
clambering
to
his
feet
it
hurt
the
wandlight
sparkled
on
his
shiny
pate
his
prominent
eyes
his
enormous
silver
walruslike
mustache
and
the
highly
polished
buttons
on
the
maroon
velvet
jacket
he
was
wearing
over
a
pair
of
lilac
silk
pajamas
the
top
of
his
head
barely
reached
dumbledore's
chin
what
gave
it
away
he
grunted
as
he
staggered
to
his
feet
still
rubbing
his
lower
belly
he
seemed
remarkably
unabashed
for
a
man
who
had
just
been
discovered
pretending
to
be
an
armchair
my
dear
Horace
said
Dumbledore
looking
amused
if
the
Death
Eaters
really
had
come
to
call
the
Dark
Mark
would
have
been
set
over
the
house
the
wizard
clapped
a
pudgy
hand
to
his
vast
forehead
the
Dark
Mark
he
muttered
knew
there
was
something
ah
well
wouldn't
have
had
time
anyway
i'd
only
just
put
the
finishing
touches
to
my
upholstery
when
you
entered
the
room
he
heaved
a
great
sigh
that
made
the
ends
of
his
mustache
flutter
would
you
like
my
assistance
clearing
up
asked
Dumbledore
politely
please
said
the
other
they
stood
back
to
back
the
tall
thin
wizard
and
the
short
round
one
and
waved
their
wands
in
one
identical
sweeping
motion
the
furniture
flew
back
to
its
original
places
ornaments
re-lormed
in
midair
feathers
zoomed
into
their
cushions
torn
books
repaired
themselves
as
they
landed
upon
their
shelves
oil
lanterns
soared
onto
side
tables
and
reignited
avast
collection
of
splintered
silver
picture
frames
flew
glittering
across
the
room
and
alighted
whole
and
untarnished
upon
a
desk
rips
cracks
and
holes
healed
everywhere
and
the
walls
wiped
themselves
clean
what
kind
of
blood
was
that
incidentally
asked
Dumbledore
loudly
over
the
chiming
of
the
newly
unsmashed
grandfather
flock
on
the
walls
dragon
shouted
the
wizard
called
Horace
as
with
a
deafening
grinding
and
tinkling
the
chandelier
screwed
itself
back
into
the
ceiling
there
was
a
final
plunk
from
the
piano
and
silence
yes
dragon
repeated
the
wizard
conversationally
my
last
bottle
and
prices
are
sky-high
at
the
moment
still
it
might
be
reusable
he
stumped
over
to
a
small
crystal
bottle
standing
on
top
of
a
sideboard
and
held
it
up
to
the
light
examining
the
thick
liquid
within
hmm
bit
dusty
he
set
the
bottle
back
on
the
sideboard
and
sighed
it
was
then
that
his
gaze
fell
upon
Harry
oho
he
said
his
large
round
eyes
flying
to
harry's
forehead
and
the
lightning-shaped
scar
it
bore
oho
this
said
Dumbledore
moving
forward
to
make
the
introduction
is
Harry
Potter
harry
this
is
an
old
Friend
and
colleague
of
mine
Horace
Slughorn
slughorn
turned
on
Dumbledore
his
expression
shrewd
so
that's
how
you
thought
you'd
persuade
me
is
it
well
the
answer's
no
Albus
he
pushed
past
Harry
his
face
turned
resolutely
away
with
the
air
of
a
man
trying
to
resist
temptation
i
suppose
we
can
have
a
drink
at
least
asked
Dumbledore
for
old
time's
sake
slughorn
hesitated
all
right
then
one
drink
he
said
ungraciously
dumbledore
smiled
at
Harry
and
directed
him
toward
a
chair
not
unlike
the
one
that
Slughorn
had
so
recently
impersonated
which
stood
right
beside
the
newly
burning
fire
and
a
brightly
glowing
oil
lamp
harry
took
the
seat
with
the
distinct
impression
that
Dumbledore
for
some
reason
wanted
to
keep
him
as
visible
as
possible
certainly
when
Slughorn
who
had
been
busy
with
decanters
and
glasses
turned
to
face
the
room
again
his
eyes
fell
immediately
upon
Harry
hmpf
he
said
looking
away
quickly
as
though
frightened
of
hurting
his
eyes
here
He
gave
a
drink
to
Dumbledore
who
had
sat
down
without
invitation
thrust
the
tray
at
Harry
and
then
sank
into
the
cushions
of
the
repaired
sofa
and
a
disgruntled
silence
his
legs
were
so
short
they
did
not
touch
the
floor
well
how
have
you
been
keeping
Horace
dumbledore
asked
not
so
well
said
Slughorn
at
once
weak
chest
wheezy
rheumatism
too
can't
move
like
I
used
to
well
that's
to
be
expected
old
age
fatigue
and
yet
you
must
have
moved
fairly
quickly
to
prepare
such
a
welcome
for
us
at
such
short
notice
said
Dumbledore
you
can't
have
had
more
than
three
minutes
warning
slughorn
said
half
irritably
half
proudly
Two
didn't
hear
my
Intruder
Charm
go
off
I
was
taking
a
bath
still
he
added
sternly
seeming
to
pull
himself
back
together
again
the
fact
remains
that
i'm
an
old
man
Albus
a
tired
old
man
who's
earned
the
right
to
a
quiet
life
and
a
few
creature
comforts
he
certainly
had
those
thought
Harry
looking
around
the
room
it
was
stuffy
and
cluttered
yet
nobody
could
say
it
was
uncomfortable
there
were
soft
chairs
and
footstools
drinks
and
books
boxes
of
chocolates
and
plump
cushions
if
Harry
had
not
known
who
lived
there
he
would
have
guessed
at
a
rich
fussy
old
lady
you're
not
yet
as
old
as
I
am
Horace
said
Dumbledore
well
maybe
you
ought
to
think
about
retirement
yourself
said
Slughorn
bluntly
his
pale
gooseberry
eyes
had
found
dumbledore's
injured
hand
reactions
not
what
they
were
I
see
you're
quite
right
said
Dumbledore
serenely
shaking
back
his
sleeve
to
reveal
the
tips
of
those
burned
and
blackened
ringers
the
sight
of
them
made
the
back
of
harry's
neck
prickle
unpleasantly
am
undoubtedly
slower
than
I
was
but
on
the
other
hand
he
shrugged
and
spread
his
hands
wide
as
though
to
say
that
age
had
its
compensations
and
Harry
noticed
a
ring
on
his
uninjured
hand
that
he
had
never
seen
Dumbledore
wear
before
It
was
large
rather
clumsily
made
of
what
looked
like
gold
and
was
set
with
a
heavy
black
stone
that
had
cracked
down
the
middle
slughorn's
eyes
lingered
for
a
moment
on
the
ring
too
and
Harry
saw
a
tiny
frown
momentarily
crease
his
wide
forehead
so
all
these
precautions
against
intruders
Horace
are
they
for
the
Death
Eaters
benefit
or
mine
asked
Dumbledore
what
would
the
Death
Eaters
want
with
a
poor
broken-down
old
buffer
like
me
demanded
Slughorn
i
imagine
that
they
would
want
you
to
turn
your
considerable
talents
to
coercion
torture
and
murder
said
Dumbledore
are
you
really
telling
me
that
they
haven't
come
recruiting
yet
slughorn
eyed
Dumbledore
balefully
for
a
moment
then
muttered
I
haven't
given
them
the
chance
i've
been
on
the
move
for
a
year
never
stay
in
one
place
more
than
a
week
move
from
mug-gle
house
to
Muggle
house
the
owners
of
this
place
are
on
holiday
in
the
Canary
Islands
it's
been
very
pleasant
i'll
be
sorry
to
leave
it's
quite
easy
once
you
know
how
one
simple
Freezing
Charm
on
these
absurd
burglar
alarms
they
use
instead
of
sneako-scopes
and
make
sure
the
neighbors
don't
spot
you
bringing
in
the
piano
ingenious
said
Dumbledore
but
it
sounds
a
rather
tiring
existence
for
a
broken-down
old
buffer
in
search
of
a
quiet
life
now
if
you
were
to
return
to
Hogwarts
if
you're
going
to
tell
me
my
life
would
be
more
peaceful
at
that
pestilential
school
you
can
save
your
breath
Albus
i
might
have
been
in
hiding
but
some
funny
rumors
have
reached
me
since
Dolores
Umbridge
left
if
that's
how
you
treat
teachers
these
days
professor
Umbridge
ran
afoul
of
our
centaur
herd
said
Dumbledore
i
think
you
Horace
would
have
known
better
than
to
stride
into
the
forest
and
call
a
horde
of
angry
centaurs
filthy
half-breeds
that's
what
she
did
did
she
said
Slughorn
idiotic
woman
never
liked
her
harry
chuckled
and
both
Dumbledore
and
Slughorn
looked
round
at
him
sorry
Harry
said
hastily
it's
just
I
didn't
like
her
either
dumbledore
stood
up
rather
suddenly
are
you
leaving
asked
Slughorn
at
once
looking
hopeful
no
I
was
wondering
whether
I
might
use
your
bathroom
said
Dumbledore
oh
said
Slughorn
clearly
disappointed
second
on
the
left
down
the
hall
dumbledore
strode
from
the
room
once
the
door
had
closed
behind
him
there
was
silence
after
a
few
moments
Slughorn
got
to
his
feet
but
seemed
uncertain
what
to
do
with
himself
he
shot
a
furtive
look
at
Harry
then
crossed
to
the
fire
and
turned
his
back
on
it
warming
his
wide
behind
don't
think
I
don't
know
why
he's
brought
you
he
said
abruptly
harry
merely
looked
at
Slughorn
slughorn's
watery
eyes
slid
over
harry's
scar
this
time
taking
in
the
rest
of
his
face
you
look
very
like
your
father
yeah
i've
been
told
said
Harry
except
for
your
eyes
you've
got
my
mother's
eyes
yeah
harry
had
heard
it
so
often
he
found
it
a
bit
wearing
hmpf
yes
well
you
shouldn't
have
favorites
as
a
teacher
of
course
but
she
was
one
of
mine
your
mother
Slughorn
added
in
answer
to
Harrys
questioning
look
lily
Evans
one
of
the
brightest
I
ever
taught
vivacious
you
know
charming
girl
i
used
to
tell
her
she
ought
to
have
been
in
my
House
very
cheeky
answers
I
used
to
get
back
too
which
was
your
House
i
was
Head
of
Slytherin
said
Slughorn
oh
now
he
went
on
quickly
seeing
the
expression
on
harry's
face
and
wagging
a
stubby
ringer
at
him
don't
go
holding
that
against
me
you'll
be
Gryffindor
like
her
I
suppose
yes
it
usually
goes
in
families
not
always
though
ever
heard
of
Sirius
Black
you
must
have
done
been
in
the
papers
for
the
last
couple
of
years
died
a
few
weeks
ago
it
was
as
though
an
invisible
hand
had
twisted
harry's
intestines
and
held
them
tight
well
anyway
he
was
a
big
pal
of
your
father's
at
school
the
whole
Black
family
had
been
in
my
House
but
Sirius
ended
up
in
Gryffindor
shame
he
was
a
talented
boy
i
got
his
brother
Regulus
when
he
came
along
but
i'd
have
liked
the
set
he
sounded
like
an
enthusiastic
collector
who
had
been
outbid
at
auction
apparently
lost
in
memories
he
gazed
at
the
opposite
wall
turning
idly
on
the
spot
to
ensure
an
even
heat
on
his
backside
your
mother
was
muggle-born
of
course
couldn't
believe
it
when
I
found
out
thought
she
must
have
been
pure-blood
she
was
so
good
one
of
my
best
friends
is
muggle-born
said
Harry
and
she's
the
best
in
our
year
funny
how
that
sometimes
happens
isn't
it
said
Slughorn
not
really
said
Harry
coldly
slughorn
looked
down
at
him
in
surprise
you
mustn't
think
i'm
prejudiced
he
said
no
no
no
haven't
I
just
said
your
mother
was
one
of
my
all-time
favorite
students
and
there
was
Dirk
Cresswell
in
the
year
after
her
too
now
Head
of
the
Goblin
Liaison
Office
of
course
another
muggle-born
a
very
gifted
student
and
still
gives
me
excellent
inside
information
on
the
goings-on
at
Gringotts
he
bounced
up
and
down
a
little
smiling
in
a
self-satisfied
way
and
pointed
at
the
many
glittering
photograph
frames
on
the
dresser
each
peopled
with
tiny
moving
occupants
all
ex-students
all
signed
you'll
notice
Barnabas
Cuffe
editor
of
the
Daily
Prophet
he's
always
interested
to
hear
my
take
on
the
day's
news
and
ambrosius
Flume
of
Honeydukes
a
hamper
every
birthday
and
all
because
I
was
able
to
give
him
an
introduction
to
Ciceron
Harkisss
who
gave
him
his
first
job
and
at
the
back
you'll
see
her
if
you
just
crane
your
neck
that's
Gwenog
Jones
who
of
course
captains
the
Holyhead
Harpies
people
are
always
astonished
to
hear
i'm
on
first-name
terms
with
the
Harpies
and
free
tickets
whenever
I
want
them
this
thought
seemed
to
cheer
him
up
enormously
and
all
these
people
know
where
to
find
you
to
send
you
stuff
asked
Harry
who
could
not
help
wondering
why
the
Death
Eaters
had
not
yet
tracked
down
Slughorn
if
hampers
of
sweets
Quidditch
tickets
and
visitors
craving
his
advice
and
opinions
could
find
him
the
smile
slid
from
slughorn's
face
as
quickly
as
the
blood
from
his
walls
of
course
not
he
said
looking
down
at
Harry
i
have
been
out
of
touch
with
everybody
for
a
year
harry
had
the
impression
that
the
words
shocked
Slughorn
himself
he
looked
quite
unsettled
for
a
moment
then
he
shrugged
still
the
prudent
wizard
keeps
his
head
down
in
such
times
all
very
well
for
Dumbledore
to
talk
but
taking
up
a
post
at
hog-warts
just
now
would
be
tantamount
to
declaring
my
public
allegiance
to
the
Order
of
the
phoenix
and
while
i'm
sure
they're
very
admirable
and
brave
and
all
the
rest
of
it
I
don't
personally
fancy
the
mortality
rate
you
don't
have
to
join
the
Order
to
teach
at
Hogwarts
said
Harry
who
could
not
quite
keep
a
note
of
derision
out
of
his
voice
It
was
hard
to
sympathize
with
slughorn's
cosseted
existence
when
he
remembered
Sirius
crouching
in
a
cave
and
living
on
rats
most
of
the
teachers
aren't
in
it
and
none
of
them
has
ever
been
killed
well
unless
you
count
Quirrell
and
he
got
what
he
deserved
seeing
as
he
was
working
with
Voldemort
harry
had
been
sure
Slughorn
would
be
one
of
those
wizards
who
could
not
bear
to
hear
voldemort's
name
spoken
aloud
and
was
not
disappointed
Slughorn
gave
a
shudder
and
a
squawk
of
protest
which
Harry
ignored
i
reckon
the
staff
are
safer
than
most
people
while
dumble-dore's
headmaster
he's
supposed
to
be
the
only
one
Voldemort
ever
feared
isn't
he
harry
went
on
slughorn
gazed
into
space
for
a
moment
or
two
He
seemed
to
be
thinking
over
harry's
words
well
yes
it
is
true
that
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
has
never
sought
a
fight
with
Dumbledore
he
muttered
grudgingly
and
I
suppose
one
could
argue
that
as
I
have
not
joined
the
Death
Kilters
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
can
hardly
count
me
a
friend
in
which
case
I
might
well
be
safer
a
little
closer
to
Albus
i
cannot
pretend
that
Amelia
bones's
death
did
not
shake
me
if
she
with
all
her
Ministry
contacts
and
protection
dumbledore
reentered
the
room
and
Slughorn
jumped
as
though
he
had
forgotten
he
was
in
the
house
oh
there
you
are
Albus
he
said
you've
been
a
very
long
lime
upset
stomach
no
I
was
merely
reading
the
Muggle
magazines
said
Dumbledore
i
do
love
knitting
patterns
well
Harry
we
have
trespassed
upon
horace's
hospitality
quite
long
enough
I
think
it
is
time
for
us
to
leave
not
at
all
reluctant
to
obey
Harry
jumped
to
his
feet
slughorn
sinned
taken
aback
you're
leaving
yes
indeed
i
think
I
know
a
lost
cause
when
I
see
one
lost
slughorn
seemed
agitated
he
twiddled
his
fat
thumbs
and
fidgeted
as
he
watched
Dumbledore
fasten
his
traveling
cloak
and
Harry
zip
up
his
jacket
well
i'm
sorry
you
don't
want
the
job
Horace
said
Dumbledore
raising
his
uninjured
hand
in
a
farewell
salute
hogwarts
would
have
been
glad
to
see
you
back
again
our
greatly
increased
security
notwithstanding
you
will
always
be
welcome
to
visit
should
you
wish
to
yes
well
very
gracious
as
I
say
good-bye
then
bye
said
Harry
they
were
at
the
front
door
when
there
was
a
shout
from
behind
them
all
right
all
right
i'll
do
it
dumbledore
turned
to
see
Slughorn
standing
breathless
in
the
doorway
to
the
sitting
room
you
will
come
out
of
retirement
yes
yes
said
Slughorn
impatiently
i
must
be
mad
but
yes
wonderful
said
Dumbledore
beaming
then
Horace
we
shall
see
you
on
the
first
of
September
yes
I
daresay
you
will
grunted
Slughorn
as
they
set
off
down
the
garden
path
slughorn's
voice
floated
after
them
i'll
want
a
pay
rise
Dumbledore
dumbledore
chuckled
the
garden
gate
swung
shut
behind
them
and
they
set
off
back
down
the
hill
through
the
dark
and
the
swirling
mist
well
done
Harry
said
Dumbledore
i
didn't
do
anything
said
Harry
in
surprise
oh
yes
you
did
you
showed
Horace
exactly
how
much
he
stands
to
gain
by
returning
to
Hogwarts
did
you
like
him
er
harry
wasn't
sure
whether
he
liked
Slughorn
or
not
he
supposed
he
had
been
pleasant
in
his
way
but
he
had
also
seemed
vain
and
whatever
he
said
to
the
contrary
much
too
surprised
that
a
muggle-born
should
make
a
good
witch
horace
said
Dumbledore
relieving
Harry
of
the
responsibility
to
say
any
of
this
likes
his
comfort
he
also
likes
the
company
of
the
famous
the
successful
and
the
powerful
he
enjoys
the
feeling
that
he
influences
these
people
he
has
never
wanted
to
occupy
the
throne
himself
he
prefers
the
backseat
more
room
to
spread
out
you
see
he
used
to
handpick
favorites
at
Hogwarts
sometimes
for
their
ambition
or
their
brains
sometimes
for
their
charm
or
their
talent
and
he
had
an
uncanny
knack
for
choosing
those
who
would
go
on
to
become
outstanding
in
their
various
fields
horace
formed
a
kind
of
club
of
his
favorites
with
himself
at
the
center
making
introductions
forging
useful
contacts
between
members
and
always
reaping
some
kind
of
benefit
in
return
whether
a
free
box
of
his
favorite
crystallized
pineapple
or
the
chance
to
recommend
the
next
junior
member
of
the
Goblin
liaison
Office
harry
had
a
sudden
and
vivid
mental
image
of
a
great
swollen
spider
spinning
a
web
around
it
twitching
a
thread
here
and
there
to
bring
its
large
and
juicy
flies
a
little
closer
i
tell
you
all
this
Dumbledore
continued
not
to
turn
you
against
Horace
or
as
we
must
now
call
him
Professor
Slughorn
but
to
put
you
on
your
guard
he
will
undoubtedly
try
to
collect
you
Harry
you
would
be
the
jewel
of
his
collection
the
Boy
Who
Lived
or
as
they
call
you
these
days
the
Chosen
One
at
these
words
a
chill
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
surrounding
mist
stole
over
Harry
he
was
reminded
of
words
he
had
heard
a
few
weeks
ago
words
that
had
a
horrible
and
particular
meaning
to
him
Neither
can
live
while
the
other
survives
dumbledore
had
stopped
walking
level
with
the
church
they
had
passed
earlier
this
will
do
Harry
if
you
will
grasp
my
arm
braced
this
time
Harry
was
ready
for
the
Apparition
but
still
found
it
unpleasant
when
the
pressure
disappeared
and
he
found
himself
able
to
breathe
again
he
was
standing
in
a
country
lane
beside
Dumbledore
and
looking
ahead
to
the
crooked
silhouette
of
his
second
favorite
building
in
the
world
the
Burrow
in
spite
of
the
feeling
of
dread
that
had
just
swept
through
him
his
spirits
could
not
help
but
lift
at
the
sight
of
it
ron
was
in
there
and
so
was
Mrs
weasley
who
could
cook
better
than
anyone
he
knew
if
you
don't
mind
Harry
said
Dumbledore
as
they
passed
through
the
gate
i'd
like
a
few
words
with
you
before
we
part
in
private
perhaps
in
here
dumbledore
pointed
toward
a
run-down
stone
outhouse
where
the
Weasleys
kept
their
broomsticks
a
little
puzzled
Harry
followed
Dumbledore
through
the
creaking
door
into
a
space
a
little
smaller
than
the
average
cupboard
dumbledore
illuminated
the
tip
of
his
wand
so
that
it
glowed
like
a
torch
and
smiled
down
at
Harry
i
hope
you
will
forgive
me
for
mentioning
it
Harry
but
I
am
pleased
and
a
little
proud
at
how
well
you
seem
to
be
coping
after
everything
that
happened
at
the
Ministry
permit
me
to
say
that
I
think
Sirius
would
have
been
proud
of
you
harry
swallowed
his
voice
seemed
to
have
deserted
him
he
did
not
think
he
could
stand
to
discuss
Sirius
it
had
been
painful
enough
to
hear
Uncle
Vernon
say
His
godfather's
dead
and
even
worse
to
hear
Siriuss
name
thrown
out
casually
by
Slughorn
it
was
cruel
said
Dumbledore
softly
that
you
and
Sirius
had
such
a
short
time
together
a
brutal
ending
to
what
should
have
been
a
long
and
happy
relationship
harry
nodded
his
eyes
fixed
resolutely
on
the
spider
now
climbing
dumbledore's
hat
he
could
tell
that
Dumbledore
understood
that
he
might
even
suspect
that
until
his
letter
arrived
Harry
had
spent
nearly
all
his
time
at
the
Dursleys
lying
on
his
bed
refusing
meals
and
staring
at
the
misted
window
full
of
the
chill
emptiness
i
hat
he
had
come
to
associate
with
dementors
it's
just
hard
Harry
said
finally
in
a
low
voice
to
realize
he
won't
write
to
me
again
his
eyes
burned
suddenly
and
he
blinked
he
felt
stupid
for
admitting
it
but
the
fact
that
he
had
had
someone
outside
Hogwarts
who
cared
what
happened
to
him
almost
like
a
parent
had
been
one
of
the
best
things
about
discovering
his
godfather
and
now
the
post
owls
would
never
bring
him
that
comfort
again
sirius
represented
much
to
you
that
you
had
never
known
before
said
Dumbledore
gently
naturally
the
loss
is
devastat-ing
but
while
I
was
at
the
Dursleys
interrupted
Harry
his
voice
growing
stronger
I
realized
I
cant
shut
myself
away
or
or
crack
up
sirius
wouldn't
have
wanted
that
would
he
and
anyway
life's
too
short
look
at
Madam
Bones
look
at
Emmeline
Vance
it
could
be
me
next
couldn't
it
but
if
it
is
he
said
fiercely
now
looking
straight
into
dumbledore's
blue
eyes
gleaming
in
the
wandlight
i'll
make
sure
I
take
as
many
Death
Eaters
with
me
as
I
can
and
Voldemort
too
if
I
can
manage
it
spoken
both
like
your
mother
and
father's
son
and
sirius's
true
godson
said
Dumbledore
with
an
approving
pat
on
harry's
back
i
take
my
hat
off
to
you
or
I
would
if
I
were
not
afraid
of
showering
you
in
spiders
and
now
Harry
on
a
closely
related
subject
i
gather
that
you
have
been
taking
the
Daily
Prophet
over
the
last
two
weeks
yes
said
Harry
and
his
heart
beat
a
little
faster
then
you
will
have
seen
that
there
have
been
not
so
much
leaks
as
floods
concerning
your
adventure
in
the
Hall
of
Prophecy
yes
said
Harry
again
and
now
everyone
knows
that
i'm
the
one
no
they
do
not
interrupted
Dumbledore
there
are
only
two
people
in
the
whole
world
who
know
the
full
contents
of
the
prophecy
made
about
you
and
Lord
Voldemort
and
they
are
both
standing
in
this
smelly
spidery
broom
shed
it
is
true
however
that
many
have
guessed
correctly
that
Voldemort
sent
his
Death
Eaters
to
steal
a
prophecy
and
that
the
prophecy
concerned
you
now
I
think
I
am
correct
in
saying
that
you
have
not
told
anybody
that
you
know
what
the
prophecy
said
no
said
Harry
a
wise
decision
on
the
whole
said
Dumbledore
although
I
think
you
ought
to
relax
it
in
favor
of
your
friends
mr.
Ronald
Weasley
and
Miss
Hermione
Granger
yes
he
continued
when
Harry
looked
startled
I
think
they
ought
to
know
you
do
them
a
disservice
by
not
confiding
something
this
important
to
them
i
didn't
want
to
worry
or
frighten
them
said
Dumbledore
surveying
Harry
over
the
top
of
his
half-moon
spectacles
or
perhaps
to
confess
that
you
yourself
are
worried
and
frightened
you
need
your
friends
Harry
as
you
so
rightly
said
Sirius
would
not
have
wanted
you
to
shut
yourself
away
harry
said
nothing
but
Dumbledore
did
not
seem
to
require
an
answer
he
continued
On
a
different
though
related
subject
it
is
my
wish
that
you
take
private
lessons
with
me
this
year
private
with
you
said
Harry
surprised
out
of
his
preoccupied
silence
yes
i
think
it
is
time
that
I
took
a
greater
hand
in
your
education
what
will
you
be
teaching
me
sir
oh
a
little
of
this
a
little
of
that
said
Dumbledore
airily
harry
waited
hopefully
but
Dumbledore
did
not
elaborate
so
ho
asked
something
else
that
had
been
bothering
him
slightly
if
i'm
having
lessons
with
you
I
won't
have
to
do
Occlumency
lessons
with
Snape
will
I
professor
Snape
Harry
and
no
you
will
not
good
said
Harry
in
relief
because
they
were
a
he
stopped
careful
not
to
say
what
he
really
thought
i
think
the
word
fiasco
would
be
a
good
one
here
said
Dumbledore
nodding
harry
laughed
well
that
means
I
won't
see
much
of
Professor
Snape
from
now
on
he
said
because
he
won't
let
me
carry
on
Potions
unless
I
get
Outstanding
in
my
owl
which
I
know
I
haven't
don't
count
your
owls
before
they
are
delivered
said
Dumbledore
gravely
which
now
I
think
of
it
ought
to
be
some
time
later
today
now
two
more
things
Harry
before
we
part
firstly
I
wish
you
to
keep
your
Invisibility
Cloak
with
you
at
all
i
imes
from
this
moment
onward
even
within
Hogwarts
itself
just
in
case
you
understand
me
harry
nodded
and
lastly
while
you
stay
here
the
Burrow
has
been
given
the
highest
security
the
Ministry
of
Magic
can
provide
these
measures
have
caused
a
certain
amount
of
inconvenience
to
Arthur
and
Molly
all
their
post
for
instance
is
being
searched
at
the
Ministry
before
being
sent
on
they
do
not
mind
in
the
slightest
for
their
only
concern
is
your
safety
however
it
would
be
poor
repayment
if
you
risked
your
neck
while
staying
with
them
i
understand
said
Harry
quickly
very
well
then
said
Dumbledore
pushing
open
the
broom
shed
door
and
stepping
out
into
the
yard
i
see
a
light
in
the
kitchen
let
us
not
deprive
Molly
any
longer
of
the
chance
to
deplore
how
thin
you
are
chapter
An
Excess
Of
Phlegm
harry
and
Dumbledore
approached
the
back
door
of
the
Burrow
which
was
surrounded
by
the
familiar
litter
of
old
Wellington
boots
and
rusty
cauldrons
Harry
could
hear
the
soft
clucking
of
sleepy
chickens
coming
from
a
distant
shed
dumbledore
knocked
three
times
and
Harry
saw
sudden
movement
behind
the
kitchen
window
who's
there
said
a
nervous
voice
he
recognized
as
Mrs
weasley's
declare
yourself
it
is
I
Dumbledore
bringing
Harry
the
door
opened
at
once
there
stood
Mrs
weasley
short
plump
and
wearing
an
old
green
dressing
gown
harry
dear
gracious
Albus
you
gave
me
a
fright
you
said
not
to
expect
you
before
morning
we
were
lucky
said
Dumbledore
ushering
Harry
over
the
threshold
slughorn
proved
much
more
persuadable
than
I
had
expected
harry's
doing
of
course
ah
hello
Nymphadora
harry
looked
around
and
saw
that
Mrs
weasley
was
not
alone
despite
the
lateness
of
the
hour
a
young
witch
with
a
pale
heart-shaped
face
and
mousy
brown
hair
was
sitting
at
the
table
clutching
a
large
mug
between
her
hands
hello
Professor
she
said
wotcher
Harry
hi
Tonks
harry
thought
she
looked
drawn
even
ill
and
there
was
something
forced
in
her
smile
certainly
her
appearance
was
less
colorful
than
usual
without
her
customary
shade
of
bubble-gum-pink
hair
i'd
better
be
off
she
said
quickly
standing
up
and
pulling
her
cloak
around
her
shoulders
thanks
for
the
tea
and
sympathy
Molly
please
don't
leave
on
my
account
said
Dumbledore
courteously
I
cannot
stay
I
have
urgent
matters
to
discuss
with
Rufus
Scrimgeour
no
no
I
need
to
get
going
said
Tonks
not
meeting
dumbledore's
eyes
night
dear
why
not
come
to
dinner
at
the
weekend
Remus
and
Mad-Eye
are
coming
no
really
Molly
thanks
anyway
good
night
every-one
tonks
hurried
past
Dumbledore
and
Harry
into
the
yard
a
few
paces
beyond
the
doorstep
she
turned
on
the
spot
and
vanished
into
thin
air
harry
noticed
that
Mrs
weasley
looked
troubled
well
I
shall
see
you
at
Hogwarts
Harry
said
Dumbledore
take
care
of
yourself
molly
your
servant
he
made
Mrs
weasley
a
bow
and
followed
Tonks
vanishing
at
precisely
the
same
spot
mrs
weasley
closed
the
door
on
the
empty
yard
and
then
steered
Harry
by
the
shoulders
into
the
full
glow
of
the
lantern
on
the
table
to
examine
his
appearance
you're
like
Ron
she
sighed
looking
him
up
and
down
both
of
you
look
as
though
you've
had
Stretching
jinxes
put
on
you
i
swear
ron's
grown
four
inches
since
I
last
bought
him
school
robes
are
you
hungry
Harry
yeah
I
am
said
Harry
suddenly
realizing
just
how
hungry
he
was
sit
down
dear
i'll
knock
something
up
as
Harry
sat
down
a
furry
ginger
cat
with
a
squashed
face
lumped
onto
his
knees
and
settled
there
purring
so
hermione's
here
he
asked
happily
as
he
tickled
Crookshanks
behind
the
ears
oh
yes
she
arrived
the
day
before
yesterday
said
Mrs
weasley
rapping
a
large
iron
pot
with
her
wand
it
bounced
onto
the
stove
with
a
loud
clang
and
began
to
bubble
at
once
everyone's
in
bed
of
course
we
didn't
expect
you
for
hours
here
you
are
she
tapped
the
pot
again
it
rose
into
the
air
flew
toward
Harry
and
tipped
over
Mrs
weasley
slid
a
bowl
nearly
beneath
it
just
in
lime
to
catch
the
stream
of
thick
steaming
onion
soup
bread
dear
thanks
Mrs
weasley
she
waved
her
wand
over
her
shoulder
a
loaf
of
bread
and
a
knife
soared
gracefully
onto
the
table
as
the
loaf
sliced
itself
and
the
soup
pot
dropped
back
onto
the
stove
Mrs
weasley
sat
down
opposite
him
so
you
persuaded
Horace
Slughorn
to
take
the
job
harry
nodded
his
mouth
so
full
of
hot
soup
that
he
could
not
speak
he
taught
Arthur
and
me
said
Mrs
weasley
he
was
at
hog-warts
for
ages
started
around
the
same
time
as
Dumbledore
I
think
did
you
like
him
his
mouth
now
full
of
bread
Harry
shrugged
and
gave
a
noncommittal
jerk
of
the
head
i
know
what
you
mean
said
Mrs
weasley
nodding
wisely
of
course
he
can
be
charming
when
he
wants
to
be
but
arthur's
never
liked
him
much
the
ministry's
littered
with
slughorn's
old
favorites
he
was
always
good
at
giving
leg
ups
but
he
never
had
much
time
for
Arthur
didn't
seem
to
think
he
was
enough
of
a
highflier
well
that
just
shows
you
even
Slughorn
makes
mistakes
i
don't
know
whether
ron's
told
you
in
any
of
his
letters
it's
only
just
happened
but
arthur's
been
promoted
it
could
not
have
been
clearer
that
Mrs
weasley
had
been
bursting
to
say
this
harry
swallowed
a
large
amount
of
very
hot
soup
and
thought
he
could
feel
his
throat
blistering
that's
great
he
gasped
you
are
sweet
beamed
Mrs
weasley
possibly
taking
his
watering
eyes
for
emotion
at
the
news
yes
Rufus
Scrimgeour
has
set
up
several
new
offices
in
response
to
the
present
situation
and
arthur's
heading
the
Office
for
the
Detection
and
Confiscation
of
Counterfeit
Defensive
Spells
and
Protective
Objects
it's
a
big
job
he's
got
ten
people
reporting
to
him
now
what
exactly
well
you
see
in
all
the
panic
about
You-Know-Who
odd
things
have
been
cropping
up
for
sale
everywhere
things
that
are
supposed
to
guard
against
You-Know-Who
and
the
Death
Eaters
you
can
imagine
the
kind
of
thing
so-called
protective
potions
that
are
really
gravy
with
a
bit
of
bubotuber
pus
added
or
instructions
for
defensive
jinxes
that
actually
make
your
ears
fall
off
well
in
the
main
the
perpetrators
are
just
people
like
Mundungus
Hotelier
who've
never
done
an
honest
day's
work
in
their
lives
and
are
taking
advantage
of
how
frightened
everybody
is
but
every
now
and
then
something
really
nasty
turns
up
the
other
day
Arthur
confiscated
a
box
of
cursed
Sneakoscopes
that
were
almost
certainly
planted
by
a
Death
Eater
so
you
see
it's
a
very
important
job
and
I
tell
him
it's
just
silly
to
miss
dealing
with
spark
plugs
and
toasters
and
all
the
rest
of
that
Muggle
rubbish
mrs
weasley
ended
her
speech
with
a
stern
look
as
if
it
had
been
Harry
suggesting
that
it
was
natural
to
miss
spark
plugs
is
mr.
Weasley
still
at
work
harry
asked
yes
he
is
as
a
matter
of
fact
he's
a
tiny
bit
late
he
said
he'd
be
back
around
midnight
she
turned
to
look
at
a
large
clock
that
was
perched
awkwardly
on
top
of
a
pile
of
sheets
in
the
washing
basket
at
the
end
of
the
table
harry
recognized
it
at
once
It
had
nine
hands
each
inscribed
with
the
name
of
a
family
member
and
usually
hung
on
i
he
Weasleys
sitting
room
wall
though
its
current
position
suggested
that
Mrs
weasley
had
taken
to
carrying
it
around
the
house
with
her
every
single
one
of
its
nine
hands
was
now
pointing
at
mortal
peril
it's
been
like
that
for
a
while
now
said
Mrs
weasley
in
an
un-convincingly
casual
voice
ever
since
You-Know-Who
came
back
into
the
open
i
suppose
everybody's
in
mortal
danger
now
i
don't
think
it
can
be
just
our
family
but
I
don't
know
anyone
else
who's
got
a
clock
like
this
so
I
can't
check
oh
with
a
sudden
exclamation
she
pointed
at
the
clock's
face
mr.
weasley's
hand
had
switched
to
traveling
he's
coming
and
sure
enough
a
moment
later
there
was
a
knock
on
the
back
door
mrs
weasley
jumped
up
and
hurried
to
it
with
one
hand
on
the
doorknob
and
her
face
pressed
against
the
wood
she
called
softly
Arthur
is
that
you
yes
came
mr.
weasley's
weary
voice
but
I
would
say
that
even
if
I
were
a
Death
Eater
dear
ask
the
question
oh
honestly
molly
all
right
all
right
what
is
your
dearest
ambition
to
find
out
how
airplanes
stay
up
mrs
weasley
nodded
and
turned
the
doorknob
but
apparently
mr.
Weasley
was
holding
tight
to
it
on
the
other
side
because
the
door
remained
firmly
shut
molly
i've
got
to
ask
you
your
question
first
arthur
really
this
is
just
silly
what
do
you
like
me
to
call
you
when
we're
alone
together
even
by
the
dim
light
of
the
lantern
Harry
could
tell
that
Mrs
weasley
had
turned
bright
red
he
himself
felt
suddenly
warm
around
the
ears
and
neck
and
hastily
gulped
soup
clattering
his
spoon
as
loudly
as
he
could
against
the
bowl
mollywobbles
whispered
a
mortified
Mrs
weasley
into
the
crack
at
the
edge
of
the
door
correct
said
mr.
Weasley
now
you
can
let
me
in
mrs
weasley
opened
the
door
to
reveal
her
husband
a
thin
balding
red-haired
wizard
wearing
horn-rimmed
spectacles
and
a
long
and
dusty
traveling
cloak
i
still
don't
see
why
we
have
to
go
through
that
every
time
you
come
home
said
Mrs
weasley
still
pink
in
the
face
as
she
helped
her
husband
out
of
his
cloak
i
mean
a
Death
Eater
might
have
forced
the
answer
out
of
you
before
impersonating
you
i
know
dear
but
it's
Ministry
procedure
and
I
have
to
set
an
example
something
smells
good
onion
soup
mr.
Weasley
turned
hopefully
in
the
direction
of
the
table
harry
we
didn't
expect
you
until
morning
they
shook
hands
and
mr.
Weasley
dropped
into
the
chair
beside
Harry
as
Mrs
weasley
set
a
bowl
of
soup
in
front
of
him
too
thanks
Molly
it's
been
a
tough
night
some
idiot's
started
selling
Metamorph-Medals
just
sling
them
around
your
neck
and
you'll
be
able
to
change
your
appearance
at
will
a
hundred
thousand
disguises
all
for
ten
Galleons
and
what
really
happens
when
you
put
them
on
mostly
you
just
turn
a
fairly
unpleasant
orange
color
but
a
couple
of
people
have
also
sprouted
tentacle
like
warts
all
over
their
bodies
as
if
st.
mungo's
didn't
have
enough
to
do
already
it
sounds
like
the
sort
of
thing
Fred
and
George
would
find
funny
said
Mrs
weasley
hesitantly
are
you
sure
of
course
I
am
said
mr.
Weasley
the
boys
wouldn't
do
anything
like
that
now
not
when
people
are
desperate
for
protection
so
is
that
why
you're
late
Metamorph-Medals
no
we
got
wind
of
a
nasty
backfiring
jinx
down
in
Elephant
and
Castle
but
luckily
the
Magical
Law
Enforcement
Squad
had
sorted
it
out
by
the
time
we
got
there
harry
stifled
a
yawn
behind
his
hand
bed
said
an
undeceived
Mrs
weasley
at
once
i've
got
Fred
and
george's
room
all
ready
for
you
you'll
have
it
to
yourself
why
where
are
they
oh
they're
in
Diagon
Alley
sleeping
in
the
little
flat
over
their
joke
shop
as
they're
so
busy
said
Mrs
weasley
i
must
say
I
didn't
approve
at
first
but
they
do
seem
to
have
a
bit
of
a
flair
for
business
come
on
dear
your
trunks
already
up
there
night
mr.
Weasley
said
Harry
pushing
back
his
chair
crookshanks
leapt
lightly
from
his
lap
and
slunk
out
of
the
room
g'night
Harry
said
mr.
Weasley
harry
saw
Mrs
weasley
glance
at
the
clock
in
the
washing
basket
as
they
left
the
kitchen
all
the
hands
were
once
again
at
mortal
peril
fred
and
george's
bedroom
was
on
the
second
floor
mrs
weasley
pointed
her
wand
at
a
lamp
on
the
bedside
table
and
it
ignited
at
once
bathing
the
room
in
a
pleasant
golden
glow
though
a
large
vase
of
flowers
had
been
placed
on
a
desk
in
front
of
the
small
window
their
perfume
could
not
disguise
the
lingering
smell
of
what
Harry
thought
was
gunpowder
a
considerable
amount
of
floor
space
was
devoted
to
a
vast
number
of
unmarked
sealed
cardboard
boxes
amongst
which
stood
harry's
school
trunk
the
room
looked
as
though
it
was
being
used
as
a
temporary
warehouse
hedwig
hooted
happily
at
Harry
from
her
perch
on
top
of
a
large
wardrobe
then
took
off
through
the
window
Harry
knew
she
had
been
waiting
to
see
him
before
going
hunting
harry
bade
Mrs
weasley
good
night
put
on
pajamas
and
got
into
one
of
the
beds
there
was
something
hard
inside
the
pillowcase
he
groped
inside
it
and
pulled
out
a
sticky
purple-and-orange
sweet
which
he
recognized
as
a
Puking
Pastille
smiling
to
himself
he
rolled
over
and
was
instantly
asleep
seconds
later
or
so
it
seemed
to
Harry
he
was
awakened
by
what
sounded
like
cannon
fire
as
the
door
burst
open
sitting
bolt
upright
he
heard
the
rasp
of
the
curtains
being
pulled
back
The
dazzling
sunlight
seemed
to
poke
him
hard
in
both
eyes
shielding
them
with
one
hand
he
groped
hopelessly
for
his
glasses
with
the
other
wuzzgoinon
we
didn't
know
you
were
here
already
said
a
loud
and
excited
voice
and
he
received
a
sharp
blow
to
the
top
of
the
head
ron
don't
hit
him
said
a
girl's
voice
reproachfully
harry's
hand
found
his
glasses
and
he
shoved
them
on
though
I
he
light
was
so
bright
he
could
hardly
see
anyway
a
long
looming
shadow
quivered
in
front
of
him
for
a
moment
he
blinked
and
Ron
Weasley
came
into
focus
grinning
down
at
him
all
right
never
been
better
said
Harry
rubbing
the
top
of
his
head
and
slumping
back
onto
his
pillows
you
not
bad
said
Ron
pulling
over
a
cardboard
box
and
sitting
on
it
when
did
you
get
here
mum's
only
just
told
us
about
one
o'clock
this
morning
were
the
Muggles
all
right
did
they
treat
you
okay
same
as
usual
said
Harry
as
Hermione
perched
herself
on
the
edge
of
his
bed
they
didn't
talk
to
me
much
but
I
like
it
better
that
way
how're
you
Hermione
oh
i'm
fine
said
Hermione
who
was
scrutinizing
Harry
as
though
he
was
sickening
for
something
he
thought
he
knew
what
was
behind
this
and
as
he
had
no
wish
to
discuss
sirius's
death
or
any
other
miserable
subject
at
the
moment
he
said
what's
the
time
have
I
missed
breakfast
don't
worry
about
that
mum's
bringing
you
up
a
tray
she
reckons
you
look
underfed
said
Ron
rolling
his
eyes
so
what's
been
going
on
nothing
much
i've
just
been
stuck
at
my
aunt
and
uncle's
haven't
I
come
off
it
said
Ron
you've
been
off
with
Dumbledore
it
wasn't
that
exciting
he
just
wanted
me
to
help
him
persuade
this
old
teacher
to
come
out
of
retirement
his
name's
Horace
Slughorn
oh
said
Ron
looking
disappointed
we
thought
hermione
flashed
a
warning
look
at
Ron
and
Ron
changed
tack
at
top
speed
we
thought
it'd
be
something
like
that
you
did
said
Harry
amused
yeah
yeah
now
Umbridge
has
left
obviously
we
need
a
new
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
teacher
don't
we
so
er
what's
he
like
he
looks
a
bit
like
a
walrus
and
he
used
to
be
Head
of
Slytherin
said
Harry
something
wrong
Hermione
she
was
watching
him
as
though
expecting
strange
symptoms
to
manifest
themselves
at
any
moment
she
rearranged
her
features
hastily
in
an
unconvincing
smile
no
of
course
not
so
um
did
Slughorn
seem
like
he'll
be
a
good
teacher
dunno
said
Harry
he
can't
be
worse
than
Umbridge
can
he
i
know
someone
who's
worse
than
Umbridge
said
a
voice
from
the
doorway
ron's
younger
sister
slouched
into
the
room
looking
irritable
hi
Harry
what's
up
with
you
ron
asked
it's
her
said
Ginny
plonking
herself
down
on
harry's
bed
she's
driving
me
mad
what's
she
done
now
asked
Hermione
sympathetically
it's
the
way
she
talks
to
me
you'd
think
I
was
about
three
i
know
said
Hermione
dropping
her
voice
she's
so
full
of
herself
harry
was
astonished
to
hear
Hermione
talking
about
Mrs
weasley
like
this
and
could
not
blame
Ron
for
saying
angrily
can't
you
two
lay
off
her
for
five
seconds
oh
that's
right
defend
her
snapped
Ginny
we
all
know
you
can't
get
enough
of
her
this
seemed
an
odd
comment
to
make
about
ron's
mother
starting
to
feel
that
he
was
missing
something
Harry
said
Who
are
you
but
his
question
was
answered
before
he
could
finish
it
the
bedroom
door
flew
open
again
and
Harry
instinctively
yanked
the
bedcovers
up
to
his
chin
so
hard
that
Hermione
and
Ginny
slid
off
the
bed
onto
the
floor
a
young
woman
was
standing
in
the
doorway
a
woman
of
such
breathtaking
beauty
that
the
room
seemed
to
have
become
strangely
airless
she
was
tall
and
willowy
with
long
blonde
hair
and
appeared
to
emanate
a
faint
silvery
glow
to
complete
this
vision
of
perfection
she
was
carrying
a
heavily
laden
breakfast
tray
arry
she
said
in
a
throaty
voice
eet
as
been
too
long
as
she
swept
over
the
threshold
toward
him
Mrs
weasley
was
revealed
bobbing
along
in
her
wake
looking
rather
cross
there
was
no
need
to
bring
up
the
tray
I
was
just
about
to
do
it
myself
eet
was
no
trouble
said
Fleur
Delacour
setting
the
tray
across
harry's
knees
and
then
swooping
to
kiss
him
on
each
cheek
He
felt
the
places
where
her
mouth
had
touched
him
burn
i
ave
been
longing
to
see
im
you
remember
my
seester
Gabrielle
she
never
stops
talking
about
Arry
Potter
she
will
be
delighted
to
see
you
again
oh

she
here
too
harry
croaked
no
no
silly
boy
said
Fleur
with
a
tinkling
laugh
I
mean
next
summer
when
we
but
do
you
not
know
her
great
blue
eyes
widened
and
she
looked
reproachfully
at
Mrs
weasley
who
said
We
hadn't
got
around
to
telling
him
yet
fleur
turned
back
to
Harry
swinging
her
silvery
sheet
of
hair
so
that
it
whipped
Mrs
weasley
across
the
face
bill
and
I
are
going
to
be
married
oh
said
Harry
blankly
he
could
not
help
noticing
how
Mrs
weasley
Hermione
and
Ginny
were
all
determinedly
avoiding
one
another's
gaze
wow
er
congratulations
she
swooped
down
upon
him
and
kissed
him
again
bill
is
very
busy
at
ze
moment
working
very
ard
and
I
only
work
part-time
at
Gringotts
for
my
Eenglish
so
he
brought
me
ere
for
a
few
days
to
get
to
know
is
family
properly
i
was
so
pleased
to
ear
you
would
be
coming
zere
isn't
much
to
do
ere
unless
you
like
cooking
and
chickens
well
enjoy
your
breakfast
Arry
with
these
words
she
turned
gracefully
and
seemed
to
float
out
of
the
room
closing
the
door
quietly
behind
her
mrs
weasley
made
a
noise
that
sounded
like
tchah
mum
hates
her
said
Ginny
quietly
i
do
not
hate
her
said
Mrs
weasley
in
a
cross
whisper
i
just
think
they've
hurried
into
this
engagement
that's
all
they've
known
each
other
a
year
said
Ron
who
looked
oddly
groggy
and
was
staring
at
the
closed
door
well
that's
not
very
long
i
know
why
it's
happened
of
course
its
all
this
uncertainty
with
You-Know-Who
coming
back
people
think
they
might
be
dead
tomorrow
so
they're
rushing
all
sorts
of
decisions
they'd
normally
take
time
over
it
was
the
same
last
time
he
was
powerful
people
eloping
left
right
and
center
including
you
and
Dad
said
Ginny
slyly
yes
well
your
father
and
I
were
made
for
each
other
what
was
the
point
in
waiting
said
Mrs
weasley
whereas
Bill
and
Fleur
well
what
have
they
really
got
in
common
he's
a
hardworking
down-to-earth
sort
of
person
whereas
she's
a
cow
said
Ginny
nodding
but
bill's
not
that
down-to-earth
he's
a
Curse-Breaker
isn't
he
he
likes
a
bit
of
adventure
a
bit
of
glamour
i
expect
that's
why
he's
gone
for
Phlegm
stop
calling
her
that
Ginny
said
Mrs
weasley
sharply
as
Harry
and
Hermione
laughed
well
i'd
better
get
on
eat
your
eggs
while
they're
warm
Harry
looking
careworn
she
left
the
room
ron
still
seemed
slightly
punch-drunk
he
was
shaking
his
head
experimentally
like
a
dog
trying
to
rid
its
ears
of
water
don't
you
get
used
to
her
if
she's
staying
in
the
same
house
harry
asked
well
you
do
said
Ron
but
if
she
jumps
out
at
you
unexpectedly
like
then
it's
pathetic
said
Hermione
furiously
striding
away
from
Ron
as
far
as
she
could
go
and
turning
to
face
him
with
her
arms
folded
once
she
had
reached
the
wall
you
don't
really
want
her
around
forever
ginny
asked
Ron
incredulously
when
he
merely
shrugged
she
said
Well
mum's
going
to
put
a
stop
to
it
if
she
can
I
bet
you
anything
how's
she
going
to
manage
that
asked
Harry
she
keeps
trying
to
get
Tonks
round
for
dinner
i
think
she's
hoping
Bill
will
fall
for
Tonks
instead
i
hope
he
does
i'd
much
rather
have
her
in
the
family
yeah
that'll
work
said
Ron
sarcastically
listen
no
bloke
in
his
right
mind's
going
to
fancy
Tonks
when
fleur's
around
i
mean
Tonks
is
okay-looking
when
she
isn't
doing
stupid
things
to
her
hair
and
her
nose
but
she's
a
damn
sight
nicer
than
Phlegm
said
Ginny
and
she's
more
intelligent
she's
an
Auror
said
Hermione
from
the
corner
fleur's
not
stupid
she
was
good
enough
to
enter
the
Triwizard
Tournament
said
Harry
not
you
as
well
said
Hermione
bitterly
i
suppose
you
like
the
way
Phlegm
says
Any
do
you
asked
Ginny
scornfully
no
said
Harry
wishing
he
hadn't
spoken
I
was
just
saying
Phlegm
i
mean
Fleur
i'd
much
rather
have
Tonks
in
the
family
said
Ginny
at
least
she's
a
laugh
she
hasn't
been
much
of
a
laugh
lately
said
Ron
every
time
i've
seen
her
she's
looked
more
like
Moaning
Myrtle
that's
not
fair
snapped
Hermione
she
still
hasn't
got
over
what
happened
you
know
i
mean
he
was
her
cousin
harry's
heart
sank
they
had
arrived
at
Sirius
he
picked
up
a
fork
and
began
shoveling
scrambled
eggs
into
his
mouth
hoping
to
deflect
any
invitation
to
join
in
this
part
of
the
conversation
tonks
and
Sirius
barely
knew
each
other
said
Ron
sirius
was
in
Azkaban
half
her
life
and
before
that
their
families
never
met
that's
not
the
point
said
Hermione
she
thinks
it
was
her
limit
he
died
how
does
she
work
that
one
out
asked
Harry
in
spite
of
himself
well
she
was
fighting
Bellatrix
Lestrange
wasn't
she
i
think
she
feels
that
if
only
she
had
finished
her
off
Bellatrix
couldn't
have
killed
Sirius
that's
stupid
said
Ron
it's
survivor's
guilt
said
Hermione
i
know
lupin's
tried
to
talk
her
round
but
she's
still
really
down
she's
actually
having
trouble
with
her
Metamorphosing
with
her
she
can't
change
her
appearance
like
she
used
to
explained
Hermione
i
think
her
powers
must
have
been
affected
by
shock
or
something
i
didn't
know
that
could
happen
said
Harry
nor
did
I
said
Hermione
but
I
suppose
if
you're
really
depressed
the
door
opened
again
and
Mrs
weasley
popped
her
head
in
ginny
she
whispered
come
downstairs
and
help
me
with
the
lunch
i'm
talking
to
this
lot
said
Ginny
outraged
now
said
Mrs
weasley
and
withdrew
she
only
wants
me
there
so
she
doesn't
have
to
be
alone
with
Phlegm
said
Ginny
crossly
she
swung
her
long
red
hair
around
in
a
very
good
imitation
of
Fleur
and
pranced
across
the
room
with
her
arms
held
aloft
like
a
ballerina
you
lot
had
better
come
down
quickly
too
she
said
as
she
left
harry
took
advantage
of
the
temporary
silence
to
eat
more
breakfast
hermione
was
peering
into
Fred
and
george's
boxes
though
every
now
and
then
she
cast
sideways
looks
at
Harry
ron
who
was
now
helping
himself
to
Harry
s
toast
was
still
gazing
dreamily
at
the
door
what's
this
hermione
asked
eventually
holding
up
what
looked
like
a
small
telescope
dunno
said
Ron
but
if
Fred
and
George
left
it
here
it's
probably
not
ready
for
the
joke
shop
yet
so
be
careful
your
mum
said
the
shop's
going
well
said
Harry
said
Fred
and
George
have
got
a
real
flair
for
business
that's
an
understatement
said
Ron
they're
raking
in
the
Galleons
i
can't
wait
to
see
the
place
we
haven't
been
to
Diagon
Alley
yet
because
Mum
says
dad's
got
to
be
there
for
extra
security
and
he's
been
really
busy
at
work
but
it
sounds
excellent
and
what
about
Percy
asked
Harry
the
third-eldest
Weasley
brother
had
fallen
out
with
the
rest
of
the
family
is
he
talking
to
your
mum
and
dad
again
nope
said
Ron
but
he
knows
your
dad
was
right
all
along
now
about
Voldemort
being
back
dumbledore
says
people
find
it
far
easier
to
forgive
others
for
being
wrong
than
being
right
said
Hermione
i
heard
him
telling
your
mum
Ron
sounds
like
the
sort
of
mental
thing
Dumbledore
would
say
said
Ron
he's
going
to
be
giving
me
private
lessons
this
year
said
Harry
conversationally
ron
choked
on
his
bit
of
toast
and
Hermione
gasped
you
kept
that
quiet
said
Ron
i
only
just
remembered
said
Harry
honestly
he
told
me
last
night
in
your
broom
shed
blimey
private
lessons
with
Dumbledore
said
Ron
looking
impressed
i
wonder
why
he's
his
voice
tailed
away
harry
saw
him
and
Hermione
exchange
looks
harry
laid
down
his
knife
and
fork
his
heart
beating
rather
fast
considering
that
all
he
was
doing
was
sitting
in
bed
dumbledore
had
said
to
do
it
why
not
now
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
his
fork
which
was
gleaming
in
the
sunlight
streaming
into
his
lap
and
said
I
don't
know
exactly
why
he's
going
to
be
giving
me
lessons
but
I
think
it
must
be
because
of
the
prophecy
neither
Ron
nor
Hermione
spoke
harry
had
the
impression
that
both
had
frozen
he
continued
still
speaking
to
his
fork
You
know
the
one
they
were
trying
to
steal
at
the
Ministry
nobody
knows
what
it
said
though
said
Hermione
quickly
it
got
smashed
although
the
Prophet
says
began
Ron
but
Hermione
said
Shh
the
prophet's
got
it
right
said
Harry
looking
up
at
them
both
with
a
great
effort
Hermione
seemed
frightened
and
Ron
amazed
that
glass
ball
that
smashed
wasn't
the
only
record
of
the
prophecy
i
heard
the
whole
thing
in
dumbledore's
office
he
was
the
one
the
prophecy
was
made
to
so
he
could
tell
me
from
what
it
said
Harry
took
a
deep
breath
it
looks
like
i'm
the
one
who's
got
to
finish
off
Voldemort
at
least
it
said
neither
of
us
could
live
while
the
other
survives
the
three
of
them
gazed
at
one
another
in
silence
for
a
moment
then
there
was
a
loud
bang
and
Hermione
vanished
behind
a
puff
of
black
smoke
hermione
shouted
Harry
and
Ron
the
breakfast
tray
slid
to
the
floor
with
a
crash
hermione
emerged
coughing
out
of
the
smoke
clutching
the
telescope
and
sporting
a
brilliantly
purple
black
eye
i
squeezed
it
and
it
it
punched
me
she
gasped
and
sure
enough
they
now
saw
a
tiny
fist
on
a
long
spring
protruding
from
the
end
of
the
telescope
don't
worry
said
Ron
who
was
plainly
trying
not
to
laugh
mum'll
fix
that
she's
good
at
healing
minor
injuries
oh
well
never
mind
that
now
said
Hermione
hastily
harry
oh
Harry
she
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
his
bed
again
we
wondered
after
we
got
back
from
the
Ministry
obviously
we
didn't
want
to
say
anything
to
you
but
from
what
Lucius
Malfoy
said
about
the
prophecy
how
it
was
about
you
and
Voldemort
well
we
thought
it
might
be
something
like
this
oh
Harry
she
stared
at
him
then
whispered
Are
you
scared
not
as
much
as
I
was
said
Harry
when
I
first
heard
it
I
was
but
now
it
seems
as
though
I
always
knew
i'd
have
to
face
him
in
the
end
when
we
heard
Dumbledore
was
collecting
you
in
person
we
thought
he
might
be
telling
you
something
or
showing
you
something
to
do
with
the
prophecy
said
Ron
eagerly
and
we
were
kind
of
right
weren't
we
he
wouldn't
be
giving
you
lessons
if
he
thought
you
were
a
goner
wouldn't
waste
his
time
he
must
think
you've
got
a
chance
that's
true
said
Hermione
i
wonder
what
he'll
teach
you
Harry
really
advanced
defensive
magic
probably
powerful
countercurses
anti-jinxes
harry
did
not
really
listen
a
warmth
was
spreading
through
him
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
sunlight
a
tight
obstruction
in
his
chest
seemed
to
be
dissolving
he
knew
that
Ron
and
Hermione
were
more
shocked
than
they
were
letting
on
but
the
mere
fact
that
they
were
still
there
on
either
side
of
him
speaking
bracing
words
of
comfort
not
shrinking
from
him
as
though
he
were
contaminated
or
dangerous
was
worth
more
than
he
could
ever
tell
them
and
evasive
enchantments
generally
concluded
Hermione
well
at
least
you
know
one
lesson
you'll
be
having
this
year
that's
one
more
than
Ron
and
me
i
wonder
when
our
owl
results
will
come
cant
be
long
now
it's
been
a
month
said
Ron
hang
on
said
Harry
as
another
part
of
last
night's
conversation
came
back
to
him
i
think
Dumbledore
said
our
owl
results
would
be
arriving
today
today
shrieked
Hermione
today
but
why
didn't
you
oh
my
God
you
should
have
said
she
leapt
to
her
feet
i'm
going
to
see
whether
any
owls
have
come
but
when
Harry
arrived
downstairs
ten
minutes
later
fully
dressed
and
carrying
his
empty
breakfast
tray
it
was
to
find
Hermione
sitting
at
the
kitchen
table
in
great
agitation
while
Mrs
weasley
tried
to
lessen
her
resemblance
to
half
a
panda
it
just
won't
budge
Mrs
weasley
was
saying
anxiously
standing
over
Hermione
with
her
wand
in
her
hand
and
a
copy
of
The
healer's
Helpmate
open
at
Bruises
Cuts
and
Abrasions
this
has
always
worked
before
I
just
can't
understand
it
it'll
be
Fred
and
george's
idea
of
a
funny
joke
making
sure
it
can't
come
off
said
Ginny
but
it's
got
to
come
off
squeaked
Hermione
i
can't
go
around
looking
like
this
forever
you
won't
dear
we'll
find
an
antidote
don't
worry
said
Mrs
weasley
soothingly
bill
told
me
W
Fred
and
George
are
very
amusing
said
Fleur
smiling
serenely
yes
I
can
hardly
breathe
for
laughing
snapped
Hermione
she
jumped
up
and
started
walking
round
and
round
the
kitchen
twisting
her
fingers
together
mrs
weasley
you're
quite
quite
sure
no
owls
have
arrived
this
morning
yes
dear
i'd
have
noticed
said
Mrs
weasley
patiently
but
it's
barely
nine
there's
still
plenty
of
time
i
know
I
messed
up
Ancient
Runes
muttered
Hermione
feverishly
I
definitely
made
at
least
one
serious
mistranslation
and
the
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
practical
was
no
good
at
all
i
thought
Transfiguration
went
all
right
at
the
time
but
looking
back
hermione
will
you
shut
up
you're
not
the
only
one
who's
nervous
barked
Ron
and
when
you've
got
your
eleven
Outstanding
OWLs
don't
don't
don't
said
Hermione
flapping
her
hands
hysterically
i
know
i've
failed
everything
what
happens
if
we
fail
harry
asked
the
room
at
large
but
it
was
again
Hermione
who
answered
we
discuss
our
options
with
our
Head
of
House
I
asked
Professor
McGonagall
at
the
end
of
last
term
harry's
stomach
squirmed
he
wished
he
had
eaten
less
breakfast
at
Beauxbatons
said
Fleur
complacently
we
ad
a
different
way
of
doing
things
i
think
eet
was
better
we
sat
our
examinations
after
six
years
of
study
not
five
and
then
fleur's
words
were
drowned
in
a
scream
hermione
was
pointing
through
the
kitchen
window
three
black
specks
were
clearly
visible
in
the
sky
growing
larger
all
the
time
they're
definitely
owls
said
Ron
hoarsely
jumping
up
to
join
Hermione
at
the
window
and
there
are
three
of
them
said
Harry
hastening
to
her
other
side
one
for
each
of
us
said
Hermione
in
a
terrified
whisper
oh
no
oh
no
oh
no
she
gripped
both
Harry
and
Ron
tightly
around
the
elbows
the
owls
were
flying
directly
at
the
Burrow
three
handsome
tawnies
each
of
which
it
became
clear
as
they
flew
lower
over
the
path
leading
up
to
the
house
was
carrying
a
large
square
envelope
oh
no
squealed
Hermione
mrs
weasley
squeezed
past
them
and
opened
the
kitchen
window
one
two
three
the
owls
soared
through
it
and
landed
on
the
table
in
a
neat
line
all
three
of
them
lifted
their
right
legs
harry
moved
forward
the
letter
addressed
to
him
was
tied
to
the
leg
of
the
owl
in
the
middle
he
untied
it
with
fumbling
fingers
to
his
left
Ron
was
trying
to
detach
his
own
results
to
his

harry
read
the
parchment
through
several
times
his
breathing
becoming
easier
with
each
reading
it
was
all
right
He
had
always
known
that
he
would
fail
Divination
and
he
had
had
no
chance
of
passing
History
of
Magic
given
that
he
had
collapsed
halfway
through
the
examination
but
he
had
passed
everything
else
he
ran
his
finger
down
the
grades
he
had
passed
well
in
Transfiguration
and
Herbology
he
had
even
exceeded
expectations
at

best
of
all
he
had
achieved
Outstanding

he
looked
around

had
her

to

bent
but
Ron
was
looking
delighted
only
failed
Divination

and
who

about
them
he
said
happily
to
Harry

harry
glanced
down
ron's
grades
There
were
no

there
knew
you'd
be

said
Ron
punching
Harry
on
the
shoulder
we've
done
all
right
haven't
we
well
done
said
Mrs

proudly
ruffling
ron's
hair

tentatively
for

still
hadn't

how

said
Hermione
in
a
small
voice
oh
come
off

said
Ron
striding
over
to
her
and
whipping
her

out
of
her

yep

half-amused
half-exasperated

hermione
shook
her
head
but
Harry
laughed

grinned
Ron

there
any
more

harry
looked
back
down
at
his
results
they
were
as
good
as
he
could
have
hoped
for
he
felt
just
one
tiny
twinge
of
regret
this
was
the
end
of
his
ambition
to
become
an
Auror
he
had
not
secured
the
required
Potions
grade
he
had
known
all
along
that
he
wouldn't
but
he
still
felt
a
sinking
in
his
stomach
as
he
looked
again
at
that
small
black
E
it
was
odd
really
seeing
that
it
had
been
a
Death
Eater
in
disguise
who
had
first
told
Harry
he
would
make
a
good
Auror
but
somehow
the
idea
had
taken
hold
of
him
and
he
couldn't
really
think
of
anything
else
he
would
like
to
be
moreover
it
had
seemed
the
right
destiny
for
him
since
he
had
heard
the
prophecy
a
few
weeks
ago
neither
can
live
while
the
other
survives
wouldn't
he
be
living
up
to
the
prophecy
and
giving
himself
the
best
chance
of
survival
if
he
joined
those
highly
trained
wizards
whose
job
it
was
to
find
and
kill
Voldemort
chapter
draco's
Detour
harry
remained
within
the
confines
of
the
burrow's
garden
over
the
next
few
weeks
he
spent
most
of
his
days
playing
two-a-side
Quidditch
in
the
Weasleys
orchard
he
and
Hermione
against
Ron
and
Ginny
Hermione
was
dreadful
and
Ginny
good
so
they
were
reasonably
well
matched
and
his
evenings
eating
triple
helpings
of
everything
Mrs
weasley
put
in
front
of
him
it
would
have
been
a
happy
peaceful
holiday
had
it
not
been
for
the
stones
of
disappearances
odd
accidents
even
of
deaths
now
appearing
almost
daily
in
the
Prophet
sometimes
Bill
and
mr.
Weasley
brought
home
news
before
it
even
reached
the
paper
to
Mrs
weasleys
displeasure
harry's
sixteenth
birthday
celebrations
were
marred
by
grisly
tidings
brought
to
the
party
by
Remus
Lupin
who
was
looking
gaunt
and
grim
his
brown
hair
streaked
liberally
with
gray
his
clothes
more
ragged
and
patched
than
ever
there
have
been
another
couple
of
dementor
attacks
he
announced
as
Mrs
weasley
passed
him
a
large
slice
of
birthday
cake
and
they've
found
Igor
karkaroff's
body
in
a
shack
up
north
the
Dark
Mark
had
been
set
over
it
well
frankly
i'm
surprised
he
stayed
alive
for
even
a
year
after
deserting
the
Death
Eaters
sirius's
brother
Regulus
only
managed
a
few
days
as
far
as
I
can
remember
yes
well
said
Mrs
weasley
frowning
perhaps
we
should
talk
about
something
diff
did
you
hear
about
Florean
Fortescue
Remus
asked
Bill
who
was
being
plied
with
wine
by
Fleur
the
man
who
ran
is
the
ice-cream
place
in
Diagon
Alley
harry
interrupted
with
an
unpleasant
hollow
sensation
in
the
pit
of
his
stomach
he
used
to
give
me
free
ice
creams
what's
happened
to
him
dragged
off
by
the
look
of
his
place
why
asked
Ron
while
Mrs
weasley
pointedly
glared
at
Bill
who
knows
he
must've
upset
them
somehow
he
was
a
good
man
Florean
talking
of
Diagon
Alley
said
mr.
Weasley
looks
like
ollivander's
gone
too
the
wandmaker
said
Ginny
looking
startled
that's
the
one
shop's
empty
no
sign
of
a
struggle
no
one
knows
whether
he
left
voluntarily
or
was
kidnapped
but
what'll
people
do
for
wands
they'll
make
do
with
other
makers
said
Lupin
but
Ollivander
was
the
best
and
if
the
other
side
have
got
him
it's
not
so
good
for
us
the
day
after
this
rather
gloomy
birthday
tea
their
letters
and
booklists
arrived
from
Hogwarts
harry's
included
a
surprise
he
had
been
made
Quidditch
Captain
that
gives
you
equal
status
with
prefects
cried
Hermione
happily
you
can
use
our
special
bathroom
now
and
everything
wow
I
remember
when
Charlie
wore
one
of
these
said
Ron
examining
the
badge
with
glee
harry
this
is
so
cool
you're
my
Captain
if
you
let
me
back
on
the
team
I
suppose
ha
ha
well
I
don't
suppose
we
can
put
off
a
trip
to
Diagon
Alley
much
longer
now
you've
got
these
sighed
Mrs
weasley
looking
down
Ron
s
booklist
we'll
go
on
Saturday
as
long
as
your
father
doesn't
have
to
go
into
work
again
i'm
not
going
there
without
him
mum
d'you
honestly
think
you-know-who's
going
to
be
hiding
behind
a
bookshelf
in
Flourish
and
Blotts
sniggered
Ron
fortescue
and
Ollivander
went
on
holiday
did
they
said
Mrs
weasley
firing
up
at
once
if
you
think
security's
a
laughing
matter
you
can
stay
behind
and
i'll
get
your
things
myself
no
I
wanna
come
I
want
to
see
Fred
and
george's
shop
said
Ron
hastily
then
you
just
buck
up
your
ideas
young
man
before
I
decide
you're
too
immature
to
come
with
us
said
Mrs
weasley
angrily
snatching
up
her
clock
all
nine
hands
of
which
were
still
pointing
at
mortal
peril
and
balancing
it
on
top
of
a
pile
of
just-laundered
towels
and
that
goes
for
returning
to
Hogwarts
as
well
ron
turned
to
stare
incredulously
at
Harry
as
his
mother
hoisted
the
laundry
basket
and
the
teetering
clock
into
her
arms
and
stormed
out
of
the
room
blimey
you
can't
even
make
a
joke
round
here
anymore
but
Ron
was
careful
not
to
be
flippant
about
Voldemort
over
the
next
few
days
saturday
dawned
without
any
more
outbursts
from
Mrs
weasley
though
she
seemed
very
tense
at
breakfast
bill
who
would
be
staying
at
home
with
Fleur
much
to
Hermione
and
ginny's
pleasure
passed
a
full
money
bag
across
the
table
to
Harry
where's
mine
demanded
Ron
at
once
his
eyes
wide
that's
already
harry's
idiot
said
Bill
i
got
it
out
of
your
vault
for
you
Harry
because
it's
taking
about
five
hours
for
the
public
to
get
to
their
gold
at
the
moment
the
goblins
have
tightened
security
so
much
two
days
ago
arkie
Philpott
had
a
Probity
Probe
stuck
up
his
well
trust
me
this
way's
easier
thanks
Bill
said
Harry
pocketing
his
gold
e
is
always
so
thoughtful
purred
Fleur
adoringly
stroking
bill's
nose
ginny
mimed
vomiting
into
her
cereal
behind
Fleur
harry
choked
over
his
cornflakes
and
Ron
thumped
him
on
the
back
it
was
an
overcast
murky
day
one
of
the
special
Ministry
of
Magic
cars
in
which
Harry
had
ridden
once
before
was
awaiting
them
in
the
front
yard
when
they
emerged
from
the
house
pulling
on
their
cloaks
it's
good
Dad
can
get
us
these
again
said
Ron
appreciatively
stretching
luxuriously
as
the
car
moved
smoothly
away
from
the
Burrow
Bill
and
Fleur
waving
from
the
kitchen
window
he
Harry
Hermione
and
Ginny
were
all
sitting
in
roomy
comfort
in
the
wide
backseat
don't
get
used
to
it
it's
only
because
of
Harry
said
mr.
Weasley
over
his
shoulder
he
and
Mrs
weasley
were
in
front
with
the
Ministry
driver
the
front
passenger
seat
had
obligingly
stretched
into
what
resembled
a
two-seater
sofa
he's
been
given
top-grade
security
status
and
we'll
be
joining
up
with
additional
security
at
the
Leaky
Cauldron
too
harry
said
nothing
he
did
not
much
fancy
doing
his
shopping
while
surrounded
by
a
battalion
of
Aurors
he
had
stowed
his
Invisibility
Cloak
in
his
backpack
and
felt
that
if
that
was
good
enough
for
Dumbledore
it
ought
to
be
good
enough
for
the
Ministry
though
now
he
came
to
think
of
it
he
was
not
sure
the
Ministry
knew
about
his
cloak
here
you
are
then
said
the
driver
a
surprisingly
short
while
later
speaking
for
the
first
time
as
he
slowed
in
Charing
Cross
Road
and
stopped
outside
the
Leaky
Cauldron
i'm
to
wait
for
you
any
idea
how
long
you'll
be
a
couple
of
hours
I
expect
said
mr.
Weasley
ah
good
he's
here
harry
imitated
mr.
Weasley
and
peered
through
the
window
his
heart
leapt
there
were
no
Aurors
waiting
outside
the
inn
but
instead
the
gigantic
black-bearded
form
of
Rubeus
Hagrid
the
Hogwarts
gamekeeper
wearing
a
long
beaverskin
coat
beaming
at
the
sight
of
harry's
face
and
oblivious
to
the
startled
stares
of
passing
Muggles
harry
he
boomed
sweeping
Harry
into
a
bone-crushing
hug
the
moment
Harry
had
stepped
out
of
the
car
buckbeak
witherwings
I
mean
yeh
should
see
him
Harry
he's
so
happy
ter
be
back
in
the
open
air
glad
he's
pleased
said
Harry
grinning
as
he
massaged
his
ribs
we
didn't
know
security
meant
you
i
know
jus
like
old
times
innit
see
the
Ministry
wanted
ter
send
a
bunch
o
Aurors
but
Dumbledore
said
i'd
do
said
Hagrid
proudly
throwing
out
his
chest
and
tucking
his
thumbs
into
his
pockets
lets
get
goin
then
after
yeh
Molly
Arthur
the
Leaky
Cauldron
was
for
the
first
time
in
harry's
memory
completely
empty
only
Tom
the
landlord
wizened
and
toothless
remained
of
the
old
crowd
he
looked
up
hopefully
as
they
entered
but
before
he
could
speak
Hagrid
said
importantly
Jus
passin
through
today
Tom
sure
yeh
understand
Hogwarts
business
yeh
know
tom
nodded
gloomily
and
returned
to
wiping
glasses
Harry
Hermione
Hagrid
and
the
Weasleys
walked
through
the
bar
and
out
into
the
chilly
little
courtyard
at
the
back
where
the
dustbins
stood
hagrid
raised
his
pink
umbrella
and
rapped
a
certain
brick
in
the
wall
which
opened
at
once
to
form
an
archway
onto
a
winding
cobbled
street
they
stepped
through
the
entrance
and
paused
looking
around
diagon
Alley
had
changed
the
colorful
glittering
window
displays
of
spellbooks
potion
ingredients
and
cauldrons
were
lost
to
view
hidden
behind
the
large
Ministry
of
Magic
posters
that
had
been
pasted
over
them
most
of
these
somber
purple
posters
carried
blown-up
versions
of
the
security
advice
on
the
Ministry
pamphlets
that
had
been
sent
out
over
the
summer
but
others
bore
moving
black-and-white
photographs
of
Death
Eaters
known
to
be
on
the
loose
bellatrix
Lestrange
was
sneering
from
the
front
of
the
nearest
apothecary
a
few
windows
were
boarded
up
including
those
of
Florean
fortescue's
Ice
Cream
Parlor
on
the
other
hand
a
number
of
shabby-looking
stalls
had
sprung
up
along
the
street
the
nearest
one
which
had
been
erected
outside
Flourish
and
Blotts
under
a
striped
stained
awning
had
a
cardboard
sign
pinned
to
its
front
amulets
effective
Against
Werewolves
Dementors
and
Inferi
a
seedy-looking
little
wizard
was
rattling
armfuls
of
silver
symbols
on
chains
at
passersby
one
for
your
little
girl
madam
he
called
at
Mrs
weasley
as
they
passed
leering
at
Ginny
protect
her
pretty
neck
if
I
were
on
duty
said
mr.
Weasley
glaring
angrily
at
the
amulet
seller
yes
but
don't
go
arresting
anyone
now
dear
we're
in
a
hurry
said
Mrs
weasley
nervously
consulting
a
list
i
think
we'd
better
do
Madam
malkin's
first
Hermione
wants
new
dress
robes
and
ron's
showing
much
too
much
ankle
in
his
school
robes
and
you
must
need
new
ones
too
Harry
you've
grown
so
much
come
on
everyone
molly
it
doesn't
make
sense
for
all
of
us
to
go
to
Madam
malkin's
said
mr.
Weasley
why
don't
those
three
go
with
Hagrid
and
we
can
go
to
Flourish
and
Blotts
and
get
everyone's
school-books
i
don't
know
said
Mrs
weasley
anxiously
clearly
torn
between
a
desire
to
finish
the
shopping
quickly
and
the
wish
to
stick
together
in
a
pack
hagrid
do
you
think
don't
fret
they'll
be
fine
with
me
Molly
said
Hagrid
soothingly
waving
an
airy
hand
the
size
of
a
dustbin
lid
mrs
weasley
did
not
look
entirely
convinced
but
allowed
the
separation
scurrying
off
toward
Flourish
and
Blotts
with
her
husband
and
Ginny
while
Harry
Ron
Hermione
and
Hagrid
set
off
for
Madam
malkin's
harry
noticed
that
many
of
the
people
who
passed
them
had
the
same
harried
anxious
look
as
Mrs
weasley
and
that
nobody
was
stopping
to
talk
anymore
the
shoppers
stayed
together
in
their
own
tightly
knit
groups
moving
intently
about
their
business
nobody
seemed
to
be
shopping
alone
migh
be
a
bit
of
a
squeeze
in
there
with
all
of
us
said
Hagrid
stopping
outside
Madam
malkin's
and
bending
down
to
peer
through
the
window
i'll
stand
guard
outside
all
right
so
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
entered
the
little
shop
together
it
appeared
at
first
glance
to
be
empty
but
no
sooner
had
the
door
swung
shut
behind
them
than
they
heard
a
familiar
voice
issuing
from
behind
a
rack
of
dress
robes
in
spangled
green
and
blue
not
a
child
in
case
you
haven't
noticed
Mother
i
am
perfectly
capable
of
doing
my
shopping
alone
there
was
a
clucking
noise
and
a
voice
Harry
recognized
as
that
of
Madam
Malkin
the
owner
said
Now
dear
your
mother's
quite
right
none
of
us
is
supposed
to
go
wandering
around
on
our
own
anymore
it's
nothing
to
do
with
being
a
child
watch
where
you're
sticking
that
pin
will
you
a
teenage
boy
with
a
pale
pointed
face
and
white-blond
hair
appeared
from
behind
the
rack
wearing
a
handsome
set
of
dark
green
robes
that
glittered
with
pins
around
the
hem
and
the
edges
of
the
sleeves
he
strode
to
the
mirror
and
examined
himself
it
was
a
few
moments
before
he
noticed
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
reflected
over
his
shoulder
his
light
gray
eyes
narrowed
if
you're
wondering
what
the
smell
is
Mother
a
Mudblood
just
walked
in
said
Draco
Malfoy
i
don't
think
there's
any
need
for
language
like
that
said
Madam
Malkin
scurrying
out
from
behind
the
clothes
rack
holding
a
tape
measure
and
a
wand
and
I
don't
want
wands
drawn
in
my
shop
either
she
added
hastily
for
a
glance
toward
the
door
had
shown
her
Harry
and
Ron
both
standing
there
with
their
wands
out
and
pointing
at
Malfoy
hermione
who
was
standing
slightly
behind
them
whispered
No
don't
honestly
it's
not
worth
it
yeah
like
you'd
dare
do
magic
out
of
school
sneered
Malfoy
who
blacked
your
eye
Granger
i
want
to
send
them
flowers
that's
quite
enough
said
Madam
Malkin
sharply
looking
over
her
shoulder
for
support
madam
please
narcissa
Malfoy
strolled
out
from
behind
the
clothes
rack
put
those
away
she
said
coldly
to
Harry
and
Ron
if
you
at-tack
my
son
again
I
shall
ensure
that
it
is
the
last
thing
you
ever
do
really
said
Harry
taking
a
step
forward
and
gazing
into
the
smoothly
arrogant
face
that
for
all
its
pallor
still
resembled
her
sister's
he
was
as
tall
as
she
was
now
going
to
get
a
few
Death
Eater
pals
to
do
us
in
are
you
madam
Malkin
squealed
and
clutched
at
her
heart
really
you
shouldn't
accuse
dangerous
thing
to
say
wands
away
please
but
Harry
did
not
lower
his
wand
narcissa
Malfoy
smiled
unpleasantly
i
see
that
being
dumbledore's
favorite
has
given
you
a
false
sense
of
security
Harry
Potter
but
Dumbledore
won't
always
be
there
to
protect
you
harry
looked
mockingly
all
around
the
shop
wow
look
at
that
he's
not
here
now
so
why
not
have
a
go
they
might
be
able
to
find
you
a
double
cell
in
Azkaban
with
your
loser
of
a
husband
malfoy
made
an
angry
movement
toward
Harry
but
stumbled
over
his
overlong
robe
ron
laughed
loudly
don't
you
dare
talk
to
my
mother
like
that
Potter
malfoy
snarled
it's
all
right
Draco
said
Narcissa
restraining
him
with
her
thin
white
fingers
upon
his
shoulder
i
expect
Potter
will
be
reunited
with
dear
Sirius
before
I
am
reunited
with
Lucius
harry
raised
his
wand
higher
harry
no
moaned
Hermione
grabbing
his
arm
and
attempting
to
push
it
down
by
his
side
think
you
mustn't
you'll
be
in
such
trouble
madam
Malkin
dithered
for
a
moment
on
the
spot
then
seemed
to
decide
to
act
as
though
nothing
was
happening
in
the
hope
that
it
wouldn't
she
bent
toward
Malfoy
who
was
still
glaring
at
Harry
i
think
this
left
sleeve
could
come
up
a
little
bit
more
dear
let
me
just
ouch
bellowed
Malfoy
slapping
her
hand
away
watch
where
you're
putting
your
pins
woman
mother
I
don't
think
I
want
these
anymore
he
pulled
the
robes
over
his
head
and
threw
them
onto
the
floor
at
Madam
malkin's
feet
you're
right
Draco
said
Narcissa
with
a
contemptuous
glance
at
Hermione
now
I
know
the
kind
of
scum
that
shops
here
we'll
do
better
at
Twilfitt
and
tatting's
and
with
that
the
pair
of
them
strode
out
of
the
shop
Malfoy
taking
care
to
bang
as
hard
as
he
could
into
Ron
on
the
way
out
well
really
said
Madam
Malkin
snatching
up
the
fallen
robes
and
moving
the
tip
of
her
wand
over
them
like
a
vacuum
cleaner
so
that
it
removed
all
the
dust
she
was
distracted
all
through
the
fitting
of
ron's
and
harry's
new
robes
tried
to
sell
Hermione
wizard's
dress
robes
instead
of
witch's
and
when
she
finally
bowed
them
out
of
the
shop
it
was
with
an
air
of
being
glad
to
see
the
back
of
them
got
ev'rything
asked
Hagrid
brightly
when
they
reappeared
at
his
side
just
about
said
Harry
did
you
see
the
Malfoys
yeah
said
Hagrid
unconcerned
bu
they
wouldn
dare
make
trouble
in
the
middle
o
Diagon
Alley
Harry
don
worry
abou
them
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
exchanged
looks
but
before
they
could
disabuse
Hagrid
of
this
comfortable
notion
mr.
and
Mrs
weasley
and
Ginny
appeared
all
clutching
heavy
packages
of
books
everyone
all
right
said
Mrs
weasley
got
your
robes
right
then
we
can
pop
in
at
the
Apothecary
and
Eeylops
on
the
way
to
Fred
and
george's
stick
close
now
neither
Harry
nor
Ron
bought
any
ingredients
at
the
Apothecary
seeing
that
they
were
no
longer
studying
Potions
but
both
bought
large
boxes
of
owl
nuts
for
Hedwig
and
Pigwidgeon
at
Eeylops
Owl
Emporium
then
with
Mrs
weasley
checking
her
watch
every
minute
or
so
they
headed
farther
along
the
street
in
search
of
Weasleys
Wizard
Wheezes
the
joke
shop
run
by
Fred
and
George
we
really
haven't
got
too
long
Mrs
weasley
said
so
we'll
just
have
a
quick
look
around
and
then
back
to
the
car
we
must
be
close
that's
number
ninety-two
ninety-four
whoasaid
Ron
stopping
in
his
tracks
set
against
the
dull
poster-muffled
shop
Fronts
around
them
Fred
and
Georges
windows
hit
the
eye
like
a
firework
display
casual
passersby
were
looking
back
over
their
shoulders
at
the
windows
and
a
few
rather
stunned-looking
people
had
actually
come
to
a
halt
transfixed
the
left-hand
window
was
dazzlingly
full
of
an
assortment
of
goods
that
revolved
popped
flashed
bounced
and
shrieked
Harrys
eyes
began
to
water
just
looking
at
it
the
right-hand
window
was
covered
with
a
gigantic
poster
purple
like
those
of
the
Ministry
but
emblazoned
with
flashing
yellow
letters
why
are
you
worrying
about
you-know-who
you
should
be
worrying
about
u-no-poo
the
constipation
sensation
that's
gripping
the
nation
harry
started
to
laugh
he
heard
a
weak
sort
of
moan
beside
him
and
looked
around
to
see
Mrs
weasley
gazing
dumbfounded
at
the
poster
her
lips
moved
silently
mouthing
the
name
U-No-Poo
they'll
be
murdered
in
their
beds
she
whispered
no
they
wont
said
Ron
who
like
Harry
was
laughing
this
is
brilliant
and
he
and
Harry
led
the
way
into
the
shop
it
was
packed
with
customers
Harry
could
not
get
near
the
shelves
he
stared
around
looking
up
at
the
boxes
piled
to
the
ceiling
Here
were
the
Skiving
Snackboxes
that
the
twins
had
perfected
during
their
last
unfinished
year
at
Hogwarts
Harry
noticed
that
the
Nosebleed
Nougat
was
most
popular
with
only
one
battered
box
left
on
the
shelf
there
were
bins
full
of
trick
wands
the
cheapest
merely
turning
into
rubber
chickens
or
pairs
of
briefs
when
waved
the
most
expensive
beating
the
unwary
user
around
the
head
and
neck
and
boxes
of
quills
which
came
in
Self-Inking
Spell-Checking
and
Smart-Answer
varieties
a
space
cleared
in
the
crowd
and
Harry
pushed
his
way
toward
the
counter
where
a
gaggle
of
delighted
ten-year-olds
was
watching
a
tiny
little
wooden
man
slowly
ascending
the
steps
to
a
real
set
of
gallows
both
perched
on
a
box
that
read
Reusable
hangman
spell
it
or
he'll
swing
patented
Daydream
Charms
hermione
had
managed
to
squeeze
through
to
a
large
display
near
the
counter
and
was
reading
the
information
on
the
back
of
a
box
bearing
a
highly
colored
picture
of
a
handsome
youth
and
a
swooning
girl
who
were
standing
on
the
deck
of
a
pirate
ship
one
simple
incantation
and
you
will
enter
a
top-quality
highly
realistic
thirty-minute
daydream
easy
to
fit
into
the
average
school
lesson
and
virtually
undetectable
side
effects
include
vacant
expression
and
minor
drooling
not
for
sale
to
under-sixteens
you
know
said
Hermione
looking
up
at
Harry
that
really
is
extraordinary
magic
for
that
Hermione
said
a
voice
behind
them
you
can
have
one
for
free
a
beaming
Fred
stood
before
them
wearing
a
set
of
magenta
robes
that
clashed
magnificently
with
his
flaming
hair
how
are
you
Harry
they
shook
hands
and
what's
happened
to
your
eye
Hermione
your
punching
telescope
she
said
ruefully
oh
blimey
I
forgot
about
those
said
Fred
here
he
pulled
a
tub
out
of
his
pocket
and
handed
it
to
her
she
unscrewed
it
gingerly
to
reveal
a
thick
yellow
paste
just
dab
it
on
that
bruise'll
be
gone
within
the
hour
said
Fred
we
had
to
find
a
decent
bruise
remover
we're
testing
most
of
our
products
on
ourselves
hermione
looked
nervous
it
is
safe
isn't
it
she
asked
course
it
is
said
Fred
bracingly
come
on
Harry
i'll
give
you
a
tour
harry
left
Hermione
dabbing
her
black
eye
with
paste
and
followed
Fred
toward
the
back
of
the
shop
where
he
saw
a
stand
of
card
and
rope
tricks
muggle
magic
tricks
said
Fred
happily
pointing
them
out
for
freaks
like
Dad
you
know
who
love
Muggle
stuff
it's
not
a
big
earner
but
we
do
fairly
steady
business
they're
great
novelties
oh
here's
George
fred's
twin
shook
Harrys
hand
energetically
giving
him
the
tour
come
through
the
back
Harry
that's
where
we're
making
the
real
money
pocket
anything
you
and
you'll
pay
in
more
than
Galleons
he
added
warningly
to
a
small
boy
who
hastily
whipped
his
hand
out
of
the
tub
labeled
edible
dark
marksthey'll
make
anyone
sick
george
pushed
back
a
curtain
beside
the
Muggle
tricks
and
Harry
saw
a
darker
less
crowded
room
the
packaging
on
the
products
lining
these
shelves
was
more
subdued
we've
just
developed
this
more
serious
line
said
Fred
funny
how
it
happened
you
wouldn't
believe
how
many
people
even
people
who
work
at
the
Ministry
can't
do
a
decent
Shield
Charm
said
George
course
they
didn't
have
you
teaching
them
Harry
that's
right
well
we
thought
Shield
Hats
were
a
bit
of
a
laugh
you
know
challenge
your
mate
to
jinx
you
while
wearing
it
and
watch
his
face
when
the
jinx
just
bounces
off
but
the
Ministry
bought
five
hundred
for
all
its
support
staff
and
we're
still
getting
massive
orders
so
we've
expanded
into
a
range
of
Shield
Cloaks
Shield
Gloves
i
mean
they
wouldn't
help
much
against
the
Unforgivable
Curses
but
for
minor
to
moderate
hexes
or
jinxes
and
then
we
thought
we'd
get
into
the
whole
area
of
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
because
it's
such
a
money
spinner
continued
George
enthusiastically
this
is
cool
look
Instant
Darkness
Powder
we're
importing
it
from
Peru
handy
if
you
want
to
make
a
quick
escape
and
our
Decoy
Detonators
are
just
walking
off
the
shelves
look
said
Fred
pointing
at
a
number
of
weird-looking
black
horn-type
objects
that
were
indeed
attempting
to
scurry
out
of
sight
you
just
drop
one
surreptitiously
and
it'll
run
off
and
make
a
nice
loud
noise
out
of
sight
giving
you
a
diversion
if
you
need
one
handy
said
Harry
impressed
here
said
George
catching
a
couple
and
throwing
them
to
Harry
a
young
witch
with
short
blonde
hair
poked
her
head
around
the
curtain
Harry
saw
that
she
too
was
wearing
magenta
staff
robes
there's
a
customer
out
here
looking
for
a
joke
cauldron
mr.
Weasley
and
mr.
Weasley
she
said
harry
found
it
very
odd
to
hear
Fred
and
George
called
mr.
Weasley
but
they
took
it
in
their
stride
right
you
are
Verity
i'm
coming
said
George
promptly
harry
you
help
yourself
to
anything
you
want
all
right
no
charge
i
can't
do
that
said
Harry
who
had
already
pulled
out
his
money
bag
to
pay
for
the
Decoy
Detonators
you
don't
pay
here
said
Fred
firmly
waving
away
harry's
gold
but
you
gave
us
our
start-up
loan
we
haven't
forgotten
said
George
sternly
Take
whatever
you
like
and
just
remember
to
tell
people
where
you
got
it
if
they
ask
george
swept
off
through
the
curtain
to
help
with
the
customers
and
Fred
led
Harry
back
into
the
main
part
of
the
shop
to
find
Hermione
and
Ginny
still
poring
over
the
Patented
Daydream
Charms
haven't
you
girls
found
our
special
WonderWitch
products
yet
asked
Fred
follow
me
ladies
near
the
window
was
an
array
of
violently
pink
products
around
which
a
cluster
of
excited
girls
was
giggling
enthusiastically
hermione
and
Ginny
both
hung
back
looking
wary
there
you
go
said
Fred
proudly
best
range
of
love
potions
you'll
find
anywhere
ginny
raised
an
eyebrow
skeptically
do
they
work
she
asked
certainly
they
work
for
up
to
twenty-four
hours
at
a
time
depending
on
the
weight
of
the
boy
in
question
and
the
attractiveness
of
the
girl
said
George
reappearing
suddenly
at
their
side
but
we're
not
selling
them
to
our
sister
he
added
becoming
suddenly
stern
not
when
she's
already
got
about
five
boys
on
the
go
from
what
we've
whatever
you've
heard
from
Ron
is
a
big
fat
lie
said
Ginny
calmly
leaning
forward
to
take
a
small
pink
pot
off
the
shelf
what's
this
guaranteed
ten-second
pimple
vanisher
said
Fred
excellent
on
everything
from
boils
to
blackheads
but
don't
change
the
subject
are
you
or
are
you
not
currently
going
out
with
a
boy
called
Dean
Thomas
yes
I
am
said
Ginny
and
last
time
I
looked
he
was
definitely
one
boy
not
five
what
are
those
she
was
pointing
at
a
number
of
round
balls
of
fluff
in
shades
of
pink
and
purple
all
rolling
around
the
bottom
of
a
cage
and
emitting
high-pitched
squeaks
pygmy
Puffs
said
George
miniature
puffskeins
we
can
t
breed
them
fast
enough
so
what
about
Michael
Corner
i
dumped
him
he
was
a
bad
loser
said
Ginny
putting
a
finger
through
the
bars
of
the
cage
and
watching
the
Pygmy
Puffs
crowd
around
it
they're
really
cute
they're
fairly
cuddly
yes
conceded
Fred
but
you're
moving
through
boyfriends
a
bit
fast
aren't
you
ginny
turned
to
look
at
him
her
hands
on
her
hips
there
was
such
a
Mrs
weasley-ish
glare
on
her
face
that
Harry
was
surprised
Fred
didn't
recoil
it's
none
of
your
business
and
i'll
thank
you
she
added
angrily
to
Ron
who
had
just
appeared
at
george's
elbow
laden
with
merchandise
not
to
tell
tales
about
me
to
these
two
that's
three
Galleons
nine
Sickles
and
a
Knut
said
Fred
examining
the
many
boxes
in
ron's
arms
cough
up
i'm
your
brother
and
that's
our
stuff
you're
nicking
three
Galleons
nine
Sickles
i'll
knock
off
the
Knut
but
I
haven't
got
three
Galleons
nine
Sickles
you'd
better
put
it
back
then
and
mind
you
put
it
on
the
right
shelves
ron
dropped
several
boxes
swore
and
made
a
rude
hand
gesture
at
Fred
that
was
unfortunately
spotted
by
Mrs
weasley
who
had
chosen
that
moment
to
appear
if
I
see
you
do
that
again
i'll
jinx
your
fingers
together
she
said
sharply
mum
can
I
have
a
Pygmy
Puff
said
Ginny
at
once
a
what
said
Mrs
weasley
warily
look
they're
so
sweet
mrs
weasley
moved
aside
to
look
at
the
Pygmy
Puffs
and
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
momentarily
had
an
unimpeded
view
out
of
the
window
draco
Malfoy
was
hurrying
up
the
street
alone
as
he
passed
Weasleys
Wizard
Wheezes
he
glanced
over
his
shoulder
seconds
later
he
moved
beyond
the
scope
of
the
window
and
they
lost
sight
of
him
wonder
where
his
mummy
is
said
Harry
frowning
given
her
the
slip
by
the
looks
of
it
said
Ron
why
though
said
Hermione
harry
said
nothing
he
was
thinking
too
hard
narcissa
Malfoy
would
not
have
let
her
precious
son
out
of
her
sight
willingly
Malfoy
must
have
made
a
real
effort
to
free
himself
from
her
clutches
harry
knowing
and
loathing
Malfoy
was
sure
the
reason
could
not
be
innocent
he
glanced
around
mrs
weasley
and
Ginny
were
bending
over
the
Pygmy
Puffs
mr.
Weasley
was
delightedly
examining
a
pack
of
Muggle
marked
playing
cards
fred
and
George
were
both
helping
customers
on
the
other
side
of
the
glass
Hagrid
was
standing
with
his
back
to
them
looking
up
and
down
the
street
get
under
here
quick
said
Harry
pulling
his
Invisibility
Cloak
out
of
his
bag
oh
I
don't
know
Harry
said
Hermione
looking
uncertainly
toward
Mrs
weasley
come
on
said
Ron
she
hesitated
for
a
second
longer
then
ducked
under
the
cloak
with
Harry
and
Ron
nobody
noticed
them
vanish
they
were
all
too
interested
in
Fred
and
george's
products
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
squeezed
their
way
out
of
the
door
as
quickly
as
they
could
but
by
the
time
they
gained
the
street
Malfoy
had
disappeared
just
as
successfully
as
they
had
he
was
going
in
that
direction
murmured
Harry
as
quietly
as
possible
so
that
the
humming
Hagrid
would
not
hear
them
cmon
they
scurried
along
peering
left
and
right
through
shop
windows
and
doors
until
Hermione
pointed
ahead
that's
him
isn't
it
she
whispered
turning
left
big
surprise
whispered
Ron
for
Malfoy
had
glanced
around
then
slid
into
Knockturn
Alley
and
out
of
sight
quick
or
we'll
lose
him
said
Harry
speeding
up
our
feet'll
be
seen
said
Hermione
anxiously
as
the
cloak
flapped
a
little
around
their
ankles
it
was
much
more
difficult
hiding
all
three
of
them
under
the
cloak
nowadays
it
doesn't
matter
said
Harry
impatiently
just
hurry
but
Knockturn
Alley
the
side
street
devoted
to
the
Dark
Arts
looked
completely
deserted
they
peered
into
windows
as
they
passed
but
none
of
the
shops
seemed
to
have
any
customers
at
all
harry
supposed
it
was
a
bit
of
a
giveaway
in
these
dangerous
and
suspicious
times
to
buy
Dark
artifacts
or
at
least
to
be
seen
buying
them
hermione
gave
his
arm
a
hard
pinch
ouch
shh
look
he's
in
there
she
breathed
in
harry's
ear
they
had
drawn
level
with
the
only
shop
in
Knockturn
Alley
that
Harry
had
ever
visited
Borgin
and
Burkes
which
sold
a
wide
variety
of
sinister
objects
there
in
the
midst
of
the
cases
full
of
skulls
and
old
bottles
stood
Draco
Malfoy
with
his
back
to
them
just
visible
beyond
the
very
same
large
black
cabinet
in
which
Harry
had
once
hidden
to
avoid
Malfoy
and
his
father
judging
by
the
movements
of
malfoy's
hands
he
was
talking
animatedly
the
proprietor
of
the
shop
mr.
Borgin
an
oily-haired
stooping
man
stood
facing
Malfoy
he
was
wearing
a
curious
expression
of
mingled
resentment
and
fear
if
only
we
could
hear
what
they're
saying
said
Hermione
we
can
said
Ron
excitedly
hang
on
damn
he
dropped
a
couple
more
of
the
boxes
he
was
still
clutching
as
he
fumbled
with
the
largest
extendable
Ears
look
fantastic
said
Hermione
as
Ron
unraveled
the
long
flesh-colored
strings
and
began
to
feed
them
toward
the
bottom
of
the
door
oh
I
hope
the
door
isn't
Imperturbable
no
said
Ron
gleefully
listen
they
put
their
heads
together
and
listened
intently
to
the
ends
of
the
strings
through
which
malfoy's
voice
could
be
heard
loud
and
clear
as
though
a
radio
had
been
turned
on
you
know
how
to
fix
it
possibly
said
Borgin
in
a
tone
that
suggested
he
was
unwilling
to
commit
himself
i'll
need
to
see
it
though
why
don't
you
bring
it
into
the
shop
i
can't
said
Malfoy
it's
got
to
stay
put
i
just
need
you
to
tell
me
how
to
do
it
harry
saw
Borgin
lick
his
lips
nervously
well
without
seeing
it
I
must
say
it
will
be
a
very
difficult
job
perhaps
impossible
i
couldn't
guarantee
anything
no
said
Malfoy
and
Harry
knew
just
by
his
tone
that
Malfoy
was
sneering
perhaps
this
will
make
you
more
confident
he
moved
toward
Borgin
and
was
blocked
from
view
by
the
cabinet
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
shuffled
sideways
to
try
and
keep
him
in
sight
but
all
they
could
see
was
Borgin
looking
very
frightened
tell
anyone
said
Maifoy
and
there
will
be
retribution
you
know
Fenrir
Greyback
he's
a
family
friend
he'll
be
dropping
in
from
time
to
time
to
make
sure
you're
giving
the
problem
your
full
attention
there
will
be
no
need
for
i'll
decide
that
said
Malfoy
well
i'd
better
be
off
and
don't
forget
to
keep
that
one
safe
i'll
need
it
perhaps
you'd
like
to
take
it
now
no
of
course
I
wouldn't
you
stupid
little
man
how
would
I
look
carrying
that
down
the
street
just
don't
sell
it
of
course
not
sir
borgin
made
a
bow
as
deep
as
the
one
Harry
had
once
seen
him
give
Lucius
Malfoy
not
a
word
to
anyone
Borgin
and
that
includes
my
mother
understand
naturally
naturally
murmured
Borgin
bowing
again
next
moment
the
bell
over
the
door
tinkled
loudly
as
Malfoy
stalked
out
of
the
shop
looking
very
pleased
with
himself
he
passed
so
close
to
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
that
they
felt
the
cloak
flutter
around
their
knees
again
inside
the
shop
Borgin
remained
frozen
his
unctuous
smile
had
vanished
he
looked
worried
what
was
that
about
whispered
Ron
reeling
in
the
Extendable
Ears
dunno
said
Harry
thinking
hard
he
wants
something
mended
and
he
wants
to
reserve
something
in
there
could
you
see
what
he
pointed
at
when
he
said
that
one
no
he
was
behind
that
cabinet
you
two
stay
here
whispered
Hermione
what
are
you
but
Hermione
had
already
ducked
out
from
under
the
cloak
she
checked
her
hair
in
the
reflection
in
the
glass
then
marched
into
the
shop
setting
the
bell
tinkling
again
ron
hastily
fed
the
Extendable
Ears
back
under
the
door
and
passed
one
of
the
strings
to
Harry
hello
horrible
morning
isn't
it
hermione
said
brightly
to
Borgin
who
did
not
answer
but
cast
her
a
suspicious
look
humming
cheerily
Hermione
strolled
through
the
jumble
of
objects
on
display
is
this
necklace
for
sale
she
asked
pausing
beside
a
glass-fronted
case
if
you've
got
one
and
a
half
thousand
Galleons
said
mr.
Borgin
coldly
oh
er
no
I
haven't
got
quite
that
much
said
Hermione
walking
on
and
what
about
this
lovely
um
skull
sixteen
Galleons
so
it's
for
sale
then
it
isn't
being
kept
for
anyone
mr.
Borgin
squinted
at
her
harry
had
the
nasty
feeling
he
knew
exactly
what
Hermione
was
up
to
apparently
Hermione
felt
she
had
been
rumbled
too
because
she
suddenly
threw
caution
to
the
winds
the
thing
is
that
er
boy
who
was
in
here
just
now
Draco
Malfoy
well
he's
a
friend
of
mine
and
I
want
to
get
him
a
birthday
present
but
if
he's
already
reserved
anything
I
obviously
don't
want
to
get
him
the
same
thing
so
um
it
was
a
pretty
lame
story
in
harry's
opinion
and
apparently
Borgin
thought
so
too
out
he
said
sharply
get
out
hermione
did
not
wait
to
be
asked
twice
but
hurried
to
the
door
with
Borgin
at
her
heels
as
the
bell
tinkled
again
Borgin
slammed
the
door
behind
her
and
put
up
the
closed
sign
ah
well
said
Ron
throwing
the
cloak
back
over
Hermione
worth
a
try
but
you
were
a
bit
obvious
well
next
time
you
can
show
me
how
it's
done
Master
of
Mystery
she
snapped
ron
and
Hermione
bickered
all
the
way
back
to
Weasleys
wizard
Wheezes
where
they
were
forced
to
stop
so
that
they
could
dodge
undetected
around
a
very
anxious-looking
Mrs
weasley
and
Hagrid
who
had
clearly
noticed
their
absence
once
in
the
shop
Harry
whipped
off
the
Invisibility
Cloak
hid
it
in
his
bag
and
joined
in
with
the
other
two
when
they
insisted
in
answer
to
Mrs
weasleys
accusations
that
they
had
been
in
the
back
room
all
along
and
that
she
could
not
have
looked
properly
chapter
The
Slug
Club
harry
spent
a
lot
of
the
last
week
of
the
holidays
pondering
the
meaning
of
malfoy's
behavior
in
Knockturn
Alley
what
disturbed
him
most
was
the
satisfied
look
on
malfoy's
face
as
he
had
left
the
shop
nothing
that
made
Malfoy
look
that
happy
could
be
good
news
to
his
slight
annoyance
however
neither
Ron
nor
Hermione
seemed
quite
as
curious
about
malfoy's
activities
as
he
was
or
at
least
they
seemed
to
get
bored
of
discussing
it
after
a
few
days
yes
i've
already
agreed
it
was
fishy
Harry
said
Hermione
a
little
impatiently
she
was
sitting
on
the
windowsill
in
Fred
and
george's
room
with
her
feet
up
on
one
of
the
cardboard
boxes
and
had
only
grudgingly
looked
up
from
her
new
copy
of
Advanced
Rune
Translation
but
haven't
we
agreed
there
could
be
a
lot
of
explanations
maybe
he's
broken
his
Hand
of
Glory
said
Ron
vaguely
as
he
attempted
to
straighten
his
broomstick's
bent
tail
twigs
remember
that
shriveled-up
arm
Malfoy
had
but
what
about
when
he
said
don't
forget
to
keep
that
one
safe
asked
Harry
for
the
umpteenth
time
that
sounded
to
me
like
borgin's
got
another
one
of
the
broken
objects
and
Malfoy
wants
both
you
reckon
said
Ron
now
trying
to
scrape
some
dirt
off
his
broom
handle
yeah
I
do
said
Harry
when
neither
Ron
nor
Hermione
answered
he
said
malfoy's
father's
in
Azkaban
don't
you
think
Malfoyd
like
revenge
ron
looked
up
blinking
malfoy
revenge
what
can
he
do
about
it
that's
my
point
I
don't
know
said
Harry
frustrated
but
he's
up
to
something
and
I
think
we
should
take
it
seriously
his
father's
a
Death
Eater
and
harry
broke
off
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
window
behind
Hermione
his
mouth
open
a
startling
thought
had
just
occurred
to
him
harry
said
Hermione
in
an
anxious
voice
what's
wrong
your
scar's
not
hurting
again
is
it
asked
Ron
nervously
he's
a
Death
Eater
said
Harry
slowly
he's
replaced
his
father
as
a
Death
Eater
there
was
a
silence
then
Ron
erupted
in
laughter
malfoy
he's
sixteen
Harry
you
think
You-Know-Who
would
let
Malfoy
join
it
seems
very
unlikely
Harry
said
Hermione
in
a
repressive
sort
of
voice
what
makes
you
think
in
Madam
malkin's
she
didn't
touch
him
but
he
yelled
and
jerked
his
arm
away
from
her
when
she
went
to
roll
up
his
sleeve
it
was
his
left
arm
he's
been
branded
with
the
Dark
Mark
ron
and
Hermione
looked
at
each
other
well
said
Ron
sounding
thoroughly
unconvinced
i
think
he
just
wanted
to
get
out
of
there
Harry
said
Hermione
he
showed
Borgin
something
we
couldn't
see
Harry
pressed
on
stubbornly
something
that
seriously
scared
Borgin
it
was
the
Mark
I
know
it
he
was
showing
Borgin
who
he
was
dealing
with
you
saw
how
seriously
Borgin
took
him
ron
and
Hermione
exchanged
another
look
i'm
not
sure
Harry
yeah
I
still
don't
reckon
You-Know-Who
would
let
Malfoy
join
annoyed
but
absolutely
convinced
he
was
right
Harry
snatched
up
a
pile
of
filthy
Quidditch
robes
and
left
the
room
Mrs
weasley
had
been
urging
them
for
days
not
to
leave
their
washing
and
packing
until
the
last
moment
on
the
landing
he
bumped
into
Ginny
who
was
returning
to
her
room
carrying
a
pile
of
freshly
laundered
clothes
i
wouldn't
go
in
the
kitchen
just
now
she
warned
him
there's
a
lot
of
Phlegm
around
i'll
be
careful
not
to
slip
in
it
harry
smiled
sure
enough
when
he
entered
the
kitchen
it
was
to
find
Fleur
sitting
at
the
kitchen
table
in
full
flow
about
plans
for
her
wedding
to
Bill
while
Mrs
weasley
kept
watch
over
a
pile
of
self-peeling
sprouts
looking
bad-tempered
bill
and
I
ave
almost
decided
on
only
two
bridesmaids
Ginny
and
Gabrielle
will
look
very
sweet
togezzer
i
am
theenking
of
dressing
zem
in
pale
gold
pink
would
of
course
be
orrible
with
ginny's
air
ah
Harry
said
Mrs
weasley
loudly
cutting
across
fleur's
monologue
good
I
wanted
to
explain
about
the
security
arrangements
for
the
journey
to
Hogwarts
tomorrow
we've
got
Ministry
cars
again
and
there
will
be
Aurors
waiting
at
the
station
is
Tonks
going
to
be
there
asked
Harry
handing
over
his
Quidditch
things
no
I
don't
think
so
she's
been
stationed
somewhere
else
from
what
Arthur
said
she
has
let
erself
go
zat
Tonks
Fleur
mused
examining
her
own
stunning
reflection
in
the
back
of
a
teaspoon
a
big
mistake
if
you
ask
yes
thank
you
said
Mrs
weasley
tartly
cutting
across
Fleur
again
you'd
better
get
on
Harry
I
want
the
trunks
ready
tonight
if
possible
so
we
don't
have
the
usual
last-minute
scramble
and
in
fact
their
departure
the
following
morning
was
smoother
than
usual
the
Ministry
cars
glided
up
to
the
front
of
the
Burrow
to
find
them
waiting
trunks
packed
hermione's
cat
Crookshanks
safely
enclosed
in
his
traveling
basket
and
Hedwig
ron's
owl
pig-widgeon
and
ginny's
new
purple
Pygmy
Puff
Arnold
in
cages
au
revoir
Any
said
Fleur
throatily
kissing
him
good-bye
ron
hurried
forward
looking
hopeful
but
Ginny
stuck
out
her
foot
and
Ron
fell
sprawling
in
the
dust
at
fleur's
feet
furious
red-faced
and
dirt-spattered
he
hurried
into
the
car
without
saying
good-bye
there
was
no
cheerful
Hagrid
waiting
for
them
at
king's
Cross
Station
instead
two
grim-faced
bearded
Aurors
in
dark
Muggle
suits
moved
forward
the
moment
the
cars
stopped
and
flanking
the
party
marched
them
into
the
station
without
speaking
quick
quick
through
the
barrier
said
Mrs
weasley
who
seemed
a
little
flustered
by
this
austere
efficiency
harry
had
better
go
first
with
she
looked
inquiringly
at
one
of
the
Aurors
who
nodded
briefly
seized
harry's
upper
arm
and
attempted
to
steer
him
toward
the
barrier
between
platforms
nine
and
ten
i
can
walk
thanks
said
Harry
irritably
jerking
his
arm
out
of
the
auror's
grip
he
pushed
his
trolley
directly
at
the
solid
barrier
ignoring
his
silent
companion
and
found
himself
a
second
later
standing
on
platform
nine
and
three-quarters
where
the
scarlet
Hogwarts
Express
stood
belching
steam
over
the
crowd
hermione
and
the
Weasleys
joined
him
within
seconds
without
waiting
to
consult
his
grim-faced
Auror
Harry
motioned
to
Ron
and
Hermione
to
follow
him
up
the
platform
looking
for
an
empty
compartment
we
can't
Harry
said
Hermione
looking
apologetic
ron
and
i've
got
to
go
to
the
prefects
carriage
first
and
then
patrol
the
corridors
for
a
bit
oh
yeah
I
forgot
said
Harry
you'd
better
get
straight
on
the
train
all
of
you
you've
only
got
a
few
minutes
to
go
said
Mrs
weasley
consulting
her
watch
well
have
a
lovely
term
Ron
mr.
Weasley
can
I
have
a
quick
word
said
Harry
making
up
his
mind
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
of
course
said
mr.
Weasley
who
looked
slightly
surprised
but
followed
Harry
out
of
earshot
of
the
others
nevertheless
harry
had
thought
it
through
carefully
and
come
to
the
conclusion
that
if
he
was
to
tell
anyone
mr.
Weasley
was
the
right
person
firstly
because
he
worked
at
the
Ministry
and
was
therefore
in
the
best
position
to
make
further
investigations
and
secondly
because
he
thought
that
there
was
not
too
much
risk
of
mr.
Weasley
exploding
with
anger
he
could
see
Mrs
weasley
and
the
grim-faced
Auror
casting
the
pair
of
them
suspicious
looks
as
they
moved
away
when
we
were
in
Diagon
Alley
Harry
began
but
mr.
Weasley
forestalled
him
with
a
grimace
am
I
about
to
discover
where
you
Ron
and
Hermione
disappeared
to
while
you
were
supposed
to
be
in
the
back
room
of
Fred
and
george's
shop
how
did
you
harry
please
you're
talking
to
the
man
who
raised
Fred
and
George
er
yeah
all
right
we
weren't
in
the
back
room
very
well
then
let's
hear
the
worst
well
we
followed
Draco
Malfoy
we
used
my
Invisibility
Cloak
did
you
have
any
particular
reason
for
doing
so
or
was
it
a
mere
whim
because
I
thought
Malfoy
was
up
to
something
said
Harry
disregarding
mr.
weasley's
look
of
mingled
exasperation
and
amusement
he'd
given
his
mother
the
slip
and
I
wanted
to
know
why
of
course
you
did
said
mr.
Weasley
sounding
resigned
well
did
you
find
out
why
he
went
into
Borgin
and
Burkes
said
Harry
and
started
bullying
the
bloke
in
there
Borgin
to
help
him
fix
something
and
he
said
he
wanted
Borgin
to
keep
something
else
for
him
he
made
it
sound
like
it
was
the
same
kind
of
thing
that
needed
fixing
like
they
were
a
pair
and
harry
took
a
deep
breath
there's
something
else
we
saw
Malfoy
jump
about
a
mile
when
Madam
Malkin
tried
to
touch
his
left
arm
i
think
he's
been
branded
with
the
Dark
Mark
think
he's
replaced
his
father
as
a
Death
Eater
mr.
Weasley
looked
taken
aback
after
a
moment
he
said
Harry
I
doubt
whether
You-Know-Who
would
allow
a
sixteen-year-old
does
anyone
really
know
what
You-Know-Who
would
or
wouldn't
do
asked
Harry
angrily
mr.
Weasley
i'm
sorry
but
isn't
it
worth
investigating
if
Malfoy
wants
something
fixing
and
he
needs
to
threaten
Borgin
to
get
it
done
it's
probably
something
Dark
or
dangerous
isn't
it
i
doubt
it
to
be
honest
Harry
said
mr.
Weasley
slowly
you
see
when
Lucius
Malfoy
was
arrested
we
raided
his
house
we
took
away
everything
that
might
have
been
dangerous
i
think
you
missed
something
said
Harry
stubbornly
well
maybe
said
mr.
Weasley
but
Harry
could
tell
that
mr.
Weasley
was
humoring
him
there
was
a
whistle
behind
them
nearly
everyone
had
boarded
the
train
and
the
doors
were
closing
you'd
better
hurry
said
mr.
Weasley
as
Mrs
weasley
cried
Harry
quickly
he
hurried
forward
and
mr.
and
Mrs
weasley
helped
him
load
his
trunk
onto
the
train
now
dear
you're
coming
to
us
for
Christmas
it's
all
fixed
with
Dumbledore
so
we'll
see
you
quite
soon
said
Mrs
weasley
through
the
window
as
Harry
slammed
the
door
shut
behind
him
and
the
train
began
to
move
you
make
sure
you
look
after
yourself
and
the
train
was
gathering
speed
be
good
and
She
was
jogging
to
keep
up
now
stay
safe
harry
waved
until
the
train
had
turned
a
corner
and
mr.
and
Mrs
weasley
were
lost
to
view
then
turned
to
see
where
the
others
had
got
to
he
supposed
Ron
and
Hermione
were
cloistered
in
the
prefects
carriage
but
Ginny
was
a
little
way
along
the
corridor
chatting
to
some
friends
he
made
his
way
toward
her
dragging
his
trunk
people
stared
shamelessly
as
he
approached
they
even
pressed
their
faces
against
the
windows
of
their
compartments
to
get
a
look
at
him
he
had
expected
an
upswing
in
the
amount
of
gaping
and
gawping
he
would
have
to
endure
this
term
after
all
the
Chosen
One
rumors
in
the
Daily
Prophet
but
he
did
not
enjoy
the
sensation
of
standing
in
a
very
bright
spotlight
he
tapped
Ginny
on
the
shoulder
fancy
trying
to
find
a
compartment
i
can't
Harry
I
said
i'd
meet
Dean
said
Ginny
brightly
see
you
later
right
said
Harry
he
felt
a
strange
twinge
of
annoyance
as
she
walked
away
her
long
red
hair
dancing
behind
her
he
had
become
so
used
to
her
presence
over
the
summer
that
he
had
almost
forgotten
that
Ginny
did
not
hang
around
with
him
Ron
and
Hermione
while
at
school
then
he
blinked
and
looked
around
He
was
surrounded
by
mesmerized
girls
hi
Harry
said
a
familiar
voice
from
behind
him
neville
said
Harry
in
relief
turning
to
see
a
round-faced
boy
struggling
toward
him
hello
Harry
said
a
girl
with
long
hair
and
large
misty
eyes
who
was
just
behind
Neville
luna
hi
how
are
you
very
well
thank
you
said
Luna
she
was
clutching
a
magazine
to
her
chest
large
letters
on
the
front
announced
that
there
was
a
pair
of
free
Spectrespecs
inside
quibbler
still
going
strong
then
asked
Harry
who
felt
a
certain
fondness
for
the
magazine
having
given
it
an
exclusive
interview
the
previous
year
oh
yes
circulation's
well
up
said
Luna
happily
let's
find
seats
said
Harry
and
the
three
of
them
set
off
along
the
train
through
hordes
of
silently
staring
students
at
last
they
found
an
empty
compartment
and
Harry
hurried
inside
gratefully
they're
even
staring
at
us
said
Neville
indicating
himself
and
Luna
because
we're
with
you
they're
staring
at
you
because
you
were
at
the
Ministry
too
said
Harry
as
he
hoisted
his
trunk
into
the
luggage
rack
our
little
adventure
there
was
all
over
the
Daily
Prophet
you
must've
seen
it
yes
I
thought
Gran
would
be
angry
about
all
the
publicity
said
Neville
but
she
was
really
pleased
says
i'm
starting
to
live
up
to
my
dad
at
long
last
she
bought
me
a
new
wand
look
he
pulled
it
out
and
showed
it
to
Harry
cherry
and
unicorn
hair
he
said
proudly
we
think
it
was
one
of
the
last
Ollivander
ever
sold
he
vanished
next
day
oi
come
back
here
Trevor
and
he
dived
under
the
seat
to
retrieve
his
toad
as
it
made
one
of
its
frequent
bids
for
freedom
are
we
still
doing
D
a.
meetings
this
year
Harry
asked
Luna
who
was
detaching
a
pair
of
psychedelic
spectacles
from
the
middle
of
The
Quibbler
no
point
now
we've
got
rid
of
Umbridge
is
there
said
Harry
sitting
down
neville
bumped
his
head
against
the
seat
as
he
emerged
from
under
it
he
looked
most
disappointed
i
liked
the
D
i
learned
loads
with
you
i
enjoyed
the
meetings
too
said
Luna
serenely
it
was
like
having
friends
this
was
one
of
those
uncomfortable
things
Luna
often
said
and
which
made
Harry
feel
a
squirming
mixture
of
pity
and
embarrassment
before
he
could
respond
however
there
was
a
disturbance
outside
their
compartment
door
a
group
of
fourth-year
girls
was
whispering
and
giggling
together
on
the
other
side
of
the
glass
you
ask
him
no
you
i'll
do
it
and
one
of
them
a
bold-looking
girl
with
large
dark
eyes
a
prominent
chin
and
long
black
hair
pushed
her
way
through
the
door
hi
Harry
i'm
Romilda
Romilda
Vane
she
said
loudly
and
confidently
why
don't
you
join
us
in
our
compartment
you
don't
have
to
sit
with
them
she
added
in
a
stage
whisper
indicating
neville's
bottom
which
was
sticking
out
from
under
the
seat
again
as
he
groped
around
for
Trevor
and
Luna
who
was
now
wearing
her
free
Spectrespecs
which
gave
her
the
look
of
a
demented
multicolored
owl
they're
friends
of
mine
said
Harry
coldly
oh
said
the
girl
looking
very
surprised
oh.
Okay
and
she
withdrew
sliding
the
door
closed
behind
her
people
expect
you
have
cooler
friends
than
us
said
Luna
once
again
displaying
her
knack
for
embarrassing
honesty
you
are
cool
said
Harry
shortly
none
of
them
was
at
the
Ministry
they
didn't
fight
with
me
that's
a
very
nice
thing
to
say
beamed
Luna
then
she
pushed
her
Spectrespecs
farther
up
her
nose
and
settled
down
to
read
The
quibbler
we
didn't
face
him
though
said
Neville
emerging
from
under
the
seat
with
fluff
and
dust
in
his
hair
and
a
resigned-looking
Trevor
in
his
hand
you
did
you
should
hear
my
gran
talk
about
you
that
Harry
potter's
got
more
backbone
than
the
whole
Ministry
of
Magic
put
together
she'd
give
anything
to
have
you
as
a
grand-son
harry
laughed
uncomfortably
and
changed
the
subject
to
owl
results
as
soon
as
he
could
while
Neville
recited
his
grades
and
wondered
aloud
whether
he
would
be
allowed
to
take
a
Transfiguration
newt
with
only
an
Acceptable
Harry
watched
him
without
really
listening
neville's
childhood
had
been
blighted
by
Voldemort
just
as
much
as
harry's
had
but
Neville
had
no
idea
how
close
he
had
come
to
having
harry's
destiny
the
prophecy
could
have
referred
to
either
of
them
yet
for
his
own
inscrutable
reasons
Voldemort
had
chosen
to
believe
that
Harry
was
the
one
meant
had
Voldemort
chosen
Neville
it
would
be
Neville
sitting
opposite
Harry
bearing
the
lightning-shaped
scar
and
the
weight
of
the
prophecy
or
would
it
would
Nevilles
mother
have
died
to
save
him
as
Lily
had
died
for
Harry
surely
she
would
but
what
if
she
had
been
unable
to
stand
between
her
son
and
Voldemort
would
there
then
have
been
no
Chosen
One
at
all
an
empty
seat
where
Neville
now
sat
and
a
scarless
Harry
who
would
have
been
kissed
good-bye
by
his
own
mother
not
ron's
you
all
right
Harry
you
look
funny
said
Neville
harry
started
sorry
wrackspurt
got
you
asked
Luna
sympathetically
peering
at
Harry
through
her
enormous
colored
spectacles
what
a
Wrackspurt
they're
invisible
they
float
in
through
your
ears
and
make
your
brain
go
fuzzy
she
said
i
thought
I
felt
one
zooming
around
in
here
she
flapped
her
hands
at
thin
air
as
though
beating
off
large
invisible
moths
harry
and
Neville
caught
each
other's
eyes
and
hastily
began
to
talk
of
Quidditch
the
weather
beyond
the
train
windows
was
as
patchy
as
it
had
been
all
summer
they
passed
through
stretches
of
the
chilling
mist
then
out
into
weak
clear
sunlight
it
was
during
one
of
the
clear
spells
when
the
sun
was
visible
almost
directly
overhead
that
Ron
and
Hermione
entered
the
compartment
at
last
wish
the
lunch
trolley
would
hurry
up
i'm
starving
said
Ron
longingly
slumping
into
the
seat
beside
Harry
and
rubbing
his
stomach
hi
Neville
hi
Luna
guess
what
he
added
turning
to
Harry
malfoy
s
not
doing
prefect
duty
he's
just
sitting
in
his
compartment
with
the
other
Slytherins
we
saw
him
when
we
passed
harry
sat
up
straight
interested
it
was
not
like
Malfoy
to
pass
up
the
chance
to
demonstrate
his
power
as
prefect
which
he
had
happily
abused
all
the
previous
year
what
did
he
do
when
he
saw
you
the
usual
said
Ron
indifferently
demonstrating
a
rude
hand
gesture
not
like
him
though
is
it
well
that
is
he
did
the
hand
gesture
again
but
why
isn't
he
out
there
bullying
first
years
dunno
said
Harry
but
his
mind
was
racing
didn't
this
look
as
though
Malfoy
had
more
important
things
on
his
mind
than
bullying
younger
students
maybe
he
preferred
the
Inquisitorial
Squad
said
Hermione
maybe
being
a
prefect
seems
a
bit
tame
after
that
i
don't
think
so
said
Harry
i
think
he's
but
before
he
could
expound
on
his
theory
the
compartment
door
slid
open
again
and
a
breathless
third-year
girl
stepped
inside
i'm
supposed
to
deliver
these
to
Neville
Longbottom
and
Harry
P-Potter
she
faltered
as
her
eyes
met
harry's
and
she
turned
scarlet
she
was
holding
out
two
scrolls
of
parchment
tied
with
violet
ribbon
perplexed
Harry
and
Neville
took
the
scroll
addressed
to
each
of
them
and
the
girl
stumbled
back
out
of
the
compartment
what
is
it
ron
demanded
as
Harry
unrolled
his
an
invitation
said
Harry
harry
i
would
be
delighted
if
you
would
join
me
for
a
bite
of
lunch
in
compartment
C
sincerely
Horace
but
what
does
he
want
me
for
asked
Neville
nervously
as
though
he
was
expecting
detention
no
idea
said
Harry
which
was
not
entirely
true
though
he
had
no
proof
yet
that
his
hunch
was
correct
listen
he
added
seized
by
a
sudden
brain
wave
let's
go
under
the
Invisibility
Cloak
then
we
might
get
a
good
look
at
Malfoy
on
the
way
see
what
he's
up
to
this
idea
however
came
to
nothing
The
corridors
which
were
packed
with
people
on
the
lookout
for
the
lunch
trolley
were
impossible
to
negotiate
while
wearing
the
cloak
harry
stowed
it
regretfully
back
in
his
bag
reflecting
that
it
would
have
been
nice
to
wear
it
just
to
avoid
all
the
staring
which
seemed
to
have
increased
in
intensity
even
since
he
had
last
walked
down
the
train
every
now
and
then
students
would
hurtle
out
of
their
compartments
to
get
a
better
look
at
him
the
exception
was
Cho
Chang
who
darted
into
her
compartment
when
she
saw
Harry
coming
as
Harry
passed
the
window
he
saw
her
deep
in
determined
conversation
with
her
friend
Marietta
who
was
wearing
a
very
thick
layer
of
makeup
that
did
not
entirely
obscure
the
odd
formation
of
pimples
still
etched
across
her
face
smirking
slightly
Harry
pushed
on
when
they
reached
compartment
C
they
saw
at
once
that
they
were
not
slughorn's
only
invitees
although
judging
by
the
enthusiasm
of
slughorn's
welcome
Harry
was
the
most
warmly
anticipated
harry
m'boy
said
Slughorn
jumping
up
at
the
sight
of
him
so
that
his
great
velvet-covered
belly
seemed
to
fill
all
the
remaining
space
in
the
compartment
his
shiny
bald
head
and
great
silvery
mustache
gleamed
as
brightly
in
the
sunlight
as
the
golden
buttons
on
his
waistcoat
good
to
see
you
good
to
see
you
and
you
must
be
mr.
Longbottom
neville
nodded
looking
scared
at
a
gesture
from
Slughorn
they
sat
down
opposite
each
other
in
the
only
two
empty
seats
which
were
nearest
the
door
harry
glanced
around
at
their
fellow
guests
he
recognized
a
Slytherin
from
their
year
a
tall
black
boy
with
high
cheekbones
and
long
slanting
eyes
there
were
also
two
seventh-year
boys
Harry
did
not
know
and
squashed
in
the
corner
beside
Slughorn
and
looking
as
though
she
was
not
entirely
sure
how
she
had
got
there
Ginny
now
do
you
know
everyone
slughorn
asked
Harry
and
Neville
blaise
Zabini
is
in
your
year
of
course
zabini
did
not
make
any
sign
of
recognition
or
greeting
nor
did
Harry
or
Neville
Gryffindor
and
Slytherin
students
loathed
each
other
on
principle
this
is
Cormac
McLaggen
perhaps
you've
come
across
each
other
no
mcLaggen
a
large
wiry-haired
youth
raised
a
hand
and
Harry
and
Neville
nodded
back
at
him
and
this
is
Marcus
Belby
I
don't
know
whether
belby
who
was
thin
and
nervous-looking
gave
a
strained
smile
and
this
charming
young
lady
tells
me
she
knows
you
slughorn
finished
ginny
grimaced
at
Harry
and
Neville
from
behind
slughorn's
back
well
now
this
is
most
pleasant
said
Slughorn
cozily
a
chance
to
get
to
know
you
all
a
little
better
here
take
a
napkin
i've
packed
my
own
lunch
the
trolley
as
I
remember
it
is
heavy
on
licorice
wands
and
a
poor
old
man's
digestive
system
isn't
quite
up
to
such
things
pheasant
Belby
belby
started
and
accepted
what
looked
like
half
a
cold
pheasant
i
was
just
telling
young
Marcus
here
that
I
had
the
pleasure
of
teaching
his
Uncle
Damocles
Slughorn
told
Harry
and
Neville
now
passing
around
a
basket
of
rolls
outstanding
wizard
outstanding
and
his
Order
of
Merlin
most
well-deserved
do
you
see
much
of
your
uncle
Marcus
unfortunately
Beiby
had
just
taken
a
large
mouthful
of
pheasant
in
his
haste
to
answer
Slughorn
he
swallowed
too
fast
turned
purple
and
began
to
choke
anapneo
said
Slughorn
calmly
pointing
his
wand
at
Belby
whose
airway
seemed
to
clear
at
once
not
not
much
of
him
no
gasped
Belby
his
eyes
streaming
well
of
course
I
daresay
he's
busy
said
Slughorn
looking
questioningly
at
Belby
i
doubt
he
invented
the
Wolfsbane
Potion
without
considerable
hard
work
i
suppose
said
Belby
who
seemed
afraid
to
take
another
bite
of
pheasant
until
he
was
sure
that
Slughorn
had
finished
with
him
er
he
and
my
dad
don't
get
on
very
well
you
see
so
I
don't
really
know
much
about
his
voice
tailed
away
as
Slughorn
gave
him
a
cold
smile
and
turned
to
McLaggen
instead
now
you
Cormac
said
Slughorn
I
happen
to
know
you
see
a
lot
of
your
Uncle
Tiberius
because
he
has
a
rather
splendid
picture
of
the
two
of
you
hunting
nogtails
in
I
think
Norfolk
oh
yeah
that
was
fun
that
was
said
McLaggen
we
went
with
Bertie
Higgs
and
Rufus
Scrimgeour
this
was
before
he
became
Minister
obviously
ah
you
know
Bertie
and
Rufus
too
beamed
Slughorn
now
offering
around
a
small
tray
of
pies
somehow
Belby
was
missed
out
now
tell
me
it
was
as
Harry
had
suspected
everyone
here
seemed
to
have
been
invited
because
they
were
connected
to
somebody
well-known
or
influential
everyone
except
Ginny
zabini
who
was
interrogated
after
McLaggen
turned
out
to
have
a
famously
beautiful
witch
for
a
mother
from
what
Harry
could
make
out
she
had
been
married
seven
times
each
of
her
husbands
dying
mysteriously
and
leaving
her
mounds
of
gold
it
was
neville's
turn
next
This
was
a
very
uncomfortable
ten
minutes
for
neville's
parents
well-known
Aurors
had
been
tortured
into
insanity
by
Bellatrix
Lestrange
and
a
couple
of
Death
Eater
cronies
at
the
end
of
neville's
interview
Harry
had
the
impression
that
Slughorn
was
reserving
judgment
on
Neville
yet
to
see
whether
he
had
any
of
his
parents
flair
and
now
said
Slughorn
shifting
massively
in
his
seat
with
the
air
of
a
compere
introducing
his
star
act
harry
Potter
where
to
begin
i
feel
I
barely
scratched
the
surface
when
we
met
over
the
summer
he
contemplated
Harry
for
a
moment
as
though
he
was
a
particularly
large
and
succulent
piece
of
pheasant
then
said
The
Chosen
One
they're
calling
you
now
harry
said
nothing
belby
McLaggen
and
Zabini
were
all
staring
at
him
of
course
said
Slughorn
watching
Harry
closely
there
have
been
rumors
for
years
i
remember
when
well
after
that
terrible
night
lily
james
and
you
survived
and
the
word
was
that
you
must
have
powers
beyond
the
ordinary
zabini
gave
a
tiny
little
cough
that
was
clearly
supposed
to
indicate
amused
skepticism
an
angry
voice
burst
out
from
behind
Slughorn
yeah
Zabini
because
you're
so
talented
at
posing
oh
dear
chuckled
Slughorn
comfortably
looking
around
at
Ginny
who
was
glaring
at
Zabini
around
slughorn's
great
belly
you
want
to
be
careful
Blaise
i
saw
this
young
lady
perform
the
most
marvelous
Bat-Bogey
Hex
as
I
was
passing
her
carriage
i
wouldn't
cross
her
zabini
merely
looked
contemptuous
anyway
said
Slughorn
turning
back
to
Harry
such
rumors
this
summer
of
course
one
doesn't
know
what
to
believe
the
Prophet
has
been
known
to
print
inaccuracies
make
mistakes
but
there
seems
little
doubt
given
the
number
of
witnesses
that
there
was
quite
a
disturbance
at
the
Ministry
and
that
you
were
there
in
the
thick
of
it
all
harry
who
could
not
see
any
way
out
of
this
without
flatly
lying
nodded
but
still
said
nothing
slughorn
beamed
at
him
so
modest
so
modest
no
wonder
Dumbledore
is
so
fond
you
were
there
then
but
the
rest
of
the
stories
so
sensational
of
course
one
doesn't
know
quite
what
to
believe
this
fabled
prophecy
for
instance
we
never
heard
a
prophecy
said
Neville
turning
geranium
pink
as
he
said
it
that's
right
said
Ginny
staunchly
neville
and
I
were
both
there
too
and
all
this
Chosen
One
rubbish
is
just
the
Prophet
making
things
up
as
usual
you
were
both
there
too
were
you
said
Slughorn
with
great
interest
looking
from
Ginny
to
Neville
but
both
of
them
sat
clam-like
before
his
encouraging
smile
yes
well
it
is
true
that
the
Prophet
often
exaggerates
of
course
slughorn
said
sounding
a
little
disappointed
i
remember
dear
Gwenog
telling
me
Gwenog
Jones
I
mean
of
course
Captain
of
the
Holyhead
Harpies
he
meandered
off
into
a
long-winded
reminiscence
but
Harry
had
the
distinct
impression
that
Slughorn
had
not
finished
with
him
and
that
he
had
not
been
convinced
by
Neville
and
Ginny
the
afternoon
wore
on
with
more
anecdotes
about
illustrious
wizards
Slughorn
had
taught
all
of
whom
had
been
delighted
to
join
what
he
called
the
Slug
Club
at
Hogwarts
harry
could
not
wait
to
leave
but
couldn't
see
how
to
do
so
politely
finally
the
train
emerged
from
yet
another
long
misty
stretch
into
a
red
sunset
and
Slughorn
looked
around
blinking
in
the
twilight
good
gracious
it's
getting
dark
already
i
didn't
notice
that
they'd
lit
the
lamps
you'd
better
go
and
change
into
your
robes
all
of
you
mcLaggen
you
must
drop
by
and
borrow
that
book
on
nogtails
harry
Blaise
any
time
you're
passing
same
goes
for
you
miss
he
twinkled
at
Ginny
well
off
you
go
off
you
go
as
he
pushed
past
Harry
into
the
darkening
corridor
Zabini
shot
him
a
filthy
look
that
Harry
returned
with
interest
he
Ginny
and
Neville
followed
Zabini
back
along
the
train
i'm
glad
that's
over
muttered
Neville
strange
man
isn't
he
yeah
he
is
a
bit
said
Harry
his
eyes
on
Zabini
how
come
you
ended
up
in
there
Ginny
he
saw
me
hex
Zacharias
Smith
said
Ginny
you
remember
that
idiot
from
Hufflepuff
who
was
in
the
D
he
kept
on
and
on
asking
about
what
happened
at
the
Ministry
and
in
the
end
he
annoyed
me
so
much
I
hexed
him
when
Slughorn
came
in
I
thought
I
was
going
to
got
detention
but
he
just
thought
it
was
i
really
good
hex
and
invited
me
to
lunch
mad
eh
better
reason
for
inviting
someone
than
because
their
mother's
famous
said
Harry
scowling
at
the
back
of
zabini's
head
or
because
their
uncle
but
he
broke
off
an
idea
had
just
occurred
to
him
a
reckless
but
potentially
wonderful
idea
in
a
minute's
time
Zabini
was
going
to
reenter
the
Slytherin
sixth-year
compartment
and
Malfoy
would
be
sitting
there
thinking
himself
unheard
by
anybody
except
fellow
Slytherins
if
Harry
could
only
enter
unseen
behind
him
what
might
he
not
see
or
hear
true
there
was
little
of
the
journey
left
hogsmeade
Station
had
to
be
less
than
half
an
hour
away
judging
by
the
wildness
of
the
scenery
flashing
by
the
windows
but
nobody
else
seemed
prepared
to
take
harry's
suspicions
seriously
so
it
was
down
to
him
to
prove
them
i'll
see
you
two
later
said
Harry
under
his
breath
pulling
out
his
Invisibility
Cloak
and
flinging
it
over
himself
but
what're
you
asked
Neville
later
whispered
Harry
darting
after
Zabini
as
quietly
as
possible
though
the
rattling
of
the
train
made
such
caution
almost
pointless
the
corridors
were
almost
completely
empty
now
nearly
everyone
had
returned
to
their
carriages
to
change
into
their
school
robes
and
pack
up
their
possessions
though
he
was
as
close
as
he
could
get
to
Zabini
without
touching
him
Harry
was
not
quick
enough
to
slip
into
the
compartment
when
Zabini
opened
the
door
zabini
was
already
sliding
it
shut
when
Harry
hastily
stuck
out
his
foot
to
prevent
it
closing
what's
wrong
with
this
thing
said
Zabini
angrily
as
he
smashed
the
sliding
door
repeatedly
into
harry's
foot
harry
seized
the
door
and
pushed
it
open
hard
Zabini
still
clinging
on
to
the
handle
toppled
over
sideways
into
Gregory
goyle's
lap
and
in
the
ensuing
ruckus
Harry
darted
into
the
compartment
leapt
onto
zabini's
temporarily
empty
seat
and
hoisted
himself
up
into
the
luggage
rack
it
was
fortunate
that
Goyle
and
Zabini
were
snarling
at
each
other
drawing
all
eyes
onto
them
for
Harry
was
quite
sure
his
feet
and
ankles
had
been
revealed
as
the
cloak
had
flapped
around
them
indeed
for
one
horrible
moment
he
thought
he
saw
malfoy's
eyes
follow
his
trainer
as
it
whipped
upward
out
of
sight
but
then
Goyle
slammed
the
door
shut
and
flung
Zabini
off
him
Zabini
collapsed
into
his
own
seat
looking
ruffled
Vincent
Crabbe
returned
to
his
comic
and
Malfoy
sniggering
lay
back
down
across
two
seats
with
his
head
in
Pansy
Parkinsons
lap
harry
lay
curled
uncomfortably
under
the
cloak
to
ensure
that
every
inch
of
him
remained
hidden
and
watched
Pansy
stroke
the
sleek
blond
hair
off
malfoy's
forehead
smirking
as
she
did
so
as
though
anyone
would
have
loved
to
have
been
in
her
place
the
lanterns
swinging
from
the
carriage
ceiling
cast
a
bright
light
over
the
scene
Harry
could
read
every
word
of
crabbe's
comic
directly
below
him
so
Zabini
said
Malfoy
what
did
Slughorn
want
just
trying
to
make
up
to
well-connected
people
said
Zabini
who
was
still
glowering
at
Goyle
not
that
he
managed
to
find
many
this
information
did
not
seem
to
please
Malfoy
who
else
had
he
invited
he
demanded
mcLaggen
from
Gryffindor
said
Zabini
oh
yeah
his
uncle's
big
in
the
Ministry
said
Malfoy
someone
else
called
Belby
from
Ravenclaw
not
him
he's
a
prat
said
Pansy
and
Longbottom
Potter
and
that
Weasley
girl
finished
Zabini
malfoy
sat
up
very
suddenly
knocking
pansy's
hand
aside
he
invited
Longbottom
well
I
assume
so
as
Longbottom
was
there
said
Zabini
indifferently
what's
Longbottom
got
to
interest
Slughorn
zabini
shrugged
potter
precious
Potter
obviously
he
wanted
a
look
at
the
Chosen
One
sneered
Malfoy
but
that
Weasley
girl
what's
so
special
about
her
a
lot
of
boys
like
her
said
Pansy
watching
Malfoy
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eyes
for
his
reaction
even
you
think
she's
good-looking
don't
you
Blaise
and
we
all
know
how
hard
you
are
to
please
i
wouldn't
touch
a
filthy
little
blood
traitor
like
her
whatever
she
looked
like
said
Zabini
coldly
and
Pansy
looked
pleased
malfoy
sank
back
across
her
lap
and
allowed
her
to
resume
the
stroking
of
his
hair
well
I
pity
slughorn's
taste
maybe
he's
going
a
bit
senile
shame
my
father
always
said
he
was
a
good
wizard
in
his
day
my
father
used
to
be
a
bit
of
a
favorite
of
his
slughorn
probably
hasn't
heard
i'm
on
the
train
or
i
wouldn't
bank
on
an
invitation
said
Zabini
he
asked
me
about
Notts
father
when
I
first
arrived
they
used
to
be
old
friends
apparently
but
when
he
heard
he'd
been
caught
at
the
Ministry
he
didn't
look
happy
and
Nott
didn't
get
an
invitation
did
he
don't
think
slughorn's
interested
in
Death
Eaters
malfoy
looked
angry
but
forced
out
a
singularly
humorless
laugh
well
who
cares
what
he's
interested
in
what
is
he
when
you
come
down
to
it
just
some
stupid
teacher
malfoy
yawned
ostentatiously
mean
I
might
not
even
be
at
Hogwarts
next
year
what's
it
matter
to
me
if
some
fat
old
has-been
likes
me
or
not
what
do
you
mean
you
might
not
be
at
Hogwarts
next
year
said
Pansy
indignantly
ceasing
grooming
Malfoy
at
once
well
you
never
know
said
Malfoy
with
the
ghost
of
a
smirk
i
might
have
er
moved
on
to
bigger
and
better
things
crouched
in
the
luggage
rack
under
his
cloak
harry's
heart
began
to
race
what
would
Ron
and
Hermione
say
about
this
crabbe
and
Goyle
were
gawping
at
Malfoy
apparently
they
had
had
no
inkling
of
any
plans
to
move
on
to
bigger
and
better
things
even
Zabini
had
allowed
a
look
of
curiosity
to
mar
his
haughty
features
pansy
resumed
the
slow
stroking
of
Malfoy
s
hair
looking
dumbfounded
do
you
mean
malfoy
shrugged
mother
wants
me
to
complete
my
education
but
personally
I
don't
see
it
as
that
important
these
days
i
mean
think
about
it
when
the
Dark
Lord
takes
over
is
he
going
to
care
how
many
OWLs
or
N
e.w.t.s
anyone's
got
of
course
he
isn't
it'll
be
all
about
the
kind
of
service
he
received
the
level
of
devotion
he
was
shown
and
you
think
you'll
be
able
to
do
something
for
him
asked
zabini
scathingly
sixteen
years
old
and
noi
even
fully
qualified
yet
i've
just
said
haven't
I
maybe
he
doesn't
care
if
i'm
qualified
maybe
the
job
he
wants
me
to
do
isn't
something
that
you
need
to
be
qualified
for
said
Malfoy
quietly
crabbe
and
Goyle
were
both
sitting
with
their
mouths
open
like
gargoyles
pansy
was
gazing
down
at
Malfoy
as
though
she
had
never
seen
anything
so
awe-inspiring
i
can
see
Hogwarts
said
Malfoy
clearly
relishing
the
effect
he
had
created
as
he
pointed
out
of
the
blackened
window
we'd
better
get
our
robes
on
harry
was
so
busy
staring
at
Malfoy
he
did
not
notice
Goyle
reaching
up
for
his
trunk
as
he
swung
it
down
it
hit
Harry
hard
on
the
side
of
the
head
he
let
out
an
involuntary
gasp
of
pain
and
Malfoy
looked
up
at
the
luggage
rack
frowning
harry
was
not
afraid
of
Malfoy
but
he
still
did
not
much
like
the
idea
of
being
discovered
hiding
under
his
Invisibility
Cloak
by
a
group
of
unfriendly
Slytherins
eyes
still
watering
and
head
still
throbbing
he
drew
his
wand
careful
not
to
disarrange
the
cloak
and
waited
breath
held
to
his
relief
Malfoy
seemed
to
decide
that
he
had
imagined
the
noise
he
pulled
on
his
robes
like
the
others
locked
his
trunk
and
as
the
train
slowed
to
a
jerky
crawl
fastened
a
thick
new
traveling
cloak
round
his
neck
harry
could
see
the
corridors
filling
up
again
and
hoped
that
Hermione
and
Ron
would
take
his
things
out
onto
the
platform
for
him
he
was
stuck
where
he
was
until
the
compartment
had
quite
emptied
at
last
with
a
final
lurch
the
train
came
to
a
complete
halt
goyle
threw
the
door
open
and
muscled
his
way
out
into
a
crowd
of
second
years
punching
them
aside
Crabbe
and
Zabini
followed
you
go
on
Malfoy
told
Pansy
who
was
waiting
for
him
with
her
hand
held
out
as
though
hoping
he
would
hold
it
i
just
want
to
check
something
pansy
left
now
Harry
and
Malfoy
were
alone
in
the
compartment
people
were
filing
past
descending
onto
the
dark
platform
malfoy
moved
over
to
the
compartment
door
and
let
down
the
blinds
so
that
people
in
the
corridor
beyond
could
not
peer
in
he
then
bent
down
over
his
trunk
and
opened
it
again
harry
peered
down
over
the
edge
of
the
luggage
rack
his
heart
pumping
a
little
faster
what
had
Malfoy
wanted
to
hide
from
Pansy
was
he
about
to
see
the
mysterious
broken
object
it
was
so
important
to
mend
petrificus
Totalus
without
warning
Malfoy
pointed
his
wand
at
Harry
who
was
instantly
paralyzed
as
though
in
slow
motion
he
toppled
out
of
the
luggage
rack
and
fell
with
an
agonizing
floor-shaking
crash
at
malfoy's
feet
the
Invisibility
Cloak
trapped
beneath
him
his
whole
body
revealed
with
his
legs
still
curled
absurdly
into
the
cramped
kneeling
position
he
couldn't
move
a
muscle
he
could
only
gaze
up
at
Malfoy
who
smiled
broadly
i
thought
so
he
said
jubilantly
i
heard
goyle's
trunk
hit
you
and
I
thought
I
saw
something
white
flash
through
the
air
after
Zabini
came
back
his
eyes
lingered
for
a
moment
upon
harry's
trainers
you
didn't
hear
anything
I
care
about
Potter
but
while
i've
got
you
here
and
he
stamped
hard
on
harry's
face
harry
felt
his
nose
break
blood
spurted
everywhere
that's
from
my
father
now
let's
see
malfoy
dragged
the
cloak
out
from
under
harry's
immobilized
body
and
threw
it
over
him
i
don't
reckon
they'll
find
you
till
the
trains
back
in
London
he
said
quietly
see
you
around
Potter
or
not
and
taking
care
to
tread
on
harry's
fingers
Malfoy
left
the
compartment
chapter
Victorious
Snape
harry
could
not
move
a
muscle
he
lay
there
beneath
the
Invisibility
Cloak
feeling
the
blood
from
his
nose
flow
hot
and
wet
over
his
face
listening
to
the
voices
and
footsteps
in
the
corridor
beyond
his
immediate
thought
was
that
someone
would
surely
check
the
compartments
before
the
train
departed
again
but
at
once
came
the
dispiriting
realization
that
even
if
somebody
looked
into
the
compartment
he
would
be
neither
seen
nor
heard
his
best
hope
was
that
somebody
else
would
walk
in
and
step
on
him
harry
had
never
hated
Malfoy
more
than
as
he
lay
there
like
an
absurd
turtle
on
its
back
blood
dripping
sickeningly
into
his
open
mouth
what
a
stupid
situation
to
have
landed
himself
in
and
now
the
last
few
footsteps
were
dying
away
everyone
was
shuffling
along
the
dark
platform
outside
he
could
hear
the
scraping
of
trunks
and
loud
babble
of
talk
ron
and
Hermione
would
think
that
he
had
left
the
train
without
them
once
they
arrived
at
Hogwarts
and
took
their
places
in
the
Great
Hall
looked
up
and
down
the
Gryffindor
table
a
few
times
and
finally
realized
that
he
was
not
there
he
no
doubt
would
be
halfway
back
to
London
he
tried
to
make
a
sound
even
a
grunt
but
it
was
impossible
then
he
remembered
that
some
wizards
like
Dumbledore
could
perform
spells
without
speaking
so
he
tried
to
summon
his
wand
which
had
fallen
out
of
his
hand
by
saying
the
words
Accio
Wand
over
and
over
again
in
his
head
but
nothing
happened
he
thought
he
could
hear
the
rustling
of
the
trees
that
surrounded
the
lake
and
the
far-off
hoot
of
an
owl
but
no
hint
of
a
search
being
made
or
even
he
despised
himself
slightly
for
hoping
it
panicked
voices
wondering
where
Harry
Potter
had
gone
a
feeling
of
hopelessness
spread
through
him
as
he
imagined
the
convoy
of
thestral-drawn
carriages
trundling
up
to
the
school
and
the
muffled
yells
of
laughter
issuing
from
whichever
carriage
Malfoy
was
riding
in
where
he
could
be
recounting
his
attack
on
Harry
to
Crabbe
Goyle
Zabini
and
Pansy
Parkinson
the
train
lurched
causing
Harry
to
roll
over
onto
his
side
now
he
was
staring
at
the
dusty
underside
of
the
seats
instead
of
the
ceiling
the
floor
began
to
vibrate
as
the
engine
roared
into
life
the
Express
was
leaving
and
nobody
knew
he
was
still
on
it
then
he
felt
his
Invisibility
Cloak
fly
off
him
and
a
voice
overhead
said
Wotcher
Harry
there
was
a
flash
of
red
light
and
harry's
body
unfroze
he
was
able
to
push
himself
into
a
more
dignified
sitting
position
hastily
wipe
the
blood
off
his
bruised
race
with
the
back
of
his
hand
and
raise
his
head
to
look
up
at
Tonks
who
was
holding
the
Invisibiliiy
Cloak
she
had
just
pulled
away
we'd
better
get
out
of
here
quickly
she
said
as
the
train
windows
became
obscured
with
steam
and
they
began
to
move
out
of
the
station
come
on
we'll
jump
harry
hurried
after
her
into
the
corridor
she
pulled
open
the
train
door
and
leapt
onto
the
platform
which
seemed
to
be
sliding
underneath
them
as
the
train
gathered
momentum
he
followed
her
staggered
a
little
on
landing
then
straightened
up
in
time
to
see
the
gleaming
scarlet
steam
engine
pick
up
speed
round
the
corner
and
disappear
from
view
the
cold
night
air
was
soothing
on
his
throbbing
nose
tonks
was
looking
at
him
he
felt
angry
and
embarrassed
that
he
had
been
discovered
in
such
a
ridiculous
position
silently
she
handed
him
back
the
Invisibility
Cloak
who
did
it
draco
Malfoy
said
Harry
bitterly
thanks
for
well
no
problem
said
Tonks
without
smiling
from
what
Harry
could
see
in
the
darkness
she
was
as
mousy-haired
and
miserable-lookinng
as
she
had
been
when
he
had
met
her
at
the
Burrow
i
can
fix
your
nose
if
you
stand
still
harry
did
not
think
much
of
this
idea
he
had
been
intending
to
visit
Madam
Pomfrey
the
matron
in
whom
he
had
a
little
more
confidence
when
it
came
to
Healing
Spells
but
it
seemed
rude
to
say
this
so
he
stayed
stock-still
and
closed
his
eyes
episkey
said
Tonks
harrys
nose
felt
very
hot
and
then
very
cold
he
raised
a
hand
and
felt
gingerly
it
seemed
to
be
mended
thanks
a
lot
you'd
better
put
that
cloak
back
on
and
we
can
walk
up
to
the
school
said
Tonks
still
unsmiling
as
Harry
swung
the
cloak
back
over
himself
she
waved
her
wand
an
immense
silvery
four-legged
creature
erupted
from
it
and
streaked
off
into
the
darkness
was
that
a
Patronus
asked
Harry
who
had
seen
Dumbledore
send
messages
like
this
yes
i'm
sending
word
to
the
castle
that
i've
got
you
or
they'll
worry
come
on
we'd
better
not
dawdle
they
set
off
toward
the
lane
that
led
to
the
school
how
did
you
find
me
i
noticed
you
hadn't
left
the
train
and
I
knew
you
had
that
cloak
i
thought
you
might
be
hiding
for
some
reason
when
I
saw
the
blinds
were
drawn
down
on
that
compartment
I
thought
Id
check
but
what
are
you
doing
here
anyway
harry
asked
i'm
stationed
in
Hogsmeade
now
to
give
the
school
extra
protection
said
Tonks
is
it
just
you
who's
stationed
up
here
or
no
Proudfoot
Savage
and
Dawlish
are
here
too
dawlish
that
Auror
Dumbledore
attacked
last
year
that's
right
they
trudged
up
the
dark
deserted
lane
following
the
freshly
made
carriage
tracks
harry
looked
sideways
at
Tonks
under
his
cloak
last
year
she
had
been
inquisitive
to
the
point
of
being
a
little
annoying
at
times
she
had
laughed
easily
she
had
made
jokes
now
she
seemed
older
and
much
more
serious
and
purposeful
was
this
all
the
effect
of
what
had
happened
at
the
Ministry
he
reflected
uncomfortably
that
Hermione
would
have
suggested
he
say
something
consoling
about
Sirius
to
her
that
it
hadn't
been
her
fault
at
all
but
he
couldn't
bring
himself
to
do
it
he
was
far
from
blaming
her
for
sirius's
death
it
was
no
more
her
fault
than
anyone
elses
and
much
less
than
his
but
he
did
not
like
talking
about
Sirius
if
he
could
avoid
it
and
so
they
tramped
on
through
the
cold
night
in
silence
tonks's
long
cloak
whispering
on
the
ground
behind
them
having
always
traveled
there
by
carriage
Harry
had
never
before
appreciated
just
how
far
Hogwarts
was
from
Hogsmeade
Station
with
great
relief
he
finally
saw
the
tall
pillars
on
either
side
of
the
gates
each
topped
with
a
winged
boar
he
was
cold
he
was
hungry
and
he
was
quite
keen
to
leave
this
new
gloomy
Tonks
behind
but
when
he
put
out
a
hand
to
push
open
the
gates
he
found
them
chained
shut
alohomora
he
said
confidently
pointing
his
wand
at
the
padlock
but
nothing
happened
that
won't
work
on
these
said
Tonks
dumbledore
bewitched
them
himself
harry
looked
around
I
could
climb
a
wall
he
suggested
no
you
couldn't
said
Tonks
flatly
anti-intruder
jinxes
on
all
of
them
security's
been
tightened
a
hundredfold
this
summer
well
then
said
Harry
starting
to
feel
annoyed
at
her
lack
of
helpfulness
I
suppose
i'll
just
have
to
sleep
out
here
and
wait
for
morning
someone's
coming
down
for
you
said
Tonks
Look
a
lantern
was
bobbing
at
the
distant
foot
of
the
castle
harry
was
so
pleased
to
see
it
he
felt
he
could
even
endure
filch's
wheezy
criticisms
of
his
tardiness
and
rants
about
how
his
timekeeping
would
improve
with
the
regular
application
of
thumbscrews
it
was
not
until
the
glowing
yellow
light
was
ten
feet
away
from
them
and
had
pulled
off
his
Invisibility
Cloak
so
that
he
could
be
seen
that
he
recognized
with
a
rush
of
pure
loathing
the
uplit
hooked
nose
and
long
black
greasy
hair
of
Severus
Snape
well
well
well
sneered
Snape
taking
out
his
wand
and
tapping
the
padlock
once
so
that
the
chains
snaked
backward
and
the
gates
creaked
open
nice
of
you
to
turn
up
Potter
although
you
have
evidently
decided
that
the
wearing
of
school
robes
would
detract
from
your
appearance
i
couldn't
change
I
didn't
have
my
Harry
began
but
Snape
cut
across
him
there
is
no
need
to
wait
Nymphadora
Potter
is
quite
ah
safe
in
my
hands
i
meant
Hagrid
to
get
the
message
said
Tonks
frowning
hagrid
was
late
for
the
start-of-term
feast
just
like
Potter
here
so
I
took
it
instead
and
incidentally
said
Snape
standing
back
to
allow
Harry
to
pass
him
I
was
interested
to
see
your
new
Patronus
he
shut
the
gates
in
her
face
with
a
loud
clang
and
tapped
the
chains
with
his
wand
again
so
that
they
slithered
clinking
back
into
place
i
think
you
were
better
off
with
the
old
one
said
Snape
the
malice
in
his
voice
unmistakable
the
new
one
looks
weak
as
Snape
swung
the
lantern
about
Harry
saw
fleetingly
a
look
of
shock
and
anger
on
tonks's
face
then
she
was
covered
in
darkness
once
more
good
night
Harry
called
to
her
over
his
shoulder
as
he
began
the
walk
up
to
the
school
with
Snape
thanks
for
everything
see
you
Harry
snape
did
not
speak
for
a
minute
or
so
harry
felt
as
though
his
body
was
generating
waves
of
hatred
so
powerful
that
it
seemed
incredible
that
Snape
could
not
feel
them
burning
him
he
had
loathed
Snape
from
their
first
encounter
but
Snape
had
placed
himself
forever
and
irrevocably
beyond
the
possibility
of
harry's
forgiveness
by
his
attitude
toward
Sirius
whatever
Dumbledore
said
Harry
had
had
time
to
think
over
the
summer
and
had
concluded
that
snape's
snide
remarks
to
Sirius
about
remaining
safely
hidden
while
the
rest
of
the
Order
of
the
Phoenix
were
off
fighting
Voldemort
had
probably
been
a
powerful
factor
in
Sirius
rushing
off
to
the
Ministry
the
night
that
he
had
died
harry
clung
to
this
notion
because
it
enabled
him
to
blame
Snape
which
felt
satisfying
and
also
because
he
knew
that
if
anyone
was
not
sorry
that
Sirius
was
dead
it
was
the
man
now
striding
next
to
him
in
the
darkness
fifty
points
from
Gryffindor
for
lateness
I
think
said
Snape
and
let
me
see
another
twenty
for
your
Muggle
attire
you
know
I
dont
believe
any
House
has
ever
been
in
negative
figures
this
early
in
the
term
We
haven't
even
started
pudding
you
might
have
set
a
record
Potter
the
fury
and
hatred
bubbling
inside
Harry
seemed
to
blaze
white-hot
but
he
would
rather
have
been
immobilized
all
the
way
back
to
London
than
tell
Snape
why
he
was
late
i
suppose
you
wanted
to
make
an
entrance
did
you
snape
continued
and
with
no
flying
car
available
you
decided
that
bursting
into
the
Great
Hall
halfway
through
the
feast
ought
to
create
a
dramatic
effect
still
Harry
remained
silent
though
he
thought
his
chest
might
explode
he
knew
that
Snape
had
come
to
fetch
him
for
this
for
the
few
minutes
when
he
could
needle
and
torment
Harry
without
anyone
else
listening
they
reached
the
castle
steps
at
last
and
as
the
great
oaken
front
doors
swung
open
into
the
vast
flagged
entrance
hall
a
burst
of
talk
and
laughter
and
of
tinkling
plates
and
glasses
greeted
them
through
the
doors
standing
open
into
the
Great
Hail
harry
wondered
whether
he
could
slip
his
Invisibility
Cloak
back
on
thereby
gaining
his
seat
at
the
long
Gryffindor
table
which
inconveniently
was
the
farthest
from
the
entrance
hall
without
being
noticed
as
though
he
had
read
harry's
mind
however
Snape
said
No
cloak
you
can
walk
in
so
that
everyone
sees
you
which
is
what
you
wanted
i'm
sure
harry
turned
on
the
spot
and
marched
straight
through
the
open
doors
anything
to
get
away
from
Snape
the
Great
Hall
with
its
four
long
House
tables
and
its
staff
table
set
at
the
top
of
the
room
was
decorated
as
usual
with
floating
candles
that
made
the
plates
below
glitter
and
glow
it
was
all
a
shimmering
blur
to
Harry
however
who
walked
so
fast
that
he
was
passing
the
Hufflepuff
table
before
people
really
started
to
stare
and
by
the
time
they
were
standing
up
to
get
a
good
look
at
him
he
had
spotted
Ron
and
Hermione
sped
along
the
benches
toward
them
and
forced
his
way
in
between
them
where've
you
blimey
what've
you
done
to
your
face
said
Ron
goggling
at
him
along
with
everyone
else
in
the
vicinity
why
what's
wrong
with
it
said
Harry
grabbing
a
spoon
and
squinting
at
his
distorted
reflection
you're
covered
in
blood
said
Hermione
come
here
she
raised
her
wand
said
Tergeo
and
siphoned
off
the
dried
blood
thanks
said
Harry
feeling
his
now
clean
face
how's
my
nose
looking
normal
said
Hermoine
anxiously
why
shouldn't
it
harry
what
happened
we've
been
terrified
i'll
tell
you
later
said
Harry
curtly
he
was
very
conscious
that
Ginny
Neville
Dean
and
Seamus
were
listening
in
even
Nearly
Headless
Nick
the
Gryffindor
ghost
had
come
floating
along
the
bench
to
eavesdrop
but
said
Hermione
not
now
Hermione
said
Harry
in
a
darkly
significant
voice
he
hoped
very
much
that
they
would
all
assume
he
had
been
involved
in
something
heroic
preferably
involving
a
couple
of
Death
Eaters
and
a
dementor
of
course
Malfoy
would
spread
the
story
as
wide
as
he
could
but
there
was
always
a
chance
it
wouldn't
reach
too
many
Gryffindor
ears
he
reached
across
Ron
for
a
couple
of
chicken
legs
and
a
handful
of
chips
but
before
he
could
take
them
they
vanished
to
be
replaced
with
puddings
you
missed
the
Sorting
anyway
said
Hermione
as
Ron
dived
for
a
large
chocolate
gateau
hat
say
anything
interesting
asked
Harry
taking
a
piece
of
treacle
tart
more
of
the
same
really
advising
us
all
to
unite
in
the
face
enemies
you
know
dumbledore
mentioned
Voldemort
at
all
not
yet
but
he
always
saves
his
proper
speech
for
after
the
the
feast
doesn't
he
it
can't
be
long
now
snape
said
Hagrid
was
late
for
the
feast
you've
seen
Snape
how
come
said
Ron
between
frenzied
mouthfuls
of
gateau
bumped
into
him
said
Harry
evasively
hagrid
was
only
a
few
minutes
late
said
Hermione
look
he's
waving
at
you
Harry
harry
looked
up
at
the
staff
table
and
grinned
at
Hagrid
who
was
indeed
waving
at
him
hagrid
had
never
quite
managed
to
comport
himself
with
the
dignity
of
Professor
McGonagall
Head
of
Gryffindor
House
the
top
of
whose
head
came
up
to
somewhere
between
hagrid's
elbow
and
shoulder
as
they
were
sitting
side
by
side
and
who
was
looking
disapprovingly
at
this
enthusiastic
greeting
harry
was
surprised
to
see
the
Divination
teacher
Professor
Trelawney
sitting
on
hagrid's
other
side
she
rarely
left
her
tower
room
and
he
had
never
seen
her
at
the
start-of-term
feast
before
she
looked
as
odd
as
ever
glittering
with
beads
and
trailing
shawls
her
eyes
magnified
to
enormous
size
by
her
spectacles
having
always
considered
her
a
bit
of
a
fraud
Harry
had
been
shocked
to
discover
at
the
end
of
the
previous
term
that
it
had
been
she
who
had
made
the
prediction
that
caused
Lord
Voldemort
to
kill
harry's
parents
and
attack
Harry
himself
the
knowledge
made
him
even
less
eager
to
find
himself
in
her
company
thankfully
this
year
he
would
be
dropping
Divination
her
great
beaconlike
eyes
swiveled
in
his
direction
he
hastily
looked
away
toward
the
Slytherin
table
draco
Malfoy
was
miming
the
shatterering
of
a
nose
to
raucous
laughter
and
applause
harry
dropped
his
gaze
to
his
treacle
tart
his
insides
burning
again
what
he
would
give
to
fight
Malfoy
one-on-one
so
what
did
Professor
Slughorn
want
hermione
asked
to
know
what
really
happened
at
the
Ministry
said
Harry
him
and
everyone
else
here
sniffed
Hermione
people
were
interrogating
us
about
it
on
the
train
weren't
they
Ron
yeah
said
Ron
all
wanting
to
know
if
you
really
are
the
Chosen
One
there
has
been
much
talk
on
that
very
subject
even
amongst
the
ghosts
interrupted
Nearly
Headless
Nick
inclining
his
barely
connected
head
toward
Harry
so
that
it
wobbled
dangerously
on
its
ruff
i
am
considered
something
of
a
Potter
authority
it
is
widely
known
that
we
are
friendly
i
have
assured
the
spirit
community
that
I
will
not
pester
you
for
information
however
harry
Potter
knows
that
he
can
confide
in
me
with
complete
confidence
I
told
them
i
would
rather
die
than
betray
his
trust
that's
not
saying
much
seeing
as
you're
already
dead
Ron
observed
once
again
you
show
all
the
sensitivity
of
a
blunt
axe
said
Nearly
Headless
Nick
in
affronted
tones
and
he
rose
into
the
air
and
glided
back
toward
the
far
end
of
the
Gryffindor
table
just
as
Dumbledore
got
to
his
feet
at
the
staff
table
the
talk
and
laughter
echoing
around
the
Hall
died
away
almost
instantly
the
very
best
of
evenings
to
you
he
said
smiling
broadly
his
arms
opened
wide
as
though
to
embrace
the
whole
room
what
happened
to
his
hand
gasped
Hermione
she
was
not
the
only
one
who
had
noticed
dumbledore's
right
hand
was
as
blackened
and
dead-looking
as
it
had
been
on
the
night
he
had
come
to
fetch
Harry
from
the
Dursleys
whispers
it
the
room
Dumbledore
interpreting
them
correctly
merely
smiled
and
shook
his
purple-and-gold
sleeve
over
his
injury
nothing
to
worry
about
he
said
airily
now
to
our
new
students
welcome
to
our
old
students
welcome
back
another
year
full
of
magical
education
awaits
you
his
hand
was
like
that
when
I
saw
him
over
the
summer
harry
whispered
to
Hermione
i
thought
he'd
have
cured
it
by
now
though
or
Madam
Pomfrey
would've
done
it
looks
as
if
it's
died
said
Hermione
with
a
nauseated
expression
but
there
are
some
injuries
you
can't
cure
old
curses
and
there
are
poisons
without
antidotes
and
mr.
Filch
our
caretaker
has
asked
me
to
say
that
there
is
a
blanket
ban
on
any
joke
items
bought
at
the
shop
called
Weasleys
Wizard
Wheezes
those
wishing
to
play
for
their
House
Quidditch
teams
should
give
their
names
to
their
Heads
of
House
as
usual
we
are
also
looking
for
new
Quidditch
commentators
who
should
do
likewise
we
are
pleased
to
welcome
a
new
member
of
staff
this
year
Professor
Slughorn
Slughorn
stood
up
his
bald
head
gleaming
in
the
candlelight
his
big
waistcoated
belly
casting
the
table
into
shadow
is
a
former
colleague
of
mine
who
has
agreed
to
resume
his
old
post
of
Potions
master
potions
potions
the
word
echoed
all
over
the
Hall
as
people
wondered
wheel
they
had
heard
right
potions
said
Ron
and
Hermione
together
turning
to
stare
Harry
but
you
said
professor
Snape
meanwhile
said
Dumbledore
raising
voice
so
that
it
carried
over
all
the
muttering
will
be
taking
the
position
of
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
teacher
no
said
Harry
so
loudly
that
many
heads
turned
in
his
direction
he
did
not
care
he
was
staring
up
at
the
staff
table
incensed
how
could
Snape
be
given
the
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
job
after
all
this
time
hadn't
it
been
widely
known
for
years
that
Dumbledore
did
not
trust
him
to
do
it
but
Harry
you
said
that
Slughorn
was
going
to
be
teaching
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
said
Hermione
i
thought
he
was
said
Harry
racking
his
brains
to
remember
when
Dumbledore
had
told
him
this
but
now
that
he
came
to
think
of
it
he
was
unable
to
recall
Dumbledore
ever
telling
him
what
Slughorn
would
be
teaching
snape
who
was
sitting
on
dumbledore's
right
did
not
stand
up
his
mention
of
his
name
he
merely
raised
a
hand
in
lazy
acknowledgment
of
the
applause
from
the
Slytherin
table
yet
Harry
was
sure
he
could
detect
a
look
of
triumph
on
the
features
he
loathed
so
much
well
there's
one
good
thing
he
said
savagely
snape'll
be
gone
by
the
end
of
the
year
what
do
you
mean
asked
Ron
that
job's
jinxed
no
ones
lasted
more
than
a
year
quirrell
actually
died
doing
it
personally
i'm
going
to
keep
my
fingers
crossed
for
another
death
harry
said
Hermione
shocked
and
reproachful
he
might
just
go
back
to
teaching
Potions
at
the
end
of
the
year
said
Ron
reasonably
that
Slughorn
bloke
might
not
want
to
stay
long-term
moody
didn't
dumbledore
cleared
his
throat
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
were
not
the
only
ones
who
had
been
talking
the
whole
Hall
had
erupted
in
a
buzz
of
conversation
at
the
news
that
Snape
had
finally
achieved
his
hearts
desire
seemingly
oblivious
to
the
sensational
nature
of
the
news
he
had
just
imparted
Dumbledore
said
nothing
more
about
staff
appointments
but
waited
a
few
seconds
to
ensure
that
the
silence
was
absolute
before
continuing
now
as
everybody
in
this
Hall
knows
Lord
Voldemort
and
his
followers
are
once
more
at
large
and
gaining
in
strength
the
silence
seemed
to
tauten
and
strain
as
Dumbledore
spoke
harry
glanced
at
Malfoy
malfoy
was
not
looking
at
Dumbledore
but
making
his
fork
hover
in
midair
with
his
wand
as
though
he
found
the
headmaster's
words
unworthy
of
his
attention
i
cannot
emphasize
strongly
enough
how
dangerous
the
present
situation
is
and
how
much
care
each
of
us
at
Hogwarts
must
take
to
ensure
that
we
remain
safe
the
castles
magical
fortifications
have
been
strengthened
over
the
summer
we
are
protected
in
new
and
more
powerful
ways
but
we
must
still
guard
scrupulously
against
carelessness
on
the
part
of
any
student
or
member
of
staff
i
urge
you
therefore
to
abide
by
any
security
restrictions
that
you
teachers
might
impose
upon
you
however
irksome
you
might
find
them
in
particular
the
rule
that
you
are
not
to
be
out
of
after
hours
i
implore
you
should
you
notice
anything
strange
or
suspicious
within
or
outside
the
castle
to
report
it
to
a
member
of
staff
immediately
i
trust
you
to
conduct
yourselves
always
with
the
utmost
regard
for
your
own
and
others
safety
dumbledore's
blue
eyes
swept
over
the
students
before
he
smiled
once
more
but
now
your
beds
await
as
warm
and
comfortable
as
you
could
possibly
wish
and
I
know
that
your
top
priority
is
to
be
well-rested
for
your
lessons
tomorrow
let
us
therefore
say
good
night
pip
pip
with
the
usual
deafening
scraping
noise
the
benches
moved
back
and
the
hundreds
of
students
began
to
file
out
of
the
Great
Hall
toward
their
dormitories
harry
who
was
in
no
hurry
at
all
to
leave
with
the
gawping
crowd
nor
to
get
near
enough
to
Malfoy
to
allow
him
to
retell
the
story
of
the
nose-stamping
lagged
behind
pretending
to
retie
the
lace
on
his
trainer
allowing
most
of
Gryffindors
to
draw
ahead
of
him
hermione
had
darted
ahead
to
fulfill
her
prefect's
duty
of
shepherding
the
first
years
but
Ron
remained
with
Harry
what
really
happened
to
your
nose
he
asked
once
they
were
at
the
very
back
of
the
throng
pressing
out
of
the
Hall
and
out
of
earshot
of
anyone
else
harry
told
him
it
was
a
mark
of
the
strength
of
their
friendship
that
Ron
did
not
laugh
i
saw
Malfoy
miming
something
to
do
with
a
nose
he
said
darkly
yeah
well
never
mind
that
said
Harry
bitterly
listen
to
what
he
was
saying
before
he
found
out
I
was
there
harry
had
expected
Ron
to
be
stunned
by
Malfoys
boasts
with
what
Harry
considered
pure
pigheadedness
however
Ron
was
unimpressed
come
on
Harry
he
was
just
showing
off
for
Parkinson
what
kind
of
mission
would
You-Know-Who
have
given
him
how
d'you
know
Voldemort
doesn't
need
someone
at
Hogwarts
it
wouldn't
be
the
first
i
wish
yeh'd
stop
sayin
tha
name
Harry
said
a
reproachful
voice
behind
them
harry
looked
over
his
shoulder
to
see
Hagtid
shaking
his
head
dumbledore
uses
that
name
said
Harry
stubbornly
yeah
well
tha's
Dumbledore
innit
said
Hagrid
mysteriously
so
how
come
yeh
were
late
Harry
i
was
worried
got
held
up
on
the
train
said
Harry
why
were
you

with
Grawp
said
Hagrid
happily
los
track
o
the
time
he's
got
a
new
home
up
in
the
mountains
now
Dumbledore
fixed
it
nice
big
cave
he's
much
happier
than
he
was
in
the
forest
we
were
havin
a
good
chat
really
said
Harry
taking
care
not
to
catch
ron's
eye
the
last
time
he
had
met
hagrid's
half-brother
a
vicious
giant
with
a
talent
for
ripping
up
trees
by
the
roots
his
vocabulary
had
comprised
five
words
two
of
which
he
was
unable
to
pronounce
properly
oh
yeah
he's
really
come
on
said
Hagrid
proudly
yeh'll
be
amazed
i'm
thinkin
o
trainin
him
up
as
me
assistant
ron
snorted
loudly
but
managed
to
pass
it
off
as
a
violent
sneeze
they
were
now
standing
beside
the
oak
front
doors
anyway
i'll
see
yeh
tomorrow
firs
lesson's
straight
after
lunch
come
early
an
yeh
can
say
hello
ter
Buck
I
mean
Witherwings
raising
an
arm
in
cheery
farewell
he
headed
out
of
the
doors
into
the
darkness
harry
and
Ron
looked
at
each
other
harry
could
tell
that
Ron
was
experiencing
the
same
sinking
feeling
as
himself
you're
not
taking
Care
of
Magical
Creatures
are
you
ron
shook
his
head
and
you're
not
either
are
you
harry
shook
his
head
too
and
Hermione
said
Ron
she's
not
is
she
harry
shook
his
head
again
exactly
what
Hagrid
would
say
when
he
realized
his
three
favorite
students
had
given
up
his
subject
he
did
not
like
to
think
chapter
The
Half-Blood
Prince
harry
and
Ron
met
Hermione
in
the
common
room
before
breakfast
next
morning
hoping
for
some
support
in
his
theory
Harry
lost
no
time
in
telling
Hermione
what
he
had
overheard
Malfoy
saying
on
the
Hogwarts
Express
but
he
was
obviously
showing
off
for
Parkinson
wasn't
he
interjected
Ron
quickly
before
Hermione
could
say
anything
well
she
said
uncertainly
I
don't
know
it
would
be
like
Malfoy
to
make
himself
seem
more
important
than
he
is
but
that's
a
big
lie
to
tell
exactly
said
Harry
but
he
could
nor
press
the
point
because
so
many
people
were
trying
to
listen
in
to
his
conversation
not
to
mention
staring
at
him
and
whispering
behind
their
hands
it's
rude
to
point
Ron
snapped
at
a
particularly
minuscule
first-year
boy
as
they
joined
the
queue
to
climb
out
of
the
portrait
hole
the
boy
who
had
been
muttering
something
about
Harry
behind
his
hand
to
his
friend
promptly
turned
scarlet
and
toppled
out
of
the
hole
in
alarm
ron
sniggered
i
love
being
a
sixth
year
and
were
going
to
be
getting
free
time
this
year
whole
periods
when
we
can
just
sit
up
here
and
relax
we're
going
to
need
that
time
for
studying
Ron
said
Hermione
as
they
set
off
down
the
corridor
yeah
but
not
today
said
Ron
today's
going
to
be
a
real
loss
I
reckon
hold
it
said
Hermione
throwing
out
an
arm
and
halting
a
passing
fourth
year
who
was
attempting
to
push
past
her
with
a
lime-green
disk
clutched
tightly
in
his
hand
fanged
Frisbees
banned
hand
it
over
she
told
him
sternly
the
scowling
boy
handed
over
the
snarling
Frisbee
ducked
under
her
arm
and
took
off
after
his
friends
ron
waited
for
him
to
vanish
then
tugged
the
Frisbee
from
hermione's
grip
excellent
i've
always
wanted
one
of
these
hermione's
remonstration
was
drowned
by
a
loud
giggle
Lavender
Brown
had
apparently
found
ron's
remark
highly
amusing
she
continued
to
laugh
as
she
passed
them
glancing
back
at
Ron
over
her
shoulder
ron
looked
rather
pleased
with
himself
the
ceiling
of
the
Great
Hall
was
serenely
blue
and
streaked
with
frail
wispy
clouds
just
like
the
squares
of
sky
visible
through
the
high
mullioned
windows
while
they
tucked
into
porridge
and
eggs
and
bacon
Harry
and
Ron
told
Hermione
about
their
embarassing
conversation
with
Hagrid
the
previous
evening
but
he
can't
really
think
we'd
continue
Care
of
Magical
Creatures
she
said
looking
distressed
i
mean
when
has
any
of
us
expressed
you
know
any
enthusiasm
that's
it
though
innit
said
Ron
swallowing
an
entire
fried
egg
whole
we
were
the
ones
who
made
the
most
effort
in
classes
because
we
like
hagrid
but
he
thinks
we
liked
the
stupid
subject
d'ya
reckon
anyone's
going
to
go
on
to
N
e.w.t
neither
Harry
nor
Hermione
answered
there
was
no
need
they
knew
perfectly
well
that
nobody
in
their
year
would
want
to
continue
Care
of
Magical
Creatures
they
avoided
hagrid's
eye
and
returned
his
cheery
wave
only
half-heartedly
when
he
left
the
staff
table
ten
minutes
later
after
they
had
eaten
they
remained
in
their
places
awaiting
Professor
mcgonagall's
descent
from
the
staff
table
the
distribution
of
class
schedules
was
more
complicated
than
usual
this
year
for
Professor
McGonagall
needed
first
to
confirm
that
everybody
had
achieved
the
necessary
O
w.l.
grades
to
continue
with
their
chosen
N
e.w.t.s
hermione
was
immediately
cleared
to
continue
with
Charms
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
Transfiguration
Herbology
Arithmancy
Ancient
Runes
and
Potions
and
shot
off
to
a
first
period
Ancient
Runes
class
without
further
ado
neville
took
a
little
longer
to
sort
out
his
round
face
was
anxious
as
Professor
McGonagall
looked
down
his
application
and
then
consulted
his
O
w.l
results
herbology
fine
she
said
professor
Sprout
will
be
delighted
to
see
you
back
with
an
Outstanding
O
w.l.
And
you
qualify
for
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
with
Exceeds
Expectations
but
the
problem
is
Transfiguration
i'm
sorry
Longbottom
but
an
Acceptable
really
isn't
good
enough
to
continue
to
N
e.w.t.
level
just
don't
think
you'd
be
able
to
cope
with
the
coursework
neville
hung
his
head
professor
McGonagall
peered
at
him
through
her
square
spectacles
why
do
you
want
to
continue
with
Transfiguration
anyway
i've
never
had
the
impression
that
you
particularly
enjoyed
it
neville
looked
miserable
and
muttered
something
about
my
grandmother
wants
hmph
snorted
Professot
McGonagall
it's
high
time
your
grandmother
learned
to
be
proud
of
the
grandson
she's
got
rather
than
the
one
she
thinks
she
ought
to
have
particularly
after
what
happened
at
the
Ministry
neville
turned
very
pink
and
blinked
confusedly
Professor
McGonagall
had
never
paid
him
a
compliment
before
i'm
sorry
Longbottom
but
I
cannot
let
you
into
my
N
e.w.t.
class
i
see
that
you
have
an
Exceeds
Expectations
in
Charm
however
why
not
try
for
a
N
e.w.t.
in
Charms
my
grandmother
thinks
Charms
is
a
soft
option
mumbled
Neville
take
Charms
said
Professor
McGonagall
and
I
shall
drop
Augusta
a
line
reminding
her
that
just
because
she
failed
her
Charms
O
w.l.
the
subject
is
not
necessarily
worthless
smiling
slightly
at
the
look
of
delighted
incredulity
on
neville's
face
Professor
McGonagall
tapped
a
blank
schedule
with
the
tip
of
her
wand
and
handed
it
now
carrying
details
of
his
new
classes
to
Neville
professor
McGonagall
turned
next
to
Parvati
Patil
whose
first
question
was
whether
Firenze
the
handsome
centaur
was
still
teaching
Divination
he
and
Professor
Trelawney
are
dividing
classes
between
them
this
year
said
Professor
McGonagall
a
hint
of
disapproval
in
her
voice
it
was
common
knowledge
that
she
despised
the
subject
of
Divination
the
sixth
year
is
being
taken
by
Professor
Trelawney
parvati
set
off
for
Divination
five
minutes
later
looking
slightly
crestfallen
so

Professor
McGonagall

all
fine
i
must
say
I
was
pleased
with
your
Transfiguration
mark
Potter
very
pleased
now
why
haven't
you
applied
to
continue
with
Potions
i
thought
it
was
your
ambition
to
become
an
Auror
it
was
but
you
told
me
I
had
to
get
an
Outstanding
in
my
O
w.l.
Professor
and
so
you
did
when
Professor
Snape
was
teaching
the
subject
professor
Slughorn
however
is
perfectly
happy
to
accept
N
e.w.t.
students
with
Exceeds
Expectations
at
O
w.l.
Do
you
wish
to
proceed
with
Potions
yes
said
Harry
but
I
didn't
buy
the
books
or
any
ingredients
or
anything
i'm
sure
Professor
Slughorn
will
be
able
to
lend
you
some
said
Professor
McGonagall
very
well
Potter
here
is
your
schedule
oh
by
the
way
twenty
hopefuls
have
already
put
down
their
names
for
the
Gryffindor
Quidditch
team
i
shall
pass
the
list
to
you
in
due
course
and
you
can
fix
up
trials
at
your
leisure
a
few
minutes
later
Ron
was
cleared
to
do
the
same
subjects
as
Harry
and
the
two
of
them
left
the
table
together
look
said
Ron
delightedly
gazing
ar
his
schedule
we've
got
a
free
period
now
and
a
free
period
after
break
and
after
lunch
excellent
they
returned
to
the
common
room
which
was
empty
apart
from
a
half
dozen
seventh
years
including
Katie
Bell
the
only
remaining
member
of
the
original
Gryffindor
Quidditch
team
that
Harry
had
joined
in
his
first
year
i
thought
you'd
get
that
well
done
she
called
over
pointing
at
the
Captains
badge
on
harry's
chest
tell
me
when
you
call
trials
don't
be
stupid
said
Harry
you
don't
need
to
try
out
I
watched
you
play
for
five
years
you
mustn't
start
off
like
that
she
said
warningly
for
all
you
know
there's
someone
much
better
than
me
out
there
good
teams
have
been
ruined
before
now
because
Captains
just
kept
playing
the
old
faces
or
letting
in
their
friends
ron
looked
a
little
uncomfortable
and
began
playing
with
the
Fanged
Frisbee
Hermione
had
taken
from
the
fourth-year
student
it
zoomed
around
the
common
room
snarling
and
attempting
to
take
bites
of
the
tapestry
crookshanks's
yellow
eyes
followed
it
and
he
hissed
when
it
came
too
close
an
hour
later
they
reluctantly
left
the
sunlit
common
room
for
the
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
classroom
four
floors
below
hermione
was
already
queuing
outside
carrying
an
armful
of
heavy
books
and
looking
put-upon
we
got
so
much
homework
for
Runes
she
said
anxiously
when
Harry
and
Ron
joined
her
a
fifteen-inch
essay
two
translations
and
i've
got
to
read
these
by
Wednesday
shame
yawned
Ron
you
wait
she
said
resentfully
i
bet
Snape
gives
us
loads
the
classroom
door
opened
as
she
spoke
and
Snape
stepped
into
the
corridor
his
sallow
face
framed
as
ever
by
two
curtains
of
greasy
black
hair
silence
fell
over
the
queue
immediately
inside
he
said
harry
looked
around
as
they
entered
snape
had
imposed
his
personality
upon
the
room
already
it
was
gloomier
than
usual
as
curtains
had
been
drawn
over
the
windows
and
was
lit
by
candlelight
new
pictures
adorned
the
walls
many
of
them
showing
people
who
appeared
to
be
in
pain
sporting
grisly
injuries
or
strangely
contorted
body
parts
nobody
spoke
as
they
settled
down
looking
around
at
the
shadowy
gruesome
pictures
i
have
not
asked
you
to
take
out
your
books
said
Snape
closing
the
door
and
moving
to
face
the
class
from
behind
his
desk
Hermione
hastily
dropped
her
copy
of
Confronting
the
Faceless
back
into
her
bag
and
stowed
it
under
her
chair
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
and
I
want
your
fullest
attention
his
black
eyes
roved
over
their
upturned
faces
lingering
for
a
fraction
of
a
second
longer
on
harry's
than
anyone
else's
you
have
had
five
teachers
in
this
subject
so
far
I
believe
you
believe
like
you
haven't
watched
them
all
come
and
go
hoping
you'd
be
next
thought
Harry
scathingly
naturally
these
teachers
will
all
have
had
their
own
methods
and
priorities
given
this
confusion
I
am
surprised
so
many
of
you
scraped
an
O
w.l.
in
this
subject
i
shall
be
even
more
surprised
if
all
of
you
manage
to
keep
up
with
the
N
e.w.t.
work
which
will
be
more
advanced
snape
set
off
around
the
edge
of
the
room
speaking
now
in
a
lower
voice
the
class
craned
their
necks
to
keep
him
in
view
the
Dark
Arts
said
Snape
are
many
varied
ever-changing
and
eternal
fighting
them
is
like
fighting
a
many-headed
monster
which
each
time
a
neck
is
severed
sprouts
a
head
even
fiercer
and
cleverer
than
before
you
are
fighting
that
which
is
unfixed
mutating
indestructible
harry
stared
at
Snape
it
was
surely
one
thing
to
respect
the
Dark
Arts
as
a
dangerous
enemy
another
to
speak
of
them
as
Snape
was
doing
with
a
loving
caress
in
his
voice
your
defenses
said
Snape
a
little
louder
must
therefore
be
as
flexible
and
inventive
as
the
arts
you
seek
to
undo
these
pictures
he
indicated
a
few
of
them
as
he
swept
past
give
a
fair
representation
of
what
happens
to
those
who
suffer
for
instance
the
Cruciatus
Curse
he
waved
a
hand
toward
a
witch
who
was
clearly
shrieking
in
agony
feel
the
dementor's
Kiss
a
wizard
lying
huddled
and
blank-eyed
slumped
against
a
wall
or
provoke
the
aggression
of
the
Inferius
a
bloody
mass
upon
ground
has
an
Inferius
been
seen
then
said
Parvati
Patil
in
a
high
pitched
voice
is
it
definite
is
he
using
them
the
Dark
Lord
has
used
Inferi
in
the
past
said
Snape
which
means
you
would
be
well-advised
to
assume
he
might
use
them
again
now
he
set
off
again
around
the
other
side
of
the
classroom
toward
his
desk
and
again
they
watched
him
as
he
walked
his
dark
robes
billowing
behind
him
you
are
I
believe
complete
novices
in
the
use
of
nonverbal
spells
what
is
the
advantage
of
a
nonverbal
spell
hermione's
hand
shot
into
the
air
snape
took
his
time
looking
around
at
everybody
else
making
sure
he
had
no
choice
before
saying
curtly
Very
well
Miss
Granger
your
adversary
has
no
warning
about
what
kind
of
magic
you're
about
to
perform
said
Hermione
which
gives
you
a
split-second
advantage
an
answer
copied
almost
word
for
word
from
The
Standard
Book
of
Spells
Grade
Six
said
Snape
dismissively
over
in
the
corner
Malfoy
sniggered
but
correct
in
essentials
yes
those
who
progress
in
using
magic
without
shouting
incantations
gain
an
element
of
surprise
in
their
spell-casting
not
all
wizards
can
do
this
of
course
it
is
a
question
of
concentration
and
mind
power
which
some
his
gaze
lingered
maliciously
upon
Harry
once
more
lack
harry
knew
Snape
was
thinking
of
their
disastrous
Occlumency
lessons
of
the
previous
year
he
refused
to
drop
his
gaze
but
glowered
at
Snape
until
Snape
looked
away
you
will
now
divide
Snape
went
on
into
pairs
one
partner
will
attempt
to
jinx
the
other
without
speaking
the
other
will
attempt
to
repel
the
jinx
in
equal
silence
carry
on
although
Snape
did
not
know
it
Harry
had
taught
at
least
half
the
class
everyone
who
had
been
a
member
of
the
D
a.
how
to
perform
a
Shield
Charm
the
previous
year
none
of
them
had
ever
cast
the
charm
without
speaking
however
a
reasonable
amount
of
cheating
ensued
many
people
were
merely
whispering
the
incantation
instead
of
saying
it
aloud
typically
ten
minutes
into
the
lesson
Hermione
managed
to
repel
neville's
muttered
Jelly-Legs
Jinx
without
uttering
a
single
word
a
feat
that
would
surely
have
earned
her
twenty
points
for
Gryffindor
from
any
reasonable
teacher
thought
Harry
bitterly
but
which
Snape
ignored
he
swept
between
them
as
they
practiced
looking
just
as
much
like
an
overgrown
bat
as
ever
lingering
to
watch
Harry
and
Ron
struggling
with
the
task
ron
who
was
supposed
to
be
jinxing
Harry
was
purple
in
the
face
his
lips
tightly
compressed
to
save
himself
from
the
temptation
of
muttering
the
incantation
harry
had
his
wand
raised
waiting
on
tenterhooks
to
repel
a
jinx
that
seemed
unlikely
ever
to
come
pathetic
Weasley
said
Snape
after
a
while
here
let
me
show
you
he
turned
his
wand
on
Harry
so
fast
that
Harry
reacted
instinctively
all
thought
of
nonverbal
spells
forgotten
he
yelled
Protego
his
Shield
Charm
was
so
strong
Snape
was
knocked
off-balance
and
hit
a
desk
the
whole
class
had
looked
around
and
now
watched
as
Snape
righted
himself
scowling
do
you
remember
me
telling
you
we
are
practicing
nonverbal
spells
Potter
yes
said
Harry
stiffly
yes
sir
there's
no
need
to
call
me

Professor
the
words
had
escaped
him
before
he
knew
what
he
was

Harry
chortled
Ron
once
they
were
safely
on

to
break
a
short
while
later
you
really
shouldn't
have

said
Hermione
frowning
at

to
jinx

in
case
you
didn't
notice

Harry
i
had
enough
of
that

lessons
why
doesn't
he
use
another
guinea
pig
for
a
change
what's
Dumbledore
playing
at
anyway
letting
him
teach
Defense
did
you
hear
him
talking
about
the
Dark
Arts
he
loves
them
all
that
unfixed
indestructble
stuff
well
said
Hermione
I
thought
he
sounded
a
bit
like
you
like
me
yes
when
you
were
telling
us
what
it's
like
to
face
Voldemort
you
said
it
wasn't
just
memorizing
a
bunch
of
spells
you
said
it
was
just
you
and
your
brains
and
your
guts
well
wasn't
that
what
Snape
was
saying
that
it
really
comes
down
to
being
brave
and
quick-thinking
harry
was
so
disarmed
that
she
had
thought
his
words
as
well
worth
memorizing
as
The
Standard
Book
of
Spells
that
he
did
not
argue
harry
hey
Harry
harry
looked
around
Jack
Sloper
one
of
the
Beaters
on
last
year's
Gryffindor
Quidditch
team
was
hurrying
toward
him
holding
a
roll
of
parchment
for
you
panted
Sloper
listen
I
heard
you're
the
new
Captain
when're
you
holding
trials
i'm
not
sure
yet
said
Harry
thinking
privately
that
Sloper
would
be
very
lucky
to
get
back
on
the
team
i'll
let
you
know
oh
right
i
was
hoping
it'd
be
this
weekend
but
Harry
was
not
listening
he
had
just
recognized
the
thin
slanting
writing
on
the
parchment
leaving
Sloper
in
mid-sentence
he
hurried
away
with
Ron
and
Hermione
unrolling
the
parchment
as
he
went
dear
Harry
i
would
like
to

Ron
who
had
read
the
message
over
harry's
shoulder
and
was
looking
perplexed
it's
the
password
to
get
past
the
gargoyle
outside

in

voice

he
Ron
and
Hermione
spent
the
whole
of
break
speculating
on
what
Dumbledore
would
teach
Harry
ron
thought
it
most
likely
to
be
spectacular
jinxes
and
hexes
of
the
type
the
Death
Eaters
would
not
know
hermione
said
such
things
were
illegal
and
thought
it
much
more
likely
that
Dumbledore
wanted

Defensive
magic
after
break
she
went
off
to
Arithmancy
while
Harry
and
Ron
returned
to
the
common
room
where
they
grudgingly
started
snape's
homework
this
turned
out
to
be
so
complex
that
they
still
had
not
finished
when
Hermione
joined
them
for
their
after-lunch
free
period
though
she
considerably
speeded
up
the
process
they
had
only
just
finished
when
the
bell
rang
for
the
afternoon's
double
Potions
and
they
beat
the
familiar
path
down
to
the
dungeon
classroom
that
had
for
so
long
been
snape's
when
they
arrived
in
the
corridor

saw
that
there
were

how
are

Ron
Hermione
before
they
could
say
more
than
fine
the
dungeon
door
opened
and
slughorn's
belly
preceded
him
out
of
the
door
as
they
filed
into
the
room
his
great
walrus
mustache
curved
above
his
beaming
mouth
and
he
greeted
Harry
and
Zabini
with
particular
enthusiasm
the
dungeon
was
most
unusually
already
full
of
vapors
and
odd
smells
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
sniffed
interestedly
as
they
passed
large
bubbling
cauldrons
the
four
Slytherins
took
a
table
together
as
did
the
four
ravenclaws
this
left
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
to
share
a
table
with
Ernie
they
chose
the
one
nearest
a
gold-colored
cauldron
that
was
emitting
one
of
the
most
seductive
scents
Harry
had
ever
inhaled
Somehow
it
reminded
him
simultaneously
of
treacle
tart
the
woody
smell
of
a
broomstick
handle
and
something
flowery
he
thought
he
might
have
smelled
at
the
Burrow
he
found
that
he
was
breathing
very
slowly
and
deeply
and
that
the
potion's
fumes
seemed
to
be
filling
him
up
like
drink
a
great
contentment
stole
over
him
he
grinned
across
at
Ron
who
grinned
back
lazily
now
then
now
then
now
then
said
Slughorn
whose
massive
outline
was
quivering
through
the
many
shimmering

everyone

mention

not

at

you
can
use

from
the

cupboard
today
and
i'm
sure
we
can
lend
you
some

and
we've

stock
of

here
they'll

slughorn
strode
over
to
a
corner
cupboard
and
after
a
moment's
foraging
emerged
with
two
very
battered-looking
copies
of
Advanced
Potion-Making
by
Libatius
Borage
which
he
gave
to
Harry
and
Ron
along
with
two
sets
of
tarnished
scales
now
then
said
Slughorn
returning
to
the
front
of
the
class
and
inflating
his
already
bulging
chest
so
that
the
buttons
on
his
waistcoat
threatened
to
burst
off
i've
prepared
a
few
potions
for
you
to
have
a
look
at
just
out
of
interest
you
know
these
are
the
kind
of
thing
you
ought
to
be
able
to
make
after
completing
your
N
e.w.t.s.
You
ought
to
have
heard
of
em
even
if
you
haven't
made
em
yet
anyone
tell
me
what
this
one
is
he
indicated
the
cauldron
nearest
the
Slytherin
table
harry
raised
himself
slighty
in
his
seat
and
saw
what
looked
like
plain
water
boiling
away
inside
it
hermione's
well-practiced
hand
hit
the
air
before
anybody
else's
Slughorn
pointed
at
her
it's

colorless
odorless
potion
thar
forces
the
drinker
to
tell
the
truth
said
Hermione
very
good
very
good
said
Slughorn
happily
now
he
continued
pointing
at
the
cauldron
nearest
the
Ravenclaw
table
this
one
here
is
pretty
well
known

in

once

lt's
Polyjuice
Potion
sir
she
said
harry
too
had
recognized
the
slow-bubbling
mudlike
substance
the
second
cauldron
but
did
not
resent
Hermione
getting
the
credit
for
answering
the
question
she
after
all
was
the
one
who
had
succeeded
in
making
it
back
in
their
second
year
excellent
excellent
now
this
one
here
yes
my
dear
said
Slughorn
now
looking
slightly
bemused
as
hermione's
hand
punched
the
air
again
it's
Amortentia
it
is
indeed
ir
seems
almost
foolish
to
ask
said
Slughorn
who
was
looking
mightily
impressed
but
I
assume
you
know
what
it
does
it's
the
most
powerful
love
porion
in
the
world
said
Hermione
quite
right
you
recognized
it
I
suppose
by
its
distinctive
mother-of-pearl
sheen
and
the
steam
rising
in
characteristic
spirals
said
Hermione
enthusiastically
and
it's
supposed
to
smell
differently
to
each
of
according
to
what
attracts
us
and
I
can
smell
freshly
mown
grass
and
new
parchment
and
but
she
turned
slightly
pink
and
did
not
complete
the
sentence
may
I
ask
your
name
my
dear
said
Slughorn
ignoring
hermione's
embarrassment
hermione
Granger
sir
granger
granger
can
you
possibly
be
related
to
Hector
Dagworth-Granger
who
founded
the
Most
Extraordinary
Society
of
Potioneers
no.
I
don't
think
so
sir
i'm
muggle-born
you
see
harry
saw
Malfoy
lean
close
to
Nott
and
whisper
something
both
of
them
sniggered
but
Slughorn
showed
no
dismay
on
the
contrary
he
beamed
and
looked
from
Hermione
to
Harry
who
was
sitting
next
to
her
oho
one
of
my
best
friends
is
muggle-born
and
she's
the
best
in
our
year
i'm
assuming
this
is
the
very
friend
of
whom
you
spoke
Harry
yes
sir
said
Harry
well
well
take
twenty
well-earned
points
for
Gryffindor
Miss
Granger
said
Slughorn
genially
malfoy
looked
rather
as
he
had
done
the
time
Hermione
had
punched
him
in
the
face
hermione
turned
to
Harry
with
a
radiant
expression
and
whispered
Did
you
really
tell
him
i'm
the
best
in
the
year
oh
Harry
well
what's
so
impressive
about
that
whispered
Ron
who
for
some
reason
looked
annoyed
you
are
the
best
in
the
year
i'd've
told
him
so
if
he'd
asked
me
hermione
smiled
but
made
a
shhing
gesture
so
that
they
could
hear
what
Slughorn
was
saying
ron
looked
slightly
disgruntled
amortentia
doesn't
really
create
love
of
course
it
is
impossible
to
manufacture
or
imitate
love
no
this
will
simply
cause
a
powerful
infatuation
or
obsession
it
is
probably
the
most
dangerous
and
powerful
potion
in
this
room
oh
yes
he
said
nodding
gravely
at
Malfoy
and
Nott
both
of
whom
were
smirking
skeptically
when
you
have
seen
as
much
of
life
as
I
have
you
will
not
underestimate
the
power
of
obsessive
love
and
now
said
Slughorn
it
is
time
for
us
to
start
work
sir
you
haven't
told
us
what's
in
this
one
said
Ernie
Macmillan
pointing
at
a
small
black
cauldron
standing
on
slughorn's
desk
the
potion
within
was
splashing
about
merrily
it
was
the
color
of
molten
gold
and
large
drops
were
leaping
like
goldfish
above
the
surface
though
not
a
particle
had
spilled
oho
said
Slughorn
again
harry
was
sure
that
Slughorn
had
not
forgotten
the
potion
at
all
but
had
waited
to
be
asked
for
dramatic
effect
yes
that
well
that
one
ladies
and
gentlemen
is
a
most
curious
little
potion
called
Felix
Felicis
i
take
it
he
turned
smiling
to
look
at
hermione
who
had
let
out
an
audible
gasp
that
you
know
what
Felix
Felicis
does
Miss
Granger
it's
liquid
luck
said
Hermione
excitedly
it
makes
you
lucky
the
whole
class
seemed
to
sit
up
a
little
straighter
now
all
Harry
could
see
of
Malfoy
was
the
back
of
his
sleek
blond
head
because
he
was
at
last
giving
Slughorn
his
full
and
undivided
attention
quite
right
take
another
ten
points
for
Gryffindor
yes
it's
a
funny
little
potion
Felix
Felicis
said
Slughorn
desperately
tricky
to
make
and
disastrous
to
get
wrong
however
if
brewed
correctly
as
this
has
been
you
will
find
that
all
your
endeavors
tend
to
succeed
at
least
until
the
effects
wear
off
why
don't
people
drink
it
all
the
time
sir
said
Terry
Boot
eagerly
because
if
taken
in
excess
it
causes
giddiness
recklessness
and
dangerous
overconfidence
said
Slughorn
too
much
of
a
good
thing
you
know
highly
toxic
in
large
quantities
but
taken
sparingly
and
very
occasionally
have
you
ever
taken
it
sir
asked
Michael
Corner
with
great
interest
twice
in
my
life
said
Slughorn
once
when
I
was
twenty-four
once
when
I
was
fifty-seven
two
tablespoonfuls
taken
with
breakfast
two
perfect
days
he
gazed
dreamily
into
the
distance
whether
he
was
playacting
or
not
thought
Harry
the
effect
was
good
and
that
said
Slughorn
apparently
coming
back
to
earth
is
what
I
shall
be
offering
as
a
prize
in
this
lesson
there
was
silence
in
which
every
bubble
and
gurgle
of
the
surrounding
potions
seemed
magnified
tenfold
one
tiny
bottle
of
Felix
Felicis
said
Slughorn
taking
a
minuscule
glass
bottle
with
a
cork
in
it
out
of
his
pocket
and
showing
it
to
them
all
enough
for
twelve
hours
luck
from
dawn
till
dusk
you
will
be
lucky
in
everything
you
attempt
now
I
must
give
you
warning
that
Felix
Felicis
is
a
banned
substance
in
organized
competitions
sporting
events
for
instance
examinations
or
elections
so
the
winner
is
to
use
it
on
an
ordinary
day
only
and
watch
how
that
ordinary
day
becomes
extraordinary
so
said
Slughorn
suddenly
brisk
how
are
you
to
win
this
fabulous
prize
well
by
turning
to
page
ten
of
Advanced
Potion
Making
we
have
a
little
over
an
hour
left
to
us
which
should
be
time
for
you
to
make
a
decent
attempt
at
the
Draught
of
Living
Death
i
know
it
is
more
complex
than
anything
you
have
attempted
before
and
I
do
not
expect
a
perfect
potion
from
anybody
the
person
who
does
best
however
will
win
little
Felix
here
off
you
go
there
was
a
scraping
as
everyone
drew
their
cauldrons
toward
them
and
some
loud
clunks
as
people
began
adding
weights
to
their
scales
but
nobody
spoke
the
concentration
within
the
room
was
almost
tangible
harry
saw
Malfoy
riffling
feverishly
through
his
copy
of
Advanced
Potion-Making
It
could
not
have
been
clearer
that
Malfoy
really
wanted
that
lucky
day
harry
bent
swiftly
over
the
tattered
book
Slughorn
had
lent
him
to
his
annoyance
he
saw
that
the
previous
owner
had
scribbled
all
over
the
pages
so
that
the
margins
were
as
black
as
the
printed
portions
bending
low
to
decipher
the
ingredients
even
here
the
previous
owner
had
made
annotations
and
crossed
things
out
Harry
hurried
off
toward
the
store
cupboard
to
find
what
he
needed
as
he
dashed
back
to
his
cauldron
he
saw
Malfoy
cutting
up
Valerian
roots
as
fast
as
he
could
everyone
kept
glancing
around
at
what
the
rest
of
the
class
was
doing
this
was
both
an
advantage
and
a
disadvantage
of
Potions
that
it
was
hard
to
keep
your
work
private
within
ten
minutes
the
whole
place
was
full
of
bluish
steam
hermione
of
course
seemed
to
have
progressed
furthest
her
potion
already
resembled
the
smooth
black
currant-colored
liquid
mentioned
as
the
ideal
halfway
stage
having
finished
chopping
his
roots
Harry
bent
low
over
his
book
again
it
was
really
very
irritating
having
to
try
and
decipher
the
directions
under
all
the
stupid
scribbles
of
the
previous
owner
who
for
some
reason
had
taken
issue
with
the
order
to
cut
up
the
sopophorous
bean
and
had
written
in
the
alternative
instruction
crush
with
flat
side
of
silver
dagger
releases
juice
better
than
cutting
sir
I
think
you
knew
my
grandfather
Abraxas
Malfoy
harry
looked
up
Slughorn
was
just
passing
the
Slytherin
table
yes
said
Slughorn
without
looking
at
Malfoy
I
was
sorry
to
hear
he
had
died
although
of
course
it
wasn't
unexpected
dragon
pox
at
his
age
and
he
walked
away
harry
bent
back
over
his
cauldron
smirking
he
could
tell
that
Malfoy
had
expected
to
be
treated
like
Harry
or
Zabini
perhaps
even
hoped
for
some
preferential
treatment
of
the
type
he
had
learned
to
expect
from
Snape
it
looked
as
though
Malfoy
would
have
to
rely
on
nothing
but
talent
to
win
the
bottle
of
Felix
Felicis
the
sopophorous
bean
was
proving
very
difficult
to
cut
up
harry
turned
to
Hermione
can
I
borrow
your
silver
knife
she
nodded
impatiently
not
taking
her
eyes
off
her
potion
which
was
still
deep
purple
though
according
to
the
book
ought
to
be
turning
a
light
shade
of
lilac
by
now
harry
crushed
his
bean
with
the
flat
side
of
the
dagger
to
his
astonishment
it
immediately
exuded
so
much
juice
he
was
amazed
the
shriveled
bean
could
have
held
it
all
hastily
scooping
it
all
into
the
cauldron
he
saw
to
his
surprise
that
the
potion
immediately
turned
exactly
the
shade
of
lilac
described
by
the
textbook
his
annoyance
with
the
previous
owner
vanishing
on
the
spot
Harry
now
squinted
at
the
next
line
of
instructions
according
the
book
he
had
to
stir
counterclockwise
until
the
potion
turned
clear
as
water
according
to
the
addition
the
previous
owner
made
however
he
ought
to
add
a
clockwise
stir
after
every
seventh
counterclockwise
stir
could
the
old
owner
be
right
twice
harry
stirred
counterclockwise
held
his
breath
and
stirred
once
clockwise
the
effect
was
immediate
the
potion
turned
pale
pink
how
are
you
doing
that
demanded
Hermione
who
was
redfaced
and
whose
hair
was
growing
bushier
and
bushier
in
the
fumes
from
her
cauldron
her
potion
was
still
resolutely
purple
add
a
clockwise
stir
no
no
the
book
says
counterclockwise
she
snapped
harry
shrugged
and
continued
what
he
was
doing
seven
stirs
counterdockwise
one
clockwise
pause
seven
stirs
counterclockwise
one
stir
clockwise
across
the
table
Ron
was
cursing
fluently
under
his
breath
his
potion
looked
like
liquid
licorice
harry
glanced
around
as
far
as
he
could
see
no
one
else's
potion
had
turned
as
pale
as
his
he
felt
elated
something
that
had
certainly
never
happened
before
in
this
dungeon
and
time's
up
called
Slughorn
stop
stirring
please
slughorn
moved
slowly
among
the
tables
peering
into
cauldrons
he
made
no
comment
but
occasionally
gave
the
potions
a
stir
or
a
sniff
at
last
he
reached
the
table
where
Harry
Ron
Hermione
and
Ernie
were
sitting
he
smiled
ruefully
at
the
tarlike
substance
in
ron's
cauldron
he
passed
over
ernie's
navy
concoction
hermione's
potion
he
gave
an
approving
nod
then
he
saw
harry's
and
a
look
of
incredulous
delight
spread
over
his
face
the
clear
winner
he
cried
to
the
dungeon
excellent
excellent
Harry
good
lord
it's
clear
you've
inherited
your
mother's
talent
she
was
a
dab
hand
at
Potions
Lily
was
here
you
are
then
here
you
are
one
bottle
of
Felix
Felicis
as
promised
and
use
it
well
harry
slipped
the
tiny
bottle
of
golden
liquid
into
his
inner
pocket
feeling
an
odd
combination
of
delight
at
the
furious
looks
on
the
Slytherins
faces
and
guilt
at
the
disappointed
expression
on
hermione's
ron
looked
simply
dumbfounded
how
did
you
do
that
he
whispered
to
Harry
as
they
left
the
dungeon
got
lucky
I
suppose
said
Harry
because
Malfoy
was
within
earshot
once
they
were
securely
ensconced
at
the
Gryffindor
table
for
dinner
however
he
felt
safe
enough
to
tell
them
hermione's
face
became
stonier
with
every
word
he
uttered
i
s'pose
you
think
I
cheated
he
finished
aggravated
by
her
expression
well
it
wasn't
exactly
your
own
work
was
it
she
said
stiffly
he
only
followed
different
instructions
to
ours
said
Ron
could've
been
a
catastrophe
couldn't
it
but
he
took
a
risk
and
it
paid
off
he
heaved
a
sigh
slughorn
could've
handed
me
that
book
but
no
I
get
the
one
no
one's
ever
written
on
puked
on
by
the
look
of
page
fifty-two
but
hang
on
said
a
voice
close
by
harry's
left
ear
and
he
caught
a
sudden
waft
of
that
flowery
smell
he
had
picked
up
in
slughorn's
dungeon
he
looked
around
and
saw
that
Ginny
had
joined
them
did
I
hear
right
you've
been
taking
orders
from
something
someone
wrote
in
a
book
Harry
she
looked
alarmed
and
angry
harry
knew
what
was
on
her
mind
at
once
it's
nothing
he
said
reassuringly
lowering
his
voice
it's
not
like
you
know
riddle's
diary
it's
just
an
old
textbook
someone's
scribbled
on
but
you're
doing
what
it
says
i
just
tried
a
few
of
the
tips
written
in
the
margins
honestly
Ginny
there's
nothing
funny
ginny's
got
a
point
said
Hermione
perking
up
at
once
we
ought
to
check
that
there's
nothing
odd
about
it
i
mean
all
these
funny
instructions
who
knows
hey
said
Harry
indignantly
as
she
pulled
his
copy
of
Advanced
Potion-Making
out
of
his
bag
and
raised
her
wand
specialis
Revelio
she
said
rapping
it
smartly
on
the
front
cover
nothing
whatsoever
happened
the
book
simply
lay
there
looking
old
and
dirty
and
dog-eared
finished
said
Harry
irritably
or
d'you
want
to
wait
and
see
if
it
does
a
few
backflips
it
seems
all
right
said
Hermione
still
staring
at
the
book
suspiciously
i
mean
it
really
does
seem
to
be
just
a
textbook
good
then
i'll
have
it
back
said
Harry
snatching
it
off
the
table
but
it
slipped
from
his
hand
and
landed
open
on
the
floor
nobody
else
was
looking
harry
bent
low
to
retrieve
the
book
and
as
he
did
so
he
saw
something
scribbled
along
the
bottom
of
the
back
cover
in
the
same
small
cramped
handwriting
as
the
instructions
that
had
won
him
his
bottle
of
Felix
Felicis
now
safely
hidden
inside
a
pair
of
socks
in
his
trunk
upstairs
this
book
is
the
property
of
the
Half
Blood
Prince
chapter
The
Hour
of
Gaunt
for
or
the
rest
of
the
week's
Potions
lessons
Harry
continued
to
follow
the
Half-Blood
prince's
instructions
wherever
they
deviated
from
Libatius
borage's
with
the
result
that
by
their
fourth
lesson
Slughorn
was
raving
about
Harrys
abilities
saying
that
he
had
rarely
taught
anyone
so
talented
neither
Ron
nor
Hermione
was
delighted
by
this
although
Harry
had
offered
to
share
his
book
with
both
of
them
Ron
had
more
difficulty
deciphering
the
handwriting
than
Harry
did
and
could
not
keep
asking
Harry
to
read
aloud
or
it
might
look
suspicious
hermione
meanwhile
was
resolutely
plowing
on
with
what
she
called
the
official
instructions
but
becoming
increasingly
bad-tempered
as
they
yielded
poorer
results
than
the
prince's
harry
wondered
vaguely
who
the
Half-Blood
Prince
had
been
although
the
amount
of
homework
they
had
been
given
prevented
him
from
reading
the
whole
of
his
copy
of
Advanced
Potion-Making
he
had
skimmed
through
it
sufficiently
to
see
that
there
was
barely
a
page
on
which
the
Prince
had
not
made
additional
notes
not
all
of
them
concerned
with
potion-making
here
and
there
were
directions
for
what
looked
like
spells
that
the
Prince
had
made
up
himself
or
herself
said
Hermione
irritably
overhearing
Harry
pointing
some
of
these
out
to
Ron
in
the
common
room
on
Saturday
evening
it
might
have
been
a
girl
i
think
the
handwriting
looks
more
like
a
girl's
than
a
boy's
the
Half-Blood
Prince
he
was
called
Harry
said
how
many
girls
have
been
Princes
hermione
seemed
to
have
no
answer
to
this
she
merely
scowled
and
twitched
her
essay
on
The
Principles
of
Rematerialization
away
from
Ron
who
was
trying
to
read
it
upside
down
harry
looked
at
his
watch
and
hurriedly
put
the
old
copy
of
Advanced
Potion-Making
back
into
his
bag
it's
five
to
eight
i'd
better
go
i'll
be
late
for
Dumbledore
ooooh
gasped
Hermione
looking
up
at
once
good
luck
we'll
wait
up
we
want
to
hear
what
he
teaches
you
hope
it
goes
okay
said
Ron
and
the
pair
of
them
watched
Harry
leave
through
the
portrait
hole
harry
proceeded
through
deserted
corridors
though
he
had
to
step
hastily
behind
a
statue
when
Professor
Trelawney
appeared
around
a
corner
muttering
to
herself
as
she
shuffled
a
pack
of
dirty-looking
playing
cards
reading
them
as
she
walked
two
of
spades
conflict
she
murmured
as
she
passed
the
place
where
Harry
crouched
hidden
seven
of
spades
an
ill
omen
ten
of
spades
violence
knave
of
spades
a
dark
young
man
possibly
troubled
one
who
dislikes
the
questioner
she
stopped
dead
right
on
the
other
side
of
harry's
statue
well
that
can't
be
right
she
said
annoyed
and
Harry
heard
her
reshuffling
vigorously
as
she
set
off
again
leaving
nothing
but
a
whiff
of
cooking
sherry
behind
her
harry
waited
until
he
was
quite
sure
she
had
gone
then
hurried
off
again
until
he
reached
the
spot
in
the
seventh-floor
corridor
where
a
single
gargoyle
stood
against
the
wall
acid
Pops
said
Harry
and
the
gargoyle
leapt
aside
the
wall
behind
it
slid
apart
and
a
moving
spiral
stone
staircase
was
revealed
onto
which
Harry
stepped
so
that
he
was
carried
in
smooth
circles
up
to
the
door
with
the
brass
knocker
that
led
to
dumbledore's
Office
harry
knocked
come
in
said
Dumbledore
s
voice
good
evening
sir
said
Harry
walking
into
the
headmaster's
office
ah
good
evening
Harry
sit
down
said
Dumbledore
smiling
i
hope
you've
had
an
enjoyable
first
week
back
at
school
yes
thanks
sir
said
Harry
you
must
have
been
busy
a
detention
under
your
belt
already
er
began
Harry
awkwardly
but
Dumbledore
did
not
look
too
stern
i
have
arranged
with
Professor
Snape
that
you
will
do
your
detention
next
Saturday
instead
right
said
Harry
who
had
more
pressing
matters
on
his
mind
than
Snapes
detention
and
now
looked
around
surreptitiously
for
some
indication
of
what
Dumbledore
was
planning
to
do
with
him
this
evening
the
circular
office
looked
just
as
it
always
did
the
delicate
silver
instruments
stood
on
spindle-legged
tables
puff-ing
smoke
and
whirring
portraits
of
previous
headmasters
and
headmistresses
dozed
in
their
frames
and
dumbledore's
magnificent
phoenix
Fawkes
stood
on
his
perch
behind
the
door
watching
Harry
with
bright
interest
it
did
not
even
look
as
though
Dumbledore
had
cleared
a
space
for
dueling
practice
so
Harry
said
Dumbledore
in
a
businesslike
voice
you
have
been
wondering
I
am
sure
what
I
have
planned
for
you
during
these
for
want
of
a
better
word
lessons
yes
sir
well
I
have
decided
that
it
is
time
now
that
you
know
what
prompted
Lord
Voldemort
to
try
and
kill
you
fifteen
years
ago
for
you
to
be
given
certain
information
there
was
a
pause
you
said
at
the
end
of
last
term
you
were
going
to
tell
me
everything
said
Harry
it
was
hard
to
keep
a
note
of
accusation
from
his
voice
sir
he
added
and
so
I
did
said
Dumbledore
placidly
i
told
you
everything
I
know
from
this
point
forth
we
shall
be
leaving
the
firm
foundation
of
fact
and
journeying
together
through
the
murky
marshes
of
memory
into
thickets
of
wildest
guesswork
from
here
on
in
Harry
I
may
be
as
woefully
wrong
as
Humphrey
Belcher
who
believed
the
time
was
ripe
for
a
cheese
cauldron
but
you
think
you're
right
said
Harry
naturally
I
do
but
as
I
have
already
proven
to
you
I
make
mistakes
like
the
next
man
in
fact
being
forgive
me
rather
cleverer
than
most
men
my
mistakes
tend
to
be
correspondingly
huger
sir
said
Harry
tentatively
does
what
you're
going
to
tell
me
have
anything
to
do
with
the
prophecy
will
it
help
me
survive
it
has
a
very
great
deal
to
do
with
the
prophecy
said
Dumbledore
as
casually
as
if
Harry
had
asked
him
about
the
next
days
weather
and
I
certainly
hope
that
it
will
help
you
to
survive
dumbledore
got
to
his
feet
and
walked
around
the
desk
past
Harry
who
turned
eagerly
in
his
seat
to
watch
Dumbledore
bending
over
the
cabinet
beside
the
door
when
Dumbledore
straightened
up
he
was
holding
a
familiar
shallow
stone
basin
etched
with
odd
markings
around
its
rim
he
placed
the
Pensieve
on
the
desk
in
front
of
Harry
you
look
worried
harry
had
indeed
been
eyeing
the
Pensieve
with
some
apprehension
his
previous
experiences
with
the
odd
device
that
stored
and
revealed
thoughts
and
memories
though
highly
instructive
had
also
been
uncomfortable
the
last
time
he
had
disturbed
its
contents
he
had
seen
much
more
than
he
would
have
wished
but
Dumbledore
was
smiling
this
time
you
enter
the
Pensieve
with
me
and
even
more
unusually
with
permission
where
are
we
going
sir
for
a
trip
down
Bob
ogden's
memory
lane
said
Dumbledore
pulling
from
his
pocket
a
crystal
bottle
containing
a
swirling
silvery-white
substance
who
was
Bob
Ogden
he
was
employed
by
the
Department
of
Magical
Law
Enforcement
said
Dumbledore
he
died
some
time
ago
but
not
before
I
had
tracked
him
down
and
persuaded
him
to
confide
these
recollections
to
me
we
are
about
to
accompany
him
on
a
visit
he
made
in
the
course
of
his
duties
if
you
will
stand
Harry
but
Dumbledore
was
having
difficulty
pulling
out
the
stopper
of
the
crystal
bottle
His
injured
hand
seemed
stiff
and
painful
shall
shall
I
sir
no
matter
Harry
dumbledore
pointed
his
wand
at
the
bottle
and
the
cork
flew
out
sir
how
did
you
injure
your
hand
harry
asked
again
looking
at
the
blackened
fingers
with
a
mixture
of
revulsion
and
pity
now
is
not
the
moment
for
that
story
Harry
not
yet
we
have
an
appointment
with
Bob
Ogden
dumbledore
tipped
the
silvery
contents
of
the
bottle
into
the
Pensieve
where
they
swirled
and
shimmered
neither
liquid
nor
gas
after
you
said
Dumbledore
gesturing
toward
the
bowl
harry
bent
forward
took
a
deep
breath
and
plunged
his
face
into
the
silvery
substance
he
felt
his
feet
leave
the
office
floor
he
was
falling
falling
through
whirling
darkness
and
then
quite
sud-denly
he
was
blinking
in
dazzling
sunlight
before
his
eyes
had
adjusted
Dumbledore
landed
beside
him
they
were
standing
in
a
country
lane
bordered
by
high
tangled
hedgerows
beneath
a
summer
sky
as
bright
and
blue
as
a
forget-me-not
some
ten
feet
in
front
of
them
stood
a
short
plump
man
wearing
enormously
thick
glasses
that
reduced
his
eyes
to
molelike
specks
he
was
reading
a
wooden
signpost
that
was
sticking
out
of
the
brambles
on
the
left-hand
side
of
the
road
harry
knew
this
must
be
Ogden
he
was
the
only
person
in
sight
and
he
was
also
wearing
the
strange
assortment
of
clothes
so
often
chosen
by
inexperienced
wizards
trying
to
look
like
Muggles
in
this
case
a
frock
coat
and
spats
over
a
striped
one-piece
bathing
costume
before
harry
had
time
to
do
more
than
register
his
bizarre
appearance
however
Ogden
had
set
off
at
a
brisk
walk
down
the
lane
dumbledore
and
Harry
followed
as
they
passed
the
wooden
sign
Harry
looked
up
at
its
two
arms
the
one
pointing
back
the
way
they
had
come
read
Great
Hangleton
miles
the
arm
pointing
after
Ogden
said
Little
Hangleton
mile
they
walked
a
short
way
with
nothing
to
see
but
the
hedgerows
the
wide
blue
sky
overhead
and
the
swishing
frock-coated
figure
ahead
then
the
lane
curved
to
the
left
and
fell
away
sloping
steeply
down
a
hillside
so
that
they
had
a
sudden
unexpected
view
of
a
whole
valley
laid
out
in
front
of
them
harry
could
see
a
village
undoubtedly
Little
Hangleton
nestled
between
two
steep
hills
its
church
and
graveyard
clearly
visible
across
the
valley
set
on
the
opposite
hillside
was
a
handsome
manor
house
surrounded
by
a
wide
expanse
of
velvety
green
lawn
ogden
had
broken
into
a
reluctant
trot
due
to
the
steep
downward
slope
dumbledore
lengthened
his
stride
and
Harry
hurried
to
keep
up
he
thought
Little
Hangleton
must
be
their
final
destination
and
wondered
as
he
had
done
on
the
night
they
had
found
Slughorn
why
they
had
to
approach
it
from
such
a
distance
he
soon
discovered
that
he
was
mistaken
in
thinking
that
they
were
going
to
the
village
however
the
lane
curved
to
the
right
and
when
they
rounded
the
corner
it
was
to
see
the
very
edge
of
ogden's
frock
coat
vanishing
through
a
gap
in
the
hedge
dumbledore
and
Harry
followed
him
onto
a
narrow
dirt
track
bordered
by
higher
and
wilder
hedgerows
than
those
they
had
left
behind
the
path
was
crooked
rocky
and
potholed
sloping
down-hill
like
the
last
one
and
it
seemed
to
be
heading
for
a
patch
of
dark
trees
a
little
below
them
sure
enough
the
track
soon
opened
up
at
the
copse
and
Dumbledore
and
Harry
came
to
a
halt
behind
Ogden
who
had
stopped
and
drawn
his
wand
despite
the
cloudless
sky
the
old
trees
ahead
cast
deep
dark
cool
shadows
and
it
was
a
few
seconds
before
harry's
eyes
discerned
the
building
half-hidden
amongst
the
tangle
of
trunks
it
seemed
to
him
a
very
strange
location
to
choose
for
a
house
or
else
an
odd
decision
to
leave
the
trees
growing
nearby
blocking
all
light
and
the
view
of
the
valley
below
he
wondered
whether
it
was
inhabited
its
walls
were
mossy
and
so
many
tiles
had
fallen
off
the
roof
that
the
rafters
were
visible
in
places
nettles
grew
all
around
it
their
tips
reaching
the
windows
which
were
tiny
and
thick
with
grime
just
as
he
had
concluded
that
nobody
could
possibly
live
there
however
one
of
the
windows
was
thrown
open
with
a
clatter
and
a
thin
trickle
of
steam
or
smoke
issued
from
it
as
though
somebody
was
cooking
ogden
moved
forward
quietly
and
it
seemed
to
Harry
rather
cautiously
as
the
dark
shadows
of
the
trees
slid
over
him
he
stopped
again
staring
at
the
front
door
to
which
somebody
had
nailed
a
dead
snake
then
there
was
a
rustle
and
a
crack
and
a
man
in
rags
dropped
from
the
nearest
tree
landing
on
his
feet
right
in
front
of
Ogden
who
leapt
backward
so
fast
he
stood
on
the
tails
of
his
frock
coat
and
stumbled
you're
not
welcome
the
man
standing
before
them
had
thick
hair
so
matted
with
dirt
it
could
have
been
any
color
several
of
his
teeth
were
missing
his
eyes
were
small
and
dark
and
stared
in
opposite
directions
he
might
have
looked
comical
but
he
did
not
the
effect
was
frighten-ing
and
Harry
could
not
blame
Ogden
for
backing
away
several
more
paces
before
he
spoke
er
good
morning
i'm
from
the
Ministry
of
Magic
you're
not
welcome
er
i'm
sorry
I
don't
understand
you
said
Ogden
nervously
harry
thought
Ogden
was
being
extremely
dim
the
stranger
was
making
himself
very
clear
in
harry's
opinion
particularly
as
he
was
brandishing
a
wand
in
one
hand
and
a
short
and
rather
bloody
knife
in
the
other
you
understand
him
i'm
sure
Harry
said
Dumbledore
quietly
yes
of
course
said
Harry
slightly
nonplussed
why
can't
Ogden
but
as
his
eyes
found
the
dead
snake
on
the
door
again
he
suddenly
understood
he's
speaking
Parseltongue
very
good
said
Dumbledore
nodding
and
smiling
the
man
in
rags
was
now
advancing
on
Ogden
knife
in
one
hand
wand
in
the
other
now
look
Ogden
began
but
too
late
There
was
a
bang
and
Ogden
was
on
the
ground
clutching
his
nose
while
a
nasty
yellowish
goo
squirted
from
between
his
fingers
morfin
said
a
loud
voice
an
elderly
man
had
come
hurrying
out
of
the
cottage
banging
the
door
behind
him
so
that
the
dead
snake
swung
pathetically
this
man
was
shorter
than
the
first
and
oddly
proportioned
his
shoulders
were
very
broad
and
his
arms
overlong
which
with
his
bright
brown
eyes
short
scrubby
hair
and
wrinkled
face
gave
him
the
look
of
a
powerful
aged
monkey
he
came
to
a
halt
beside
the
man
with
the
knife
who
was
now
cackling
with
laughter
at
the
sight
of
Ogden
on
the
ground
ministry
is
it
said
the
older
man
looking
down
at
Ogden
correct
said
Ogden
angrily
dabbing
his
face
and
you
I
take
it
are
mr.
Gaunt
s'right
said
Gaunt
got
you
in
the
face
did
he
yes
he
did
snapped
Ogden
should've
made
your
presence
known
shouldn't
you
said
Gaunt
aggressively
this
is
private
property
can't
just
walk
in
here
and
not
expect
my
son
to
defend
himself
defend
himself
against
what
man
said
Ogden
clambering
back
to
his
feet
busybodies
intruders
muggles
and
filth
ogden
pointed
his
wand
at
his
own
nose
which
was
still
issuing
large
amounts
of
what
looked
like
yellow
pus
and
the
flow
stopped
at
once
mr.
Gaunt
spoke
out
of
the
corner
of
his
mouth
to
Morfin
get
in
the
house
don't
argue
this
time
ready
for
it
Harry
recognized
Parseltongue
even
while
he
could
understand
what
was
being
said
he
distinguished
the
weird
hissing
noise
that
was
all
Ogden
could
hear
morfin
seemed
to
be
on
the
point
of
disagreeing
but
when
his
father
cast
him
a
threatening
look
he
changed
his
mind
lumbering
away
to
the
cottage
with
an
odd
rolling
gait
and
slamming
the
front
door
behind
him
so
that
the
snake
swung
sadly
again
it's
your
son
i'm
here
to
see
mr.
Gaunt
said
Ogden
as
he
mopped
the
last
of
the
pus
from
the
front
of
his
coat
that
was
Morfin
wasn't
it
ah
that
was
Morfin
said
the
old
man
indifferently
are
you
pure-blood
he
asked
suddenly
aggressive
that's
neither
here
nor
there
said
Ogden
coldly
and
Harry
felt
his
respect
for
Ogden
rise
apparently
Gaunt
felt
rather
differently
he
squinted
into
Ogdens
face
and
muttered
in
what
was
clearly
supposed
to
be
an
offensive
tone
Now
I
come
to
think
about
it
i've
seen
noses
like
yours
down
in
the
village
i
don't
doubt
it
if
your
sons
been
let
loose
on
them
said
Ogden
perhaps
we
could
continue
this
discussion
inside
inside
yes
mr.
Gaunt
i've
already
told
you
i'm
here
about
Morfin
we
sent
an
owl
i've
no
use
for
owls
said
Gaunt
i
don't
open
letters
then
you
can
hardly
complain
that
you
get
no
warning
of
visitors
said
Ogden
tartly
i
am
here
following
a
serious
breach
of
Wizarding
law
which
occurred
here
in
the
early
hours
of
this
morning
all
right
all
right
all
right
bellowed
Gaunt
come
in
the
bleeding
house
then
and
much
good
it'll
do
you
the
house
seemed
to
contain
three
tiny
rooms
two
doors
led
off
the
main
room
which
served
as
kitchen
and
living
room
com-bined
morfin
was
sitting
in
a
filthy
armchair
beside
the
smoking
fire
twisting
a
live
adder
between
his
thick
fingers
and
crooning
softly
at
it
in
Parseltongue
hissy
hissy
little
snakey
slither
on
the
floor
you
be
good
to
Morfin
or
he'll
nail
you
to
the
door
there
was
a
scuffling
noise
in
the
corner
beside
the
open
window
and
Harry
realized
that
there
was
somebody
else
in
the
room
a
girl
whose
ragged
gray
dress
was
the
exact
color
of
the
dirty
stone
wall
behind
her
she
was
standing
beside
a
steaming
pot
on
a
grimy
black
stove
and
was
fiddling
around
with
the
shelf
of
squalid-looking
pots
and
pans
above
it
her
hair
was
lank
and
dull
and
she
had
a
plain
pale
rather
heavy
face
her
eyes
like
her
brother's
stared
in
opposite
directions
she
looked
a
little
cleaner
than
the
two
men
but
Harry
thought
he
had
never
seen
a
more
defeated-looking
person
m'daughter
Merope
said
Gaunt
grudgingly
as
Ogden
looked
inquiringly
toward
her
good
morning
said
Ogden
she
did
not
answer
but
with
a
frightened
glance
at
her
father
turned
her
back
on
the
room
and
continued
shifting
the
pots
on
the
shelf
behind
her
well
mr.
Gaunt
said
Ogden
to
get
straight
to
the
point
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
your
son
Morfin
performed
magic
in
front
of
a
Muggle
late
last
night
there
was
a
deafening
clang
merope
had
dropped
one
of
the
pots
pick
it
up
gaunt
bellowed
at
her
that's
it
grub
on
the
floor
like
some
filthy
Muggle
what's
your
wand
for
you
useless
sack
of
muck
mr.
Gaunt
please
said
Ogden
in
a
shocked
voice
as
Merope
who
had
already
picked
up
the
pot
flushed
blotchily
scarlet
lost
her
grip
on
the
pot
again
drew
her
wand
shakily
from
her
pocket
pointed
it
at
the
pot
and
muttered
a
hasty
inaudible
spell
that
caused
the
pot
to
shoot
across
the
floor
away
from
her
hit
the
opposite
wall
and
crack
in
two
morfin
let
out
a
mad
cackle
of
laughter
gaunt
screamed
Mend
it
you
pointless
lump
mend
it
merope
stumbled
across
the
room
but
before
she
had
time
to
raise
her
wand
Ogden
had
lifted
his
own
and
said
firmly
Reparo
the
pot
mended
itself
instantly
gaunt
looked
for
a
moment
as
though
he
was
going
to
shout
at
Ogden
but
seemed
to
think
better
of
it
Instead
he
jeered
at
his
daughter
Lucky
the
nice
man
from
the
ministry's
here
isn't
it
perhaps
he'll
take
you
off
my
hands
perhaps
he
doesn't
mind
dirty
Squibs
without
looking
at
anybody
or
thanking
Ogden
Merope
picked
up
the
pot
and
returned
it
hands
trembling
to
its
shelf
she
then
stood
quite
still
her
back
against
the
wall
between
the
filthy
window
and
the
stove
as
though
she
wished
for
nothing
more
than
to
sink
into
the
stone
and
vanish
mr.
Gaunt
Ogden
began
again
as
i've
said
the
reason
for
my
visit
i
heard
you
the
first
time
snapped
Gaunt
and
so
what
morfin
gave
a
Muggle
a
bit
of
what
was
coming
to
him
what
about
it
then
morfin
has
broken
Wizarding
law
said
Ogden
sternly
morfin
has
broken
Wizarding
law
gaunt
imitated
Ogdens
voice
making
it
pompous
and
singsong
morfin
cackled
again
he
taught
a
filthy
Muggle
a
lesson
that's
illegal
now
is
it
yes
said
Ogden
i'm
afraid
it
is
he
pulled
from
an
inside
pocket
a
small
scroll
of
parchment
and
unrolled
it
what's
that
then
his
sentence
said
Gaunt
his
voice
rising
angrily
it
is
a
summons
to
the
Ministry
for
a
hearing
summons
summons
who
do
you
think
you
are
summoning
my
son
anywhere
i'm
Head
of
the
Magical
Law
Enforcement
Squad
said
Ogden
and
you
think
we're
scum
do
you
screamed
Gaunt
advancing
on
Ogden
now
with
a
dirty
yellow-nailed
finger
pointing
at
his
chest
scum
who'll
come
running
when
the
Ministry
tells
em
to
do
you
know
who
you're
talking
to
you
filthy
little
Mudblood
do
you
i
was
under
the
impression
that
I
was
speaking
to
mr.
Gaunt
said
Ogden
looking
wary
but
standing
his
ground
that's
right
roared
Gaunt
for
a
moment
Harry
thought
Gaunt
was
making
an
obscene
hand
gesture
but
then
realized
that
he
was
showing
Ogden
the
ugly
black-stoned
ring
he
was
wearing
on
his
middle
finger
waving
it
before
ogden's
eyes
see
this
see
this
know
what
it
is
know
where
it
came
from
centuries
it's
been
in
our
family
that's
how
far
back
we
go
and
pure-blood
all
the
way
know
how
much
i've
been
offered
for
this
with
the
Peverell
coat
of
arms
engraved
on
the
stone
i've
really
no
idea
said
Ogden
blinking
as
the
ring
sailed
within
an
inch
of
his
nose
and
it's
quite
beside
the
point
mr.
Gaunt
your
son
has
committed
with
a
howl
of
rage
Gaunt
ran
toward
his
daughter
for
a
split
second
Harry
thought
he
was
going
to
throttle
her
as
his
hand
flew
to
her
throat
next
moment
he
was
dragging
her
toward
Ogden
by
a
gold
chain
around
her
neck
see
this
he
bellowed
at
Ogden
shaking
a
heavy
gold
locket
at
him
while
Merope
spluttered
and
gasped
for
breath
i
see
it
I
see
it
said
Ogden
hastily
slytherins
yelled
Gaunt
salazar
slytherin's
we're
his
last
living
descendants
what
do
you
say
to
that
eh
mr.
Gaunt
your
daughter
said
Ogden
in
alarm
but
Gaunt
had
already
released
Merope
she
staggered
away
from
him
back
to
her
corner
massaging
her
neck
and
gulping
for
air
so
said
Gaunt
triumphantly
as
though
he
had
just
proved
a
complicated
point
beyond
all
possible
dispute
don't
you
go
talking
to
us
as
if
we're
dirt
on
your
shoes
generations
of
purebloods
wizards
all
more
than
you
can
say
I
don't
doubt
and
he
spat
on
the
floor
at
Ogdens
feet
morfin
cackled
again
merope
huddled
beside
the
window
her
head
bowed
and
her
face
hidden
by
her
lank
hair
said
nothing
mr.
Gaunt
said
Ogden
doggedly
I
am
afraid
that
neither
your
ancestors
nor
mine
have
anything
to
do
with
the
matter
in
hand
i
am
here
because
of
Morfin
Morfin
and
the
Muggle
he
accosted
late
last
night
our
information
he
glanced
down
at
his
scroll
of
parchment
is
that
Morfin
performed
a
jinx
or
hex
on
the
said
Muggle
causing
him
to
erupt
in
highly
painful
hives
morfin
giggled
be
quiet
boy
snarled
Gaunt
in
Parseltongue
and
Morfin
fell
silent
again
and
so
what
if
he
did
then
gaunt
said
defiantly
to
Ogden
I
expect
you've
wiped
the
muggle's
filthy
face
clean
for
him
and
his
memory
to
boot
that's
hardly
the
point
is
it
mr.
Gaunt
said
Ogden
this
was
an
unprovoked
attack
on
a
defenseless
ar
I
had
you
marked
out
as
a
muggle-lover
the
moment
I
saw
you
sneered
Gaunt
and
he
spat
on
the
floor
again
this
discussion
is
getting
us
nowhere
said
Ogden
firmly
it
is
clear
from
your
son's
attitude
that
he
feels
no
remorse
for
his
actions
he
glanced
down
at
his
scroll
of
parchment
again
morfin
will
attend
a
hearing
on
the
fourteenth
of
September
to
answer
the
charges
of
using
magic
in
front
of
a
Muggle
and
causing
harm
and
distress
to
that
same
Mugg
ogden
broke
off
the
jingling
clopping
sounds
of
horses
and
loud
laughing
voices
were
drifting
in
through
the
open
window
apparently
the
winding
lane
to
the
village
passed
very
close
to
the
copse
where
the
house
stood
gaunt
froze
listening
his
eyes
wide
morfin
hissed
and
turned
his
face
toward
the
sounds
his
expression
hungry
merope
raised
her
head
her
face
Harry
saw
was
starkly
white
my
God
what
an
eyesore
rang
out
a
girl's
voice
as
clearly
audible
through
the
open
window
as
if
she
had
stood
in
the
room
beside
them
couldn't
your
father
have
that
hovel
cleared
away
Tom
it's
not
ours
said
a
young
man's
voice
everything
on
the
other
side
of
the
valley
belongs
to
us
but
that
cottage
belongs
to
an
old
tramp
called
Gaunt
and
his
children
the
son's
quite
mad
you
should
hear
some
of
the
stories
they
tell
in
the
village
the
girl
laughed
the
jingling
clopping
noises
were
growing
louder
and
louder
morfin
made
to
get
out
of
his
armchair
keep
your
seat
said
his
father
warningly
in
Parseltongue
tom
said
the
girl's
voice
again
now
so
close
they
were
clearly
right
beside
the
house
I
might
be
wrong
but
has
somebody
nailed
a
snake
to
that
door
good
lord
you're
right
said
the
man's
voice
that'll
be
the
son
I
told
you
he's
not
right
in
the
head
don't
look
at
it
Cecilia
darling
the
jingling
and
clopping
sounds
were
now
growing
faint
again
darling
whispered
Morfin
in
Parseltongue
looking
at
his
sister
darling
he
called
her
so
he
wouldn't
have
you
anyway
merope
was
so
white
Harry
felt
sure
she
was
going
to
faint
what's
that
said
Gaunt
sharply
also
in
Parseltongue
looking
from
his
son
to
his
daughter
what
did
you
say
Morfin
she
likes
looking
at
that
Muggle
said
Morfin
a
vicious
expression
on
his
face
as
he
stared
at
his
sister
who
now
looked
terrified
always
in
the
garden
when
he
passes
peering
through
the
hedge
at
him
isn't
she
and
last
night
merope
shook
her
head
jerkily
imploringly
but
Morfin
went
on
ruthlessly
Hanging
out
of
the
window
waiting
for
him
to
ride
home
wasn't
she
hanging
out
of
the
window
to
look
at
a
Muggle
said
Gaunt
quietly
all
three
of
the
Gaunts
seemed
to
have
forgotten
Ogden
who
was
looking
both
bewildered
and
irritated
at
this
renewed
outbreak
of
incomprehensible
hissing
and
rasping
is
it
true
said
Gaunt
in
a
deadly
voice
advancing
a
step
or
two
toward
the
terrified
girl
my
daughterpure-blooded
descendant
of
Salazar
Slytherin
hankering
after
a
filthy
dirt-veined
Muggle
merope
shook
her
head
frantically
pressing
herself
into
the
wall
apparently
unable
to
speak
but
I
got
him
Father
cackled
Morfin
i
got
him
as
he
went
by
and
he
didn't
look
so
pretty
with
hives
all
over
him
did
he
Merope
you
disgusting
little
Squib
you
filthy
little
blood
traitor
roared
Gaunt
losing
control
and
his
hands
closed
around
his
daughter's
throat
both
Harry
and
Ogden
yelled
No
at
the
same
time
Ogden
raised
his
wand
and
cried
Relaskio
gaunt
was
thrown
backward
away
from
his
daughter
he
tripped
over
a
chair
and
fell
flat
on
his
back
with
a
roar
of
rage
Morfin
leapt
out
of
his
chair
and
ran
at
Ogden
brandishing
his
bloody
knife
and
firing
hexes
indiscriminately
from
his
wand
ogden
ran
for
his
life
dumbledore
indicated
that
they
ought
to
follow
and
Harry
obeyed
merope's
screams
echoing
in
his
ears
ogden
hurtled
up
the
path
and
erupted
onto
the
main
lane
his
arms
over
his
head
where
he
collided
with
the
glossy
chestnut
horse
ridden
by
a
very
handsome
dark-haired
young
man
both
he
and
the
pretty
girl
riding
beside
him
on
a
gray
horse
roared
with
laughter
at
the
sight
of
Ogden
who
bounced
off
the
horse's
flank
and
set
off
again
his
frock
coat
flying
covered
from
head
to
foot
in
dust
running
pell-mell
up
the
lane
i
think
that
will
do
Harry
said
Dumbledore
he
took
Harry
by
the
elbow
and
tugged
next
moment
they
were
both
soaring
weightlessly
through
darkness
until
they
landed
squarely
on
their
feet
back
in
dumbledore's
now
twilit
office
what
happened
to
the
girl
in
the
cottage
said
Harry
at
once
as
Dumbledore
lit
extra
lamps
with
a
flick
of
his
wand
merope
or
whatever
her
name
was
oh
she
survived
said
Dumbledore
reseating
himself
behind
his
desk
and
indicating
that
Harry
should
sit
down
too
ogden
Apparated
back
to
the
Ministry
and
returned
with
reinforcements
within
fifteen
minutes
morfin
and
his
father
attempted
to
fight
but
both
were
overpowered
removed
from
the
cottage
and
subsequently
convicted
by
the
Wizengamot
morfin
who
already
had
a
record
of
Muggle
attacks
was
sentenced
to
three
years
in
Azkaban
marvolo
who
had
injured
several
Ministry
employees
in
addition
to
Ogden
received
six
months
marvolo
harry
repeated
wonderingly
that's
right
said
Dumbledore
smiling
in
approval
i
am
glad
to
see
you're
keeping
up
that
old
man
was
voldemort's
grandfather
yes
said
Dumbledore
marvolo
his
son
Morfin
and
his
daughter
Merope
were
the
last
of
the
Gaunts
a
very
ancient
Wizarding
family
noted
for
a
vein
of
instability
and
violence
that
flourished
through
the
generations
due
to
their
habit
of
marrying
their
own
cousins
lack
of
sense
coupled
with
a
great
liking
for
grandeur
meant
that
the
family
gold
was
squandered
several
generations
before
Marvolo
was
born
he
as
you
saw
was
left
in
squalor
and
poverty
with
a
very
nasty
temper
a
fantastic
amount
of
arrogance
and
pride
and
a
couple
of
family
heirlooms
that
he
treasured
just
as
much
as
his
son
and
rather
more
than
his
daughter
so
Merope
said
Harry
leaning
forward
in
his
chair
and
star-ing
at
Dumbledore
so
Merope
was
sir
does
that
mean
she
was
voldemort's
mother
it
does
said
Dumbledore
and
it
so
happens
that
we
also
had
a
glimpse
of
voldemort's
father
i
wonder
whether
you
noticed
the
Muggle
Morfin
attacked
the
man
on
the
horse
very
good
indeed
said
Dumbledore
beaming
yes
that
was
Tom
Riddle
senior
the
handsome
Muggle
who
used
to
go
riding
past
the
Gaunt
cottage
and
for
whom
Merope
Gaunt
cherished
a
secret
burning
passion
and
they
ended
up
married
harry
said
in
disbelief
unable
to
imagine
two
people
less
likely
to
fall
in
love
i
think
you
are
forgetting
said
Dumbledore
that
Merope
was
a
witch
i
do
not
believe
that
her
magical
powers
appeared
to
their
best
advantage
when
she
was
being
terrorized
by
her
father
once
Marvolo
and
Morfin
were
safely
in
Azkaban
once
she
was
alone
and
free
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
then
I
am
sure
she
was
able
to
give
full
rein
to
her
abilities
and
to
plot
her
escape
from
the
desperate
life
she
had
led
for
eighteen
years
can
you
not
think
of
any
measure
Merope
could
have
taken
to
make
Tom
Riddle
forget
his
Muggle
companion
and
fall
in
love
with
her
instead
the
Imperius
Curse
harry
suggested
or
a
love
potion
very
good
personally
I
am
inclined
to
think
that
she
used
a
love
potion
i
am
sure
it
would
have
seemed
more
romantic
to
her
and
I
do
not
think
it
would
have
been
very
difficult
some
hot
day
when
Riddle
was
riding
alone
to
persuade
him
to
take
a
drink
of
water
in
any
case
within
a
few
months
of
the
scene
we
have
just
witnessed
the
village
of
Little
Hangleton
enjoyed
a
tremendous
scandal
you
can
imagine
the
gossip
it
caused
when
the
squire's
son
ran
off
with
the
tramp's
daughter
Merope
but
the
villagers
shock
was
nothing
to
marvolo's
he
returned
from
Azkaban
expecting
to
find
his
daughter
dutifully
awaiting
his
return
with
a
hot
meal
ready
on
his
table
instead
he
found
a
clear
inch
of
dust
and
her
note
of
farewell
explaining
what
she
had
done
from
all
that
I
have
been
able
to
discover
he
never
mentioned
her
name
or
existence
from
that
time
forth
the
shock
of
her
desertion
may
have
contributed
to
his
early
death
or
perhaps
he
had
simply
never
learned
to
feed
himself
azkaban
had
greatly
weakened
Marvolo
and
he
did
not
live
to
see
Morfin
return
to
the
cottage
and
Merope
she
she
died
didn't
she
wasn't
Voldemort
brought
up
in
an
orphanage
yes
indeed
said
Dumbledore
we
must
do
a
certain
amount
of
guessing
here
although
I
do
not
think
it
is
difficult
to
deduce
what
happened
you
see
within
a
few
months
of
their
runaway
marriage
Tom
riddle
reappeared
at
the
manor
house
in
Little
Hangleton
without
his
wife
the
rumor
flew
around
the
neighborhood
that
he
was
talking
of
being
hoodwinked
and
taken
in
what
he
meant
I
am
sure
is
that
he
had
been
under
an
enchantment
that
had
now
lifted
though
I
daresay
he
did
not
dare
use
those
precise
words
for
fear
of
being
thought
insane
when
they
heard
what
he
was
saying
however
the
villagers
guessed
that
Merope
had
lied
to
Tom
Riddle
pretending
that
she
was
going
to
have
his
baby
and
that
he
had
married
her
for
this
reason
but
she
did
have
his
baby
but
not
until
a
year
after
they
were
married
tom
Riddle
left
her
while
she
was
still
pregnant
what
went
wrong
asked
Harry
why
did
the
love
potion
stop
working
again
this
is
guesswork
said
Dumbledore
but
I
believe
that
Merope
who
was
deeply
in
love
with
her
husband
could
not
bear
to
continue
enslaving
him
by
magical
means
i
believe
that
she
made
the
choice
to
stop
giving
him
the
potion
perhaps
besotted
as
she
was
she
had
convinced
herself
that
he
would
by
now
have
fallen
in
love
with
her
in
return
perhaps
she
thought
he
would
stay
for
the
baby's
sake
if
so
she
was
wrong
on
both
counts
he
left
her
never
saw
her
again
and
never
troubled
to
discover
what
became
of
his
son
the
sky
outside
was
inky
black
and
the
lamps
in
dumbledore's
office
seemed
to
glow
more
brightly
than
before
i
think
that
will
do
for
tonight
Harry
said
Dumbledore
after
a
moment
or
two
yes
sir
said
Harry
he
got
to
his
feet
but
did
not
leave
sir
is
it
important
to
know
all
this
about
voldemort's
past
very
important
I
think
said
Dumbledore
and
it
it's
got
something
to
do
with
the
prophecy
it
has
everything
to
do
with
the
prophecy
right
said
Harry
a
little
confused
but
reassured
all
the
same
he
turned
to
go
then
another
question
occurred
to
him
and
he
turned
back
again
sir
am
I
allowed
to
tell
Ron
and
Hermione
everything
you've
told
me
dumbledore
considered
him
for
a
moment
then
said
Yes
I
think
mr.
Weasley
and
Miss
Granger
have
proved
themselves
trust-worthy
but
Harry
I
am
going
to
ask
you
to
ask
them
not
to
repeat
any
of
this
to
anybody
else
it
would
not
be
a
good
idea
if
word
got
around
how
much
I
know
or
suspect
about
Lord
voldemort's
secrets
no
sir
i'll
make
sure
it's
just
Ron
and
Hermione
good
night
he
turned
away
again
and
was
almost
at
the
door
when
he
saw
it
sitting
on
one
of
the
little
spindle-legged
tables
that
supported
so
many
frail-looking
silver
instruments
was
an
ugly
gold
ring
set
with
a
large
cracked
black
stone
sir
said
Harry
staring
at
it
that
ring
yes
said
Dumbledore
you
were
wearing
it
when
we
visited
Professor
Slughorn
that
night
so
I
was
Dumbledore
agreed
but
isn't
it
sir
isn't
it
the
same
ring
Marvolo
Gaunt
showed
Ogden
dumbledore
bowed
his
head
the
very
same
but
how
come
have
you
always
had
it
no
I
acquired
it
very
recently
said
Dumbledore
a
few
days
before
I
came
to
fetch
you
from
your
aunt
and
uncle's
in
fact
that
would
be
around
the
time
you
injured
your
hand
then
sir
around
that
time
yes
Harry
harry
hesitated
dumbledore
was
smiling
sir
how
exactly
too
late
Harry
you
shall
hear
the
story
another
time
good
night
good
night
sir
chapter
hermione's
helping
hand
as
Hermione
had
predicted
the
sixth
years
free
periods
were
not
the
hours
of
blissful
relaxation
Ron
had
anticipated
but
times
in
which
to
attempt
to
keep
up
with
the
vast
amount
of
homework
they
were
being
set
not
only
were
they
studying
as
though
they
had
exams
every
day
but
the
lessons
themselves
had
become
more
demanding
than
ever
before
harry
barely
understood
half
of
what
Professor
McGonagall
said
to
them
these
days
even
Hermione
had
had
to
ask
her
to
repeat
instructions
once
or
twice
incredibly
and
to
hermione's
increasing
resentment
harry's
best
subject
had
suddenly
become
Potions
thanks
to
the
Half-Blood
Prince
nonverbal
spells
were
now
expected
not
only
in
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
but
in
Charms
and
Transfiguration
too
harry
frequently
looked
over
at
his
classmates
in
the
common
room
or
at
mealtimes
to
see
them
purple
in
the
face
and
straining
as
though
they
had
overdosed
on
U-No-Poo
but
he
knew
that
they
were
really
struggling
to
make
spells
work
without
saying
incantations
aloud
it
was
a
relief
to
get
outside
into
the
greenhouses
they
were
dealing
with
more
dangerous
plants
than
ever
in
Herbology
but
at
least
they
were
still
allowed
to
swear
loudly
if
the
Venomous
Tentacula
seized
them
unexpectedly
from
behind
one
result
of
their
enormous
workload
and
the
frantic
hours
of
practicing
nonverbal
spells
was
that
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
had
so
far
been
unable
to
find
time
to
go
and
visit
Hagrid
he
had
stopped
coming
to
meals
at
the
staff
table
an
ominous
sign
and
on
the
few
occasions
when
they
had
passed
him
in
the
corridors
or
out
in
the
grounds
he
had
mysteriously
failed
to
notice
them
or
hear
their
greetings
we've
got
to
go
and
explain
said
Hermione
looking
up
at
hagrid's
huge
empty
chair
at
the
staff
table
the
following
Saturday
at
breakfast
we've
got
Quidditch
tryouts
this
morning
said
Ron
and
we're
supposed
to
be
practicing
that
Aguamenti
Charm
from
Flitwick
anyway
explain
what
how
are
we
going
to
tell
him
we
hated
his
stupid
subject
we
didn't
hate
it
said
Hermione
speak
for
yourself
I
haven't
forgotten
the
skrewts
said
Ron
darkly
and
i'm
telling
you
now
we've
had
a
narrow
escape
you
didn't
hear
him
going
on
about
his
gormless
brother
we'd
have
been
teaching
Grawp
how
to
tie
his
shoelaces
if
we'd
stayed
i
hate
not
talking
to
Hagrid
said
Hermione
looking
upset
we'll
go
down
after
Quidditch
Harry
assured
her
he
too
was
missing
Hagrid
although
like
Ron
he
thought
that
they
were
better
off
without
Grawp
in
their
lives
but
trials
might
take
all
morning
the
number
of
people
who
have
applied
he
felt
slightly
nervous
at
confronting
the
first
hurdle
of
his
Captaincy
i
dunno
why
the
team's
this
popular
all
of
a
sudden
oh
come
on
Harry
said
Hermione
suddenly
impatient
it's
not
Quidditch
that's
popular
it's
you
you've
never
been
more
interesting
and
frankly
you've
never
been
more
fanciable
ron
gagged
on
a
large
piece
of
kipper
hermione
spared
him
one
look
of
disdain
before
turning
back
to
Harry
everyone
knows
you've
been
telling
the
truth
now
don't
they
the
whole
Wizarding
world
has
had
to
admit
that
you
were
right
about
Voldemort
being
back
and
that
you
really
have
fought
him
twice
in
the
last
two
years
and
escaped
both
times
and
now
they're
calling
you
the
Chosen
One
well
come
on
can't
you
see
why
people
are
fascinated
by
you
harry
was
finding
the
Great
Hall
very
hot
all
of
a
sudden
even
though
the
ceiling
still
looked
cold
and
rainy
and
you've
been
through
all
that
persecution
from
the
Ministry
when
they
were
trying
to
make
out
you
were
unstable
and
a
liar
you
can
still
see
the
marks
on
the
back
of
your
hand
where
that
evil
woman
made
you
write
with
your
own
blood
but
you
stuck
to
your
story
anyway
you
can
still
see
where
those
brains
got
hold
of
me
in
the
Ministry
look
said
Ron
shaking
back
his
sleeves
and
it
doesn't
hurt
that
you've
grown
about
a
foot
over
the
summer
either
Hermione
finished
ignoring
Ron
i'm
tall
said
Ron
inconsequentially
the
post
owls
arrived
swooping
down
through
rain-flecked
windows
scattering
everyone
with
droplets
of
water
most
people
were
receiving
more
post
than
usual
anxious
parents
were
keen
to
hear
from
their
children
and
to
reassure
them
in
turn
that
all
was
well
at
home
harry
had
received
no
mail
since
the
start
of
term
his
only
regular
correspondent
was
now
dead
and
although
he
had
hoped
that
Lupin
might
write
occasionally
he
had
so
far
been
disappointed
he
was
very
surprised
therefore
to
see
the
snowy
white
Hedwig
circling
amongst
all
the
brown
and
gray
owls
she
landed
in
front
of
him
carrying
a
large
square
package
a
moment
later
an
identical
package
landed
in
front
of
Ron
crushing
beneath
it
his
minuscule
and
exhausted
owl
Pigwidgeon
ha
said
Harry
unwrapping
the
parcel
to
reveal
a
new
copy
of
Advanced
Potion-Making
fresh
from
Flourish
and
Blotts
oh
good
said
Hermione
delighted
now
you
can
give
that
graffitied
copy
back
are
you
mad
said
Harry
i'm
keeping
it
look
i've
thought
it
out
he
pulled
the
old
copy
of
Advanced
Potion-Making
out
of
his
bag
and
tapped
the
cover
with
his
wand
muttering
Dijjindo
the
cover
fell
off
he
did
the
same
thing
with
the
brand-new
book
Hermione
looked
scandalized
he
then
swapped
the
covers
tapped
each
and
said
Reparo
there
sat
the
prince's
copy
disguised
as
a
new
book
and
there
sat
the
fresh
copy
from
Flourish
and
Blotts
looking
thoroughly
secondhand
i'll
give
Slughorn
back
the
new
one
he
can't
complain
it
cost
nine
Galleons
hermione
pressed
her
lips
together
looking
angry
and
disapproving
but
was
distracted
by
a
third
owl
landing
in
front
of
her
carrying
that
day's
copy
of
the
Daily
Prophet
she
unfolded
it
hastily
and
scanned
the
front
page
anyone
we
know
dead
asked
Ron
in
a
determinedly
casual
voice
he
posed
the
same
question
every
time
Hermione
opened
her
paper
no
but
there
have
been
more
dementor
attacks
said
Hermione
and
an
arrest
excellent
who
said
Harry
thinking
of
Bellatrix
Lestrange
stan
Shunpike
said
Hermione
what
said
Harry
startled
stanley
Shunpike
conductor
on
the
popular
Wizarding
conveyance
the
Knight
Bus
has
been
arrested
on
suspicion
of
Death
Eater
activity
mr.
Shunpike
was
taken
into
custody
late
last
night
after
a
raid
on
his
Clapham
home
stan
Shunpike
a
Death
Eater
said
Harry
remembering
the
spotty
youth
he
had
first
met
three
years
before
no
way
he
might
have
been
put
under
the
Imperius
Curse
said
Ron
reasonably
you
never
can
tell
it
doesn't
look
like
it
said
Hermione
who
was
still
reading
it
says
here
he
was
arrested
after
he
was
overheard
talking
about
the
Death
Eaters
secret
plans
in
a
pub
she
looked
up
with
a
troubled
expression
on
her
face
if
he
was
under
the
Imperius
Curse
he'd
hardly
stand
around
gossiping
about
their
plans
would
he
it
sounds
like
he
was
trying
to
make
out
he
knew
more
than
he
did
said
Ron
isn't
he
the
one
who
claimed
he
was
going
to
become
Minister
of
Magic
when
he
was
trying
to
chat
up
those
veela
yeah
that's
him
said
Harry
i
dunno
what
they're
playing
at
taking
Stan
seriously
they
probably
want
to
look
as
though
they're
doing
something
said
Hermione
frowning
people
are
terrified
you
know
the
Patil
twins
parents
want
them
to
go
home
and
Eloise
Midgen
has
already
been
withdrawn
her
father
picked
her
up
last
night
what
said
Ron
goggling
at
Hermione
but
Hogwarts
is
safer
than
their
homes
bound
to
be
we've
got
Aurors
and
all
those
extra
protective
spells
and
we've
got
Dumbledore
i
don't
think
we've
got
him
all
the
time
said
Hermione
very
quietly
glancing
toward
the
staff
table
over
the
top
of
the
Prophet
haven't
you
noticed
his
seat's
been
empty
as
often
as
hagrid's
this
past
week
harry
and
Ron
looked
up
at
the
staff
table
the
headmaster's
chair
was
indeed
empty
now
Harry
came
to
think
of
it
he
had
not
seen
Dumbledore
since
their
private
lesson
a
week
ago
i
think
he's
left
the
school
to
do
something
with
the
Order
said
Hermione
in
a
low
voice
i
mean
it's
all
looking
serious
isn't
it
harry
and
Ron
did
not
answer
but
Harry
knew
that
they
were
all
thinking
the
same
thing
there
had
been
a
horrible
incident
the
day
before
when
Hannah
Abbott
had
been
taken
out
of
Herbology
to
be
told
her
mother
had
been
found
dead
they
had
not
seen
Hannah
since
when
they
left
the
Gryffindor
table
five
minutes
later
to
head
down
to
the
Quidditch
pitch
they
passed
Lavender
Brown
and
Parvati
Patil
remembering
what
Hermione
had
said
about
the
Patil
twins
parents
wanting
them
to
leave
Hogwarts
Harry
was
unsurprised
to
see
that
the
two
best
friends
were
whispering
together
looking
distressed
what
did
surprise
him
was
that
when
Ron
drew
level
with
them
Parvati
suddenly
nudged
Lavender
who
looked
around
and
gave
Ron
a
wide
smile
ron
blinked
at
her
then
returned
the
smile
uncertainly
his
walk
instantly
became
something
more
like
a
strut
harry
resisted
the
temptation
to
laugh
remembering
that
Ron
had
refrained
from
doing
so
after
Malfoy
had
broken
harry's
nose
Hermione
however
looked
cold
and
distant
all
the
way
down
to
the
stadium
through
the
cool
misty
drizzle
and
departed
to
find
a
place
in
the
stands
without
wishing
Ron
good
luck
as
Harry
had
expected
the
trials
took
most
of
the
morning
half
of
Gryffindor
House
seemed
to
have
turned
up
from
first
years
who
were
nervously
clutching
a
selection
of
the
dreadful
old
school
brooms
to
seventh
years
who
towered
over
the
rest
looking
coolly
intimidating
the
latter
included
a
large
wiry-haired
boy
Harry
recognized
immediately
from
the
Hogwarts
Express
we
met
on
the
train
in
old
sluggy's
compartment
he
said
confidently
stepping
out
of
the
crowd
to
shake
harry's
hand
cormac
McLaggen
Keeper
you
didn't
try
out
last
year
did
you
asked
Harry
taking
note
of
the
breadth
of
McLaggen
and
thinking
that
he
would
probably
block
all
three
goal
hoops
without
even
moving
i
was
in
the
hospital
wing
when
they
held
the
trials
said
McLaggen
with
something
of
a
swagger
ate
a
pound
of
doxy
eggs
for
a
bet
right
said
Harry
well
if
you
wait
over
there
he
pointed
over
to
the
edge
of
the
pitch
close
to
where
Hermione
was
sitting
he
thought
he
saw
a
flicker
of
annoyance
pass
over
mclaggen's
face
and
wondered
whether
McLaggen
expected
preferential
treatment
because
they
were
both
old
sluggy's
favorites
harry
decided
to
start
with
a
basic
test
asking
all
applicants
for
the
team
to
divide
into
groups
of
ten
and
fly
once
around
the
pitch
this
was
a
good
decision
the
first
ten
was
made
up
of
first
years
and
it
could
not
have
been
plainer
that
they
had
hardly
ever
flown
before
only
one
boy
managed
to
remain
airborne
for
more
than
a
few
seconds
and
he
was
so
surprised
he
promptly
crashed
into
one
of
the
goal
posts
the
second
group
was
comprised
of
ten
of
the
silliest
girls
Harry
had
ever
encountered
who
when
he
blew
his
whistle
merely
fell
about
giggling
and
clutching
one
another
romilda
Vane
was
amongst
them
when
he
told
them
to
leave
the
pitch
they
did
so
quite
cheerfully
and
went
to
sit
in
the
stands
to
heckle
everyone
else
the
third
group
had
a
pileup
halfway
around
the
pitch
most
of
the
fourth
group
had
come
without
broomsticks
the
fifth
group
were
Hufflepuffs
if
there's
anyone
else
here
who's
not
from
Gryffindor
roared
Harry
who
was
starting
to
get
seriously
annoyed
leave
now
please
there
was
a
pause
then
a
couple
of
little
Ravenclaws
went
sprinting
off
the
pitch
snorting
with
laughter
after
two
hours
many
complaints
and
several
tantrums
one
involving
a
crashed
Comet
Two
Sixty
and
several
broken
teeth
Harry
had
found
himself
three
Chasers
Katie
Bell
returned
to
the
team
after
an
excellent
trial
a
new
find
called
Demelza
Robins
who
was
particularly
good
at
dodging
Bludgers
and
Ginny
Weasley
who
had
outflown
all
the
competition
and
scored
seventeen
goals
to
boot
pleased
though
he
was
with
his
choices
harry
had
also
shouted
himself
hoarse
at
the
many
complainers
and
was
now
enduring
a
similar
battle
with
the
rejected
Beaters
that's
my
final
decision
and
if
you
don't
get
out
of
the
way
of
the
Keepers
i'll
hex
you
he
bellowed
neither
of
his
chosen
Beaters
had
the
old
brilliance
of
Fred
and
George
but
he
was
still
reasonably
pleased
with
them
Jimmy
Peakes
a
short
but
broad-chested
third-year
boy
who
had
managed
to
raise
a
lump
the
size
of
an
egg
on
the
back
of
harry's
head
with
a
ferociously
hit
Bludger
and
Ritchie
Coote
who
looked
weedy
but
aimed
well
they
now
joined
Katie
Demelza
and
Ginny
in
the
stands
to
watch
the
selection
of
their
last
team
member
harry
had
deliberately
left
the
trial
of
the
Keepers
until
last
hoping
for
an
emptier
stadium
and
less
pressure
on
all
concerned
unfortunately
however
all
the
rejected
players
and
a
number
of
people
who
had
come
down
to
watch
after
a
lengthy
breakfast
had
joined
the
crowd
by
now
so
that
it
was
larger
than
ever
as
each
Keeper
flew
up
to
the
goal
hoops
the
crowd
roared
and
jeered
in
equal
measure
harry
glanced
over
at
Ron
who
had
always
had
a
problem
with
nerves
Harry
had
hoped
that
winning
their
final
match
last
term
might
have
cured
it
but
apparently
not
Ron
was
a
delicate
shade
of
green
none
of
the
first
five
applicants
saved
more
than
two
goals
apiece
to
harry's
great
disappointment
Cormac
McLaggen
saved
four
penalties
out
of
five
on
the
last
one
however
he
shot
off
in
completely
the
wrong
direction
the
crowd
laughed
and
booed
and
McLaggen
returned
to
the
ground
grinding
his
teeth
ron
looked
ready
to
pass
out
as
he
mounted
his
Cleansweep
Eleven
good
luck
cried
a
voice
from
the
stands
harry
looked
around
expecting
to
see
Hermione
but
it
was
Lavender
Brown
he
would
have
quite
liked
to
have
hidden
his
face
in
his
hands
as
she
did
a
moment
later
but
thought
that
as
the
Captain
he
ought
to
show
slightly
more
grit
and
so
turned
to
watch
Ron
do
his
trial
yet
he
need
not
have
worried
Ron
saved
one
two
three
four
five
penalties
in
a
row
delighted
and
resisting
joining
in
the
cheers
of
the
crowd
with
difficulty
Harry
turned
to
McLaggen
to
tell
him
that
most
unfortunately
Ron
had
beaten
him
only
to
find
mclaggen's
red
face
inches
from
his
own
he
stepped
back
hastily
his
sister
didn't
really
try
said
McLaggen
menacingly
there
was
a
vein
pulsing
in
his
temple
like
the
one
Harry
had
often
ad-mired
in
Uncle
vernon's
she
gave
him
an
easy
save
rubbish
said
Harry
coldly
that
was
the
one
he
nearly
missed
mcLaggen
took
a
step
nearer
Harry
who
stood
his
ground
this
time
give
me
another
go
no
said
Harry
you've
had
your
go
you
saved
four
ron
saved
five
ron's
Keeper
he
won
it
fair
and
square
get
out
of
my
way
he
thought
for
a
moment
that
McLaggen
might
punch
him
but
he
contented
himself
with
an
ugly
grimace
and
stormed
away
growling
what
sounded
like
threats
to
thin
air
harry
turned
around
to
find
his
new
team
beaming
at
him
well
done
he
croaked
you
flew
really
well
you
did
brilliantly
Ron
this
time
it
really
was
Hermione
running
toward
them
from
the
stands
Harry
saw
Lavender
walking
off
the
pitch
arm
in
arm
with
Parvati
a
rather
grumpy
expression
on
her
face
ron
looked
extremely
pleased
with
himself
and
even
taller
than
usual
as
he
grinned
at
the
team
and
at
Hermione
after
fixing
the
time
of
their
first
full
practice
for
the
following
Thursday
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
bade
good-bye
to
the
rest
of
the
team
and
headed
off
toward
hagrid's
a
watery
sun
was
trying
to
break
through
the
clouds
now
and
it
had
stopped
drizzling
at
last
harry
felt
extremely
hungry
he
hoped
there
would
be
some-thing
to
eat
at
hagrid's
i
thought
I
was
going
to
miss
that
fourth
penalty
Ron
was
saying
happily
tricky
shot
from
Demelza
did
you
see
had
a
bit
of
spin
on
it
yes
yes
you
were
magnificent
said
Hermione
looking
amused
i
was
better
than
that
McLaggen
anyway
said
Ron
in
a
highly
satisfied
voice
did
you
see
him
lumbering
off
in
the
wrong
direction
on
his
fifth
looked
like
he'd
been
Confunded
to
harry's
surprise
Hermione
turned
a
very
deep
shade
of
pink
at
these
words
ron
noticed
nothing
he
was
too
busy
describing
each
of
his
other
penalties
in
loving
detail
the
great
gray
hippogriff
Buckbeak
was
tethered
in
front
of
hagrid's
cabin
he
clicked
his
razor-sharp
beak
at
their
approach
and
turned
his
huge
head
toward
them
oh
dear
said
Hermione
nervously
he's
still
a
bit
scary
isn't
he
come
off
it
you've
ridden
him
haven't
you
said
Ron
harry
stepped
forward
and
bowed
low
to
the
hippogriff
without
breaking
eye
contact
or
blinking
after
a
few
seconds
Buckbeak
sank
into
a
bow
too
how
are
you
harry
asked
him
in
a
low
voice
moving
forward
to
stroke
the
feathery
head
missing
him
but
you're
okay
here
with
Hagrid
aren't
you
oi
said
a
loud
voice
hagrid
had
come
striding
around
the
corner
of
his
cabin
wearing
a
large
flowery
apron
and
carrying
a
sack
of
potatoes
his
enormous
boarhound
Fang
was
at
his
heels
Fang
gave
a
booming
bark
and
bounded
forward
git
away
from
him
he'll
have
yer
fingers
oh
it's
yeh
lot
fang
was
jumping
up
at
Hermione
and
Ron
attempting
to
lick
their
ears
hagrid
stood
and
looked
at
them
all
for
a
split
second
then
turned
and
strode
into
his
cabin
slamming
the
door
behind
him
oh
dear
said
Hermione
looking
stricken
don't
worry
about
it
said
Harry
grimly
he
walked
over
to
the
door
and
knocked
loudly
hagrid
open
up
we
want
to
talk
to
you
there
was
no
sound
from
within
if
you
don't
open
the
door
we'll
blast
it
open
harry
said
pulling
out
his
wand
harry
said
Hermione
sounding
shocked
you
can't
possibly
yeah
I
can
said
Harry
stand
back
but
before
he
could
say
anything
else
the
door
flew
open
again
as
Harry
had
known
it
would
and
there
stood
Hagrid
glowering
down
at
him
and
looking
despite
the
flowery
apron
positively
alarming
i'm
a
teacher
he
roared
at
Harry
a
teacher
Potter
how
dare
yeh
threaten
ter
break
down
my
door
i'm
sorry
sir
said
Harry
emphasizing
the
last
word
as
he
stowed
his
wand
inside
his
robes
hagrid
looked
stunned
since
when
have
yeh
called
me
sir
since
when
have
you
called
me
Potter
oh
very
clever
growled
Hagrid
very
amusin
that's
me
outsmarted
innit
all
righ
come
in
then
yeh
ungrateful
little
mumbling
darkly
he
stood
back
to
let
them
pass
hermione
scurried
in
after
Harry
looking
rather
frightened
well
said
Hagrid
grumpily
as
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
sat
down
around
his
enormous
wooden
table
Fang
laying
his
head
immediately
upon
harry's
knee
and
drooling
all
over
his
robes
what's
this
feelin
sorry
for
me
reckon
i'm
lonely
or
summat
no
said
Harry
at
once
we
wanted
to
see
you
we've
missed
you
said
Hermione
tremulously
missed
me
have
yeh
snorted
Hagrid
yeah
righ
he
stomped
around
brewing
up
tea
in
his
enormous
copper
kettle
muttering
all
the
while
finally
he
slammed
down
three
bucket-sized
mugs
of
mahogany-brown
tea
in
front
of
them
and
a
plate
of
his
rock
cakes
harry
was
hungry
enough
even
for
hagrid's
cooking
and
took
one
at
once
hagrid
said
Hermione
timidly
when
he
joined
them
at
the
table
and
started
peeling
his
potatoes
with
a
brutality
that
suggested
that
each
tuber
had
done
him
a
great
personal
wrong
we
really
wanted
to
carry
on
with
Care
of
Magical
Creatures
you
know
hagrid
gave
another
great
snort
harry
rather
thought
some
bo-geys
landed
on
the
potatoes
and
was
inwardly
thankful
that
they
were
not
staying
for
dinner
we
did
said
Hermione
but
none
of
us
could
fit
it
into
our
schedules
yeah
righ
said
Hagrid
again
there
was
a
funny
squelching
sound
and
they
all
looked
around
Hermione
let
out
a
tiny
shriek
and
Ron
leapt
out
of
his
seat
and
hurried
around
the
table
away
from
the
large
barrel
standing
in
the
corner
that
they
had
only
just
noticed
it
was
full
of
what
looked
like
foot-long
maggots
slimy
white
and
writhing
what
are
they
Hagrid
asked
Harry
trying
to
sound
interested
rather
than
revolted
but
putting
down
his
rock
cake
all
the
same
jus
giant
grubs
said
Hagrid
and
they
grow
into
said
Ron
looking
apprehensive
they
won
grow
inter
nuthin
said
Hagrid
i
got
em
ter
feed
ter
Aragog
and
without
warning
he
burst
into
tears
hagrid
cried
Hermione
leaping
up
hurrying
around
the
table
the
long
way
to
avoid
the
barrel
of
maggots
and
putting
an
arm
around
his
shaking
shoulders
what
is
it
it's
him
gulped
Hagrid
his
beetle-black
eyes
stream-ing
as
he
mopped
his
face
with
his
apron
it's
aragog
i
think
he's
dyin
he
got
ill
over
the
summer
an
he's
not
gettin
better
i
don
know
what
i'll
do
if
he
if
he
we've
bin
tergether
so
long
hermione
patted
hagrid's
shoulder
looking
at
a
complete
loss
for
anything
to
say
harry
knew
how
she
felt
he
had
known
Hagrid
to
present
a
vicious
baby
dragon
with
a
teddy
bear
seen
him
croon
over
giant
scorpions
with
suckers
and
stingers
attempt
to
reason
with
his
brutal
giant
of
a
half-brother
but
this
was
perhaps
the
most
incomprehensible
of
all
his
monster
fancies
the
gigantic
talking
spider
Aragog
who
dwelled
deep
in
the
Forbidden
Forest
and
which
he
and
Ron
had
only
narrowly
escaped
four
years
previously
is
there
is
there
anything
we
can
do
hermione
asked
ignoring
ron's
frantic
grimaces
and
head-shakings
i
don
think
there
is
Hermione
choked
Hagrid
attempting
to
stem
the
flood
of
his
tears
see
the
rest
o
the
tribe
aragog's
family
they're
gettin
a
bit
funny
now
he's
ill
bit
restive
yeah
I
think
we
saw
a
bit
of
that
side
of
them
said
Ron
in
an
undertone
i
don
reckon
it'd
be
safe
fer
anyone
but
me
ter
go
near
the
colony
at
the
mo
Hagrid
finished
blowing
his
nose
hard
on
his
apron
and
looking
up
but
thanks
fer
offerin
Hermione
it
means
a
lot
after
that
the
atmosphere
lightened
considerably
for
although
neither
Harry
nor
Ron
had
shown
any
inclination
to
go
and
feed
giant
grubs
to
a
murderous
gargantuan
spider
Hagrid
seemed
to
take
it
for
granted
that
they
would
have
liked
to
have
done
and
became
his
usual
self
once
more
ar
I
always
knew
yeh'd
find
it
hard
ter
squeeze
me
inter
yer
timetables
he
said
gruffly
pouring
them
more
tea
even
if
yeh
applied
fer
Time-Turners
we
couldn't
have
done
said
Hermione
we
smashed
the
entire
stock
of
Ministry
Time-Turners
when
we
were
there
last
summer
it
was
in
the
Daily
Prophet
ar
well
then
said
Hagrid
there's
no
way
yeh
could've
done
it
i'm
sorry
i've
bin
yeh
know
i've
jus
bin
worried
about
Aragog
an
I
did
wonder
whether
if
Professor
Grubbly-Plank
had
bin
teachin
yeh
at
which
all
three
of
them
stated
categorically
and
untruthfully
that
Professor
Grubbly-Plank
who
had
substituted
for
Hagrid
a
few
times
was
a
dreadful
teacher
with
the
result
that
by
the
time
Hagrid
waved
them
off
the
premises
at
dusk
he
looked
quite
cheerful
i'm
starving
said
Harry
once
the
door
had
closed
behind
them
and
they
were
hurrying
through
the
dark
and
deserted
grounds
he
had
abandoned
the
rock
cake
after
an
ominous
cracking
noise
from
one
of
his
back
teeth
and
i've
got
that
detention
with
Snape
tonight
I
haven't
got
much
time
for
dinner
as
they
came
into
the
castle
they
spotted
Cormac
McLaggen
entering
the
Great
Hall
it
took
him
two
attempts
to
get
through
the
doors
he
ricocheted
off
the
frame
on
the
first
attempt
ron
merely
guffawed
gloatingly
and
strode
off
into
the
Hall
after
him
but
Harry
caught
hermione's
arm
and
held
her
back
what
said
Hermione
defensively
if
you
ask
me
said
Harry
quietly
McLaggen
looks
like
he
was
Confunded
this
morning
and
he
was
standing
right
in
front
of
where
you
were
sitting
hermione
blushed
oh
all
right
then
I
did
it
she
whispered
but
you
should
have
heard
the
way
he
was
talking
about
Ron
and
Ginny
anyway
he's
got
a
nasty
temper
you
saw
how
he
reacted
when
he
didn't
get
in
you
wouldn't
have
wanted
someone
like
that
on
the
team
no
said
Harry
no
I
suppose
that's
true
but
wasn't
that
dishonest
Hermione
i
mean
you're
a
prefect
aren't
you
oh
be
quiet
she
snapped
as
he
smirked
what
are
you
two
doing
demanded
Ron
reappearing
in
the
doorway
to
the
Great
Hall
and
looking
suspicious
nothing
said
Harry
and
Hermione
together
and
they
hurried
after
Ron
the
smell
of
roast
beef
made
harry's
stomach
ache
with
hunger
but
they
had
barely
taken
three
steps
toward
the
Gryffindor
table
when
Professor
Slughorn
appeared
in
front
of
them
blocking
their
path
harry
Harry
just
the
man
I
was
hoping
to
see
he
boomed
genially
twiddling
the
ends
of
his
walrus
mustache
and
puffing
out
his
enormous
belly
I
was
hoping
to
catch
you
before
dinner
what
do
you
say
to
a
spot
of
supper
tonight
in
my
rooms
instead
we're
having
a
little
party
just
a
few
rising
stars
i've
got
McLaggen
coming
and
Zabini
the
charming
Melinda
Bobbin
I
don't
know
whether
you
know
her
her
family
owns
a
large
chain
of
apothecaries
and
of
course
I
hope
very
much
that
Miss
Granger
will
favor
me
by
coming
too
slughorn
made
Hermione
a
little
bow
as
he
finished
speaking
it
was
as
though
Ron
was
not
present
Slughorn
did
not
so
much
as
look
at
him
i
can't
come
Professor
said
Harry
at
once
i've
got
a
detention
with
Professor
Snape
oh
dear
said
Slughorn
his
face
falling
comically
dear
dear
I
was
counting
on
you
Harry
well
now
i'll
just
have
to
have
a
word
with
Severus
and
explain
the
situation
i'm
sure
i'll
be
able
to
persuade
him
to
postpone
your
detention
yes
i'll
see
you
both
later
he
bustled
away
out
of
the
Hall
he's
got
no
chance
of
persuading
Snape
said
Harry
the
moment
Slughorn
was
out
of
earshot
this
detentions
already
been
postponed
once
Snape
did
it
for
Dumbledore
but
he
won't
do
it
for
anyone
else
oh
I
wish
you
could
come
I
don't
want
to
go
on
my
own
said
Hermione
anxiously
Harry
knew
that
she
was
thinking
about
McLaggen
i
doubt
you'll
be
alone
ginny'll
probably
be
invited
snapped
Ron
who
did
not
seem
to
have
taken
kindly
to
being
ignored
by
Slughorn
after
dinner
they
made
their
way
back
to
Gryffindor
Tower
the
common
room
was
very
crowded
as
most
people
had
finished
dinner
by
now
but
they
managed
to
find
a
free
table
and
sat
down
Ron
who
had
been
in
a
bad
mood
ever
since
the
encounter
with
Slughorn
folded
his
arms
and
frowned
at
the
ceiling
hermione
reached
out
for
a
copy
of
the
Evening
Prophet
which
somebody
had
left
abandoned
on
a
chair
anything
new
said
Harry
not
really
hermione
had
opened
the
newspaper
and
was
scanning
the
inside
pages
oh
look
your
dad's
in
here
Ron
he's
all
right
she
added
quickly
for
Ron
had
looked
around
in
alarm
it
just
says
he's
been
to
visit
the
Malfoys
house
this
second
search
of
the
Death
Eaters
residence
does
not
seem
to
have
yielded
any
results
arthur
Weasley
of
the
Office
for
the
Detection
and
Confiscation
of
Counterfeit
Defensive
Spells
and
Protective
Objects
said
that
his
team
had
been
acting
upon
a
confidential
tip-off
yeah
mine
said
Harry
i
told
him
at
Kings
Cross
about
Malfoy
and
that
thing
he
was
trying
to
get
Borgin
to
fix
well
if
it's
not
at
their
house
he
must
have
brought
whatever
it
is
to
Hogwarts
with
him
but
how
can
he
have
done
Harry
said
Hermione
putting
down
the
newspaper
with
a
surprised
look
we
were
all
searched
when
we
arrived
weren't
we
were
you
said
Harry
taken
aback
i
wasn't
oh
no
of
course
you
weren't
I
forgot
you
were
late
well
Filch
ran
over
all
of
us
with
Secrecy
Sensors
when
we
got
into
the
entrance
hall
any
Dark
object
would
have
been
found
I
know
for
a
fact
Crabbe
had
a
shrunken
head
confiscated
so
you
see
Malfoy
can't
have
brought
in
anything
dangerous
momentarily
stymied
Harry
watched
Ginny
Weasley
playing
with
Arnold
the
Pygmy
Puff
for
a
while
before
seeing
a
way
around
this
objection
someone's
sent
it
to
him
by
owl
then
he
said
his
mother
or
someone
all
the
owls
are
being
checked
too
said
Hermione
filch
told
us
so
when
he
was
jabbing
those
Secrecy
Sensors
everywhere
he
could
reach
really
stumped
this
time
Harry
found
nothing
else
to
say
there
did
not
seem
to
be
any
way
Malfoy
could
have
brought
a
dangerous
or
Dark
object
into
the
school
he
looked
hopefully
at
Ron
who
was
sitting
with
his
arms
folded
staring
over
at
Lavender
Brown
can
you
think
of
any
way
Malfoy
oh
drop
it
Harry
said
Ron
listen
it's
not
my
fault
Slughorn
invited
Hermione
and
me
to
his
stupid
party
neither
of
us
wanted
to
go
you
know
said
Harry
firing
up
well
as
i'm
not
invited
to
any
parties
said
Ron
getting
to
his
feet
again
I
think
i'll
go
to
bed
he
stomped
off
toward
the
door
to
the
boys
dormitories
leaving
Harry
and
Hermione
staring
after
him
harry
said
the
new
Chaser
Demelza
Robins
appearing
suddenly
at
his
shoulder
i've
got
a
message
for
you
from
Professor
Slughorn
asked
Harry
sitting
up
hopefully
no
from
Professor
Snape
said
Demelza
harry's
heart
sank
he
says
you're
to
come
to
his
office
at
half
past
eight
tonight
to
do
your
detention
er
no
matter
how
many
party
invitations
you've
received
and
he
wanted
you
to
know
you'll
be
sorting
out
rotten
flobberworms
from
good
ones
to
use
in
Potions
and
and
he
says
there's
no
need
to
bring
protective
gloves
right
said
Harry
grimly
thanks
a
lot
Demelza
chapter
Silver
and
opals
where
was
Dumbledore
and
what
was
he
doing
harry
caught
sight
of
the
headmaster
only
twice
over
the
next
few
weeks
he
rarely
appeared
at
meals
anymore
and
Harry
was
sure
Hermione
was
right
in
thinking
that
he
was
leaving
the
school
for
days
at
a
time
had
Dumbledore
forgotten
the
lessons
he
was
supposed
to
be
giving
Harry
dumbledore
had
said
that
the
lessons
were
leading
to
something
to
do
with
the
prophecy
Harry
had
felt
bolstered
comforted
and
now
he
felt
slightly
abandoned
halfway
through
October
came
their
first
trip
of
the
term
to
Hogsmeade
harry
had
wondered
whether
these
trips
would
still
be
allowed
given
the
increasingly
tight
security
measures
around
the
school
but
was
pleased
to
know
that
they
were
going
ahead
it
was
always
good
to
get
out
of
the
castle
grounds
for
a
few
hours
harry
woke
early
on
the
morning
of
the
trip
which
was
proving
stormy
and
whiled
away
the
time
until
breakfast
by
reading
his
copy
of
Advanced
Potion-Making
he
did
not
usually
lie
in
bed
reading
his
textbooks
that
sort
of
behavior
as
Ron
rightly
said
was
indecent
in
anybody
except
Hermione
who
was
simply
weird
that
way
harry
felt
however
that
the
Half-Blood
Princes
copy
of
Advanced
Potion-Making
hardly
qualified
as
a
textbook
the
more
Harry
pored
over
the
book
the
more
he
realized
how
much
was
in
there
not
only
the
handy
hints
and
shortcuts
on
potions
that
was
earning
him
such
a
glowing
reputation
with
Slughorn
but
also
the
imaginative
little
jinxes
and
hexes
scribbled
in
the
margins
which
Harry
was
sure
judging
by
the
crossings-out
and
revisions
that
the
Prince
had
invented
himself
harry
had
already
attempted
a
few
of
the
prince's
self-invented
spells
there
had
been
a
hex
that
caused
toenails
to
grow
alarmingly
fast
he
had
tried
this
on
Crabbe
in
the
corridor
with
very
entertaining
results
a
jinx
that
glued
the
tongue
to
the
roof
of
the
mouth
which
he
had
twice
used
to
general
applause
on
an
unsuspecting
Argus
Filch
and
perhaps
most
useful
of
all
Muffliato
a
spell
that
filled
the
ears
of
anyone
nearby
with
an
unidentifiable
buzzing
so
that
lengthy
conversations
could
be
held
in
class
with
out
being
overheard
the
only
person
who
did
not
find
these
charms
amusing
was
Hermione
who
maintained
a
rigidly
disapproving
expression
throughout
and
refused
to
talk
at
all
if
Harry
had
used
the
Muffliato
spell
on
anyone
in
the
vicinity
sitting
up
in
bed
Harry
turned
the
book
sideways
so
as
to
examine
more
closely
the
scribbled
instructions
for
a
spell
that
seemed
to
have
caused
the
Prince
some
trouble
there
were
many
crossings-out
and
alterations
but
finally
crammed
into
a
corner
of
the
page
the
scribble
levicorpus
nvbl
while
the
wind
and
sleet
pounded
relentlessly
on
the
windows
and
Neville
snored
loudly
Harry
stared
at
the
letters
in
brackets
nvbl
that
had
to
mean
nonverbal
harry
rather
doubted
he
would
be
able
to
bring
off
this
particular
spell
he
was
still
having
difficulty
with
nonverbal
spells
something
Snape
had
been
quick
to
comment
on
in
every
D
a.d.a.
class
on
the
other
hand
the
Prince
had
proved
a
much
more
effective
teacher
than
Snape
so
far
pointing
his
wand
at
nothing
in
particular
he
gave
it
an
upward
flick
and
said
Levicorpus
inside
his
head
aaaaaaaargh
there
was
a
flash
of
light
and
the
room
was
full
of
voices
Everyone
had
woken
up
as
Ron
had
let
out
a
yell
harry
sent
Advanced
Potion-Making
flying
in
panic
Ron
was
dangling
upside
down
in
midair
as
though
an
invisible
hook
had
hoisted
him
up
by
the
ankle
sorry
yelled
Harry
as
Dean
and
Seamus
roared
with
laughter
and
Neville
picked
himself
up
from
the
floor
having
fallen
out
of
Bed
hang
on
i'll
let
you
down
he
groped
for
the
potion
book
and
riffled
through
it
in
a
panic
trying
to
find
the
right
page
at
last
he
located
it
and
deciphered
the
cramped
word
underneath
the
spell
Praying
that
this
was
the
counter-jinx
Harry
thought
Liberacorpus
with
all
his
might
there
was
another
flash
of
light
and
Ron
fell
in
a
heap
onto
his
mattress
sorry
repeated
Harry
weakly
while
Dean
and
Seamus
continued
to
roar
with
laughter
tomorrow
said
Ron
in
a
muffled
voice
i'd
rather
you
set
the
alarm
clock
by
the
time
they
had
got
dressed
padding
themselves
out
with
several
of
Mrs
weasleys
hand-knitted
sweaters
and
carrying
cloaks
scarves
and
gloves
ron's
shock
had
subsided
and
he
had
decided
that
harry's
new
spell
was
highly
amusing
so
amusing
in
fact
that
he
lost
no
time
in
regaling
Hermione
with
the
story
as
they
sat
down
for
breakfast
and
then
there
was
another
flash
of
light
and
I
landed
on
the
bed
again
ron
grinned
helping
himself
to
sausages
hermione
had
not
cracked
a
smile
during
this
anecdote
and
now
turned
an
expression
of
wintry
disapproval
upon
Harry
was
this
spell
by
any
chance
another
one
from
that
potion
book
of
yours
she
asked
harry
frowned
at
her
always
jump
to
the
worst
conclusion
don't
you
was
it
well
yeah
it
was
but
so
what
so
you
just
decided
to
try
out
an
unknown
handwritten
incantation
and
see
what
would
happen
why
does
it
matter
if
it's
handwritten
said
Harry
preferring
not
to
answer
the
rest
of
the
question
because
its
probably
not
Ministry
of
Magic
approved
said
Hermione
and
also
she
added
as
Harry
and
Ron
rolled
their
eyes
because
i'm
starting
to
think
this
Prince
character
was
a
bit
dodgy
both
Harry
and
Ron
shouted
her
down
at
once
it
was
a
laugh
said
Ron
upending
a
ketchup
bottle
over
his
sausages
just
a
laugh
Hermione
that's
all
dangling
people
upside
down
by
the
ankle
said
hermi-one
who
puts
their
time
and
energy
into
making
up
spells
like
that
fred
and
George
said
Ron
shrugging
it's
their
kind
of
thing
and
er
my
dad
said
Harry
he
had
only
just
remembered
what
said
Ron
and
Hermione
together
my
dad
used
this
spell
said
Harry
i
Lupin
told
me
this
last
part
was
not
true
in
fact
Harry
had
seen
his
father
use
the
spell
on
Snape
but
he
had
never
told
Ron
and
Hermione
about
that
particular
excursion
into
the
Pensieve
now
however
a
wonderful
possibility
occurred
to
him
could
the
Half-Blood
Prince
possibly
be
maybe
your
dad
did
use
it
Harry
said
Hermione
but
he's
not
the
only
one
we've
seen
a
whole
bunch
of
people
use
it
in
case
you've
forgotten
dangling
people
in
the
air
making
them
float
along
asleep
helpless
harry
stared
at
her
with
a
sinking
feeling
he
too
remembered
the
behavior
of
the
Death
Eaters
at
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
ron
came
to
his
aid
that
was
different
he
said
robustly
they
were
abusing
it
harry
and
his
dad
were
just
having
a
laugh
you
don't
like
the
Prince
Hermione
he
added
pointing
a
sausage
at
her
sternly
because
he's
better
than
you
at
Potions
it's
got
nothing
to
do
with
that
said
Hermione
her
cheeks
reddening
i
just
think
it's
very
irresponsible
to
start
performing
spells
when
you
don't
even
know
what
they're
for
and
stop
talking
about
the
Prince
as
if
it's
his
title
I
bet
it's
just
a
stupid
nickname
and
it
doesn't
seem
as
though
he
was
a
very
nice
person
to
me
i
don't
see
where
you
get
that
from
said
Harry
heatedly
if
he'd
been
a
budding
Death
Eater
he
wouldn't
have
been
boasting
about
being
half-blood
would
he
even
as
he
said
it
Harry
remembered
that
his
father
had
been
pure-blood
but
he
pushed
the
thought
out
of
his
mind
he
would
worry
about
that
later
the
Death
Eaters
can't
all
be
pure-blood
there
aren't
enough
pure-blood
wizards
left
said
Hermione
stubbornly
i
expect
most
of
them
are
half-bloods
pretending
to
be
pure
it's
only
muggle-borns
they
hate
they'd
be
quite
happy
to
let
you
and
Ron
join
up
there
is
no
way
they'd
let
me
be
a
Death
Eater
said
Ron
indignantly
a
bit
of
sausage
flying
off
the
fork
he
was
now
brandishing
at
Hermione
and
hitting
Ernie
Macmillan
on
the
head
my
whole
family
are
blood
traitors
that's
as
bad
as
muggle-borns
to
Death
Eaters
and
they'd
love
to
have
me
said
Harry
sarcastically
we'd
be
best
pals
if
they
didn't
keep
trying
to
do
me
in
this
made
Ron
laugh
even
Hermione
gave
a
grudging
smile
and
a
distraction
arrived
in
the
shape
of
Ginny
hey
Harry
i'm
supposed
to
give
you
this
it
was
a
scroll
of
parchment
with
harry's
name
written
upon
it
in
familiar
thin
slanting
writing
thanks
Ginny
it's
dumbledore's
next
lesson
harry
told
Ron
and
Hermione
pulling
open
the
parchment
and
quickly
read-ing
its
contents
monday
evening
he
felt
suddenly
light
and
happy
want
to
join
us
in
Hogsmeade
Ginny
he
asked
i'm
going
with
Dean
might
see
you
there
she
replied
waving
at
them
as
she
left
filch
was
standing
at
the
oak
front
doors
as
usual
checking
off
the
names
of
people
who
had
permission
to
go
into
Hogsmeade
the
process
took
even
longer
than
normal
as
Filch
was
triple-checking
everybody
with
his
Secrecy
Sensor
what
does
it
matter
if
we're
smuggling
Dark
stuff
out
demanded
Ron
eyeing
the
long
thin
Secrecy
Sensor
with
apprehension
surely
you
ought
to
be
checking
what
we
bring
back
in
his
cheek
earned
him
a
few
extra
jabs
with
the
Sensor
and
he
was
still
wincing
as
they
stepped
out
into
the
wind
and
sleet
the
walk
into
Hogsmeade
was
not
enjoyable
harry
wrapped
his
scarf
over
his
lower
face
the
exposed
part
soon
felt
both
raw
and
numb
the
road
to
the
village
was
full
of
students
bent
double
against
the
bitter
wind
more
than
once
Harry
wondered
whether
they
might
not
have
had
a
better
time
in
the
warm
common
room
and
when
they
finally
reached
Hogsmeade
and
saw
that
zonko's
Joke
Shop
had
been
boarded
up
Harry
took
it
as
confirmation
that
this
trip
was
not
destined
to
be
fun
ron
pointed
with
a
thickly
gloved
hand
toward
Honeydukes
which
was
mercifully
open
and
Harry
and
Hermione
staggered
in
his
wake
into
the
crowded
shop
thank
God
shivered
Ron
as
they
were
enveloped
by
warm
toffee-scented
air
let's
stay
here
all
afternoon
harry
m'boy
said
a
booming
voice
from
behind
them
oh
no
muttered
Harry
the
three
of
them
turned
to
see
Professor
Slughorn
who
was
wearing
an
enormous
furry
hat
and
an
overcoat
with
matching
fur
collar
clutching
a
large
bag
of
crystalized
pineapple
and
occupying
at
least
a
quarter
of
the
shop
harry
that's
three
of
my
little
suppers
you've
missed
now
said
Slughorn
poking
him
genially
in
the
chest
it
won't
do
m'boy
i'm
determined
to
have
you
miss
Granger
loves
them
don't
you
yes
said
Hermione
helplessly
they're
really
so
why
don't
you
come
along
Harry
demanded
Slughorn
well
i've
had
Quidditch
practice
Professor
said
Harry
who
had
indeed
been
scheduling
practices
every
time
Slughorn
had
sent
him
a
little
violet
ribbon-adorned
invitation
this
strategy
meant
that
Ron
was
not
left
out
and
they
usually
had
a
laugh
with
Ginny
imagining
Hermione
shut
up
with
McLaggen
and
Zabini
well
I
certainly
expect
you
to
win
your
first
match
after
all
the
hard
work
said
Slughorn
but
a
little
recreation
never
hurt
any
body
now
how
about
Monday
night
you
can't
possibly
want
to
practice
in
this
weather
i
can't
Professor
i've
got
er
an
appointment
with
Professor
Dumbledore
that
evening
unlucky
again
cried
Slughorn
dramatically
ah
well
you
can't
evade
me
forever
Harry
and
with
a
regal
wave
he
waddled
out
of
the
shop
taking
as
little
notice
of
Ron
as
though
he
had
been
a
display
of
Cockroach
Clusters
i
can't
believe
you've
wriggled
out
of
another
one
said
Hermione
shaking
her
head
they're
not
that
bad
you
know
they're
even
quite
fun
sometimes
but
then
she
caught
sight
of
ron's
expression
oh
look
they've
got
deluxe
sugar
quills
those
would
last
hours
glad
that
Hermione
had
changed
the
subject
Harry
showed
much
more
interest
in
the
new
extra-large
sugar
quills
than
he
would
normally
have
done
but
Ron
continued
to
look
moody
and
merely
shrugged
when
Hermione
asked
him
where
he
wanted
to
go
next
let's
go
to
the
Three
Broomsticks
said
Harry
it'll
be
warm
they
bundled
their
scarves
back
over
their
faces
and
left
the
sweetshop
the
bitter
wind
was
like
knives
on
their
faces
after
the
sugary
warmth
of
Honeydukes
the
street
was
not
very
busy
nobody
was
lingering
to
chat
just
hurrying
toward
their
destinations
the
exceptions
were
two
men
a
little
ahead
of
them
standing
just
outside
the
Three
Broomsticks
one
was
very
tall
and
thin
squinting
through
his
rain-washed
glasses
Harry
recognized
the
barman
who
worked
in
the
other
Hogsmeade
pub
the
hog's
Head
as
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
drew
closer
the
barman
drew
his
cloak
more
tightly
around
his
neck
and
walked
away
leaving
the
shorter
man
to
fumble
with
something
in
his
arms
they
were
barely
feet
from
him
when
Harry
realized
who
the
man
was
mundungus
the
squat
bandy-legged
man
with
long
straggly
ginger
hair
jumped
and
dropped
an
ancient
suitcase
which
burst
open
releasing
what
looked
like
the
entire
contents
of
a
junk
shop
window
oh
ello
Arry
said
Mundungus
Fletcher
with
a
most
unconvincing
stab
at
airiness
well
don't
let
me
keep
ya
and
he
began
scrabbling
on
the
ground
to
retrieve
the
contents
of
his
suitcase
with
every
appearance
of
a
man
eager
to
be
gone
are
you
selling
this
stuff
asked
Harry
watching
Mundungus
grab
an
assortment
of
grubby-looking
objects
from
the
ground
oh
well
gotta
scrape
a
living
said
Mundungus
gimme
that
ron
had
stooped
down
and
picked
up
something
silver
hang
on
Ron
said
slowly
this
looks
familiar
thank
you
said
Mundungus
snatching
the
goblet
out
of
ron's
hand
and
stuffing
it
back
into
the
case
well
i'll
see
you
all
ouch
harry
had
pinned
Mundungus
against
the
wall
of
the
pub
by
the
throat
holding
him
fast
with
one
hand
he
pulled
out
his
wand
harry
squealed
Hermione
you
took
that
from
sinus's
house
said
Harry
who
was
almost
nose
to
nose
with
Mundungus
and
was
breathing
in
an
unpleasant
smell
of
old
tobacco
and
spirits
that
had
the
Black
family
crest
on
it
i
no
what
spluttered
Mundungus
who
was
slowly
turning
purple
what
did
you
do
go
back
the
night
he
died
and
strip
the
place
snarled
Harry
i
no
give
it
to
me
harry
you
mustn't
shrieked
Hermione
as
Mundungus
started
to
turn
blue
there
was
a
bang
and
Harry
felt
his
hands
fly
off
mundungus's
throat
gasping
and
spluttering
Mundungus
seized
his
fallen
case
then
crack
he
Disapparated
harry
swore
at
the
top
of
his
voice
spinning
on
the
spot
to
see
where
Mundungus
had
gone
come
back
you
thieving
there's
no
point
Harry
tonks
had
appeared
out
of
nowhere
her
mousy
hair
wet
with
sleet
mundungus
will
probably
be
in
London
by
now
there's
no
point
yelling
he's
nicked
sirius's
stuff
nicked
it
yes
but
still
said
Tonks
who
seemed
perfectly
untroubled
by
this
piece
of
information
you
should
get
out
of
the
cold
she
watched
them
go
through
the
door
of
the
Three
broom-sticks
the
moment
he
was
inside
Harry
burst
out
He
was
nicking
sirius's
stuff
i
know
Harry
but
please
don't
shout
people
are
staring
whispered
Hermione
go
and
sit
down
i'll
get
you
a
drink
harry
was
still
fuming
when
Hermione
returned
to
their
table
a
few
minutes
later
holding
three
bottles
of
butterbeer
can't
the
Order
control
Mundungus
harry
demanded
of
the
other
two
in
a
furious
whisper
can't
they
at
least
stop
him
stealing
everything
that's
not
fixed
down
when
he's
at
headquarters
shh
said
Hermione
desperately
looking
around
to
make
sure
nobody
was
listening
there
were
a
couple
of
warlocks
sitting
close
by
who
were
staring
at
Harry
with
great
interest
and
Zabini
was
lolling
against
a
pillar
not
far
away
harry
i'd
be
annoyed
too
I
know
it's
your
things
he's
stealing
harry
gagged
on
his
butterbeer
he
had
momentarily
forgotten
that
he
owned
number
twelve
Grimmauld
Place
yeah
it's
my
stuff
he
said
no
wonder
he
wasn't
pleased
to
see
me
well
i'm
going
to
tell
Dumbledore
what's
going
on
he's
the
only
one
who
scares
Mundungus
good
idea
whispered
Hermione
clearly
pleased
that
Harry
was
calming
down
ron
what
are
you
staring
at
nothing
said
Ron
hastily
looking
away
from
the
bar
but
Harry
knew
he
was
trying
to
catch
the
eye
of
the
curvy
and
attractive
bar-maid
Madam
Rosmerta
for
whom
he
had
long
nursed
a
soft
spot
i
expect
nothing's
in
the
back
getting
more
firewhisky
said
Hermione
waspishly
ron
ignored
this
jibe
sipping
his
drink
in
what
he
evidently
considered
to
be
a
dignified
silence
harry
was
thinking
about
Sirius
and
how
he
had
hated
those
silver
goblets
anyway
hermione
drummed
her
fingers
on
the
table
her
eyes
flickering
between
Ron
and
the
bar
the
moment
Harry
drained
the
last
drops
in
his
bottle
she
said
Shall
we
call
it
a
day
and
go
back
to
school
then
the
other
two
nodded
it
had
not
been
a
fun
trip
and
the
weather
was
getting
worse
the
longer
they
stayed
once
again
they
drew
their
cloaks
tightly
around
them
rearranged
their
scarves
pulled
on
their
gloves
then
followed
Katie
Bell
and
a
friend
out
of
the
pub
and
back
up
the
High
Street
harry's
thoughts
strayed
to
Ginny
as
they
trudged
up
the
road
to
Hogwarts
through
the
frozen
slush
they
had
not
met
up
with
her
undoubtedly
thought
Harry
because
she
and
Dean
were
cozily
closeted
in
Madam
puddifoot's
Tea
Shop
that
haunt
of
happy
couples
scowling
he
bowed
his
head
against
the
swirling
sleet
and
trudged
on
it
was
a
little
while
before
Harry
became
aware
that
the
voices
of
Katie
Bell
and
her
friend
which
were
being
carried
back
to
him
on
the
wind
had
become
shriller
and
louder
harry
squinted
at
their
indistinct
figures
the
two
girls
were
having
an
argument
about
something
Katie
was
holding
in
her
hand
it's
nothing
to
do
with
you
Leanne
harry
heard
Katie
say
they
rounded
a
corner
in
the
lane
sleet
coming
thick
and
fast
blurring
harry's
glasses
just
as
he
raised
a
gloved
hand
to
wipe
them
Leanne
made
to
grab
hold
of
the
package
Katie
was
holding
Katie
tugged
it
back
and
the
package
fell
to
the
ground
at
once
Katie
rose
into
the
air
not
as
Ron
had
done
suspended
comically
by
the
ankle
but
gracefully
her
arms
outstretched
as
though
she
was
about
to
fly
yet
there
was
something
wrong
something
eerie
her
hair
was
whipped
around
her
by
the
fierce
wind
but
her
eyes
were
closed
and
her
face
was
quite
empty
of
expression
harry
Ron
Hermione
and
Leanne
had
all
halted
in
their
tracks
watching
then
six
feet
above
the
ground
Katie
let
out
a
terrible
scream
her
eyes
flew
open
but
whatever
she
could
see
or
whatever
she
was
feeling
was
clearly
causing
her
terrible
anguish
she
screamed
and
screamed
Leanne
started
to
scream
too
and
seized
katie's
ankles
trying
to
tug
her
back
to
the
ground
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
rushed
forward
to
help
but
even
as
they
grabbed
katie's
legs
she
fell
on
top
of
them
Harry
and
Ron
managed
to
catch
her
but
she
was
writhing
so
much
they
could
hardly
hold
her
instead
they
lowered
her
to
the
ground
where
she
thrashed
and
screamed
apparently
unable
to
recognize
any
of
them
harry
looked
around
the
landscape
seemed
deserted
stay
there
he
shouted
at
the
others
over
the
howling
wind
i'm
going
for
help
he
began
to
sprint
toward
the
school
he
had
never
seen
anyone
behave
as
Katie
had
just
behaved
and
could
not
think
what
had
caused
it
he
hurtled
around
a
bend
in
the
lane
and
collided
with
what
seemed
to
be
an
enormous
bear
on
its
hind
legs
hagrid
he
panted
disentangling
himself
from
the
hedgerow
into
which
he
had
fallen
harry
said
Hagrid
who
had
sleet
trapped
in
his
eyebrows
and
beard
and
was
wearing
his
great
shaggy
beaverskin
coat
jus
bin
visitin
Grawp
he's
comin
on
so
well
yeh
wouldn
hagrid
someone's
hurt
back
there
or
cursed
or
something
wha
said
Hagrid
bending
lower
to
hear
what
Harry
was
saying
over
the
raging
wind
someone's
been
cursed
bellowed
Harry
cursed
who's
bin
cursed
not
Ron
hermione
no
it's
not
them
it's
Katie
Bell
this
way
together
they
ran
back
along
the
lane
it
took
them
no
time
to
find
the
little
group
of
people
around
Katie
who
was
still
writhing
and
screaming
on
the
ground
Ron
Hermione
and
Leanne
were
all
trying
to
quiet
her
get
back
shouted
Hagrid
lemme
see
her
something's
happened
to
her
sobbed
Leanne
i
don't
know
what
hagrid
stared
at
Katie
for
a
second
then
without
a
word
bent
down
scooped
her
into
his
arms
and
ran
off
toward
the
castle
with
her
within
seconds
katie's
piercing
screams
had
died
away
and
the
only
sound
was
the
roar
of
the
wind
hermione
hurried
over
to
katie's
wailing
friend
and
put
an
arm
around
her
it's
Leanne
isn't
it
the
girl
nodded
did
it
just
happen
all
of
a
sudden
or
it
was
when
that
package
tore
sobbed
Leanne
pointing
at
the
now
sodden
brown-paper
package
on
the
ground
which
had
split
open
to
reveal
a
greenish
glitter
ron
bent
down
his
hand
out-stretched
but
Harry
seized
his
arm
and
pulled
him
back
don't
touch
it
he
crouched
down
an
ornate
opal
necklace
was
visible
poking
out
of
the
paper
i've
seen
that
before
said
Harry
staring
at
the
thing
it
was
on
display
in
Borgin
and
Burkes
ages
ago
the
label
said
it
was
cursed
katie
must
have
touched
it
he
looked
up
at
Leanne
who
had
started
to
shake
uncontrollably
how
did
Katie
get
hold
of
this
well
that's
why
we
were
arguing
she
came
back
from
the
bathroom
in
the
Three
Broomsticks
holding
it
said
it
was
a
surprise
for
somebody
at
Hogwarts
and
she
had
to
deliver
it
she
looked
all
funny
when
she
said
it
oh
no
oh
no
I
bet
she'd
been
Imperiused
and
I
didn't
realize
leanne
shook
with
renewed
sobs
hermione
patted
her
shoulder
gently
she
didn't
say
who'd
given
it
to
her
Leanne
no
she
wouldn't
tell
me
and
I
said
she
was
being
stupid
and
not
to
take
it
up
to
school
but
she
just
wouldn't
listen
and
and
then
I
tried
to
grab
it
from
her
and
and
leanne
let
out
a
wail
of
despair
we'd
better
get
up
to
school
said
Hermione
her
arm
still
around
Leanne
we'll
be
able
to
find
out
how
she
is
come
on
harry
hesitated
for
a
moment
then
pulled
his
scarf
from
around
his
face
and
ignoring
ron's
gasp
carefully
covered
the
necklace
in
it
and
picked
it
up
we'll
need
to
show
this
to
Madam
Pomfrey
he
said
as
they
followed
Hermione
and
Leanne
up
the
road
Harry
was
thinking
furiously
they
had
just
entered
the
grounds
when
he
spoke
unable
to
keep
his
thoughts
to
himself
any
longer
malfoy
knows
about
this
necklace
it
was
in
a
case
at
Borgin
and
Burkes
four
years
ago
I
saw
him
having
a
good
look
at
it
while
I
was
hiding
from
him
and
his
dad
this
is
what
he
was
buying
that
day
when
we
followed
him
he
remembered
it
and
he
went
back
for
it
i
I
dunno
Harry
said
Ron
hesitantly
loads
of
people
go
to
Borgin
and
Burkes
and
didn't
that
girl
say
Katie
got
it
in
the
girls
bathroom
she
said
she
came
back
from
the
bathroom
with
it
she
didn't
necessarily
get
it
in
the
bathroom
itself
mcGonagall
said
Ron
warningly
harry
looked
up
sure
enough
Professor
McGonagall
was
hurrying
down
the
stone
steps
through
swirling
sleet
to
meet
them
hagrid
says
you
four
saw
what
happened
to
Katie
Bell
upstairs
to
my
office
at
once
please
what's
that
you're
holding
Potter
it's
the
thing
she
touched
said
Harry
good
lord
said
Professor
McGonagall
looking
alarmed
as
she
took
the
necklace
from
Harry
no
no
Filch
they're
with
me
she
added
hastily
as
Filch
came
shuffling
eagerly
across
the
entrance
hall
holding
his
Secrecy
Sensor
aloft
take
this
necklace
to
Professor
Snape
at
once
but
be
sure
not
to
touch
it
keep
it
wrapped
in
the
scarf
harry
and
the
others
followed
Professor
McGonagall
upstairs
and
into
her
office
the
sleet-spattered
windows
were
rattling
in
their
frames
and
the
room
was
chilly
despite
the
fire
crackling
in
the
grate
professor
McGonagall
closed
the
door
and
swept
around
her
desk
to
face
Harry
Ron
Hermione
and
the
still
sobbing
Leanne
well
she
said
sharply
what
happened
haltingly
and
with
many
pauses
while
she
attempted
to
control
her
crying
Leanne
told
Professor
McGonagall
how
Katie
had
gone
to
the
bathroom
in
the
Three
Broomsticks
and
returned
holding
the
unmarked
package
how
Katie
had
seemed
a
little
odd
and
how
they
had
argued
about
the
advisability
of
agreeing
to
deliver
unknown
objects
the
argument
culminating
in
the
tussle
over
the
parcel
which
tore
open
at
this
point
Leanne
was
so
overcome
there
was
no
getting
another
word
out
of
her
all
right
said
Professor
McGonagall
not
unkindly
go
up
to
the
hospital
wing
please
Leanne
and
get
Madam
Pomfrey
to
give
you
something
for
shock
when
she
had
left
the
room
Professor
McGonagall
turned
back
to
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
what
happened
when
Katie
touched
the
necklace
she
rose
up
in
the
air
said
Harry
before
either
Ron
or
Hermione
could
speak
and
then
began
to
scream
and
collapsed
professor
can
I
see
Professor
Dumbledore
please
the
headmaster
is
away
until
Monday
Potter
said
Professor
McGonagall
looking
surprised
away
harry
repeated
angrily
yes
Potter
away
said
Professor
McGonagall
tartly
but
anything
you
have
to
say
about
this
horrible
business
can
be
said
to
me
i'm
sure
for
a
split
second
Harry
hesitated
professor
McGonagall
did
not
invite
confidences
Dumbledore
though
in
many
ways
more
intimidating
still
seemed
less
likely
to
scorn
a
theory
however
wild
this
was
a
life-and-death
matter
though
and
no
moment
to
worry
about
being
laughed
at
i
think
Draco
Malfoy
gave
Katie
that
necklace
Professor
on
one
side
of
him
Ron
rubbed
his
nose
in
apparent
embarrassment
on
the
other
Hermione
shuffled
her
feet
as
though
quite
keen
to
put
a
bit
of
distance
between
herself
and
Harry
that
is
a
very
serious
accusation
Potter
said
Professor
McGonagall
after
a
shocked
pause
do
you
have
any
proof
no
said
Harry
but
and
he
told
her
about
following
Malfoy
to
Borgin
and
Burkes
and
the
conversation
they
had
over-heard
between
him
and
mr.
Borgin
when
he
had
finished
speaking
Professor
McGonagall
looked
slightly
confused
malfoy
took
something
to
Borgin
and
Burkes
for
repair
no
Professor
he
just
wanted
Borgin
to
tell
him
how
to
mend
something
he
didn't
have
it
with
him
but
that's
not
the
point
the
thing
is
that
he
bought
something
at
the
same
time
and
I
think
it
was
that
necklace
you
saw
Malfoy
leaving
the
shop
with
a
similar
package
no
Professor
he
told
Borgin
to
keep
it
in
the
shop
for
him
but
Harry
Hermione
interrupted
Borgin
asked
him
if
he
wanted
to
take
it
with
him
and
Malfoy
said
no
because
he
didn't
want
to
touch
it
obviously
said
Harry
angrily
what
he
actually
said
was
How
would
I
look
carrying
that
down
the
street
said
Hermione
well
he
would
look
a
bit
of
a
prat
carrying
a
necklace
interjected
Ron
oh
Ron
said
Hermione
despairingly
it
would
be
all
wrapped
up
so
he
wouldn't
have
to
touch
it
and
quite
easy
to
hide
inside
a
cloak
so
nobody
would
see
it
i
think
whatever
he
reserved
at
Borgin
and
Burkes
was
noisy
or
bulky
something
he
knew
would
draw
attention
to
him
if
he
carried
it
down
the
street
and
in
any
case
she
pressed
on
loudly
before
Harry
could
interrupt
I
asked
Borgin
about
the
necklace
don't
you
remember
when
I
went
in
to
try
and
find
out
what
Malfoy
had
asked
him
to
keep
I
saw
it
there
and
Borgin
just
told
me
the
price
he
didn't
say
it
was
already
sold
or
anything
well
you
were
being
really
obvious
he
realized
what
you
were
up
to
within
about
five
seconds
of
course
he
wasn't
going
to
tell
you
anyway
Malfoy
could've
sent
off
for
it
since
that's
enough
said
Professor
McGonagall
as
Hermione
opened
her
mouth
to
retort
looking
furious
potter
I
appreciate
you
telling
me
this
but
we
cannot
point
the
finger
of
blame
at
mr.
Malfoy
purely
because
he
visited
the
shop
where
this
necklace
might
have
been
purchased
the
same
is
probably
true
of
hundreds
of
people
that's
what
I
said
muttered
Ron
and
in
any
case
we
have
put
stringent
security
measures
in
place
this
year
i
do
not
believe
that
necklace
can
possibly
have
entered
this
school
without
our
knowledge
but
and
what
is
more
said
Professor
McGonagall
with
an
air
of
awful
finality
mr.
Malfoy
was
not
in
Hogsmeade
today
harry
gaped
at
her
deflating
how
do
you
know
Professor
because
he
was
doing
detention
with
me
he
has
now
failed
to
complete
his
Transfiguration
homework
twice
in
a
row
so
thank
you
for
telling
me
your
suspicions
Potter
she
said
as
she
marched
past
them
but
I
need
to
go
up
to
the
hospital
wing
now
to
check
on
Katie
Bell
good
day
to
you
all
she
held
open
her
office
door
they
had
no
choice
but
to
file
past
her
without
another
word
harry
was
angry
with
the
other
two
for
siding
with
McGonagall
nevertheless
he
felt
compelled
to
join
in
once
they
started
discussing
what
had
happened
so
who
do
you
reckon
Katie
was
supposed
to
give
the
necklace
to
asked
Ron
as
they
climbed
the
stairs
to
the
common
room
goodness
only
knows
said
Hermione
but
whoever
it
was
has
had
a
narrow
escape
no
one
could
have
opened
that
package
without
touching
the
necklace
it
could've
been
meant
for
loads
of
people
said
Harry
dumbledore
the
Death
Eaters
would
love
to
get
rid
of
him
he
must
be
one
of
their
top
targets
or
Slughorn
Dumbledore
reckons
Voldemort
really
wanted
him
and
they
can't
be
pleased
that
he's
sided
with
Dumbledore
or
or
you
said
Hermione
looking
troubled
couldn't
have
been
said
Harry
or
Katie
would've
just
turned
around
in
the
lane
and
given
it
to
me
wouldn't
she
i
was
behind
her
all
the
way
out
of
the
Three
Broomsticks
it
would
have
made
much
more
sense
to
deliver
the
parcel
outside
Hogwarts
what
with
Filch
searching
everyone
who
goes
in
and
out
i
wonder
why
Malfoy
told
her
to
take
it
into
the
castle
harry
Malfoy
wasn't
in
Hogsmeade
said
Hermione
actually
stamping
her
foot
in
frustration
he
must
have
used
an
accomplice
then
said
Harry
crabbe
or
Goyle
or
come
to
think
of
it
another
Death
Eater
he'll
have
loads
better
cronies
than
Crabbe
and
Goyle
now
he's
joined
up
ron
and
Hermione
exchanged
looks
that
plainly
said
there's
no
point
arguing
with
him
dilligrout
said
Hermione
firmly
as
they
reached
the
Fat
Lady
the
portrait
swung
open
to
admit
them
to
the
common
room
it
was
quite
full
and
smelled
of
damp
clothing
many
people
seemed
to
have
returned
from
Hogsmeade
early
because
of
the
bad
weather
there
was
no
buzz
of
fear
or
speculation
however
Clearly
the
news
of
katie's
fate
had
not
yet
spread
it
wasn't
a
very
slick
attack
really
when
you
stop
and
think
about
it
said
Ron
casually
turfing
a
first
year
out
of
one
of
the
good
armchairs
by
the
fire
so
that
he
could
sit
down
the
curse
didn't
even
make
it
into
the
castle
not
what
you'd
call
foolproof
you're
right
said
Hermione
prodding
Ron
out
of
the
chair
with
her
foot
and
offering
it
to
the
first
year
again
it
wasn't
very
well
thought-out
at
all
but
since
when
has
Malfoy
been
one
of
the
world's
great
thinkers
asked
Harry
neither
Ron
nor
Hermione
answered
him
chapter
The
Secret
Riddle
katie
was
removed
to
st.
mungo's
Hospital
for
Magical
Maladies
and
Injuries
the
following
day
by
which
time
the
news
that
she
had
been
cursed
had
spread
all
over
the
school
though
the
details
were
confused
and
nobody
other
than
Harry
Ron
Hermione
and
Leanne
seemed
to
know
that
Katie
herself
had
not
been
the
intended
target
oh
and
Malfoy
knows
of
course
said
Harry
to
Ron
and
Hermione
who
continued
their
new
policy
of
feigning
deafness
whenever
Harry
mentioned
his
Malfoy-Is-a-Death-Eater
theory
harry
had
wondered
whether
Dumbledore
would
return
from
wherever
he
had
been
in
time
for
Monday
night's
lesson
but
having
had
no
word
to
the
contrary
he
presented
himself
outside
dumbledore's
office
at
eight
o'clock
knocked
and
was
told
to
enter
there
sat
Dumbledore
looking
unusually
tired
his
hand
was
as
black
and
burned
as
ever
but
he
smiled
when
he
gestured
to
Harry
to
sit
down
the
Pensieve
was
sitting
on
the
desk
again
casting
silvery
specks
of
light
over
the
ceiling
you
have
had
a
busy
time
while
I
have
been
away
Dumbledore
said
i
believe
you
witnessed
katie's
accident
yes
sir
how
is
she
still
very
unwell
although
she
was
relatively
lucky
she
appears
to
have
brushed
the
necklace
with
the
smallest
possible
amount
of
skin
there
was
a
tiny
hole
in
her
glove
had
she
put
it
on
had
she
even
held
it
in
her
ungloved
hand
she
would
have
died
perhaps
instantly
luckily
Professor
Snape
was
able
to
do
enough
to
prevent
a
rapid
spread
of
the
curse
why
him
asked
Harry
quickly
why
not
Madam
Pomfrey
impertinent
said
a
soft
voice
from
one
of
the
portraits
on
the
wall
and
Phineas
Nigellus
Black
sirius's
great-great-grandfather
raised
his
head
from
his
arms
where
he
had
appeared
to
be
sleeping
i
would
not
have
permitted
a
student
to
question
the
way
Hogwarts
operated
in
my
day
yes
thank
you
Phineas
said
Dumbledore
quellingly
professor
Snape
knows
much
more
about
the
Dark
Arts
than
Madam
Pomfrey
Harry
anyway
the
st.
mungo's
staff
are
sending
me
hourly
reports
and
I
am
hopeful
that
Katie
will
make
a
full
recovery
in
time
where
were
you
this
weekend
sir
harry
asked
disregarding
a
strong
feeling
that
he
might
be
pushing
his
luck
a
feeling
apparently
shared
by
Phineas
Nigellus
who
hissed
softly
i
would
rather
not
say
just
now
said
Dumbledore
however
I
shall
tell
you
in
due
course
you
will
said
Harry
startled
yes
I
expect
so
said
Dumbledore
withdrawing
a
fresh
bottle
of
silver
memories
from
inside
his
robes
and
uncorking
it
with
a
prod
of
his
wand
sir
said
Harry
tentatively
I
met
Mundungus
in
Hogsmeade
ah
yes
I
am
already
aware
that
Mundungus
has
been
treating
your
inheritance
with
light-fingered
contempt
said
Dumbledore
frowning
a
little
he
has
gone
to
ground
since
you
accosted
him
outside
the
Three
Broomsticks
I
rather
think
he
dreads
facing
me
however
rest
assured
that
he
will
not
be
making
away
with
any
more
of
sirius's
old
possessions
that
mangy
old
half-blood
has
been
stealing
Black
heirlooms
said
Phineas
Nigellus
incensed
and
he
stalked
out
of
his
frame
undoubtedly
to
visit
his
portrait
in
number
twelve
Grimmauld
Place
professor
said
Harry
after
a
short
pause
did
Professor
McGonagall
tell
you
what
I
told
her
after
Katie
got
hurt
about
Draco
Malfoy
she
told
me
of
your
suspicions
yes
said
Dumbledore
and
do
you
i
shall
take
all
appropriate
measures
to
investigate
anyone
who
might
have
had
a
hand
in
katie's
accident
said
Dumbledore
but
what
concerns
me
now
Harry
is
our
lesson
harry
felt
slightly
resentful
at
this
If
their
lessons
were
so
very
important
why
had
there
been
such
a
long
gap
between
the
first
and
second
however
he
said
no
more
about
Draco
Malfoy
but
watched
as
Dumbledore
poured
the
fresh
memories
into
the
Pensieve
and
began
swirling
the
stone
basin
once
more
between
his
long-fingered
hands
you
will
remember
I
am
sure
that
we
left
the
tale
of
Lord
voldemort's
beginnings
at
the
point
where
the
handsome
Muggle
Tom
Riddle
had
abandoned
his
witch
wife
Merope
and
returned
to
his
family
home
in
Little
Hangleton
merope
was
left
alone
in
London
expecting
the
baby
who
would
one
day
become
Lord
Voldemort
how
do
you
know
she
was
in
London
sir
because
of
the
evidence
of
one
Caractacus
Burke
said
Dumbledore
who
by
an
odd
coincidence
helped
found
the
very
shop
whence
came
the
necklace
we
have
just
been
discussing
he
swilled
the
contents
of
the
Pensieve
as
Harry
had
seen
him
swill
them
before
much
as
a
gold
prospector
sifts
for
gold
up
out
of
the
swirling
silvery
mass
rose
a
little
old
man
revolving
slowly
in
the
Pensieve
silver
as
a
ghost
but
much
more
solid
with
a
thatch
of
hair
that
completely
covered
his
eyes
yes
we
acquired
it
in
curious
circumstances
it
was
brought
in
by
a
young
witch
just
before
Christmas
oh
many
years
ago
now
she
said
she
needed
the
gold
badly
well
that
much
was
obvious
covered
in
rags
and
pretty
far
along
going
to
have
a
baby
see
she
said
the
locket
had
been
slytherin's
well
we
hear
that
sort
of
story
all
the
time
Oh
this
was
merlin's
this
was
his
favorite
teapot
but
when
I
looked
at
it
it
had
his
mark
all
right
and
a
few
simple
spells
were
enough
to
tell
me
the
truth
of
course
that
made
it
near
enough
priceless
she
didn't
seem
to
have
any
idea
how
much
it
was
worth
happy
to
get
ten
Galleons
for
it
best
bargain
we
ever
made
dumbledore
gave
the
Pensieve
an
extra-vigorous
shake
and
Caractacus
Burke
descended
back
into
the
swirling
mass
of
memory
from
whence
he
had
come
he
only
gave
her
ten
Galleons
said
Harry
indignantly
caractacus
Burke
was
not
famed
for
his
generosity
said
Dumbledore
so
we
know
that
near
the
end
of
her
pregnancy
Merope
was
alone
in
London
and
in
desperate
need
of
gold
desperate
enough
to
sell
her
one
and
only
valuable
possession
the
locket
that
was
one
of
marvolo's
treasured
family
heirlooms
but
she
could
do
magic
said
Harry
impatiently
she
could
have
got
food
and
everything
for
herself
by
magic
couldn't
she
ah
said
Dumbledore
perhaps
she
could
but
it
is
my
beliefi
am
guessing
again
but
I
am
sure
I
am
right
that
when
her
husband
abandoned
her
Merope
stopped
using
magic
i
do
not
think
that
she
wanted
to
be
a
witch
any
longer
of
course
it
is
also
possible
that
her
unrequited
love
and
the
attendant
despair
sapped
her
of
her
powers
that
can
happen
in
any
case
as
you
are
about
to
see
Merope
refused
to
raise
her
wand
even
to
save
her
own
life
she
wouldn't
even
stay
alive
for
her
son
dumbledore
raised
his
eyebrows
could
you
possibly
be
feeling
sorry
for
Lord
Voldemort
no
said
Harry
quickly
but
she
had
a
choice
didn't
she
not
like
my
mother
your
mother
had
a
choice
too
said
Dumbledore
gently
yes
Merope
Riddle
chose
death
in
spite
of
a
son
who
needed
her
but
do
not
judge
her
too
harshly
Harry
she
was
greatly
weakened
by
long
suffering
and
she
never
had
your
mother's
courage
and
now
if
you
will
stand
where
are
we
going
harry
asked
as
Dumbledore
joined
him
at
the
front
of
the
desk
this
time
said
Dumbledore
we
are
going
to
enter
my
memory
i
think
you
will
find
it
both
rich
in
detail
and
satisfyingly
accurate
after
you
Harry
harry
bent
over
the
Pensieve
his
face
broke
the
cool
surface
of
the
memory
and
then
he
was
falling
through
darkness
again
seconds
later
his
feet
hit
firm
ground
he
opened
his
eyes
and
found
that
he
and
Dumbledore
were
standing
in
a
bustling
old-fashioned
London
street
there
I
am
said
Dumbledore
brightly
pointing
ahead
of
them
to
a
tall
figure
crossing
the
road
in
front
of
a
horse-drawn
milk
cart
this
younger
Albus
dumbledore's
long
hair
and
beard
were
auburn
having
reached
their
side
of
the
street
he
strode
off
along
the
pavement
drawing
many
curious
glances
due
to
the
flamboyantly
cut
suit
of
plum
velvet
that
he
was
wearing
nice
suit
sir
said
Harry
before
he
could
stop
himself
but
Dumbledore
merely
chuckled
as
they
followed
his
younger
self
a
short
distance
finally
passing
through
a
set
of
iron
gates
into
a
bare
courtyard
that
fronted
a
rather
grim
square
building
surrounded
by
high
railings
he
mounted
the
few
steps
leading
to
the
front
door
and
knocked
once
after
a
moment
or
two
the
door
was
opened
by
a
scruffy
girl
wearing
an
apron
good
afternoon
i
have
an
appointment
with
a
Mrs
cole
who
I
believe
is
the
matron
here
oh
said
the
bewildered-looking
girl
taking
in
dumbledore's
eccentric
appearance
um
just
a
mo
mrs
cole
she
bellowed
over
her
shoulder
harry
heard
a
distant
voice
shouting
something
in
response
the
girl
turned
back
to
Dumbledore
come
in
she's
on
er
way
dumbledore
stepped
into
a
hallway
tiled
in
black
and
white
the
whole
place
was
shabby
but
spotlessly
clean
harry
and
the
older
Dumbledore
followed
before
the
front
door
had
closed
behind
them
a
skinny
harassed-looking
woman
came
scurrying
toward
them
she
had
a
sharp-featured
face
that
appeared
more
anxious
than
unkind
and
she
was
talking
over
her
shoulder
to
another
aproned
helper
as
she
walked
toward
Dumbledore
and
take
the
iodine
upstairs
to
Martha
Billy
Stubbs
has
been
picking
his
scabs
and
Eric
whalley's
oozing
all
over
his
sheets
chicken
pox
on
top
of
everything
else
she
said
to
nobody
in
particular
and
then
her
eyes
fell
upon
Dumbledore
and
she
stopped
dead
in
her
tracks
looking
as
astonished
as
if
a
giraffe
had
just
crossed
her
threshold
good
afternoon
said
Dumbledore
holding
out
his
hand
mrs
cole
simply
gaped
my
name
is
Albus
Dumbledore
i
sent
you
a
letter
requesting
an
appointment
and
you
very
kindly
invited
me
here
today
mrs
cole
blinked
apparently
deciding
that
Dumbledore
was
not
a
hallucination
she
said
feebly
Oh
yes
well
well
then
you'd
better
come
into
my
room
yes
she
led
Dumbledore
into
a
small
room
that
seemed
part
sitting
room
part
office
it
was
as
shabby
as
the
hallway
and
the
furniture
was
old
and
mismatched
she
invited
Dumbledore
to
sit
on
a
rickety
chair
and
seated
herself
behind
a
cluttered
desk
eyeing
him
nervously
i
am
here
as
I
told
you
in
my
letter
to
discuss
Tom
Riddle
and
arrangements
for
his
future
said
Dumbledore
are
you
family
asked
Mrs
cole
no
I
am
a
teacher
said
Dumbledore
i
have
come
to
offer
Tom
a
place
at
my
school
what
school's
this
then
it
is
called
Hogwarts
said
Dumbledore
and
how
come
you're
interested
in
Tom
we
believe
he
has
qualities
we
are
looking
for
you
mean
he's
won
a
scholarship
how
can
he
have
done
he's
never
been
entered
for
one
well
his
name
has
been
down
for
our
school
since
birth
who
registered
him
his
parents
there
was
no
doubt
that
Mrs
cole
was
an
inconveniently
sharp
woman
apparently
Dumbledore
thought
so
too
for
Harry
now
saw
him
slip
his
wand
out
of
the
pocket
of
his
velvet
suit
at
the
same
time
picking
up
a
piece
of
perfectly
blank
paper
from
Mrs
cole's
desktop
here
said
Dumbledore
waving
his
wand
once
as
he
passed
her
the
piece
of
paper
I
think
this
will
make
everything
clear
mrs
cole's
eyes
slid
out
of
focus
and
back
again
as
she
gazed
intently
at
the
blank
paper
for
a
moment
that
seems
perfectly
in
order
she
said
placidly
handing
it
back
then
her
eyes
fell
upon
a
bottle
of
gin
and
two
glasses
that
had
certainly
not
been
present
a
few
seconds
before
er
may
I
offer
you
a
glass
of
gin
she
said
in
an
extra-refined
voice
thank
you
very
much
said
Dumbledore
beaming
it
soon
became
clear
that
Mrs
cole
was
no
novice
when
it
came
to
gin
drinking
pouring
both
of
them
a
generous
measure
she
drained
her
own
glass
in
one
gulp
smacking
her
lips
frankly
she
smiled
at
Dumbledore
for
the
first
time
and
he
didn't
hesitate
to
press
his
advantage
i
was
wondering
whether
you
could
tell
me
anything
of
Tom
riddle's
history
i
think
he
was
born
here
in
the
orphanage
that's
right
said
Mrs
cole
helping
herself
to
more
gin
i
remember
it
clear
as
anything
because
i'd
just
started
here
myself
new
year's
Eve
and
bitter
cold
snowing
you
know
nasty
night
and
this
girl
not
much
older
than
I
was
myself
at
the
time
came
staggering
up
the
front
steps
well
she
wasn't
the
first
we
took
her
in
and
she
had
the
baby
within
the
hour
and
she
was
dead
in
another
hour
mrs
cole
nodded
impressively
and
took
another
generous
gulp
of
gin
did
she
say
anything
before
she
died
asked
Dumbledore
anything
about
the
boy's
father
for
instance
now
as
it
happens
she
did
said
Mrs
cole
who
seemed
to
be
rather
enjoying
herself
now
with
the
gin
in
her
hand
and
an
eager
audience
for
her
story
i
remember
she
said
to
me
I
hope
he
looks
like
his
papa
and
I
won't
lie
she
was
right
to
hope
it
because
she
was
no
beauty
and
then
she
told
me
he
was
to
be
named
Tom
for
his
father
and
Marvolo
for
her
father
yes
I
know
funny
name
isn't
it
we
wondered
whether
she
came
from
a
circus
and
she
said
the
boy's
surname
was
to
be
Riddle
and
she
died
soon
after
that
without
another
word
well
we
named
him
just
as
she'd
said
it
seemed
so
important
to
the
poor
girl
but
no
Tom
nor
Marvolo
nor
any
kind
of
Riddle
ever
came
looking
for
him
nor
any
family
at
all
so
he
stayed
in
the
orphanage
and
he's
been
here
ever
since
mrs
cole
helped
herself
almost
absentmindedly
to
another
healthy
measure
of
gin
two
pink
spots
had
appeared
high
on
her
cheekbones
then
she
said
he's
a
funny
boy
yes
said
Dumbledore
i
thought
he
might
be
he
was
a
funny
baby
too
he
hardly
ever
cried
you
know
and
then
when
he
got
a
little
older
he
was
odd
odd
in
what
way
asked
Dumbledore
gently
well
he
but
Mrs
cole
pulled
up
short
and
there
was
nothing
blurry
or
vague
about
the
inquisitorial
glance
she
shot
Dumbledore
over
her
gin
glass
he's
definitely
got
a
place
at
your
school
you
say
definitely
said
Dumbledore
and
nothing
I
say
can
change
that
nothing
said
Dumbledore
you'll
be
taking
him
away
whatever
whatever
repeated
Dumbledore
gravely
she
squinted
at
him
as
though
deciding
whether
or
not
to
trust
him
apparently
she
decided
she
could
because
she
said
in
a
sudden
rush
He
scares
the
other
children
you
mean
he
is
a
bully
asked
Dumbledore
i
think
he
must
be
said
Mrs
cole
frowning
slightly
but
it's
very
hard
to
catch
him
at
it
there
have
been
incidents
nasty
things
dumbledore
did
not
press
her
though
Harry
could
tell
that
he
was
interested
she
took
yet
another
gulp
of
gin
and
her
rosy
cheeks
grew
rosier
still
billy
stubbs's
rabbit
well
Tom
said
he
didn't
do
it
and
I
don't
see
how
he
could
have
done
but
even
so
it
didn't
hang
itself
from
the
rafters
did
it
i
shouldn't
think
so
no
said
Dumbledore
quietly
but
i'm
jiggered
if
I
know
how
he
got
up
there
to
do
it
all
I
know
is
he
and
Billy
had
argued
the
day
before
and
then
Mrs
cole
took
another
swig
of
gin
slopping
a
little
over
her
chin
this
time
on
the
summer
outing
we
take
them
out
you
know
once
a
year
to
the
countryside
or
to
the
seaside
well
Amy
Benson
and
Dennis
Bishop
were
never
quite
right
afterwards
and
all
we
ever
got
out
of
them
was
that
they'd
gone
into
a
cave
with
Tom
Riddle
he
swore
they'd
just
gone
exploring
but
something
happened
in
there
i'm
sure
of
it
and
well
there
have
been
a
lot
of
things
funny
things
she
looked
around
at
Dumbledore
again
and
though
her
cheeks
were
flushed
her
gaze
was
steady
i
don't
think
many
people
will
be
sorry
to
see
the
back
of
him
you
understand
i'm
sure
that
we
will
not
be
keeping
him
permanently
said
Dumbledore
he
will
have
to
return
here
at
the
very
least
every
summer
oh
well
that's
better
than
a
whack
on
the
nose
with
a
rusty
poker
said
Mrs
cole
with
a
slight
hiccup
she
got
to
her
feet
and
Harry
was
impressed
to
see
that
she
was
quite
steady
even
though
two-thirds
of
the
gin
was
now
gone
i
suppose
you'd
like
to
see
him
very
much
said
Dumbledore
rising
too
she
led
him
out
of
her
office
and
up
the
stone
stairs
calling
out
instructions
and
admonitions
to
helpers
and
children
as
she
passed
the
orphans
Harry
saw
were
all
wearing
the
same
kind
of
grayish
tunic
they
looked
reasonably
well-cared
for
but
there
was
no
denying
that
this
was
a
grim
place
in
which
to
grow
up
here
we
are
said
Mrs
cole
as
they
turned
off
the
second
landing
and
stopped
outside
the
first
door
in
a
long
corridor
she
knocked
twice
and
entered
tom
you've
got
a
visitor
this
is
mr.
Dumberton
sorry
Dunderbore
he's
come
to
tell
you
well
i'll
let
him
do
it
harry
and
the
two
Dumbledores
entered
the
room
and
Mrs
cole
closed
the
door
on
them
it
was
a
small
bare
room
with
nothing
in
it
except
an
old
wardrobe
and
an
iron
bedstead
a
boy
was
sitting
on
top
of
the
gray
blankets
his
legs
stretched
out
in
front
of
him
holding
a
book
there
was
no
trace
of
the
Gaunts
in
Tom
riddle's
face
merope
had
got
her
dying
wish
He
was
his
handsome
father
in
miniature
tall
for
eleven
years
old
dark-haired
and
pale
his
eyes
narrowed
slightly
as
he
took
in
dumbledore's
eccentric
appearance
there
was
a
moment's
silence
how
do
you
do
Tom
said
Dumbledore
walking
forward
and
holding
out
his
hand
the
boy
hesitated
then
took
it
and
they
shook
hands
dumbledore
drew
up
the
hard
wooden
chair
beside
Riddle
so
that
the
pair
of
them
looked
rather
like
a
hospital
patient
and
visitor
i
am
Professor
Dumbledore
professor
repeated
Riddle
he
looked
wary
is
that
like
doctor
what
are
you
here
for
did
she
get
you
in
to
have
a
look
at
me
he
was
pointing
at
the
door
through
which
Mrs
cole
had
just
left
no
no
said
Dumbledore
smiling
i
don't
believe
you
said
Riddle
she
wants
me
looked
at
doesn't
she
tell
the
truth
he
spoke
the
last
three
words
with
a
ringing
force
that
was
almost
shocking
it
was
a
command
and
it
sounded
as
though
he
had
given
it
many
times
before
his
eyes
had
widened
and
he
was
glaring
at
Dumbledore
who
made
no
response
except
to
continue
smiling
pleasantly
after
a
few
seconds
Riddle
stopped
glaring
though
he
looked
if
anything
warier
still
who
are
you
i
have
told
you
my
name
is
Professor
Dumbledore
and
I
work
at
a
school
called
Hogwarts
i
have
come
to
offer
you
a
place
at
my
school
your
new
school
if
you
would
like
to
come
riddle's
reaction
to
this
was
most
surprising
he
leapt
from
the
bed
and
backed
away
from
Dumbledore
looking
furious
you
can't
kid
me
the
asylum
that's
where
you're
from
isn't
it
professor
yes
of
course
well
i'm
not
going
see
that
old
cat's
the
one
who
should
be
in
the
asylum
i
never
did
anything
to
little
Amy
Benson
or
Dennis
Bishop
and
you
can
ask
them
they'll
tell
you
i
am
not
from
the
asylum
said
Dumbledore
patiently
i
am
a
teacher
and
if
you
will
sit
down
calmly
I
shall
tell
you
about
Hogwarts
of
course
if
you
would
rather
not
come
to
the
school
nobody
will
force
you
i'd
like
to
see
them
try
sneered
Riddle
hogwarts
Dumbledore
went
on
as
though
he
had
not
heard
riddle's
last
words
is
a
school
for
people
with
special
abilities
i'm
not
mad
i
know
that
you
are
not
mad
hogwarts
is
not
a
school
for
mad
people
it
is
a
school
of
magic
there
was
silence
riddle
had
frozen
his
face
expressionless
but
his
eyes
were
flickering
back
and
forth
between
each
of
dumbledore's
as
though
trying
to
catch
one
of
them
lying
magic
he
repeated
in
a
whisper
that's
right
said
Dumbledore
it's
it's
magic
what
I
can
do
what
is
it
that
you
can
do
all
sorts
breathed
Riddle
a
flush
of
excitement
was
rising
up
his
neck
into
his
hollow
cheeks
he
looked
fevered
i
can
make
filings
move
without
touching
them
i
can
make
animals
do
what
I
want
them
to
do
without
training
them
i
can
make
bad
things
happen
to
people
who
annoy
me
i
can
make
them
hurt
if
I
want
to
his
legs
were
trembling
he
stumbled
forward
and
sat
down
on
the
bed
again
staring
at
his
hands
his
head
bowed
as
though
in
prayer
i
knew
I
was
different
he
whispered
to
his
own
quivering
fingers
i
knew
I
was
special
always
I
knew
there
was
something
well
you
were
quite
right
said
Dumbledore
who
was
no
longer
smiling
but
watching
Riddle
intently
you
are
a
wizard
riddle
lifted
his
head
his
face
was
transfigured
There
was
a
wild
happiness
upon
it
yet
for
some
reason
it
did
not
make
him
better
looking
on
the
contrary
his
finely
carved
features
seemed
somehow
rougher
his
expression
almost
bestial
are
you
a
wizard
too
yes
I
am
prove
it
said
Riddle
at
once
in
the
same
commanding
tone
he
had
used
when
he
had
said
Tell
the
truth
dumbledore
raised
his
eyebrows
if
as
I
take
it
you
are
accepting
your
place
at
Hogwarts
of
course
I
am
then
you
will
address
me
as
Professor
or
sir
riddle's
expression
hardened
for
the
most
fleeting
moment
before
he
said
in
an
unrecognizably
polite
voice
i'm
sorry
sir
i
meant
please
Professor
could
you
show
me
harry
was
sure
that
Dumbledore
was
going
to
refuse
that
he
would
tell
Riddle
there
would
be
plenty
of
time
for
practical
demonstrations
at
Hogwarts
that
they
were
currently
in
a
building
full
of
Muggles
and
must
therefore
be
cautious
to
his
great
surprise
however
Dumbledore
drew
his
wand
from
an
inside
pocket
of
his
suit
jacket
pointed
it
at
the
shabby
wardrobe
in
the
corner
and
gave
the
wand
a
casual
flick
the
wardrobe
burst
into
flames
riddle
jumped
to
his
feet
Harry
could
hardly
blame
him
for
howling
in
shock
and
rage
all
his
worldly
possessions
must
be
in
there
but
even
as
Riddle
rounded
on
Dumbledore
the
flames
vanished
leaving
the
wardrobe
completely
undamaged
riddle
stared
from
the
wardrobe
to
Dumbledore
then
his
expression
greedy
he
pointed
at
the
wand
where
can
I
get
one
of
them
all
in
good
time
said
Dumbledore
i
think
there
is
something
trying
to
get
out
of
your
wardrobe
and
sure
enough
a
faint
rattling
could
be
heard
from
inside
it
for
the
first
time
Riddle
looked
frightened
open
the
door
said
Dumbledore
riddle
hesitated
then
crossed
the
room
and
threw
open
the
wardrobe
door
on
the
topmost
shelf
above
a
rail
of
threadbare
clothes
a
small
cardboard
box
was
shaking
and
rattling
as
though
there
were
several
frantic
mice
trapped
inside
it
take
it
out
said
Dumbledore
riddle
took
down
the
quaking
box
he
looked
unnerved
is
there
anything
in
that
box
that
you
ought
not
to
have
asked
Dumbledore
riddle
threw
Dumbledore
a
long
clear
calculating
look
yes
I
suppose
so
sir
he
said
finally
in
an
expressionless
voice
open
it
said
Dumbledore
riddle
took
off
the
lid
and
tipped
the
contents
onto
his
bed
without
looking
at
them
harry
who
had
expected
something
much
more
exciting
saw
a
mess
of
small
everyday
objects
a
yo-yo
a
silver
thimble
and
a
tarnished
mouth
organ
among
them
once
free
of
the
box
they
stopped
quivering
and
lay
quite
still
upon
the
thin
blankets
you
will
return
them
to
their
owners
with
your
apologies
said
Dumbledore
calmly
putting
his
wand
back
into
his
jacket
i
shall
know
whether
it
has
been
done
and
be
warned
Thieving
is
not
tolerated
at
Hogwarts
riddle
did
not
look
remotely
abashed
he
was
still
staring
coldly
and
appraisingly
at
Dumbledore
at
last
he
said
in
a
colorless
voice
Yes
sir
at
Hogwarts
Dumbledore
went
on
we
teach
you
not
only
to
use
magic
but
to
control
it
you
have
inadvertently
I
am
sure
been
using
your
powers
in
a
way
that
is
neither
taught
nor
tolerated
at
our
school
you
are
not
the
first
nor
will
you
be
the
last
to
allow
your
magic
to
run
away
with
you
but
you
should
know
that
Hogwarts
can
expel
students
and
the
Ministry
of
Magic
yes
there
is
a
Ministry
will
punish
lawbreakers
still
more
severely
all
new
wizards
must
accept
that
in
entering
our
world
they
abide
by
our
laws
yes
sir
said
Riddle
again
it
was
impossible
to
tell
what
he
was
thinking
his
face
remained
quite
blank
as
he
put
the
little
cache
of
stolen
objects
back
into
the
cardboard
box
when
he
had
finished
he
turned
to
Dumbledore
and
said
baldly
I
haven't
got
any
money
that
is
easily
remedied
said
Dumbledore
drawing
a
leather
money-pouch
from
his
pocket
there
is
a
fund
at
Hogwarts
for
those
who
require
assistance
to
buy
books
and
robes
you
might
have
to
buy
some
of
your
spellbooks
and
so
on
secondhand
but
where
do
you
buy
spellbooks
interrupted
Riddle
who
had
taken
the
heavy
money
bag
without
thanking
Dumbledore
and
was
now
examining
a
fat
gold
Galleon
in
Diagon
Alley
said
Dumbledore
i
have
your
list
of
books
and
school
equipment
with
me
i
can
help
you
find
everything
you're
coming
with
me
asked
Riddle
looking
up
certainly
if
you
i
don't
need
you
said
Riddle
i'm
used
to
doing
things
for
myself
I
go
round
London
on
my
own
all
the
time
how
do
you
get
to
this
Diagon
Alley
sir
he
added
catching
dumbledore's
eye
harry
thought
that
Dumbledore
would
insist
upon
accompanying
Riddle
but
once
again
he
was
surprised
dumbledore
handed
Riddle
the
envelope
containing
his
list
of
equipment
and
after
telling
Riddle
exactly
how
to
get
to
the
Leaky
Cauldron
from
the
orphanage
he
said
You
will
be
able
to
see
it
although
Muggles
around
you
non-magical
people
that
is
will
not
ask
for
Tom
the
barman
easy
enough
to
remember
as
he
shares
your
name
riddle
gave
an
irritable
twitch
as
though
trying
to
displace
an
irksome
fly
you
dislike
the
name
Tom
there
are
a
lot
of
Toms
muttered
Riddle
then
as
though
he
could
not
suppress
the
question
as
though
it
burst
from
him
in
spite
of
himself
he
asked
Was
my
father
a
wizard
he
was
called
Tom
Riddle
too
they've
told
me
i'm
afraid
I
don't
know
said
Dumbledore
his
voice
gentle
my
mother
can't
have
been
magic
or
she
wouldn't
have
died
said
Riddle
more
to
himself
than
Dumbledore
it
must've
been
him
so
when
i've
got
all
my
stuff
when
do
I
come
to
this
Hogwarts
all
the
details
are
on
the
second
piece
of
parchment
in
your
envelope
said
Dumbledore
you
will
leave
from
king's
Cross
Station
on
the
first
of
September
there
is
a
train
ticket
in
there
too
riddle
nodded
dumbledore
got
to
his
feet
and
held
out
his
hand
again
taking
it
Riddle
said
I
can
speak
to
snakes
i
found
out
when
we've
been
to
the
country
on
trips
they
find
me
they
whisper
to
me
is
that
normal
for
a
wizard
harry
could
tell
that
he
had
withheld
mention
of
this
strangest
power
until
that
moment
determined
to
impress
it
is
unusual
said
Dumbledore
after
a
moment's
hesitation
but
not
unheard
of
his
tone
was
casual
but
his
eyes
moved
curiously
over
riddle's
face
they
stood
for
a
moment
man
and
boy
staring
at
each
other
then
the
handshake
was
broken
Dumbledore
was
at
the
door
good-bye
Tom
i
shall
see
you
at
Hogwarts
i
think
that
will
do
said
the
white-haired
Dumbledore
at
harry's
side
and
seconds
later
they
were
soaring
weightlessly
through
darkness
once
more
before
landing
squarely
in
the
present-day
office
sit
down
said
Dumbledore
landing
beside
Harry
harry
obeyed
his
mind
still
full
of
what
he
had
just
seen
he
believed
it
much
quicker
than
I
did
I
mean
when
you
told
him
he
was
a
wizard
said
Harry
i
didn't
believe
Hagrid
at
first
when
he
told
me
yes
Riddle
was
perfectly
ready
to
believe
that
he
was
to
use
his
word
special
said
Dumbledore
did
you
know
then
asked
Harry
did
I
know
that
I
had
just
met
the
most
dangerous
Dark
wizard
of
all
time
said
Dumbledore
no
I
had
no
idea
that
he
was
to
grow
up
to
be
what
he
is
however
I
was
certainly
intrigued
by
him
i
returned
to
Hogwarts
intending
to
keep
an
eye
upon
him
something
I
should
have
done
in
any
case
given
that
he
was
alone
and
friendless
but
which
already
I
felt
I
ought
to
do
for
others
sake
as
much
as
his
his
powers
as
you
heard
were
surprisingly
well-developed
for
such
a
young
wizard
and
most
interestingly
and
ominously
of
all
he
had
already
discovered
that
he
had
some
measure
of
control
over
them
and
begun
to
use
them
consciously
and
as
you
saw
they
were
not
the
random
experiments
typical
of
young
wizards
He
was
already
using
magic
against
other
people
to
frighten
to
punish
to
control
the
little
stories
of
the
strangled
rabbit
and
the
young
boy
and
girl
he
lured
into
a
cave
were
most
suggestive
i
can
make
them
hurt
if
I
want
to
and
he
was
a
Parselmouth
interjected
Harry
yes
indeed
a
rare
ability
and
one
supposedly
connected
with
the
Dark
Arts
although
as
we
know
there
are
Parselmouths
among
the
great
and
the
good
too
in
fact
his
ability
to
speak
to
serpents
did
not
make
me
nearly
as
uneasy
as
his
obvious
instincts
for
cruelty
secrecy
and
domination
time
is
making
fools
of
us
again
said
Dumbledore
indicating
the
dark
sky
beyond
the
windows
but
before
we
part
I
want
to
draw
your
attention
to
certain
features
of
the
scene
we
have
just
witnessed
for
they
have
a
great
bearing
on
the
matters
we
shall
be
discussing
in
future
meetings
firstly
I
hope
you
noticed
riddle's
reaction
when
I
mentioned
that
another
shared
his
first
name
Tom
harry
nodded
there
he
showed
his
contempt
for
anything
that
tied
him
to
other
people
anything
that
made
him
ordinary
even
then
he
wished
to
be
different
separate
notorious
he
shed
his
name
as
you
know
within
a
few
short
years
of
that
conversation
and
created
the
mask
of
Lord
Voldemort
behind
which
he
has
been
hidden
for
so
long
i
trust
that
you
also
noticed
that
Tom
Riddle
was
already
highly
self-sufficient
secretive
and
apparently
friendless
he
did
not
want
help
or
companionship
on
his
trip
to
Diagon
Alley
he
preferred
to
operate
alone
the
adult
Voldemort
is
the
same
you
will
hear
many
of
his
Death
Eaters
claiming
that
they
are
in
his
confidence
that
they
alone
are
close
to
him
even
understand
him
they
are
deluded
lord
Voldemort
has
never
had
a
friend
nor
do
I
believe
that
he
has
ever
wanted
one
and
lastly
I
hope
you
are
not
too
sleepy
to
pay
attention
to
this
Harry
the
young
Tom
Riddle
liked
to
collect
trophies
you
saw
the
box
of
stolen
articles
he
had
hidden
in
his
room
these
were
taken
from
victims
of
his
bullying
behavior
souvenirs
if
you
will
of
particularly
unpleasant
bits
of
magic
bear
in
mind
this
magpie-like
tendency
for
this
particularly
will
be
important
later
and
now
it
really
is
time
for
bed
harry
got
to
his
feet
as
he
walked
across
the
room
his
eyes
fell
I
upon
the
little
table
on
which
Marvolo
gaunt's
ring
had
rested
last
I
time
but
the
ring
was
no
longer
there
yes
Harry
said
Dumbledore
for
Harry
had
come
to
a
halt
the
ring's
gone
said
Harry
looking
around
but
I
thought
I
you
might
have
the
mouth
organ
or
something
dumbledore
beamed
at
him
peering
over
the
top
of
his
halfw
moon
spectacles
very
astute
Harry
but
the
mouth
organ
was
only
ever
a
mouth
organ
and
on
that
enigmatic
note
he
waved
to
Harry
who
understood
himself
to
be
dismissed
chapter
Felix
Felicis
harry
had
Herbology
first
thing
the
following
morning
he
had
been
unable
to
tell
Ron
and
Hermione
about
his
lesson
with
Dumbledore
over
breakfast
for
fear
of
being
over-heard
but
he
filled
them
in
as
they
walked
across
the
vegetable
patch
toward
the
greenhouses
the
weekends
brutal
wind
had
died
out
at
last
the
weird
mist
had
returned
and
it
took
them
a
little
longer
than
usual
to
find
the
correct
greenhouse
wow
scary
thought
the
boy
You-Know-Who
said
Ron
qui-etly
as
they
took
their
places
around
one
of
the
gnarled
Snargaluff
stumps
that
formed
this
terms
project
and
began
pulling
on
their
protective
gloves
but
I
still
don't
get
why
dumbledore's
showing
you
all
this
i
mean
it's
really
interesting
and
everything
but
what's
the
point
dunno
said
Harry
inserting
a
gum
shield
but
he
says
its
all
important
and
it'll
help
me
survive
i
think
it's
fascinating
said
Hermione
earnestly
it
makes
absolute
sense
to
know
as
much
about
Voldemort
as
possible
how
else
will
you
find
out
his
weaknesses
so
how
was
slughorn's
latest
party
harry
asked
her
thickly
through
the
gum
shield
oh
it
was
quite
fun
really
said
Hermione
now
putting
on
protective
goggles
i
mean
he
drones
on
about
famous
exploits
a
bit
and
he
absolutely
fawns
on
McLaggen
because
he's
so
well
connected
but
he
gave
us
some
really
nice
food
and
he
introduced
us
to
Gwenog
Jones
gwenog
Jones
said
Ron
his
eyes
widening
under
his
own
goggles
the
Gwenog
Jones
captain
of
the
Holyhead
Harpies
that's
right
said
Hermione
personally
I
thought
she
was
a
bit
full
of
herself
but
quite
enough
chat
over
here
said
Professor
Sprout
briskly
bustling
over
and
looking
stern
you're
lagging
behind
everybody
else
has
started
and
neville's
already
got
his
first
pod
they
looked
around
sure
enough
there
sat
Neville
with
a
bloody
lip
and
several
nasty
scratches
along
the
side
of
his
face
but
clutching
an
unpleasantly
pulsating
green
object
about
the
size
of
a
grapefruit
okay
Professor
we're
starting
now
said
Ron
adding
quietly
when
she
had
turned
away
again
should
ve
used
Muffliato
Harry
no
we
shouldn't
said
Hermione
at
once
looking
as
she
always
did
intensely
cross
at
the
thought
of
the
Half-Blood
Prince
and
his
spells
well
come
on
we'd
better
get
going
she
gave
the
other
two
an
apprehensive
look
they
all
took
deep
breaths
and
then
dived
at
the
gnarled
stump
between
them
it
sprang
to
life
at
once
long
prickly
bramblelike
vines
flew
out
of
the
top
and
whipped
through
the
air
one
tangled
itself
in
hermione's
hair
and
Ron
beat
it
back
with
a
pair
of
secateurs
Harry
succeeded
in
trapping
a
couple
of
vines
and
knotting
them
together
a
hole
opened
in
the
middle
of
all
the
tentaclelike
branches
Hermione
plunged
her
arm
bravely
into
this
hole
which
closed
like
a
trap
around
her
elbow
Harry
and
Ron
tugged
and
wrenched
at
the
vines
forcing
the
hole
to
open
again
and
hermi-one
snatched
her
arm
free
clutching
in
her
fingers
a
pod
just
like
neville's
at
once
the
prickly
vines
shot
back
inside
and
the
gnarled
stump
sat
there
looking
like
an
innocently
dead
lump
of
wood
you
know
I
don't
think
i'll
be
having
any
of
these
in
my
garden
when
i've
got
my
own
place
said
Ron
pushing
his
goggles
up
onto
his
forehead
and
wiping
sweat
from
his
face
pass
me
a
bowl
said
Hermione
holding
the
pulsating
pod
at
arm's
length
Harry
handed
one
over
and
she
dropped
the
pod
into
it
with
a
look
of
disgust
on
her
face
don't
be
squeamish
squeeze
it
out
they're
best
when
they're
fresh
called
Professor
Sprout
anyway
said
Hermione
continuing
their
interrupted
conver-sation
as
though
a
lump
of
wood
had
not
just
attacked
them
slughorn's
going
to
have
a
Christmas
party
Harry
and
there's
no
way
you'll
be
able
to
wriggle
out
of
this
one
because
he
actually
asked
me
to
check
your
free
evenings
so
he
could
be
sure
to
have
it
on
a
night
you
can
come
harry
groaned
meanwhile
Ron
who
was
attempting
to
burst
the
pod
in
the
bowl
by
putting
both
hands
on
it
standing
up
and
squashing
it
as
hard
as
he
could
said
angrily
And
this
is
another
party
just
for
slughorn's
favorites
is
it
just
for
the
Slug
Club
yes
said
Hermione
the
pod
flew
out
from
under
ron's
fingers
and
hit
the
green
house
glass
rebounding
onto
the
back
of
Professor
sprout's
head
and
knocking
off
her
old
patched
hat
harry
went
to
retrieve
the
pod
when
he
got
back
Hermione
was
saying
Look
I
didn't
make
up
the
name
Slug
Club
slug
club'repeated
Ron
with
a
sneer
worthy
of
Malfoy
it's
pathetic
well
I
hope
you
enjoy
your
party
why
don't
you
try
hooking
up
with
McLaggen
then
Slughorn
can
make
you
King
and
Queen
Slug
we're
allowed
to
bring
guests
said
Hermione
who
for
some
reason
had
turned
a
bright
boiling
scarlet
and
I
was
going
to
ask
you
to
come
but
if
you
think
it's
that
stupid
then
I
won't
bother
harry
suddenly
wished
the
pod
had
flown
a
little
farther
so
that
he
need
not
have
been
sitting
here
with
the
pair
of
them
unno-ticed
by
either
he
seized
the
bowl
that
contained
the
pod
and
be-gan
to
try
and
open
it
by
the
noisiest
and
most
energetic
means
he
could
think
of
unfortunately
he
could
still
hear
every
word
of
their
conversation
you
were
going
to
ask
me
asked
Ron
in
a
completely
differ-ent
voice
yes
said
Hermione
angrily
but
obviously
if
you'd
rather
hooked
up
with
McLaggen
there
was
a
pause
while
Harry
continued
to
pound
the
resilient
pod
with
a
trowel
no
I
wouldn't
said
Ron
in
a
very
quiet
voice
harry
missed
the
pod
hit
the
bowl
and
shattered
it
reparo
he
said
hastily
poking
the
pieces
with
his
wand
and
the
bowl
sprang
back
together
again
the
crash
however
appeared
to
have
awoken
Ron
and
Hermione
to
harry's
presence
hermione
looked
flustered
and
immediately
started
fussing
about
for
her
copy
of
Flesh-Eating
Trees
of
the
World
to
find
out
the
correct
way
to
juice
Snargaluff
pods
Ron
on
the
other
hand
looked
sheepish
but
also
rather
pleased
with
himself
hand
that
over
Harry
said
Hermione
hurriedly
it
says
we're
supposed
to
puncture
them
with
something
sharp
harry
passed
her
the
pod
in
the
bowl
he
and
Ron
both
snapped
their
goggles
back
over
their
eyes
and
dived
once
more
for
the
stump
it
was
not
as
though
he
was
really
surprised
thought
Harry
as
he
wrestled
with
a
thorny
vine
intent
upon
throttling
him
he
had
had
an
inkling
that
this
might
happen
sooner
or
later
but
he
was
not
sure
how
he
felt
about
it
he
and
cho
were
now
too
em-barrassed
to
look
at
each
other
let
alone
talk
to
each
other
what
if
Ron
and
Hermione
started
going
out
together
then
split
up
could
their
friendship
survive
it
harry
remembered
the
few
weeks
when
they
had
not
been
talking
to
each
other
in
the
third
year
he
had
not
enjoyed
trying
to
bridge
the
distance
between
them
and
then
what
if
they
didn't
split
up
what
if
they
became
like
Bill
and
Fleur
and
it
became
excruciatingly
embarrassing
to
be
in
their
presence
so
that
he
was
shut
out
for
good
gotcha
yelled
Ron
pulling
a
second
pod
from
the
stump
just
as
Hermione
managed
to
burst
the
first
one
open
so
that
the
bowl
was
full
of
tubers
wriggling
like
pale
green
worms
the
rest
of
the
lesson
passed
without
further
mention
of
slughorn's
party
although
Harry
watched
his
two
friends
more
closely
over
the
next
few
days
Ron
and
Hermione
did
not
seem
any
different
except
that
they
were
a
little
politer
to
each
other
than
usual
harry
supposed
he
would
just
have
to
wait
to
see
what
happened
under
the
influence
of
butterbeer
in
slughorn's
dimly
lit
room
on
the
night
of
the
party
in
the
meantime
however
he
had
more
pressing
worries
katie
Bell
was
still
in
st.
mungo's
Hospital
with
no
prospect
of
leaving
which
meant
that
the
promising
Gryffindor
team
Harry
had
been
training
so
carefully
since
September
was
one
Chaser
short
he
kept
putting
off
replacing
Katie
in
the
hope
that
she
would
return
but
their
opening
match
against
Slytherin
was
loom-ing
and
he
finally
had
to
accept
that
she
would
not
be
back
in
time
to
play
harry
did
not
think
he
could
stand
another
full-House
tryout
with
a
sinking
feeling
that
had
little
to
do
with
Quidditch
he
cor-nered
Dean
Thomas
after
Transfiguration
one
day
most
of
the
class
had
already
left
although
several
twittering
yellow
birds
were
still
zooming
around
the
room
all
of
hermione's
creation
nobody
else
had
succeeded
in
conjuring
so
much
as
a
feather
from
thin
air
are
you
still
interested
in
playing
Chaser
wha
yeah
of
course
said
Dean
excitedly
over
Deans
shoulder
Harry
saw
Seamus
Finnegan
slamming
his
books
into
his
bag
looking
sour
one
of
the
reasons
why
Harry
would
have
pre-ferred
not
to
have
to
ask
Dean
to
play
was
that
he
knew
Seamus
would
not
like
it
on
the
other
hand
he
had
to
do
what
was
best
for
the
team
and
Dean
had
outflown
Seamus
at
the
tryouts
well
then
you're
in
said
Harry
there's
a
practice
tonight
seven
o'clock
right
said
Dean
cheers
Harry
blimey
I
can't
wait
to
tell
Ginny
he
sprinted
out
of
the
room
leaving
Harry
and
Seamus
alone
together
an
uncomfortable
moment
made
no
easier
when
a
bird
dropping
landed
on
seamus's
head
as
one
of
hermione's
canaries
whizzed
over
them
seamus
was
not
the
only
person
disgruntled
by
the
choice
of
Katies
substitute
there
was
much
muttering
in
the
common
room
about
the
fact
that
Harry
had
now
chosen
two
of
his
class-mates
for
the
team
as
Harry
had
endured
much
worse
mutterings
than
this
in
his
school
career
he
was
not
particularly
bothered
but
all
the
same
the
pressure
was
increasing
to
provide
a
win
in
the
upcoming
match
against
Slytherin
if
Gryffindor
won
Harry
knew
that
the
whole
House
would
forget
that
they
had
criticized
him
and
swear
that
they
had
always
known
it
was
a
great
team
if
they
lost
well
Harry
thought
wryly
he
had
still
endured
worse
mutterings
harry
had
no
reason
to
regret
his
choice
once
he
saw
Dean
fly
that
evening
he
worked
well
with
Ginny
and
Demelza
the
Beaters
Peakes
and
Coote
were
getting
better
all
the
time
the
only
problem
was
Ron
harry
had
known
all
along
that
Ron
was
an
inconsistent
player
who
suffered
from
nerves
and
a
lack
of
confidence
and
unfortu-nately
the
looming
prospect
of
the
opening
game
of
the
season
seemed
to
have
brought
out
all
his
old
insecurities
after
letting
in
half
a
dozen
goals
most
of
them
scored
by
Ginny
his
technique
became
wilder
and
wilder
until
he
finally
punched
an
oncoming
Demelza
Robins
in
the
mouth
it
was
an
accident
i'm
sorry
Demelza
really
sorry
ron
shouted
after
her
as
she
zigzagged
back
to
the
ground
dripping
blood
everywhere
i
just
panicked
Ginny
said
angrily
landing
next
to
Demelza
and
examining
her
fat
lip
you
prat
Ron
look
at
the
state
of
her
i
can
fix
that
said
Harry
landing
beside
the
two
girls
pointing
his
wand
at
Demelzas
mouth
and
saying
Episkey
and
Ginny
don't
call
Ron
a
prat
you're
not
the
Captain
of
this
team
well
you
seemed
too
busy
to
call
him
a
prat
and
I
thought
someone
should
harry
forced
himself
not
to
laugh
in
the
air
everyone
let's
go
overall
it
was
one
of
the
worst
practices
they
had
had
all
term
though
Harry
did
not
feel
that
honesty
was
the
best
policy
when
they
were
this
close
to
the
match
good
work
everyone
I
think
we'll
flatten
Slytherin
he
said
bracingly
and
the
Chasers
and
Beaters
left
the
changing
room
looking
reasonably
happy
with
themselves
i
played
like
a
sack
of
dragon
dung
said
Ron
in
a
hollow
voice
when
the
door
had
swung
shut
behind
Ginny
no
you
didn't
said
Harry
firmly
you're
the
best
Keeper
I
tried
out
Ron
your
only
problem
is
nerves
he
kept
up
a
relentless
flow
of
encouragement
all
the
way
back
to
the
castle
and
by
the
time
they
reached
the
second
floor
Ron
was
looking
marginally
more
cheerful
when
Harry
pushed
open
the
tapestry
to
take
their
usual
shortcut
up
to
Gryffindor
Tower
however
they
found
themselves
looking
at
Dean
and
Ginny
who
were
locked
in
a
close
embrace
and
kissing
fiercely
as
though
glued
together
it
was
as
though
something
large
and
scaly
erupted
into
life
in
harry's
stomach
clawing
at
his
insides
Hot
blood
seemed
to
flood
his
brain
so
that
all
thought
was
extinguished
replaced
by
a
savage
urge
to
jinx
Dean
into
a
jelly
wrestling
with
this
sudden
madness
he
heard
ron's
voice
as
though
from
a
great
distance
away
oi
dean
and
Ginny
broke
apart
and
looked
around
what
said
Ginny
i
don't
want
to
find
my
own
sister
snogging
people
in
public
this
was
a
deserted
corridor
till
you
came
butting
in
said
Ginny
dean
was
looking
embarrassed
he
gave
Harry
a
shifty
grin
that
Harry
did
not
return
as
the
newborn
monster
inside
him
was
roar-ing
for
dean's
instant
dismissal
from
the
team
er
c'mon
Ginny
said
Dean
let's
go
back
to
the
common
room
you
go
said
Ginny
i
want
a
word
with
my
dear
brother
dean
left
looking
as
though
he
was
not
sorry
to
depart
the
scene
right
said
Ginny
tossing
her
long
red
hair
out
of
her
face
and
glaring
at
Ron
let's
get
this
straight
once
and
for
all
it
is
none
of
your
business
who
I
go
out
with
or
what
I
do
with
them
Ron
Yeah
it
is
said
Ron
just
as
angrily
d
you
think
I
want
peo-ple
saying
my
sister's
a
a
what
shouted
Ginny
drawing
her
wand
a
what
exactly
he
doesn't
mean
anything
Ginny
said
Harry
automati-cally
though
the
monster
was
roaring
its
approval
of
ron's
words
oh
yes
he
does
she
said
flaring
up
at
Harry
just
because
he's
never
snogged
anyone
in
his
life
just
because
the
best
kiss
he's
ever
had
is
from
our
Auntie
Muriel
shut
your
mouth
bellowed
Ron
bypassing
red
and
turning
maroon
no
I
will
not
yelled
Ginny
beside
herself
i've
seen
you
with
Phlegm
hoping
she'll
kiss
you
on
the
cheek
every
time
you
see
her
it's
pathetic
if
you
went
out
and
got
a
bit
of
snogging
done
your
self
you
wouldn't
mind
so
much
that
everyone
else
does
it
ron
had
pulled
out
his
wand
too
Harry
stepped
swiftly
between
them
you
don't
know
what
you're
talking
about
ron
roared
trying
to
get
a
clear
shot
at
Ginny
around
Harry
who
was
now
standing
in
front
of
her
with
his
arms
outstretched
just
because
I
don't
do
it
in
public
ginny
screamed
with
derisive
laughter
trying
to
push
Harry
out
of
the
way
been
kissing
Pigwidgeon
have
you
or
have
you
got
a
picture
of
Auntie
Muriel
stashed
under
your
pillow
you
a
streak
of
orange
light
flew
under
Harrys
left
arm
and
missed
Ginny
by
inches
Harry
pushed
Ron
up
against
the
wall
don't
be
stupid
harry's
snogged
Cho
Chang
shouted
Ginny
who
sounded
close
to
tears
now
and
Hermione
snogged
Viktor
Krum
it's
only
you
who
acts
like
it's
something
disgusting
Ron
and
that's
because
you've
got
about
as
much
experience
as
a
twelve-year-old
and
with
that
she
stormed
away
harry
quickly
let
go
of
Ron
the
look
on
his
face
was
murderous
they
both
stood
there
breath-ing
heavily
until
Mrs
norris
rich's
cat
appeared
around
the
cor-ner
which
broke
the
tension
c'mon
said
Harry
as
the
sound
of
filch's
shuffling
feet
reached
their
ears
they
hurried
up
the
stairs
and
along
a
seventh-floor
corridor
oi
out
of
the
way
ron
barked
at
a
small
girl
who
jumped
in
fright
and
dropped
a
bottle
of
toadspawn
harry
hardly
noticed
the
sound
of
shattering
glass
he
felt
dis-oriented
dizzy
being
struck
by
a
lightning
bolt
must
be
something
like
this
it's
just
because
she's
Rons
sister
he
told
himself
you
just
didn't
like
seeing
her
kissing
Dean
because
she's
ron's
sister
but
unbidden
into
his
mind
came
an
image
of
that
same
de-serted
corridor
with
himself
kissing
Ginny
instead
the
mon-ster
in
his
chest
purred
but
then
he
saw
Ron
ripping
open
the
tapestry
curtain
and
drawing
his
wand
on
Harry
shouting
things
like
betrayal
of
trust
supposed
to
be
my
friend
d'you
think
Hermione
did
snog
Krum
ron
asked
abruptly
as
they
approached
the
Fat
Lady
harry
gave
a
guilty
start
and
wrenched
his
imagination
away
from
a
corridor
in
which
no
Ron
intruded
in
which
he
and
Ginny
were
quite
alone
What
he
said
confusedly
oh
er
the
honest
answer
was
yes
but
he
did
not
want
to
give
it
however
Ron
seemed
to
gather
the
worst
from
the
look
on
harry's
face
dilligrout
he
said
darkly
to
the
Fat
Lady
and
they
climbed
through
the
portrait
hole
into
the
common
room
neither
of
them
mentioned
Ginny
or
Hermione
again
indeed
they
barely
spoke
to
each
other
that
evening
and
got
into
bed
in
si-lence
each
absorbed
in
his
own
thoughts
harry
lay
awake
for
a
long
time
looking
up
at
the
canopy
of
his
four-poster
and
trying
to
convince
himself
that
his
feelings
for
Ginny
were
entirely
elder-brotherly
they
had
lived
had
they
not
like
brother
and
sister
all
summer
playing
Quidditch
teasing
Ron
and
having
a
laugh
about
Bill
and
Phlegm
he
had
known
Ginny
for
years
now
it
was
natural
that
he
should
feel
protective
natural
that
he
should
want
to
look
out
for
her
want
to
rip
Dean
limb
from
limb
for
kissing
her
no
he
would
have
to
control
that
particular
brotherly
feeling
ron
gave
a
great
grunting
snore
she's
ron's
sister
Harry
told
himself
firmly
ron's
sister
she's
out-of-bounds
he
would
not
risk
his
friendship
with
Ron
for
anything
he
punched
his
pillow
into
a
more
comfortable
shape
and
waited
for
sleep
to
come
trying
his
utmost
not
to
allow
his
thoughts
to
stray
anywhere
near
Ginny
harry
awoke
next
morning
feeling
slightly
dazed
and
confused
by
a
series
of
dreams
in
which
Ron
had
chased
him
with
a
Beaters
bat
but
by
midday
he
would
have
happily
exchanged
the
dream
Ron
for
the
real
one
who
was
not
only
cold-shouldering
Ginny
and
Dean
but
also
treating
a
hurt
and
bewildered
Hermione
with
an
icy
sneering
indifference
what
was
more
Ron
seemed
to
have
become
overnight
as
touchy
and
ready
to
lash
out
as
the
average
Blast-Ended
Skrewt
harry
spent
the
day
attempting
to
keep
the
peace
between
Ron
and
Hermione
with
no
success
finally
Hermione
departed
for
bed
in
high
dudgeon
and
Ron
stalked
off
to
the
boys
dormitory
after
swearing
angrily
at
several
frightened
first
years
for
looking
at
him
to
Harrys
dismay
ron's
new
aggression
did
not
wear
off
over
the
next
few
days
worse
still
it
coincided
with
an
even
deeper
dip
in
his
Keeping
skills
which
made
him
still
more
aggressive
so
that
during
the
final
Quidditch
practice
before
Saturdays
match
he
failed
to
save
every
single
goal
the
Chasers
aimed
at
him
but
bellowed
at
everybody
so
much
that
he
reduced
Demelza
Robins
to
tears
you
shut
up
and
leave
her
alone
shouted
Peakes
who
was
about
two-thirds
ron's
height
though
admittedly
carrying
a
heavy
bat
enough
bellowed
Harry
who
had
seen
Ginny
glowering
in
Rons
direction
and
remembering
her
reputation
as
an
accom-plished
caster
of
the
Bat-Bogey
Hex
soared
over
to
intervene
be-fore
things
got
out
of
hand
peakes
go
and
pack
up
the
Bludgers
demelza
pull
yourself
together
you
played
really
well
today
Ron
he
waited
until
the
rest
of
the
team
were
out
of
earshot
before
saying
it
you're
my
best
mate
but
carry
on
treating
the
rest
of
them
like
this
and
i'm
going
to
kick
you
off
the
team
he
really
thought
for
a
moment
that
Ron
might
hit
him
but
then
something
much
worse
happened
Ron
seemed
to
sag
on
his
broom
all
the
fight
went
out
of
him
and
he
said
I
resign
i'm
pathetic
you're
not
pathetic
and
you're
not
resigning
said
Harry
fiercely
seizing
Ron
by
the
front
of
his
robes
you
can
save
any-thing
when
you're
on
form
it's
a
mental
problem
you've
got
you
calling
me
mental
yeah
maybe
I
am
they
glared
at
each
other
for
a
moment
then
Ron
shook
his
head
wearily
i
know
you
haven't
got
any
time
to
find
another
Keeper
so
i'll
play
tomorrow
but
if
we
lose
and
we
will
i'm
tak-ing
myself
off
the
team
nothing
Harry
said
made
any
difference
he
tried
boosting
ron's
confidence
all
through
dinner
but
Ron
was
too
busy
being
grumpy
and
surly
with
Hermione
to
notice
harry
persisted
in
the
common
room
that
evening
but
his
assertion
that
the
whole
team
would
be
devastated
if
Ron
left
was
somewhat
undermined
by
the
fact
that
the
rest
of
the
team
was
sitting
in
a
huddle
in
a
distant
corner
clearly
muttering
about
Ron
and
casting
him
nasty
looks
finally
Harry
tried
getting
angry
again
in
the
hope
of
provoking
Ron
into
a
defiant
and
hopefully
goal-saving
attitude
but
this
strategy
did
not
appear
to
work
any
better
than
encouragement
Ron
went
to
bed
as
dejected
and
hopeless
as
ever
harry
lay
awake
for
a
very
long
time
in
the
darkness
he
did
not
want
to
lose
the
upcoming
match
not
only
was
it
his
first
as
cap-tain
but
he
was
determined
to
beat
Draco
Malfoy
at
Quidditch
even
if
he
could
not
yet
prove
his
suspicions
about
him
yet
if
Ron
played
as
he
had
done
in
the
last
few
practices
their
chances
of
winning
were
very
slim
if
only
there
was
something
he
could
do
to
make
Ron
pull
him-self
together
make
him
play
at
the
top
of
his
form
some-thing
that
would
ensure
that
Ron
had
a
really
good
day
and
the
answer
came
to
Harry
in
one
sudden
glorious
stroke
of
inspiration
breakfast
was
the
usual
excitable
affair
next
morning
the
Slytherins
hissed
and
booed
loudly
as
every
member
of
the
Gryffindor
team
entered
the
Great
Hall
harry
glanced
at
the
ceiling
and
saw
a
clear
pale
blue
sky
a
good
omen
the
Gryffindor
table
a
solid
mass
of
red
and
gold
cheered
as
Harry
and
Ron
approached
harry
grinned
and
waved
Ron
gri-maced
weakly
and
shook
his
head
cheer
up
Ron
called
Lavender
i
know
you'll
be
brilliant
Ron
ignored
her
tea
harry
asked
him
coffee
pumpkin
juice
anything
said
Ron
glumly
taking
a
moody
bite
of
toast
a
few
minutes
later
Hermione
who
had
become
so
tired
of
ron's
recent
unpleasant
behavior
that
she
had
not
come
down
to
breakfast
with
them
paused
on
her
way
up
the
table
how
are
you
both
feeling
she
asked
tentatively
her
eyes
on
the
back
of
ron's
head
fine
said
Harry
who
was
concentrating
on
handing
Ron
a
glass
of
pumpkin
juice
there
you
go
Ron
drink
up
ron
had
just
raised
the
glass
to
his
lips
when
Hermione
spoke
sharply
don't
drink
that
Ron
both
Harry
and
Ron
looked
up
at
her
why
not
said
Ron
hermione
was
now
staring
at
Harry
as
though
she
could
not
be-lieve
her
eyes
you
just
put
something
in
that
drink
excuse
me
said
Harry
you
heard
me
i
saw
you
you
just
tipped
something
into
ron's
drink
you've
got
the
bottle
in
your
hand
right
now
i
dont
know
what
you're
talking
about
said
Harry
stowing
the
little
bottle
hastily
in
his
pocket
ron
I
warn
you
don't
drink
it
hermione
said
again
alarmed
but
Ron
picked
up
the
glass
drained
it
in
one
gulp
and
said
Stop
bossing
me
around
Hermione
she
looked
scandalized
bending
low
so
that
only
Harry
could
hear
her
she
hissed
You
should
be
expelled
for
that
i'd
never
have
believed
it
of
you
Harry
look
who's
talking
he
whispered
back
confunded
anyone
lately
she
stormed
up
the
table
away
from
them
harry
watched
her
go
without
regret
hermione
had
never
really
understood
what
a
serious
business
Quidditch
was
he
then
looked
around
at
Ron
who
was
smacking
his
lips
nearly
time
said
Harry
blithely
the
frosty
grass
crunched
underfoot
as
they
strode
down
to
the
stadium
pretty
lucky
the
weathers
this
good
eh
harry
asked
Ron
yeah
said
Ron
who
was
pale
and
sick-looking
ginny
and
Demelza
were
already
wearing
their
Quidditch
robes
and
waiting
in
the
changing
room
conditions
look
ideal
said
Ginny
ignoring
Ron
and
guess
what
that
Slytherin
Chaser
Vaisey
he
took
a
Bludger
in
the
head
yesterday
during
their
practice
and
he's
too
sore
to
play
and
even
better
than
that
malfoy's
gone
off
sick
too
what
said
Harry
wheeling
around
to
stare
at
her
he's
ill
what's
wrong
with
him
no
idea
but
it's
great
for
us
said
Ginny
brightly
they're
playing
Harper
instead
he's
in
my
year
and
he's
an
idiot
harry
smiled
back
vaguely
but
as
he
pulled
on
his
scarlet
robes
his
mind
was
far
from
Quidditch
malfoy
had
once
before
claimed
he
could
not
play
due
to
injury
but
on
that
occasion
he
had
made
sure
the
whole
match
was
rescheduled
for
a
time
that
suited
the
Slytherins
better
why
was
he
now
happy
to
let
a
substitute
go
on
was
he
really
ill
or
was
he
faking
fishy
isn't
it
he
said
in
an
undertone
to
Ron
malfoy
not
playing
lucky
I
call
it
said
Ron
looking
slightly
more
animated
and
Vaisey
off
too
he's
their
best
goal
scorer
I
didn't
fancy
hey
he
said
suddenly
freezing
halfway
through
pulling
on
his
Keepers
gloves
and
staring
at
Harry
what
you
ron
had
dropped
his
voice
he
looked
both
scared
and
excited
my
drink
my
pumpkin
juice
you
didn't
harry
raised
his
eyebrows
but
said
nothing
except
we'll
be
starting
in
about
five
minutes
you'd
better
get
your
boots
on
they
walked
out
onto
the
pitch
to
tumultuous
roars
and
boos
one
end
of
the
stadium
was
solid
red
and
gold
the
other
a
sea
of
green
and
silver
many
Hufflepuffs
and
Ravenclaws
had
taken
sides
too
Amidst
all
the
yelling
and
clapping
Harry
could
distinctly
hear
the
roar
of
Luna
lovegood's
famous
lion-topped
hat
harry
stepped
up
to
Madam
Hooch
the
referee
who
was
stand-ing
ready
to
release
the
balls
from
the
crate
captains
shake
hands
she
said
and
Harry
had
his
hand
crushed
by
the
new
Slytherin
Captain
Urquhart
mount
your
brooms
on
the
whistle
three
two
one
the
whistle
sounded
Harry
and
the
others
kicked
off
hard
from
the
frozen
ground
and
they
were
away
harry
soared
around
the
perimeter
of
the
grounds
looking
around
for
the
Snitch
and
keeping
one
eye
on
Harper
who
was
zigzagging
far
below
him
then
a
voice
that
was
jarringly
different
to
the
usual
commentator's
started
up
well
there
they
go
and
I
think
we're
all
surprised
to
see
the
team
that
potter's
put
together
this
year
many
thought
given
Ronald
weasley's
patchy
performance
as
Keeper
last
year
that
he
might
be
off
the
team
but
of
course
a
close
personal
friendship
with
the
Captain
does
help
these
words
were
greeted
with
jeers
and
applause
from
the
Slytherin
end
of
the
pitch
harry
craned
around
on
his
broom
to
look
toward
the
commentator's
podium
a
call
skinny
blond
buy
with
an
upturned
nose
was
standing
there
talking
into
the
magical
megaphone
that
had
once
been
Lee
jordan's
Harry
recognized
Zacharias
Smith
a
Hufflepuff
player
whom
he
heartily
disliked
oh
and
here
comes
slytherin's
first
attempt
on
goal
it's
Urquhart
streaking
down
the
pitch
and
harrys
stomach
turned
over
Weasley
saves
it
well
he's
bound
to
get
lucky
sometimes
I
suppose
that's
right
Smith
he
is
muttered
Harry
grinning
to
him-self
as
he
dived
amongst
the
Chasers
with
his
eyes
searching
all
around
for
some
hint
of
the
elusive
Snitch
with
half
an
hour
of
the
game
gone
Gryffindor
were
leading
sixty
points
to
zero
Ron
having
made
some
truly
spectacular
saves
some
by
the
very
tips
of
his
gloves
and
Ginny
having
scored
four
of
gryffindor's
six
goals
this
effectively
stopped
Zacharias
won-dering
loudly
whether
the
two
Weasleys
were
only
there
because
Harry
liked
them
and
he
started
on
Peakes
and
Coote
instead
of
course
Coote
isn't
really
the
usual
build
for
a
Beater
said
Zacharias
loftily
they've
generally
got
a
bit
more
muscle
hit
a
Bludger
at
him
harry
called
to
Coote
as
he
zoomed
past
but
Coote
grinning
broadly
chose
to
aim
the
next
Bludger
at
Harper
instead
who
was
just
passing
Harry
in
the
opposite
direc-tion
harry
was
pleased
to
hear
the
dull
thunk
that
meant
the
Bludger
had
found
its
mark
it
seemed
as
though
Gryffindor
could
do
no
wrong
again
and
again
they
scored
and
again
and
again
at
the
other
end
of
the
pitch
Ron
saved
goals
with
apparent
ease
he
was
actually
smiling
now
and
when
the
crowd
greeted
a
particularly
good
save
with
a
rousing
chorus
of
the
old
favorite
Weasley
Is
Our
King
he
pre-tended
to
conduct
them
from
on
high
thinks
he's
something
special
today
doesn't
he
said
a
snide
voice
and
Harry
was
nearly
knocked
off
his
broom
as
Harper
collided
with
him
hard
and
deliberately
your
blood-traitor
pal
madam
hooch's
back
was
turned
and
though
Gryffindors
be-low
shouted
in
anger
by
the
time
she
looked
around
Harper
had
already
sped
off
his
shoulder
aching
Harry
raced
after
him
de-termined
to
ram
him
back
and
I
think
Harper
of
slytherin's
seen
the
Snitch
said
Zacharias
Smith
through
his
megaphone
yes
he's
certainly
seen
something
Potter
hasn't
smith
really
was
an
idiot
thought
Harry
hadn't
he
noticed
them
collide
but
next
moment
his
stomach
seemed
to
drop
out
of
the
sky
Smith
was
right
and
Harry
was
wrong
Harper
had
not
sped
upward
at
random
he
had
spotted
what
Harry
had
not
The
Snitch
was
speeding
along
high
above
them
glinting
brightly
against
the
clear
blue
sky
harry
accelerated
the
wind
was
whistling
in
his
ears
so
that
it
drowned
all
sound
of
smith's
commentary
or
the
crowd
but
Harper
was
still
ahead
of
him
and
Gryffindor
was
only
a
hundred
points
up
if
Harper
got
there
first
Gryffindor
had
lost
and
now
Harper
was
feet
from
it
his
hand
outstretched
oi
Harper
yelled
Harry
in
desperation
how
much
did
Malfoy
pay
you
to
come
on
instead
of
him
he
did
not
know
what
made
him
say
it
but
Harper
did
a
dou-ble-take
he
fumbled
the
Snitch
let
it
slip
through
his
fingers
and
shot
right
past
it
harry
made
a
great
swipe
for
the
tiny
fluttering
ball
and
caught
it
yes
hairy
yelled
wheeling
around
he
hurtled
back
toward
the
ground
the
Snitch
held
high
in
his
hand
as
the
crowd
realized
what
had
happened
a
great
shout
went
up
that
almost
drowned
the
sound
of
the
whistle
that
signaled
the
end
of
the
game
ginny
where're
you
going
yelled
Harry
who
had
found
hint
self
trapped
in
the
midst
of
a
mass
midair
hug
with
the
rest
of
tin
team
but
Ginny
sped
right
on
past
them
until
with
an
almighty
crash
she
collided
with
the
commentators
podium
as
the
crowd
shrieked
and
laughed
the
Gryffindor
team
landed
beside
the
wreckage
of
wood
under
which
Zacharias
was
feebly
stirring
Harry
heard
Ginny
saying
blithely
to
an
irate
Professor
McGonagall
Forgot
to
brake
Professor
sorry
laughing
Harry
broke
free
of
the
rest
of
the
team
and
hugged
Ginny
but
let
go
very
quickly
avoiding
her
gaze
he
clapped
cheering
Ron
on
the
back
instead
as
all
enmity
forgotten
the
Gryffindor
team
left
the
pitch
arm
in
arm
punching
the
air
ami
waving
to
their
supporters
the
atmosphere
in
the
changing
room
was
jubilant
party
up
in
the
common
room
Seamus
said
yelled
Dean
exuberantly
c'mon
Ginny
Demelza
ron
and
Harry
were
the
last
two
in
the
changing
room
they
were
just
about
to
leave
when
Hermione
entered
she
was
twisting
her
Gryffindor
scarf
in
her
hands
and
looked
upset
but
determined
i
want
a
word
with
you
Harry
she
took
a
deep
breath
yon
shouldn't
have
done
it
you
heard
Slughorn
its
illegal
what
are
you
going
to
do
turn
us
in
demanded
Ron
what
are
you
two
talking
about
asked
Harry
turning
away
to
hang
up
his
robes
so
that
neither
of
them
would
see
him
grinning
You
know
perfectly
well
what
we're
talking
about
said
Hermione
shrilly
you
spiked
Rons
juice
with
lucky
potion
at
breakfast
i'elix
Felicis
no
I
didn't
said
Harry
turning
back
to
face
them
both
yes
you
did
Harry
and
that's
why
everything
went
right
there
were
Slytherin
players
missing
and
Ron
saved
everything
i
didn't
put
it
in
said
Harry
grinning
broadly
he
slipped
his
hand
inside
his
jacket
pocket
and
drew
out
the
tiny
bottle
that
Hermione
had
seen
in
his
hand
that
morning
it
was
full
of
golden
potion
and
the
cork
was
still
tightly
sealed
with
wax
i
wanted
Ron
to
think
i'd
done
it
so
I
faked
it
when
I
knew
you
were
look-ing
he
looked
at
Ron
you
saved
everything
because
you
felt
lucky
you
did
it
all
yourself
he
pocketed
the
potion
again
there
really
wasn't
anything
in
my
pumpkin
juice
ron
said
astounded
but
the
weather's
good
and
Vaisey
couldn't
play
i
honestly
haven't
been
given
lucky
potion
harry
shook
his
head
ron
gaped
at
him
for
a
moment
then
rounded
on
Hermione
imitating
her
voice
you
added
Felix
Felicis
to
Rons
juice
this
morning
that's
why
he
saved
everything
see
i
can
save
goals
without
help
Hermione
i
never
said
you
couldn't
Ron
you
thought
you'd
been
given
it
too
but
Ron
had
already
strode
past
her
out
of
the
door
with
his
broomstick
over
his
shoulder
er
said
Harry
into
the
sudden
silence
he
had
not
expected
his
plan
to
backfire
like
this
shall
shall
we
go
up
to
the
party
then
you
go
said
Hermione
blinking
back
tears
i'm
sick
of
Ron
at
the
moment
I
don't
know
what
i'm
supposed
to
have
done
and
she
stormed
out
of
the
changing
room
too
harry
walked
slowly
back
up
the
grounds
toward
the
castle
through
the
crowd
many
of
whom
shouted
congratulations
at
him
but
he
felt
a
great
sense
of
letdown
he
had
been
sure
that
if
Ron
won
the
match
he
and
Hermione
would
be
friends
again
immediately
he
did
not
see
how
he
could
possibly
explain
to
hermi-one
that
what
she
had
done
to
offend
Ron
was
kiss
Viktor
Krum
not
when
the
offense
had
occurred
so
long
ago
harry
could
not
see
Hermione
at
the
Gryffindor
celebration
party
which
was
in
full
swing
when
he
arrived
renewed
cheers
and
clapping
greeted
his
appearance
and
he
was
soon
surrounded
by
a
mob
of
people
congratulating
him
what
with
trying
to
shake
off
the
Creevey
brothers
who
wanted
a
blow-by-blow
match
analysis
and
the
large
group
of
girls
that
encircled
him
laughing
at
his
least
amusing
comments
and
batting
their
eyelids
it
was
some
time
before
he
could
try
and
find
Ron
at
last
he
extricated
him-self
from
Romilda
Vane
who
was
hinting
heavily
that
she
would
like
to
go
to
slughorn's
Christmas
party
with
him
as
he
was
duck-ing
toward
the
drinks
table
he
walked
straight
into
Ginny
Arnold
the
Pygmy
Puff
riding
on
her
shoulder
and
Crookshanks
mewing
hopefully
at
her
heels
looking
for
Ron
she
asked
smirking
he's
over
there
the
filthy
hypocrite
harry
looked
into
the
corner
she
was
indicating
there
in
full
view
of
the
whole
room
stood
Ron
wrapped
so
closely
around
Lavender
Brown
it
was
hard
to
tell
whose
hands
were
whose
it
looks
like
he's
eating
her
face
doesn't
it
said
Ginny
dispas-sionately
but
I
suppose
he's
got
to
refine
his
technique
somehow
good
game
Harry
she
patted
him
on
the
arm
Harry
felt
a
swooping
sensation
in
his
stomach
but
then
she
walked
off
to
help
herself
to
more
butterbeer
crookshanks
trotted
after
her
his
yellow
eyes
fixed
upon
Arnold
harry
turned
away
from
Ron
who
did
not
look
like
he
would
be
surfacing
soon
just
as
the
portrait
hole
was
closing
with
a
sinking
feeling
he
thought
he
saw
a
mane
of
bushy
brown
hair
whip-ping
out
of
sight
he
darted
forward
sidestepped
Romilda
Vane
again
and
pushed
open
the
portrait
of
the
Fat
Lady
the
corridor
outside
seemed
to
be
deserted
hermione
he
found
her
in
the
first
unlocked
classroom
he
tried
she
was
sitting
on
the
teacher's
desk
alone
except
for
a
small
ring
of
twit-tering
yellow
birds
circling
her
head
which
she
had
clearly
just
conjured
out
of
midair
harry
could
not
help
admiring
her
spell-work
at
a
time
like
this
oh
hello
Harry
she
said
in
a
brittle
voice
i
was
just
practicing
yeah
they're
er
really
good
said
Harry
he
had
no
idea
what
to
say
to
her
he
was
just
wondering
whether
there
was
any
chance
that
she
had
not
noticed
Ron
that
she
had
merely
left
the
room
because
the
party
was
a
little
too
rowdy
when
she
said
in
an
unnaturally
high-pitched
voice
Ron
seems
to
be
enjoying
the
celebrations
er
does
he
said
Harry
don't
pretend
you
didn't
see
him
said
Hermione
he
wasn't
exactly
hiding
it
was
the
door
behind
them
burst
open
to
harry's
horror
Ron
came
in
laughing
pulling
Lavender
by
the
hand
oh
he
said
drawing
up
short
at
the
sight
of
Harry
and
Hermione
oops
said
Lavender
and
she
backed
out
of
the
room
gig-gling
the
door
swung
shut
behind
her
there
was
a
horrible
swelling
billowing
silence
hermione
was
staring
at
Ron
who
refused
to
look
at
her
but
said
with
an
odd
mixture
of
bravado
and
awkwardness
Hi
Harry
wondered
where
you'd
got
to
hermione
slid
off
the
desk
the
little
flock
of
golden
birds
con-tinued
to
twitter
in
circles
around
her
head
so
that
she
looked
like
a
strange
feathery
model
of
the
solar
system
you
shouldn't
leave
Lavender
waiting
outside
she
said
quietly
she'll
wonder
where
you've
gone
she
walked
very
slowly
and
erectly
toward
the
door
harry
glanced
at
Ron
who
was
looking
relieved
that
nothing
worse
had
happened
oppugno
came
a
shriek
from
the
doorway
harry
spun
around
to
see
Hermione
pointing
her
wand
at
Ron
her
expression
wild
The
little
flock
of
birds
was
speeding
like
a
hail
of
fat
golden
bullets
toward
Ron
who
yelped
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
but
the
birds
attacked
pecking
and
clawing
at
every
bit
of
flesh
they
could
reach
gerremoffme
he
yelled
but
with
one
last
look
of
vindictive
fury
Hermione
wrenched
open
the
door
and
disappeared
through
it
harry
thought
he
heard
a
sob
before
it
slammed
chapter
The
Unbreakable
Vow
snow
was
swirling
against
the
icy
windows
once
more
Christmas
was
approaching
fast
hagrid
had
already
singlehandedly
delivered
the
usual
twelve
C
hristmas
trees
to
the
Great
Hall
garlands
of
holly
and
tinsel
had
been
twisted
around
the
banisters
of
the
stairs
everlasting
candles
glowed
from
inside
the
helmets
of
suits
of
armor
and
great
bunches
of
mistletoe
had
been
hung
at
intervals
along
the
corridors
large
groups
of
girls
tended
to
converge
underneath
the
mistletoe
bunches
every
time
Harry
went
past
which
caused
blockages
in
the
corridors
fortunat
e
ly
however
harry's
frequent
nighttime
wanderings
had
given
him
an
unusually
good
knowledge
of
the
castle's
secret
passageways
so
that
he
was
often
without
too
much
difficulty
to
naviga
t
e
mistletoe-free
routes
between
classes
ron
who
might
once
have
found
the
necessity
of
these
detours
excuse
for
jealousy
rather
than
hilarity
simply
roared
with
laughter
about
it
all
although
Harry
much
preferred
this
new
laughing
joking
Ron
to
the
moody
aggressive
model
he
had
been
enduring
for
the
last
few
weeks
the
improved
Ron
came
at
a
heavy
price
firstly
Harry
had
to
put
up
with
the
frequent
presence
of
Lavender
Brown
who
seemed
to
regard
any
moment
that
she
was
not
kissing
Ron
as
a
moment
wasted
and
secondly
Harry
found
himself
once
more
the
best
friend
of
two
people
who
seemed
unlikely
ever
to
speak
to
each
other
again
ron
whose
hands
and
forearms
still
bore
scratches
and
cuts
from
hermione's
bird
attack
was
taking
a
defensive
and
resentful
tone
she
can't
complain
he
told
Harry
she
snogged
Krum
so
she's
found
out
someone
wants
to
snog
me
too
well
it's
a
free
country
i
haven't
done
anything
wrong
harry
did
not
answer
but
pretended
to
be
absorbed
in
the
book
they
were
supposed
to
have
read
before
Charms
next
morning
Quintessence
A
Q
uest
determined
as
he
was
to
remain
friends
with
both
Ron
and
Hermione
he
was
spending
a
lot
of
time
with
his
mouth
shut
tight
i
never
promised
Hermione
anything
Ron
mumbled
i
mean
all
right
I
was
going
to
go
to
slughorn's
Christmas
party
with
her
but
she
never
said
just
as
friends
i'm
a
free
agent
harry
turned
a
page
of
Quintessence
aware
that
Ron
was
watching
him
ron's
voice
trailed
away
in
mutters
barely
audible
over
the
loud
crackling
of
the
fire
though
Harry
thought
he
caught
the
words
Krum
and
can't
complain
again
hermione's
schedule
was
so
full
that
Harry
could
only
talk
to
her
properly
in
the
evenings
when
Ron
was
in
any
case
so
tightly
wrapped
around
Lavender
that
he
did
not
notice
what
Harry
was
doing
hermione
refused
to
sit
in
the
common
room
while
Ron
was
there
So
Harry
generally
joined
her
in
the
library
which
meant
that
their
conversations
were
held
in
whispers
he's
at
perfect
liberty
to
kiss
whomever
he
likes
said
Hermione
while
the
librarian
Madam
Pince
prowled
the
shelves
behind
them
i
really
couldn't
care
less
she
raised
her
quill
and
dotted
an
i
so
ferociously
that
she
punctured
a
hole
in
her
parchment
harry
said
nothing
he
thought
his
voice
might
soon
vanish
from
the
lack
of
use
he
bent
a
little
lower
over
Advanced
Potion-Making
and
continued
to
make
notes
on
Everlasting
Elixirs
occasionally
pausing
to
decipher
the
p
rince's
useful
additions
to
Libatius
B
orage's
text
and
incidentally
said
Hermione
after
a
few
moments
you
need
to
be
careful
for
the
last
time
said
Harry
speaking
in
a
slightly
hoarse
tone
after
three-quarters
of
an
ho
u
r
of
silence
I
am
not
giving
back
this
book
i've
learned
more
from
the
half-blood
p
rince
than
Snape
or
Slughorn
have
taught
me
in
i'm
not
talking
about
your
stupid
so-called
prince
said
Hermione
giving
his
book
a
nasty
look
as
though
it
had
been
rude
to
her
i'm
talki
ng
about
earlier
i
went
into
the
girl's
bathroom
just
before
I
came
in
here
and
there
were
about
a
dozen
girls
in
there
including
that
Romilda
Vane
trying
to
decide
how
to
slip
you
a
love
potion
they're
all
hoping
they're
going
to
get
you
to
take
them
to
slughorn's
party
and
thay
all
seem
to
have
bought
Fred
and
george's
love
potions
which
i'm
afraid
to
say
probably
work
why
didn't
you
confiscate
them
then
demanded
Harry
it
seemed
extraordinary
that
hermione's
m
ania
for
upholding
the
rules
could
have
abandoned
her
at
this
crucial
juncture
they
didn't
have
the
potions
with
them
in
the
bathroom
said
Hermione
scornfully
They
were
just
discussing
tactics
as
I
doubt
the
half-blood
prince
she
gave
the
book
another
scornful
look
could
dream
up
an
antidote
for
a
dozen
different
love
potions
at
once
i'd
just
invite
someone
to
go
with
you
that'll
stop
all
the
others
thinking
they've
still
got
a
chance
it's
tomor
r
ow
night
they're
getting
desperate
there
isn't
anyone
I
want
to
invite
mumbled
Harry
who
was
still
not
trying
to
think
about
Ginny
any
more
than
he
could
help
despite
the
fact
the
fact
that
she
kept
cropping
up
in
his
dreams
in
ways
that
made
him
devoutly
thankful
that
Ron
could
not
perform
Legilimency
well
just
be
careful
what
you
drink
because
Romilda
Va
ne
looked
like
she
meant
business
said
Hermione
grimly
she
hitched
up
the
long
roll
of
parchment
on
which
she
was
writing
her
Arithma
n
cy
essay
and
continued
to
scratch
away
with
her
quill
harry
wa
t
che
d
her
with
his
mind
a
long
way
away
hang
on
a
moment
he
said
slowly
i
thought
Filch
had
banned
anything
bought
at
weasley's
Wizard
Wheezes
and
when
has
anyone
ever
paid
attention
to
what
Filch
has
banned
asked
Hermione
still
concentrating
on
her
essay
but
I
thought
all
the
owls
were
being
searched
so
how
come
these
grils
are
able
to
bring
love
potions
into
the
school
fred
and
George
send
them
disguised
as
perfumes
and
cough
potions
said
Hermione
it's
part
of
their
Owl
order
service
you
know
a
lot
about
it
hermione
gave
him
the
kind
of
nasty
look
she
had
just
given
his
copy
of
Advanced
Potion-Making
it
was
all
on
the
back
of
the
bottles
they
showed
Ginny
and
me
in
the
summer
she
said
coldly
I
don't
go
around
putting
potions
in
people's
drinks
or
pretending
too
eit
h
er
which
is
just
as
bad
yeah
well
never
mind
that
said
Harry
quickly
the
point
is
Filch
is
being
fooled
isn't
he
these
girls
are
getting
stuff
into
the
school
disguised
as
something
else
so
why
couldn't
Malfoy
have
brought
the
necklace
into
the
school
oh
Harry
not
that
again
come
on
why
not
demanded
Harry
look
sighed
Hermione
Secrecy
Sensors
detect
jinxes
curses
and
concealment
charms
don't
they
they're
used
to
find
d
ark
magic
and
d
ark
obje
c
ts
they'd
have
picked
up
a
powerful
curse
like
the
one
in
the
necklace
withi
n
seconds
but
something
that's
just
been
put
in
the
wrong
bottle
wouldn
t
register
anyway
Love
potions
aren't
d
ark
or
dangerous
easy
for
you
to
say
muttered
Harry
thinking
of
Romilda
Vane
so
it
would
be
down
to
Filch
to
realise
it
wasn't
a
cough
potion
and
he's
not
a
very
good
wizard
I
doubt
he
can
tell
one
potion
from
hermione
stopped
dead
Harry
had
heard
it
too
somebody
had
moved
close
behind
them
among
the
dark
bookshelves
they
waited
and
a
moment
later
the
vulturelike
countenance
of
Madam
Pince
appeared
around
the
corner
her
sunken
cheeks
her
skin
like
parchment
and
her
long
hooked
nose
illuminated
unflatteringly
by
the
lamp
she
was
carrying
the
library
is
now
closed
she
said
Mind
you
return
anything
you
have
borrowed
to
the
correct
what
have
you
been
doing
to
that
book
you
depraved
boy
it
isn't
the
library's
it's
mine
said
Harry
hastily
snatching
his
copy
of
Advanced
Potion-Making
off
the
table
as
she
lunged
at
it
with
a
clawlike
hand
spoiled
she
hissed
desecrated
befouled
it's
just
a
book
that's
been
written
on
said
Harry
tugging
it
out
of
her
grip
she
looked
as
though
she
might
have
a
seizure
Hermione
who
had
hastily
packed
her
things
grabbed
Harry
by
the
arm
and
frogmarched
him
away
she'll
ban
you
from
the
library
if
you're
not
careful
why
did
you
have
to
bring
that
stupid
book
it's
not
my
fault
she's
barking
mad
Hermione
or
d'you
think
she
overheard
you
being
rude
about
Filch
i've
always
thought
there
might
be
something
between
them
oh
ha
ha
enjoying
the
fact
that
they
could
speak
normally
again
they
made
their
way
along
the
deserted
lamp-lit
corridors
back
to
the
common
room
arguing
w
hether
or
not
Filch
and
Madam
Pince
were
secretly
in
love
with
each
other
baubles
said
Harry
to
the
Fat
Lady
this
being
the
new
festive
password
same
to
you
said
the
fat
lady
with
a
roguish
grin
and
she
swung
forward
to
admit
them
hi
Harry
said
Romilda
Vane
the
moment
he
had
climbed
through
the
portrait
hole
fancy
a
gillywater
hermione
gave
him
a
what-did-i-tell-you
look
over
her
shoulder
no
thanks
said
Harry
quickly
i
don't
like
it
much
well
take
these
anyway
said
Romilda
thrusting
a
box
into
his
hands
chocolate
Cauldrons
they've
got
firewhiskey
in
them
my
gran
sent
them
to
me
but
I
don't
like
them
oh
right
thanks
a
lot
said
Harry
who
could
not
think
what
else
to
say
er
I
m
just
going
over
here
with
he
hurried
off
behind
Hermione
his
voice
tailing
away
feebly
told
you
said
Hermione
succinctly
Sooner
you
ask
someone
sooner
they'll
all
leave
you
alone
and
you
can
but
her
face
suddnly
turned
blank
she
had
just
spotted
Ron
and
Lavender
who
were
i
ntertwined
in
the
same
armchair
well
good
night
Harry
said
Hermione
though
it
was
only
seven
o'clock
in
the
evening
and
she
left
for
the
girl
s
dormitory
without
another
word
harry
went
to
bed
comforting
himself
that
there
was
only
one
more
day
of
lessons
to
struggle
through
plus
slughorn's
party
after
which
he
and
Ron
would
depart
together
for
the
B
urrow
it
now
seemed
impossible
that
Ron
and
Hermione
would
make
up
with
each
other
before
the
holidays
began
but
perhaps
somehow
the
break
would
give
them
time
to
calm
down
think
better
of
their
behavior
but
his
hopes
were
not
high
and
they
sank
still
lower
after
enduring
a
Transfiguration
lesson
with
them
both
next
day
they
had
just
embarked
upon
the
immensely
difficult
topic
of
human
transfiguration
working
in
front
of
mirrors
they
were
suposed
to
be
changing
the
color
of
their
own
eyebrows
hermione
laughed
unkindly
at
ron's
disastrous
first
attempt
during
which
he
somehow
managed
to
give
himself
a
spectacular
handlebar
mustache
Ron
retaliated
by
doing
a
cruel
but
accurate
impression
of
Hermione
jumping
up
and
down
in
her
seat
every
time
Profe
s
sor
McGonagall
asked
a
question
which
Lavender
and
Parvati
found
deeply
amusing
and
which
reduced
Hermione
to
the
verge
of
tears
again
she
raced
out
of
the
classroom
on
the
bell
leaving
half
her
things
behind
Harry
deciding
that
her
need
was
greater
than
ron's
just
now
scooped
up
her
remaining
po
ssessions
and
followed
her
he
finally
tracked
her
down
as
she
emerged
from
a
girl's
bathroom
on
the
floor
below
she
was
accompanied
by
Luna
Lovegood
who
was
patting
her
vaguely
on
the
back
oh
hello
Harry
said
Luna
d
id
you
know
one
of
your
eyebrows
is
bright
yellow
hi
Luna
hermione
you
left
your
stuff
he
held
out
her
books
oh
yes
said
Hermione
in
a
choked
voice
taking
her
things
and
turning
away
quickly
to
hide
the
fact
she
was
wiping
her
eyes
with
her
pencil
case
thank
you
Harry
well
i'd
better
get
going
and
she
hurried
off
without
ever
giving
Harry
any
time
to
offer
words
of
comfort
though
admittedly
he
could
not
think
of
any
she's
a
bit
upset
said
Luna
i
thought
at
first
it
was
Moaning
Myrtle
in
there
but
it
turned
out
to
be
Hermione
she
said
something
about
Ron
Weasley
yeah
they've
had
a
row
said
Harry
he
says
funny
things
sometimes
doesn't
he
said
Luna
as
they
set
off
down
the
corridor
together
but
he
can
be
a
bit
unkind
i
noticed
that
last
year
i
s'pose
said
Harry
luna
was
demonstrating
her
usual
knack
of
speaking
uncomfortable
truths
he
had
never
met
anyone
quite
like
her
so
have
you
had
a
good
term
oh
it's
been
al
l
right
said
Luna
a
bit
lonely
without
the
D
a.
ginny's
been
nice
though
she
stopped
two
boys
in
our
Transfiguration
class
calling
me
Loony
the
other
day
how
would
you
like
to
come
to
S
lughorn's
party
with
me
tonight
the
words
were
out
of
harry's
mouth
before
he
could
stop
them
he
heard
himself
say
them
as
though
it
were
a
stranger
speaking
luna
turned
her
protuberant
eyes
to
him
in
surprise
slughorn's
party
with
you
yeah
said
Harry
we're
supposed
to
bring
guests
so
I
thought
you
might
like
i
mean
he
was
keen
to
make
his
intentions
perfectly
clear
i
mean
just
as
friends
you
know
but
if
you
don't
want
to
he
was
already
half
hoping
that
she
didn't
want
to
o
h
no
i'd
love
to
go
with
you
as
friends
said
Luna
beaming
as
he
had
never
seen
her
beam
before
nobody's
ever
asked
me
to
a
party
before
as
a
friend
is
that
why
you
dyed
your
eyebrow
for
the
party
should
I
dye
mine
too
no
said
Harry
firmly
That
was
a
mistake
i'll
get
Hermione
to
put
it
right
for
me
so
i'll
meet
you
in
the
entrance
hall
at
eight
o'clock
then
aha
screamed
a
voice
from
overhead
and
both
of
them
jumped
unnoticed
by
either
of
them
they
had
just
passed
underneath
Peeves
who
was
hanging
upside
down
from
a
chandelier
and
grinning
maliciously
at
them
potty
asked
Loony
to
go
to
the
part
y
potty
lurves
Loony
potty
luuuuuurves
Looooony
and
he
zoomed
away
cackling
and
shrieking
Potty
loves
Loony
nice
to
keep
these
things
private
said
Harry
and
sure
enough
in
no
time
at
all
the
whole
school
seemed
to
know
that
Harry
Potter
was
taking
Luna
Lovegood
to
slughorn's
party
you
could've
taken
anyone
said
Ron
in
disbelief
over
dinner
anyone
and
you
chose
Loony
Lovegood
don't
call
her
that
Ron
snapped
Ginny
pausing
behind
Harry
on
her
way
to
join
friends
i'm
really
glad
you're
taking
her
Harry
she's
so
excited
and
she
moved
on
down
the
table
to
sit
with
Dean
harry
tried
to
feel
pleased
that
Ginny
was
glad
he
was
taking
Luna
to
the
party
but
could
not
quite
manage
it
a
long
way
along
the
table
Hermione
was
sitting
alone
playing
with
her
stew
harry
noticed
Ron
looking
at
her
furtively
you
could
say
sorry
suggested
Harry
bluntly
what
and
get
attacked
by
another
flock
of
canaries
muttered
Ron
what
did
you
have
to
imitate
her
for
she
laughed
at
my
mustache
so
did
I
it
was
the
stupidest
thing
i've
ever
seen
but
Ron
did
not
seem
to
have
he
a
rd
Lavender
had
just
arrived
with
Parvati
squeezing
herself
in
between
Harry
and
Ron
Lavender
flung
her
arms
around
ron's
neck
hi
Harry
said
Parvati
who
like
Harry
looked
faintly
embarrassed
and
bored
by
the
behavior
of
their
two
friends
hi
said
Harry
how're
you
you're
staying
at
Hogwarts
then
i
heard
your
parents
wanted
you
to
leave
i
managed
to
talk
them
out
o
f
it
for
the
time
being
said
Parvati
that
Katie
thing
really
freaked
them
out
but
as
there
hasn't
been
anything
since
oh
hi
Hermione
parvati
positively
beamed
harry
could
tell
that
she
was
feeling
guilty
for
having
laughed
at
Hermione
in
Transfiguration
he
looked
around
and
saw
that
Hermione
was
beaming
back
if
possible
even
more
brightly
girls
were
very
strange
sometimes
hi
Parvati
said
Hermione
ignoring
Ron
and
Lavender
completely
are
you
going
to
slughorn's
party
tonight
no
invite
said
Parvati
gloomily
i'd
love
to
go
though
it
sounds
like
it's
going
to
be
really
good
you're
going
aren't
you
yes
i'm
meeting
Cormac
at
eight
and
we're
there
was
a
noise
like
a
plunger
being
withdrawn
from
a
blocked
sink
and
Ron
surfaced
hermione
acted
as
though
she
had
not
seen
or
heard
anything
we're
going
up
to
the
party
together
cormac
said
Parvati
cormac
McLaggen
you
mean
that's
right
said
Hermione
sweetly
the
one
who
almost
she
put
a
great
deal
of
emphasis
on
the
word
bec
a
me
Gryffindor
Keeper
are
you
going
out
with
him
then
asked
Parvati
wide-eyed
oh
yes
didn't
you
know
said
Harmione
with
a
most
un-hermione-ish
giggle
no
said
Parvati
looking
positively
agog
at
thi
s
piece
of
gossip
wow
you
like
your
Quidditch
players
don't
you
first
Krum
then
McLaggen
i
like
really
good
Quidditch
players
Hermione
corrected
her
still
smiling
well
see
you
got
to
go
and
get
ready
for
the
party
she
left
at
once
Lavender
and
Parvati
put
their
heads
together
to
discuss
this
new
development
with
everything
they
had
ever
heard
about
McLaggen
and
all
they
had
ever
guessed
about
Hermione
ron
looked
strangely
blank
and
said
nothing
harry
was
left
to
ponder
in
silence
the
depths
to
which
girls
would
sink
to
get
revenge
when
he
arrived
in
the
entrance
hall
at
eight
o'clock
that
night
he
found
an
unusually
large
number
of
girls
lurking
there
all
of
whom
seemed
to
be
staring
at
him
resentfully
as
he
approached
Luna
she
was
wearing
a
set
of
spangled
silver
robes
that
were
attracting
a
certain
amount
of
giggles
from
the
onlookers
but
otherwise
she
looked
quite
nice
harry
was
glad
in
any
case
that
she
had
left
off
her
radish
earrings
her
butterbeer
cork
necklace
and
her
Spectrespecs
hi
he
said
shall
we
get
going
then
oh
yes
she
said
happily
where
is
the
party
slughorn's
office
said
Harry
leading
her
up
the
marble
staircase
away
from
all
the
staring
and
muttering
did
you
hear
there's
supposed
to
be
a
vampire
coming
rufus
Scrimgeour
asked
Luna
i
what
said
Harry
disconcerted
you
mean
the
Minister
of
Magic
yes
he's
a
vampire
said
Luna
matter-of-factly
father
wrote
a
very
long
article
about
it
when
Scrimgeour
first
took
over
from
Cornelius
Fudge
but
he
was
forced
not
to
publish
by
somebody
from
the
Ministry
obviously
they
didn't
want
the
truth
to
get
out
harry
who
thought
it
most
unlikely
that
Rufus
Scrimgeour
was
a
vampire
but
who
was
used
to
Luna
repeating
her
father's
bizarre
views
as
though
they
were
fact
did
not
reply
they
were
already
approaching
slughorn's
office
and
the
sounds
of
laughter
music
and
loud
conversation
were
growing
louder
with
every
step
they
took
whether
it
had
been
built
that
way
or
because
he
had
used
magical
trickery
to
make
it
so
slughorn's
office
was
much
larger
than
the
usual
teacher's
study
the
ceiling
and
walls
had
been
draped
with
emerald
crimson
and
gold
hangings
so
that
it
looked
as
though
they
were
all
inside
a
vast
tent
the
room
was
crowded
and
stuffy
and
bathed
in
the
red
light
cast
by
an
ornate
golden
lamp
dangling
from
the
center
of
the
ceiling
in
which
real
fairies
were
fluttering
each
a
brilliant
speck
of
light
loud
singing
accompanied
by
what
sounded
like
mandolins
issued
from
a
distant
corner
a
haze
of
pipe
smoke
hung
over
several
elderly
warlocks
deep
in
conversation
and
a
number
of
house-elves
were
negotiating
their
way
squeakily
through
the
forest
of
knees
obscured
by
the
heavy
silver
platters
of
food
they
were
bearing
so
that
they
looked
like
little
roving
tables
harry
m'boy
boomed
Slughorn
almost
as
soon
as
Harry
and
Luna
had
squeezed
in
through
the
door
come
in
come
in
so
many
people
i'd
like
you
to
meet
slughorn
was
wearing
a
tasseled
velvet
hat
to
match
his
smoking
jacket
gripping
harry's
arm
so
tightly
he
might
have
been
hoping
to
Disapparate
with
him
Slughorn
led
him
purposefully
into
the
party
Harry
seized
luna's
hand
and
dragged
her
along
with
him
harry
i'd
like
you
to
meet
Eldred
Worple
an
old
student
of
mine
author
of
Blood
Brothers
My
L
ife
Amongst
the
Vampires
and
of
course
his
friend
Sanguini
worple
who
was
a
small
stout
bespectacled
man
grabbed
harry's
hand
and
shook
it
enthusiastically
the
vampire
Sanguini
who
was
tall
and
emaciated
with
dark
shadows
under
his
eyes
merely
nodded
he
looked
rather
bored
a
gaggle
of
girls
was
standing
close
to
him
looking
curious
and
excited
harry
Potter
I
am
simply
delighted
said
Worple
peering
shortsightedly
up
into
harry's
face
i
was
saying
to
Professor
Slughorn
only
the
other
day
Where
is
the
biography
of
Harry
Potter
for
which
we
have
all
been
waiting
er
said
Harry
were
you
just
as
modest
as
Horace
described
said
Worple
but
seri-ously
his
manner
changed
it
became
suddenly
businesslike
I
would
be
delighted
to
write
it
myself
people
are
craving
to
know
more
about
you
dear
boy
craving
if
you
were
prepared
to
grant
me
a
few
interviews
say
in
four
or
five-hour
sessions
why
we
could
have
the
book
finished
within
months
and
all
with
very
little
effort
on
your
part
I
assure
you
ask
Sanguini
here
if
it
isn't
quite
Sanguini
stay
here
added
Worple
suddenly
stern
for
the
vampire
had
been
edging
toward
the
nearby
group
of
girls
a
rather
hungry
look
in
his
eye
here
have
a
pasty
said
Worple
seizing
one
from
a
passing
elf
and
stuffing
it
into
sanguini's
hand
before
turning
his
attention
back
to
Harry
my
dear
boy
the
gold
you
could
make
you
have
no
idea
i'm
definitely
not
interested
said
Harry
firmly
and
i've
just
seen
a
friend
of
mine
sorry
he
pulled
Luna
after
him
into
the
crowd
he
had
indeed
just
seen
a
long
mane
of
brown
hair
disappear
between
what
looked
like
two
members
of
the
Weird
Sisters
hermione
hermione
harry
there
you
are
thank
goodness
hi
Luna
what's
happened
to
you
asked
Harry
for
Hermione
looked
distinctly
disheveled
rather
as
though
she
had
just
fought
her
way
out
of
a
thicket
of
devil's
Snare
oh
i've
just
escaped
I
mean
i've
just
left
Cormac
she
said
under
the
mistletoe
she
added
in
explanation
as
Harry
continued
to
look
questioningly
at
her
serves
you
right
for
coming
with
him
he
told
her
severely
i
thought
he'd
annoy
Ron
most
said
Hermione
dispassion-ately
i
debated
for
a
while
about
Zacharias
Smith
but
I
thought
on
the
whole
you
considered
Smith
said
Harry
revoked
yes
I
did
and
i'm
starting
to
wish
i'd
chosen
him
McLaggen
makes
Grawp
look
a
gentleman
let's
go
this
way
we'll
be
able
to
see
him
coming
he's
so
tall
the
three
of
them
made
their
way
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
scooping
up
goblets
of
mead
on
the
way
realizing
too
late
that
Professor
Trelawney
was
standing
there
alone
hello
said
Luna
politely
to
Professor
Trelawney
good
evening
my
dear
said
Professor
Trelawney
focusing
upon
Luna
with
some
difficulty
harry
could
smell
cooking
sherry
again
i
haven't
seen
you
in
my
classes
lately
no
i've
got
Firenze
this
year
said
Luna
oh
of
course
said
Professor
Trelawney
with
an
angry
drunken
titter
or
Dobbin
as
I
prefer
to
think
of
him
you
would
have
thought
would
you
not
that
now
I
am
returned
to
the
school
Professor
Dumbledore
might
have
got
rid
of
the
horse
but
no
we
share
classes
it's
an
insult
frankly
an
insult
do
you
know
professor
Trelawney
seemed
too
tipsy
to
have
recognized
Harry
under
cover
of
her
furious
criticisms
of
Firenze
Harry
drew
closer
to
Hermione
and
said
Let
s
get
something
straight
are
you
planning
to
tell
Ron
that
you
interfered
at
Keeper
tryouts
hermione
raised
her
eyebrows
do
you
really
think
i'd
stoop
that
low
harry
looked
at
her
shrewdly
hermione
if
you
can
ask
McLaggen
there's
a
difference
said
Hermione
with
dignity
i've
got
no
plans
to
tell
Ron
anything
about
what
might
or
might
not
have
happened
at
Keeper
tryouts
good
said
Harry
fervently
because
he'll
just
fall
apart
again
and
we'll
lose
the
next
match
quidditch
said
Hermione
angrily
is
that
all
boys
care
about
cormac
hasn't
asked
me
one
single
question
about
myself
no
i've
just
been
treated
to
A
Hundred
Great
Saves
Made
by
Cormac
McLaggen
nonstop
ever
since
oh
no
here
he
comes
she
moved
so
fast
it
was
as
though
she
had
Disapparated
one
moment
she
was
there
the
next
she
had
squeezed
between
two
guffawing
witches
and
vanished
seen
Hermione
asked
McLaggen
forcing
his
way
through
the
throng
a
minute
later
no
sorry
said
Harry
and
he
turned
quickly
to
join
in
luna's
conversation
forgetting
for
a
split
second
to
whom
she
was
talking
harry
Potter
said
Professor
Trelawney
in
deep
vibrant
tones
noticing
him
for
the
first
time
oh
hello
said
Harry
unenthusiastically
my
dear
boy
she
said
in
a
very
carrying
whisper
the
rumors
the
stories
the
Chosen
One
of
course
I
have
known
for
a
very
long
time
the
omens
were
never
good
Harry
but
why
have
you
not
returned
to
Divination
for
you
of
all
people
the
subject
is
of
the
utmost
importance
ah
Sybi
l
l
we
all
think
our
subject's
most
important
said
a
loud
voice
and
Slughorn
appeared
at
Professor
Trelawney
s
other
side
his
face
very
red
his
velvet
hat
a
little
askew
a
glass
of
mead
in
one
hand
and
an
enormous
mince
pie
in
the
other
but
I
don't
t
hink
i've
ever
known
such
a
natural
at
Potions
said
Slughorn
re-garding
Harry
with
a
fond
if
bloodshot
eye
instinctive
you
know
like
his
mother
i've
only
ever
taught
a
few
with
this
kind
of
ability
I
can
tell
you
that
Sybi
l
l
why
even
Severus
And
to
harry's
horror
Slughorn
threw
out
an
arm
and
seemed
to
scoop
Snape
out
of
thin
air
toward
them
stop
skulking
and
come
and
join
us
Severus
hiccuped
Slughorn
happily
i
was
just
talking
about
harry's
exceptional
po-tion-making
some
credit
must
go
to
you
of
course
you
taught
him
for
five
years
trapped
with
Slughorns
arm
around
his
shoulders
Snape
looked
down
his
hooked
nose
at
Harry
his
black
eyes
narrowed
funny
I
never
had
the
impression
that
I
managed
to
teach
Potter
anything
at
all
well
then
it's
natural
ability
shouted
Slughorn
you
should
have
seen
what
he
gave
me
first
lesson
Draught
of
Living
Death
never
had
a
student
produce
finer
on
a
first
attempt
I
don't
think
even
you
Severus
really
said
Snape
quietly
his
eyes
still
boring
into
Harry
who
felt
a
certain
disquiet
the
last
thing
he
wanted
was
for
Snape
to
start
investigating
the
source
of
his
newfound
brilliance
at
Potions
remind
me
what
other
subjects
you're
taking
Harry
asked
Slughorn
defense
Against
the
D
ark
Arts
Charms
Transfiguration
Herbology
all
the
subjects
required
in
short
for
an
Auror
said
Snap
e
with
the
faintest
sneer
yeah
well
that's
what
i'd
like
to
do
said
Harry
defiantly
and
a
great
one
you'll
make
too
boomed
Slughorn
i
don't
think
you
should
be
an
Auror
Harry
said
Luna
unex
pectedly
everybody
looked
at
her
the
Aurors
are
part
of
the
Rotfang
Conspiracy
I
thought
everyone
knew
that
they're
planning
to
bring
down
the
Ministry
of
Magic
from
within
using
a
c
om
bination
of
Dark
Magic
and
gum
disease
harry
inhaled
half
his
mead
up
his
nose
as
he
started
to
lau
gh
really
it
had
been
worth
bringing
Luna
just
for
this
emerging
from
his
goblet
coughing
sopping
wet
but
still
grinning
he
saw
something
calculated
to
raise
his
spirits
even
higher
Draco
Malf
o
y
being
dragged
by
the
ear
toward
them
by
Argus
Filch
professor
Slughorn
wheezed
Filch
his
jowls
aquiver
and
the
maniacal
light
of
mischief-detection
in
his
bulging
eyes
I
discovered
this
boy
lurking
in
an
upstairs
corridor
he
claims
to
have
been
invited
to
your
party
and
to
have
been
delayed
in
setting
out
did
you
issue
him
with
an
invitation
malfoy
pulled
himself
free
of
Filchs
grip
looking
furious
all
right
I
wasn't
invited
he
said
angrily
i
was
trying
to
gate
crash
happy
no
i'm
not
said
Filch
a
statement
at
complete
odds
with
the
glee
on
his
face
you're
in
trouble
you
are
didn't
the
headma
ster
say
that
nighttime
prowling
s
out
unless
you've
got
permission
didn't
he
eh
that's
all
right
Argus
that's
all
right
said
Slughorn
waving
it
nd
it's
Christmas
and
it's
not
a
crime
to
want
to
come
to
a
party
just
this
once
we'll
forget
any
punishment
you
may
stay
Draco
fil
ich's
expression
of
outraged
disappointment
was
perfectly
pre
di
c
t
able
but
why
Harry
wondered
watching
him
did
Malfoy
look
almost
equally
unhappy
and
why
was
Snape
looking
at
mal-foy
as
though
both
angry
and
was
it
p
ossible
a
lit
tl
afraid
but
almost
before
Harry
had
registered
what
he
had
seen
Filch
had
turned
and
shuffled
away
muttering
under
his
breath
Malfoy
h
ad
composed
his
face
into
a
smile
and
was
thanking
Slughorn
for
his
generosity
and
snape's
face
was
smoothly
inscrutable
again
it's
nothing
nothing
said
Slughorn
waving
away
malfoy's
t
hanks
i
did
know
your
grandfather
after
all
he
always
spoke
very
highly
of
you
sir
said
Malfoy
quickly
said
you
were
the
best
potion-maker
he'd
ever
known
harry
stared
at
Malfoy
it
was
not
the
sucking-up
that
intrigued
him
he
had
watched
Malfoy
do
that
to
Snape
for
a
long
time
it
was
the
fact
that
Malfoy
did
after
all
look
a
little
ill
this
was
the
first
time
he
had
seen
Malfoy
close
up
for
ages
he
now
saw
that
Malfoy
had
dark
shadows
under
his
eyes
and
a
distinctly
grayish
tinge
to
his
skin
i'd
like
a
word
with
you
Draco
said
Snape
suddenly
now
Severus
said
Slughorn
hiccuping
again
it's
Christ
mas
do
n't
be
too
hard
i
am
his
Head
of
House
and
I
shall
decide
how
hard
or
other-wise
to
be
said
Snape
curtly
follow
me
Draco
they
left
Snape
leading
the
way
Malfoy
looking
resentful
harry
stood
there
for
a
moment
irresolute
then
said
i'll
be
back
in
a
bit
Luna
er
bathroom
all
right
she
said
cheerfully
and
he
thought
he
heard
her
as
he
hurried
off
into
the
crowd
resume
the
subject
of
the
Rotfang
Conspiracy
with
Professor
Trelawney
who
seemed
sincerely
in
terested
it
was
easy
once
out
of
the
party
to
pull
his
Invisibility
Cloak
out
of
his
pocket
and
throw
it
over
himself
for
the
corridor
was
quite
deserted
what
was
more
difficult
was
finding
Snape
and
Malfoy
harry
ran
down
the
corridor
the
noise
of
his
feet
masked
by
the
music
and
loud
talk
still
issuing
from
slughorn's
office
behind
him
perhaps
Snape
had
taken
Malfoy
to
his
office
in
the
dungeons
or
perhaps
he
was
escorting
him
back
to
the
Slyt
herin
common
room
harry
pressed
his
ear
against
door
after
door
as
he
dashed
down
the
corridor
until
with
a
great
jolt
of
excitement
he
crouched
down
to
the
keyhole
of
the
last
classroom
in
the
corridor
and
heard
voices
cannot
afford
mistakes
Draco
because
if
you
are
expelled
i
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
it
all
right
i
hope
you
are
telling
the
truth
because
it
was
both
clumsy
a
nd
foolish
already
you
are
suspected
of
having
a
hand
in
it
who
suspects
me
said
Malfoy
angrily
for
the
last
time
I
didn't
do
it
okay
that
Bell
girl
must
ve
had
an
enemy
no
on
e
knows
about
don't
look
at
me
like
that
i
know
what
you're
do-ing
i'm
not
stupid
but
it
won't
work
I
can
stop
you
there
was
a
pause
and
then
Snape
said
quietly
Ah
aunt
Bellatrix
has
been
teaching
you
Occlumency
I
see
what
thoughts
are
you
trying
to
conceal
from
your
master
Draco
i'm
not
trying
to
conceal
anything
from
him
I
just
don't
want
you
butting
in
harry
pressed
his
ear
still
more
closely
against
the
keyhole
what
had
happened
to
make
Malfoy
speak
to
Snape
like
this
Snape
toward
whom
he
had
always
shown
respect
even
liking
so
that
is
why
you
have
been
avoiding
me
this
term
you
have
feared
my
interference
you
realize
that
had
anybody
else
failed
to
come
to
my
office
when
I
had
told
them
repeatedly
to
be
there
Draco
so
put
me
in
detention
report
me
to
Dumbledore
jeered
Malfoy
there
was
another
pause
then
Snape
said
You
know
perfectly
well
that
I
do
not
wish
to
do
either
of
those
things
you'd
better
stop
telling
me
to
come
to
your
office
then
listen
to
me
said
Snape
his
voice
so
low
now
that
Harry
had
to
push
his
ear
very
hard
against
the
keyhole
to
hear
i
am
trying
to
help
you
i
swore
to
your
mother
I
would
protect
you
i
made
the
Unbreakable
Vow
Draco
looks
like
you'll
have
to
break
it
then
because
I
don't
need
your
protection
it's
my
job
he
gave
it
to
me
and
i'm
doing
it
i've
got
a
plan
and
it's
going
to
work
it's
just
taking
a
bit
longer
than
I
thought
it
would
what
is
your
plan
it's
none
of
your
business
if
you
tell
me
what
you
are
trying
to
do
I
can
assist
you
i
have
all
the
assistance
I
need
thanks
i'm
not
alone
you
were
certainly
alone
tonight
which
was
foolish
in
the
ex-treme
wandering
the
corridors
without
lookouts
or
backup
these
are
elementary
mistakes
i
would've
had
Crabbe
and
Goyle
with
me
if
you
hadn't
put
them
in
detention
keep
your
voice
down
spat
Snape
for
Malfoy
s
voice
had
risen
excitedly
if
your
friends
Crabbe
and
Goyle
intend
to
pass
their
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
owl
this
time
around
they
will
need
to
work
a
little
harder
than
they
are
doing
at
pres
what
does
it
matter
said
Malfoy
defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
its
all
just
a
joke
isn't
it
an
act
like
any
of
us
need
pro-tecting
against
the
Dark
Arts
it
is
an
act
that
is
crucial
to
success
Draco
said
Snape
where
do
you
think
I
would
have
been
all
these
years
if
I
had
not
known
how
to
act
now
listen
to
me
you
are
being
incautious
wandering
around
at
night
getting
yourself
caught
and
if
you
are
placing
your
reliance
in
assistants
like
Crabbe
and
Goyle
they're
not
the
only
ones
i've
got
other
people
on
my
side
better
people
then
why
not
confide
in
me
and
I
can
i
know
what
you're
up
to
you
want
to
steal
my
glory
there
was
another
pause
then
Snape
said
coldly
You
are
speaking
like
a
child
i
quite
understand
that
your
fathers
capture
and
imprisonment
has
upset
you
but
harry
had
barely
a
second
s
warning
he
heard
malfoy's
footsteps
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
and
flung
himself
out
of
the
way
just
as
it
burst
open
malfoy
was
striding
away
down
the
corridor
past
the
open
door
of
Slughorns
office
around
the
distant
corner
and
out
of
sight
hardly
daring
to
breathe
Harry
remained
crouched
down
as
Snape
emerged
slowly
from
the
classroom
his
expression
unfath-omable
he
returned
to
the
party
harry
remained
on
the
floor
hid-den
beneath
the
cloak
his
mind
racing
chapter
AVeryFrosty
Christmas
so
Snape
was
offering
to
help
him
he
was
definitely
offering
to
help
him
if
you
ask
that
once
more
said
Harry
i'm
going
to
stick
this
sprout
i'm
only
checking
said
Ron
they
were
standing
alone
at
the
burrow's
kitchen
sink
peeling
a
mountain
of
sprouts
for
Mrs
weasley
snow
was
drifting
past
the
window
in
front
of
them
yes
Snape
was
offering
to
help
him
said
Harry
he
said
he'd
promised
malfoy's
mother
to
protect
him
that
he'd
made
an
un-breakable
Oath
or
something
an
Unbreakable
Vow
said
Ron
looking
stunned
nah
he
can't
have
are
you
sure
yes
i'm
sure
said
Harry
why
what
does
it
mean
well
you
can't
break
an
Unbreakable
Vow
i'd
worked
that
much
out
for
myself
funnily
enough
what
happens
if
you
break
it
then
you
die
said
Ron
simply
fred
and
George
tried
to
get
me
to
make
one
when
I
was
about
five
i
nearly
did
too
I
was
holding
hands
with
Fred
and
everything
when
Dad
found
us
he
went
mental
said
Ron
with
a
reminiscent
gleam
in
his
eyes
only
time
i've
ever
seen
Dad
as
angry
as
Mum
Fred
reckons
his
left
but-tock
has
never
been
the
same
since
yeah
well
passing
over
fred's
left
buttock
i
beg
your
pardon
said
fred's
voice
as
the
twins
entered
the
kitchen
aaah
George
look
at
this
they're
using
knives
and
everything
bless
them
i'll
be
seventeen
in
two
and
a
bit
months
time
said
Ron
grumpily
and
then
i'll
be
able
to
do
it
by
magic
but
meanwhile
said
George
sitting
down
at
the
kitchen
table
and
putting
his
feet
up
on
it
we
can
enjoy
watching
you
demon-strate
the
correct
use
of
a
whoops-a-daisy
you
made
me
do
that
said
Ron
angrily
sucking
his
cut
thumb
you
wait
when
i'm
seventeen
i'm
sure
you'll
dazzle
us
all
with
hitherto
unsuspected
magical
skills
yawned
Fred
and
speaking
of
hitherto
unsuspected
skills
Ronald
said
George
what
is
this
we
hear
from
Ginny
about
you
and
a
young
lady
called
unless
our
information
is
faulty
Lavender
Brown
ron
turned
a
little
pink
but
did
not
look
displeased
as
he
turned
back
to
the
sprouts
mind
your
own
business
what
a
snappy
retort
said
Fred
i
really
don't
know
how
you
think
of
them
no
what
we
wanted
to
know
was
how
did
it
happen
what
d'you
mean
did
she
have
an
accident
or
something
what
well
how
did
she
sustain
such
extensive
brain
damage
care-ful
now
mrs
weasley
entered
the
room
just
in
time
to
see
Ron
throw
the
sprout
knife
at
Fred
who
had
turned
it
into
a
paper
airplane
with
one
lazy
flick
of
his
wand
ron
she
said
furiously
don't
you
ever
let
me
see
you
throw-ing
knives
again
i
wont
said
Ron
let
you
see
he
added
under
his
breath
as
he
turned
back
to
the
sprout
mountain
fred
George
i'm
sorry
dears
but
Remus
is
arriving
tonight
so
Bill
will
have
to
squeeze
in
with
you
two
no
problem
said
George
Then
as
Charlie
isn't
coming
home
that
just
leaves
Harry
and
Ron
in
the
attic
and
if
Fleur
shares
with
Ginny
that'll
make
ginny's
Christmas
muttered
Fred
everyone
should
be
comfortable
well
they'll
have
a
bed
anyway
said
Mrs
weasley
sounding
slightly
harassed
percy
definitely
not
showing
his
ugly
face
then
asked
Fred
mrs
weasley
turned
away
before
she
answered
no
he's
busy
I
expect
at
the
Ministry
or
he's
the
world's
biggest
prat
said
Fred
as
Mrs
weasley
left
the
kitchen
one
of
the
two
well
let's
get
going
then
George
what
are
you
two
up
to
asked
Ron
cant
you
help
us
with
these
sprouts
you
could
just
use
your
wand
and
then
we'll
be
free
too
no
I
don't
think
we
can
do
that
said
Fred
seriously
it's
very
character-building
stuff
learning
to
peel
sprouts
without
magic
makes
you
appreciate
how
difficult
it
is
for
Muggles
and
Squibs
and
if
you
want
people
to
help
you
Ron
added
George
throwing
the
paper
airplane
at
him
I
wouldn't
chuck
knives
at
them
just
a
little
hint
we're
off
to
the
village
there's
a
very
pretty
girl
working
in
the
paper
shop
who
thinks
my
card
tricks
are
some-thing
marvelous
almost
like
real
magic
gits
said
Ron
darkly
watching
Fred
and
George
setting
off
across
the
snowy
yard
would've
only
taken
them
ten
seconds
and
then
we
could've
gone
too
i
couldn't
said
Harry
i
promised
Dumbledore
I
wouldn't
wander
off
while
i'm
staying
here
oh
yeah
said
Ron
he
peeled
a
few
more
sprouts
and
then
said
Are
you
going
to
tell
Dumbledore
what
you
heard
Snape
and
Malfoy
saying
to
each
other
yep
said
Harry
i'm
going
to
tell
anyone
who
can
put
a
stop
to
it
and
Dumbledores
top
of
the
list
i
might
have
another
word
with
your
dad
too
pity
you
didn't
hear
what
Malfoys
actually
doing
though
i
couldn't
have
done
could
I
that
was
the
whole
point
he
was
refusing
to
tell
Snape
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
or
two
then
Ron
said
Course
you
know
what
they'll
all
say
dad
and
Dumbledore
and
all
of
them
they'll
say
Snape
isn't
really
trying
to
help
Malfoy
he
was
just
trying
to
find
out
what
malfoy's
up
to
they
didn't
hear
him
said
Harry
flatly
no
one's
that
good
an
actor
not
even
Snape
yeah
i'm
just
saying
though
said
Ron
harry
turned
to
face
him
frowning
you
think
i'm
right
though
yeah
I
do
said
Ron
hastily
seriously
I
do
but
they're
all
convinced
snape's
in
the
Order
aren't
they
harry
said
nothing
it
had
already
occurred
to
him
that
this
would
be
the
most
likely
objection
to
his
new
evidence
he
could
hear
Hermione
now
Obviously
Harry
he
was
pretending
to
offer
help
so
he
could
trick
Malfoy
into
telling
him
what
he's
doing
this
was
pure
imagination
however
as
he
had
had
no
opportu-nity
to
tell
Hermione
what
he
had
overheard
she
had
disappeared
from
slughorn's
party
before
he
returned
to
it
or
so
he
had
been
informed
by
an
irate
McLaggen
and
she
had
already
gone
to
bed
by
the
time
he
returned
to
the
common
room
as
he
and
Ron
had
left
for
the
Burrow
early
the
next
day
he
had
barely
had
time
to
wish
her
a
happy
Christmas
and
to
tell
her
that
he
had
some
very
important
news
when
they
got
back
from
the
holidays
he
was
not
entirely
sure
that
she
had
heard
him
though
Ron
and
Lavender
had
been
saying
a
thoroughly
nonverbal
good-bye
just
behind
him
at
the
time
still
even
Hermione
would
not
be
able
to
deny
one
thing
mal-foy
was
definitely
up
to
something
and
Snape
knew
it
so
Harry
felt
fully
justified
in
saying
I
told
you
so
which
he
had
done
sev-eral
times
to
Ron
already
harry
did
not
get
the
chance
to
speak
to
mr.
Weasley
who
was
working
very
long
hours
at
the
Ministry
until
Christmas
Eve
night
the
Weasleys
and
their
guests
were
sitting
in
the
living
room
which
Ginny
had
decorated
so
lavishly
that
it
was
rather
like
sitting
in
a
paper-chain
explosion
fred
George
Harry
and
Ron
were
the
only
ones
who
knew
that
the
angel
on
top
of
the
tree
was
actually
a
garden
gnome
that
had
bitten
Fred
on
the
ankle
as
hr
pulled
up
carrots
for
Christmas
dinner
stupefied
painted
gold
stuffed
into
a
miniature
tutu
and
with
small
wings
glued
to
il
s
back
it
glowered
down
at
them
all
the
ugliest
angel
Harry
had
ever
seen
with
a
large
bald
head
like
a
potato
and
rather
hairy
feet
they
were
all
supposed
to
be
listening
to
a
Christmas
broadcast
by
Mrs
weasleys
favorite
singer
Celestina
Warbeck
whose
voice
was
warbling
out
of
the
large
wooden
wireless
set
fleur
who
seemed
to
find
Celestina
very
dull
was
talking
so
loudly
in
the
corner
that
a
scowling
Mrs
weasley
kept
pointing
her
wand
at
the
volume
con-trol
so
that
Celestina
grew
louder
and
louder
under
cover
of
a
par-ticularly
jazzy
number
called
A
Cauldron
Full
of
Hot
Strong
Love
Fred
and
George
started
a
game
of
Exploding
Snap
with
Ginny
ron
kept
shooting
Bill
and
Fleur
covert
looks
as
though
hoping
to
pick
up
tips
meanwhile
Remus
Lupin
who
was
thinner
and
more
ragged-looking
than
ever
was
sitting
beside
the
fire
staring
into
its
depths
as
though
he
could
not
hear
Celestinas
voice
oh
come
and
stir
my
cauldron
and
if
you
do
it
right
i'll
boil
you
up
some
hot
strong
love
to
keep
you
warm
tonight
we
danced
to
this
when
we
were
eighteen
said
Mrs
weasley
wiping
her
eyes
on
her
knitting
do
you
remember
Arthur
mphf
said
mr.
Weasley
whose
head
had
been
nodding
over
the
satsuma
he
was
peeling
oh
yes
marvelous
tune
with
an
effort
he
sat
up
a
little
straighter
and
looked
around
at
Harry
who
was
sitting
next
to
him
sorry
about
this
he
said
jerking
his
head
toward
the
wireless
as
Celestina
broke
into
the
chorus
be
over
soon
no
problem
said
Harry
grinning
has
it
been
busy
at
the
Ministry
very
said
mr.
Weasley
i
wouldn't
mind
if
we
were
getting
anywhere
but
of
the
three
arrests
we've
made
in
the
last
couple
of
months
I
doubt
that
one
of
them
is
a
genuine
Death
Eater
only
don't
repeat
that
Harry
he
added
quickly
looking
much
more
awake
all
of
a
sudden
they're
not
still
holding
Stan
Shunpike
are
they
asked
Harry
i'm
afraid
so
said
mr.
Weasley
i
know
dumbledore's
tried
appealing
directly
to
Scrimgeour
about
Stan
i
mean
anybody
who
has
actually
interviewed
him
agrees
that
he's
about
as
much
a
Death
Eater
as
this
satsuma
but
the
top
levels
want
to
look
as
though
they're
making
some
progress
and
three
arrests
sounds
better
than
three
mistaken
arrests
and
releases
but
again
this
is
all
top
secret
i
won't
say
anything
said
Harry
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
wondering
how
best
to
embark
on
what
he
wanted
to
say
as
he
marshaled
his
thoughts
Celestina
Warbeck
began
a
ballad
called
You
Charmed
the
Heart
Right
Out
of
Me
mr.
Weasley
you
know
what
I
told
you
at
the
station
when
we
were
setting
off
for
school
i
checked
Harry
said
mr.
Weasley
at
once
i
went
and
searched
the
Malfoys
house
there
was
nothing
either
broken
or
whole
that
shouldn't
have
been
there
yeah
I
know
I
saw
in
the
Prophet
that
you'd
looked
but
this
is
something
different
well
something
more
and
he
told
mr.
Weasley
everything
he
had
overheard
between
malfoy
and
Snape
As
Harry
spoke
he
saw
lupin's
head
turn
a
lit-tle
toward
him
taking
in
every
word
when
he
had
finished
there
was
silence
except
for
celestina's
crooning
oh
my
poor
heart
where
has
it
gone
it's
left
me
for
a
spell
has
it
occurred
to
you
Harry
said
mr.
Weasley
that
Snape
was
simply
pretending
pretending
to
offer
help
so
that
he
could
find
out
what
malfoy's
up
to
said
Harry
quickly
yeah
I
thought
you'd
say
that
but
how
do
we
know
it
isn't
our
business
to
know
said
Lupin
unexpectedly
he
had
turned
his
back
on
the
fire
now
and
faced
Harry
across
mr.
Weasley
it's
Dumbledores
business
dumbledore
trusts
Severus
and
that
ought
to
be
good
enough
for
all
of
us
but
said
Harry
just
say
just
say
Dumbledores
wrong
about
Snape
people
have
said
it
many
times
it
comes
down
to
whether
or
not
you
trust
Dumbledores
judgment
i
do
therefore
I
trust
Severus
but
Dumbledore
can
make
mistakes
argued
Harry
he
says
it
himself
and
you
he
looked
Lupin
straight
in
the
eye
do
you
honestly
like
Snape
i
neither
like
nor
dislike
Severus
said
Lupin
no
Harry
I
am
speaking
the
truth
he
added
as
Harry
pulled
a
skeptical
expres-sion
we
shall
never
be
bosom
friends
perhaps
after
all
that
hap-pened
between
James
and
Sirius
and
Severus
there
is
too
much
bitterness
there
but
I
do
not
forget
that
during
the
year
I
taught
at
Hogwarts
Severus
made
the
Wolfsbane
Potion
for
me
every
month
made
it
perfectly
so
that
I
did
not
have
to
suffer
as
I
usu-ally
do
at
the
full
moon
but
he
accidentally
let
it
slip
that
you're
a
werewolf
so
you
had
to
leave
said
Harry
angrily
lupin
shrugged
the
news
would
have
leaked
out
anyway
we
both
know
he
wanted
my
job
but
he
could
have
wreaked
much
worse
damage
on
me
by
tampering
with
the
potion
he
kept
me
healthy
i
must
be
grateful
maybe
he
didn't
dare
mess
with
the
potion
with
Dumbledore
watching
him
said
Harry
you
are
determined
to
hate
him
Harry
said
Lupin
with
a
faint
smile
and
I
understand
with
James
as
your
father
with
sir-ius
as
your
godfather
you
have
inherited
an
old
prejudice
by
all
means
tell
Dumbledore
what
you
have
told
Arthur
and
me
but
do
not
expect
him
to
share
your
view
of
the
matter
do
not
even
expect
him
to
be
surprised
by
what
you
tell
him
it
might
have
been
on
dumbledore's
orders
that
Severus
questioned
Draco
and
now
you've
torn
it
quite
apart
i'll
thank
you
to
give
back
my
heart
celestina
ended
her
song
on
a
very
long
high-pitched
note
and
loud
applause
issued
out
of
the
wireless
which
Mrs
weasley
joined
in
with
enthusiastically
eez
eet
over
said
Fleur
loudly
thank
goodness
what
an
orrible
shall
we
have
a
nightcap
then
asked
mr.
Weasley
loudly
leaping
to
his
feet
who
wants
eggnog
what
have
you
been
up
to
lately
harry
asked
Lupin
as
Mr
Weasley
bustled
off
to
fetch
the
eggnog
and
everybody
else
stretched
and
broke
into
conversation
oh
i've
been
underground
said
Lupin
almost
literally
that's
why
I
haven't
been
able
to
write
Harry
sending
letters
to
you
would
have
been
something
of
a
giveaway
what
do
you
mean
i've
been
living
among
my
fellows
my
equals
said
Lupin
werewolves
he
added
at
Harrys
look
of
incomprehension
nearly
all
of
them
are
on
voldemort's
side
dumbledore
wanted
a
spy
and
here
I
was
ready-made
he
sounded
a
little
bitter
and
perhaps
realized
it
for
he
smiled
more
warmly
as
he
went
on
I
am
not
complaining
it
is
necessary
work
and
who
can
do
it
better
than
I
however
it
has
been
difficult
gaining
their
trust
i
bear
the
unmistakable
signs
of
having
tried
to
live
among
wizards
you
see
whereas
they
have
shunned
normal
society
and
live
on
the
margins
stealing
and
sometimes
killing
to
eat
how
come
they
like
Voldemort
they
think
that
under
his
rule
they
will
have
a
better
life
said
Lupin
and
it
is
hard
to
argue
with
Greyback
out
there
who's
Greyback
you
haven't
heard
of
him
lupin's
hands
closed
convulsively
in
his
lap
fenrir
Greyback
is
perhaps
the
most
savage
werewolf
alive
today
he
regards
it
as
his
mission
in
life
to
bite
and
to
conta-minate
as
many
people
as
possible
he
wants
to
create
enough
were-wolves
to
overcome
the
wizards
voldemort
has
promised
him
prey
in
return
for
his
services
greyback
specializes
in
children
bite
them
young
he
says
and
raise
them
away
from
their
parents
raise
them
to
hate
normal
wizards
voldemort
has
threatened
to
unleash
him
upon
people's
sons
and
daughters
it
is
a
threat
that
usually
produces
good
results
lupin
paused
and
then
said
It
was
Greyback
who
bit
me
what
said
Harry
astonished
when
when
you
were
a
kid
you
mean
yes
my
father
had
offended
him
i
did
not
know
for
a
very
long
time
the
identity
of
the
werewolf
who
had
attacked
me
I
even
felt
pity
for
him
thinking
that
he
had
had
no
control
know-ing
by
then
how
it
felt
to
transform
but
Greyback
is
not
like
that
at
the
full
moon
he
positions
himself
close
to
victims
ensuring
that
he
is
near
enough
to
strike
he
plans
it
all
and
this
is
the
man
Voldemort
is
using
to
marshal
the
werewolves
i
cannot
pretend
that
my
particular
brand
of
reasoned
argument
is
making
much
headway
against
greyback's
insistence
that
we
werewolves
deserve
blood
that
we
ought
to
revenge
ourselves
on
normal
people
but
you
are
normal
said
Harry
fiercely
you've
just
got
a
a
problem
lupin
burst
out
laughing
sometimes
you
remind
me
a
lot
of
James
he
called
it
my
furry
little
problem
in
company
many
people
were
under
the
impression
that
I
owned
a
badly
behaved
rabbit
he
accepted
a
glass
of
eggnog
from
mr.
Weasley
with
a
word
of
thanks
looking
slightly
more
cheerful
Harry
meanwhile
felt
a
rush
of
excitement
This
last
mention
of
his
father
had
reminded
him
that
there
was
something
he
had
been
looking
forward
to
ask-ing
Lupin
have
you
ever
heard
of
someone
called
the
Half-Blood
Prince
the
Half-Blood
what
prince
said
Harry
watching
him
closely
for
signs
of
recogni-tion
there
are
no
Wizarding
princes
said
Lupin
now
smiling
is
this
a
title
you
re
thinking
of
adopting
i
should
have
thought
be-ing
the
Chosen
One
would
be
enough
it's
nothing
to
do
with
me
said
Harry
indignantly
the
Half-Blood
Prince
is
someone
who
used
to
go
to
Hogwarts
i've
got
his
old
Potions
book
he
wrote
spells
all
over
it
spells
he
invented
one
of
them
was
Levicorpus
oh
that
one
had
a
great
vogue
during
my
time
at
Hogwarts
said
Lupin
reminiscently
there
were
a
few
months
in
my
fifth
year
when
you
couldn't
move
for
being
hoisted
into
the
air
by
your
ankle
my
dad
used
it
said
Harry
i
saw
him
in
the
Pensieve
he
used
it
on
Snape
he
tried
to
sound
casual
as
though
this
was
a
throwaway
com-ment
of
no
real
importance
but
he
was
not
sure
he
had
achieved
the
right
effect
Lupins
smile
was
a
little
too
understanding
yes
he
said
but
he
wasn't
the
only
one
as
I
say
it
was
very
popular
you
know
how
these
spells
come
and
go
but
it
sounds
like
it
was
invented
while
you
were
at
school
Harry
persisted
not
necessarily
said
Lupin
jinxes
go
in
and
out
of
fashion
like
everything
else
he
looked
into
harry's
face
and
then
said
quietly
James
was
a
pureblood
Harry
and
I
promise
you
he
never
asked
us
to
call
him
Prince
abandoning
pretense
Harry
said
And
it
wasn't
Sirius
or
you
definitely
not
oh.
Harry
stared
into
the
fire
i
just
thought
well
he's
helped
me
out
a
lot
in
Potions
classes
the
Prince
has
how
old
is
this
book
Harry
i
dunno
i've
never
checked
well
perhaps
that
will
give
you
some
clue
as
to
when
the
Prince
was
at
Hogwarts
said
Lupin
shortly
after
this
Fleur
decided
to
imitate
Celestina
singing
A
Cauldron
Full
of
Hot
Strong
Love
which
was
taken
by
everyone
once
they
had
glimpsed
Mrs
weasley's
expression
to
be
the
cue
to
go
to
bed
harry
and
Ron
climbed
all
the
way
up
to
ron's
attic
bedroom
where
a
camp
bed
had
been
added
for
Harry
ron
fell
asleep
almost
immediately
but
Harry
delved
into
his
trunk
and
pulled
out
his
copy
of
Advanced
Potion-Making
before
getting
into
bed
there
he
turned
its
pages
searching
until
he
finally
found
at
the
front
of
the
book
the
date
that
it
had
been
pub-lished
it
was
nearly
fifty
years
old
neither
his
father
nor
his
father's
friends
had
been
at
Hogwarts
fifty
years
ago
feeling
disappointed
Harry
threw
the
book
back
into
his
trunk
turned
off
the
lamp
and
rolled
over
thinking
of
werewolves
and
Snape
Stan
Shunpike
and
the
Half-Blood
Prince
and
finally
falling
into
an
uneasy
sleep
full
of
creeping
shadows
and
the
cries
of
bitten
children
she's
got
to
be
joking
harry
woke
with
a
start
to
find
a
bulging
stocking
lying
over
the
end
of
his
bed
he
put
on
his
glasses
and
looked
around
the
tiny
window
was
almost
completely
obscured
with
snow
and
in
front
of
it
Ron
was
sitting
bolt
upright
in
bed
and
examining
what
ap-peared
to
be
a
thick
gold
chain
what's
chat
asked
Harry
its
from
Lavender
said
Ron
sounding
revolted
She
earn
honestly
think
i'd
wear
harry
looked
more
closely
and
let
out
a
shout
of
laughter
Dan
gling
from
the
chain
in
large
gold
letters
were
the
words
my
sweetheart
nice
he
said
classy
you
should
definitely
wear
it
in
front
ol
Fred
and
George
if
you
tell
them
said
Ron
shoving
the
necklace
out
of
sight
under
his
pillow
I
I
Ill
stutter
at
me
said
Harry
grinning
come
on
would
I
how
could
she
think
i'd
like
something
like
that
though
ron
demanded
of
thin
air
looking
rather
shocked
well
think
back
said
Harry
have
you
ever
let
it
slip
that
you'd
like
to
go
out
in
public
with
the
words
My
Sweetheart
round
your
neck
well
we
don't
really
talk
much
said
Ron
it's
mainly
snogging
said
Harry
well
yeah
said
Ron
he
hesitated
a
moment
then
said
Is
Hermione
really
going
out
with
McLaggen
i
dunno
said
Harry
they
were
at
slughorn's
party
together
but
I
don't
think
it
went
that
well
ron
looked
slightly
more
cheerful
as
he
delved
deeper
into
his
stocking
harrys
presents
included
a
sweater
with
a
large
Golden
Snitch
worked
onto
the
front
hand-knitted
by
Mrs
weasley
a
large
box
of
Weasleys
Wizard
Wheezes
products
from
the
twins
and
a
slightly
damp
moldy-smelling
package
that
came
with
a
label
read-ing
To
Master
From
Kreacher
harry
stared
at
it
d'you
reckon
this
is
safe
to
open
he
asked
can't
be
anything
dangerous
all
our
mail's
still
being
searched
at
the
Ministry
replied
Ron
though
he
was
eyeing
the
parcel
suspiciously
i
didn't
think
of
giving
Kreacher
anything
do
people
usually
give
their
house-elves
Christmas
presents
asked
Harry
prodding
the
parcel
cautiously
hermione
would
said
Ron
but
let's
wait
and
see
what
it
is
before
you
start
feeling
guilty
a
moment
later
Harry
had
given
a
loud
yell
and
leapt
out
of
his
camp
bed
the
package
contained
a
large
number
of
maggots
nice
said
Ron
roaring
with
laughter
very
thoughtful
i'd
rather
have
them
than
that
necklace
said
Harry
which
sobered
Ron
up
at
once
everybody
was
wearing
new
sweaters
when
they
all
sat
down
for
Christmas
lunch
everyone
except
Fleur
on
whom
it
appeared
Mrs
weasley
had
not
wanted
to
waste
one
and
Mrs
weasley
herself
who
was
sporting
a
brand-new
midnight
blue
witch's
hat
glittering
with
what
looked
like
tiny
starlike
diamonds
and
a
spec-tacular
golden
necklace
fred
and
George
gave
them
to
me
aren't
they
beautiful
Well
we
find
we
appreciate
you
more
and
more
Mum
now
we're
washing
our
own
socks
said
George
waving
an
airy
hand
parsnips
Remus
harry
you've
got
a
maggot
in
your
hair
said
Ginny
cheerfully
leaning
across
the
table
to
pick
it
out
Harry
felt
goose
bumps
erupt
up
his
neck
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
maggot
ow
orrible
said
Fleur
with
an
affected
little
shudder
yes
isn't
it
said
Ron
gravy
Fleur
in
his
eagerness
to
help
her
he
knocked
the
gravy
boat
flying
Bill
waved
his
wand
and
the
gravy
soared
up
in
the
air
and
returned
meekly
to
the
boat
you
are
as
bad
as
zat
Tonks
said
Fleur
to
Ron
when
she
had
finished
kissing
Bill
in
thanks
she
is
always
knocking
i
invited
dear
Tonks
to
come
along
today
said
Mrs
weasley
setting
down
the
carrots
with
unnecessary
force
and
glaring
at
Fleur
but
she
wouldn't
come
have
you
spoken
to
her
lately
Remus
no
I
haven't
been
in
contact
with
anybody
very
much
said
Lupin
but
Tonks
has
got
her
own
family
to
go
to
hasn't
she
hmmm
said
Mrs
weasley
maybe
i
got
the
impression
she
was
planning
to
spend
Christmas
alone
actually
she
gave
Lupin
an
annoyed
look
as
though
it
was
all
his
fault
she
was
getting
Fleur
for
a
daughter-in-law
instead
of
Tonks
but
Harry
glancing
across
at
Fleur
who
was
now
feeding
Bill
bits
of
turkey
off
her
own
fork
thought
that
Mrs
weasley
was
fighting
a
long-lost
battle
he
was
however
reminded
of
a
question
he
had
with
regard
to
Tonks
and
who
better
to
ask
than
Lupin
the
man
who
knew
all
about
Patronuses
tonks's
Patronus
has
changed
its
form
he
told
him
snape
said
so
anyway
i
didn't
know
that
could
happen
why
would
your
Patronus
change
lupin
took
his
time
chewing
his
turkey
and
swallowing
before
saying
slowly
Sometimes
a
great
shock
an
emotional
up-heaval
it
looked
big
and
it
had
four
legs
said
Harry
struck
by
a
sud-den
thought
and
lowering
his
voice
hey
it
couldn't
be
arthur
said
Mrs
weasley
suddenly
she
had
risen
from
her
chair
her
hand
was
pressed
over
her
heart
and
she
was
staring
out
of
the
kitchen
window
arthur
it's
Percy
what
mr.
Weasley
looked
around
everybody
looked
quickly
at
the
window
Ginny
stood
up
for
a
better
look
there
sure
enough
was
Percy
Weasley
striding
across
the
snowy
yard
his
horn-rimmed
glasses
glinting
in
the
sunlight
he
was
not
however
alone
arthur
he's
he's
with
the
Minister
and
sure
enough
the
man
Harry
had
seen
in
the
Daily
Prophet
was
following
along
in
percy's
wake
limping
slightly
his
mane
of
graying
hair
and
his
black
cloak
flecked
with
snow
before
any
of
them
could
say
anything
before
mr.
and
Mrs
weasley
could
do
more
than
exchange
stunned
looks
the
back
door
opened
and
there
stood
Percy
there
was
a
moment's
painful
silence
then
Percy
said
rather
stiffly
Merry
Christmas
Mother
oh
Percy
said
Mrs
weasley
and
she
threw
herself
into
his
arms
rufus
Scrimgeour
paused
in
the
doorway
leaning
on
his
walk-ing
stick
and
smiling
as
he
observed
this
affecting
scene
you
must
forgive
this
intrusion
he
said
when
Mrs
weasley
looked
around
at
him
beaming
and
wiping
her
eyes
percy
and
I
were
in
the
vicinity
working
you
know
and
he
couldn't
re-sist
dropping
in
and
seeing
you
all
but
Percy
showed
no
sign
of
wanting
to
greet
any
of
the
rest
of
the
family
he
stood
poker-straight
and
awkward-looking
and
stared
over
everybody
else's
heads
mr.
Weasley
Fred
and
George
were
all
observing
him
stony-faced
please
come
in
sit
down
Minister
fluttered
Mrs
weasley
straightening
her
hat
have
a
little
purkey
or
some
tooding
mean
no
no
my
dear
Molly
said
Scrimgeour
harry
guessed
that
he
had
checked
her
name
with
Percy
before
they
entered
the
house
i
don't
want
to
intrude
wouldn't
be
here
at
all
if
Percy
hadn't
wanted
to
see
you
all
so
badly
oh
Perce
said
Mrs
weasley
tearfully
reaching
up
to
kiss
him
we've
only
looked
in
for
five
minutes
so
i'll
have
a
stroll
around
the
yard
while
you
catch
up
with
Percy
no
no
I
assure
you
I
don't
want
to
butt
in
well
if
anybody
cared
to
show
me
your
charming
garden
ah
that
young
man's
finished
why
doesn't
he
take
a
stroll
with
me
the
atmosphere
around
the
table
changed
perceptibly
every-body
looked
from
Scrimgeour
to
Harry
nobody
seemed
to
find
scrimgeour's
pretense
that
he
did
not
know
harry's
name
convincing
or
find
it
natural
that
he
should
be
chosen
to
accompany
the
Minister
around
the
garden
when
Ginny
Fleur
and
George
also
had
clean
plates
yeah
all
right
said
Harry
into
the
silence
he
was
not
fooled
for
all
scrimgeour's
talk
that
they
had
just
been
in
the
area
that
Percy
wanted
to
look
up
his
family
this
must
be
the
real
reason
that
they
had
come
so
that
Scrimgeour
could
speak
to
Harry
alone
it's
fine
he
said
quietly
as
he
passed
Lupin
who
had
half
risen
from
his
chair
fine
he
added
as
mr.
Weasley
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
wonderful
said
Scrimgeour
standing
back
to
let
Harry
pass
through
the
door
ahead
of
him
we'll
just
take
a
turn
around
the
garden
and
Percy
and
i'll
be
off
carry
on
everyone
harry
walked
across
the
yard
toward
the
Weasleys
overgrown
snow-covered
garden
Scrimgeour
limping
slightly
at
his
side
he
had
Harry
knew
been
Head
of
the
Auror
office
he
looked
tough
and
battle-scarred
very
different
from
portly
Fudge
in
his
bowler
hat
charming
said
Scrimgeour
stopping
at
the
garden
fence
and
looking
out
over
the
snowy
lawn
and
the
indistinguishable
plants
charming
harry
said
nothing
he
could
tell
that
Scrimgeour
was
watching
him
i've
wanted
to
meet
you
for
a
very
long
time
said
Scrimgeour
after
a
few
moments
did
you
know
that
no
said
Harry
truthfully
oh
yes
for
a
very
long
time
but
Dumbledore
has
been
very
protective
of
you
said
Scrimgeour
natural
of
course
natural
after
what
you've
been
through
especially
what
happened
at
the
Ministry
he
waited
for
Harry
to
say
something
but
Harry
did
not
oblige
so
he
went
on
I
have
been
hoping
for
an
occasion
to
talk
to
you
ever
since
I
gained
office
but
Dumbledore
has
most
under-standably
as
I
say
prevented
this
still
Harry
said
nothing
waiting
the
rumors
that
have
flown
around
said
Scrimgeour
well
of
course
we
both
know
how
these
stories
get
distorted
all
these
whispers
of
a
prophecy
of
you
being
the
Chosen
One
they
were
getting
near
it
now
Harry
thought
the
reason
scrim-geour
was
here
i
assume
that
Dumbledore
has
discussed
these
matters
with
you
harry
deliberated
wondering
whether
he
ought
to
lie
or
not
he
looked
at
the
little
gnome
prints
all
around
the
flowerbeds
ami
the
scuffed-up
patch
that
marked
the
spot
where
Fred
had
caught
the
gnome
now
wearing
the
tutu
at
the
top
of
the
Christmas
tree
finally
he
decided
on
the
truth
or
a
bit
of
it
yeah
we've
discussed
it
have
you
have
you
said
Scrimgeour
harry
could
see
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
Scrimgeour
squinting
at
him
so
he
pre-tended
to
be
very
interested
in
a
gnome
that
had
just
poked
its
head
out
from
underneath
a
frozen
rhododendron
and
what
has
Dumbledore
told
you
Harry
sorry
but
that's
between
us
said
Harry
he
kept
his
voice
as
pleasant
as
he
could
and
scrimgeour's
tone
too
was
light
and
friendly
as
he
said
Oh
of
course
if
it's
a
question
of
confidences
I
wouldn't
want
you
to
divulge
no
no
and
in
any
case
does
it
really
matter
whether
you
are
the
Chosen
One
or
not
harry
had
to
mull
that
one
over
for
a
few
seconds
before
re-sponding
i
don't
really
know
what
you
mean
Minister
well
of
course
to
you
it
will
matter
enormously
said
scrim-geour
with
a
laugh
but
to
the
Wizarding
community
at
large
it's
all
perception
isn't
it
it's
what
people
believe
that's
important
harry
said
nothing
he
thought
he
saw
dimly
where
they
were
heading
but
he
was
not
going
to
help
Scrimgeour
get
there
the
gnome
under
the
rhododendron
was
now
digging
for
worms
at
its
roots
and
Harry
kept
his
eyes
fixed
upon
it
people
believe
you
are
the
Chosen
One
you
see
said
scrim-geour
they
think
you
quite
the
hero
which
of
course
you
arc
Harry
chosen
or
not
how
many
times
have
you
faced
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
now
well
anyway
he
pressed
on
without
waiting
for
a
reply
the
point
is
you
are
a
symbol
of
hope
lor
many
Harry
the
idea
that
there
is
somebody
out
there
who
might
be
able
who
might
even
be
destined
to
destroy
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
well
naturally
it
gives
people
a
lift
and
I
can't
help
but
feel
that
once
you
realize
this
you
might
consider
it
well
almost
a
duty
to
stand
alongside
the
Ministry
and
give
everyone
a
boost
the
gnome
had
just
managed
to
get
hold
of
a
worm
it
was
now
tugging
very
hard
on
it
trying
to
get
it
out
of
the
frozen
ground
harry
was
silent
so
long
that
Scrimgeour
said
looking
from
Harry
to
the
gnome
Funny
little
chaps
aren't
they
but
what
say
you
Harry
i
don't
exactly
understand
what
you
want
said
Harry
slowly
stand
alongside
the
Ministry
what
does
that
mean
oh
well
nothing
at
all
onerous
I
assure
you
said
scrim-geour
if
you
were
to
be
seen
popping
in
and
out
of
the
Ministry
from
time
to
time
for
instance
that
would
give
the
right
impres-sion
and
of
course
while
you
were
there
you
would
have
ample
opportunity
to
speak
to
Gawain
Robards
my
successor
as
Head
of
the
Auror
office
dolores
Umbridge
has
told
me
that
you
cherish
an
ambition
to
become
an
Auror
well
that
could
be
arranged
very
easily
harry
felt
anger
bubbling
in
the
pit
of
his
stomach
So
Dolores
Umbridge
was
still
at
the
Ministry
was
she
so
basically
he
said
as
though
he
just
wanted
to
clarify
a
few
points
you'd
like
to
give
the
impression
that
i'm
working
for
the
Ministry
it
would
give
everyone
a
lift
to
think
you
were
more
involved
Harry
said
Scrimgeour
sounding
relieved
that
Harry
had
cot-toned
on
so
quickly
the
Chosen
One
you
know
it's
all
about
giving
people
hope
the
feeling
that
exciting
things
are
hap-pening
but
if
I
keep
running
in
and
out
of
the
Ministry
said
Harry
still
endeavoring
to
keep
his
voice
friendly
won't
that
seem
as
though
I
approve
of
what
the
ministry's
up
to
well
said
Scrimgeour
frowning
slightly
well
yes
that's
partly
why
we'd
like
no
I
don't
think
that'll
work
said
Harry
pleasantly
you
see
I
don't
like
some
of
the
things
the
ministry's
doing
locking
up
Stan
Shunpike
for
instance
scrimgeour
did
not
speak
for
a
moment
but
his
expression
hard-ened
instantly
i
would
not
expect
you
to
understand
he
said
and
he
was
not
as
successful
at
keeping
anger
out
of
his
voice
as
Harry
had
been
these
are
dangerous
times
and
certain
measures
need
to
be
taken
you
are
sixteen
years
old
dumbledore's
a
lot
older
than
sixteen
and
he
doesn't
think
Stan
should
be
in
Azkaban
either
said
Harry
you're
making
Stan
a
scapegoat
just
like
you
want
to
make
me
a
mascot
they
looked
at
each
other
long
and
hard
finally
Scrimgeour
said
with
no
pretense
at
warmth
I
see
you
prefer
like
your
hero
Dumbledore
to
disassociate
yourself
from
the
Ministry
i
don't
want
to
be
used
said
Harry
some
would
say
it's
your
duty
to
be
used
by
the
Ministry
yeah
and
others
might
say
its
your
duty
to
check
that
people
really
are
Death
Eaters
before
you
chuck
them
in
prison
said
Harry
his
temper
rising
now
you're
doing
what
Barty
Crouch
did
you
never
get
it
right
you
people
do
you
either
we've
got
Fudge
pretending
everything's
lovely
while
people
get
murdered
right
under
his
nose
or
we've
got
you
chucking
the
wrong
people
into
jail
and
trying
to
pretend
you've
got
the
Chosen
One
work-ing
for
you
so
you're
not
the
Chosen
One
said
Scrimgeour
i
thought
you
said
it
didn't
matter
either
way
said
Harry
with
a
bitter
laugh
not
to
you
anyway
i
shouldn't
have
said
that
said
Scrimgeour
quickly
it
was
tactless
no
it
was
honest
said
Harry
one
of
the
only
honest
things
you've
said
to
me
you
don't
care
whether
I
live
or
die
but
you
do
care
that
I
help
you
convince
everyone
you're
winning
the
war
against
Voldemort
i
haven't
forgotten
Minister
he
raised
his
right
fist
there
shining
white
on
the
back
of
his
cold
hand
were
the
scars
which
Dolores
Umbridge
had
forced
him
to
carve
into
his
own
flesh
I
must
not
tell
lies
i
don't
remember
you
rushing
to
my
defense
when
I
was
trying
to
tell
everyone
Voldemort
was
back
the
Ministry
wasn't
so
keen
to
be
pals
last
year
they
stood
in
silence
as
icy
as
the
ground
beneath
their
feet
the
gnome
had
finally
managed
to
extricate
his
worm
and
was
now
sucking
on
it
happily
leaning
against
the
bottommost
branches
of
the
rhododendron
bush
what
is
Dumbledore
up
to
said
Scrimgeour
brusquely
where
does
he
go
when
he
is
absent
from
Hogwarts
no
idea
said
Harry
and
you
wouldn't
tell
me
if
you
knew
said
Scrimgeour
would
you
no
wouldn't
said
Harry
well
then
I
shall
have
to
see
whether
I
can't
find
out
by
other
means
you
can
try
said
Harry
indifferently
but
you
seem
cleverer
than
Fudge
so
i'd
have
thought
you'd
have
learned
from
his
mis-takes
he
tried
interfering
at
Hogwarts
you
might
have
noticed
he's
not
Minister
anymore
but
Dumbledores
still
headmaster
i'd
leave
Dumbledore
alone
if
I
were
you
there
was
a
long
pause
well
it
is
clear
to
me
that
he
has
done
a
very
good
job
on
you
said
Scrimgeour
his
eyes
cold
and
hard
behind
his
wire-rimmed
glasses
Dumbledores
man
through
and
through
aren't
you
Potter
yeah
I
am
said
Harry
glad
we
straightened
that
out
and
turning
his
back
on
the
Minister
of
Magic
he
strode
back
toward
the
house
chapter
A
Sluggish
Memory
late
in
the
afternoon
a
few
days
after
New
Year
Harry
Ron
and
Ginny
lined
up
beside
the
kitchen
fire
to
return
to
Hogwarts
the
Ministry
had
arranged
this
one-off
connection
to
the
Floo
Network
to
return
students
quickly
and
safely
to
the
school
only
Mrs
weasley
was
there
to
say
good-bye
as
mr.
Weasley
Fred
George
Bill
and
Fleur
were
all
at
work
mrs
weasley
dissolved
into
tears
at
the
moment
of
parting
admittedly
it
took
very
little
to
set
her
off
lately
she
had
been
crying
on
and
off
ever
since
Percy
had
stormed
from
the
house
on
Christmas
Day
with
his
glasses
splattered
with
mashed
parsnip
for
which
Fred
George
and
Ginny
all
claimed
credit
don't
cry
Mum
said
Ginny
patting
her
on
the
back
as
Mrs
weasley
sobbed
into
her
shoulder
it's
okay
yeah
don't
worry
about
us
said
Ron
permitting
his
mother
to
plant
a
very
wet
kiss
on
his
cheek
or
about
Percy
he's
such
a
prat
it's
not
really
a
loss
is
it
mrs
weasley
sobbed
harder
than
ever
as
she
enfolded
Harry
in
her
arms
promise
me
you'll
look
after
yourself
stay
out
of
trouble
i
always
do
Mrs
weasley
said
Harry
i
like
a
quiet
life
you
know
me
she
gave
a
watery
chuckle
and
stood
back
be
good
then
all
of
you
harry
stepped
into
the
emerald
fire
and
shouted
Hogwarts
he
had
one
last
fleeting
view
of
the
Weasleys
kitchen
and
Mrs
weasley's
tearful
face
before
the
flames
engulfed
him
spinning
very
fast
he
caught
blurred
glimpses
of
other
Wizarding
rooms
which
were
whipped
out
of
sight
before
he
could
get
a
proper
look
then
he
was
slowing
down
finally
stopping
squarely
in
the
fireplace
in
Professor
mcgonagall's
office
she
barely
glanced
up
from
her
work
as
he
clambered
out
over
the
grate
evening
Potter
try
not
to
get
too
much
ash
on
the
carpet
no
Professor
harry
straightened
his
glasses
and
flattened
his
hair
as
Ron
came
spinning
into
view
when
Ginny
had
arrived
all
three
of
them
trooped
out
of
mcgonagall's
office
and
off
toward
Gryffindor
Tower
harry
glanced
out
of
the
corridor
windows
as
they
passed
the
sun
was
already
sinking
over
grounds
carpeted
in
deeper
snow
than
had
lain
over
the
Burrow
garden
in
the
distance
he
could
see
Hagrid
feeding
Buckbeak
in
front
of
his
cabin
baubles
said
Ron
confidently
when
they
reached
the
Fat
Lady
who
was
looking
rather
paler
than
usual
and
winced
at
his
loud
voice
no
she
said
what
dyou
mean
no
there
is
a
new
password
she
said
and
please
don't
shout
but
we've
been
away
how're
we
supposed
to
harry
ginny
hermione
was
hurrying
toward
them
very
pink-faced
and
wearing
a
cloak
hat
and
gloves
i
got
back
a
couple
of
hours
ago
i've
just
been
down
to
visit
Hagrid
and
Buck
I
mean
Witherwings
she
said
breathlessly
did
you
have
a
good
Christmas
yeah
said
Ron
at
once
pretty
eventful
Rufus
Scrim
i've
got
something
for
you
Harry
said
Hermione
neither
looking
at
Ron
nor
giving
any
sign
that
she
had
heard
him
oh
hang
on
password
abstinence
precisely
said
the
Fat
Lady
in
a
feeble
voice
and
swung
forward
to
reveal
the
portrait
hole
what's
up
with
her
asked
Harry
overindulged
over
Christmas
apparently
said
Hermione
rolling
her
eyes
as
she
led
the
way
into
the
packed
common
room
she
and
her
friend
violet
drank
their
way
through
all
the
wine
in
that
picture
of
drunk
monks
down
by
the
Charms
corridor
anyway
she
rummaged
in
her
pocket
for
a
moment
then
pulled
out
a
scroll
of
parchment
with
dumbledore's
writing
on
it
great
said
Harry
unrolling
it
at
once
to
discover
that
his
next
lesson
with
Dumbledore
was
scheduled
for
the
following
night
ive
got
loads
to
tell
him
and
you
let's
sit
down
but
at
that
moment
there
was
a
loud
squeal
of
Won-Won
and
Lavender
Brown
came
hurtling
out
of
nowhere
and
flung
herself
into
ron's
arms
several
onlookers
sniggered
Hermione
gave
a
tinkling
laugh
and
said
there's
a
cable
over
here
coming
ginny
no
thanks
I
said
i'd
meet
Dean
said
Ginny
though
Harry
could
not
help
noticing
that
she
did
not
sound
very
enthusiastic
leaving
Ron
and
Lavender
locked
in
a
kind
of
vertical
wrestling
match
Harry
led
Hermione
over
to
the
spare
table
so
how
was
your
Christmas
oh
fine
she
shrugged
nothing
special
how
was
it
at
won-won's
i'll
tell
you
in
a
minute
said
Harry
look
Hermione
can't
you
no
I
can't
she
said
flatly
so
don't
even
ask
i
thought
maybe
you
know
over
Christmas
it
was
the
Fat
Lady
who
drank
a
vat
of
five-hundred-year-old
wine
Harry
not
me
so
what
was
this
important
news
you
wanted
to
tell
me
she
looked
too
fierce
to
argue
with
at
that
moment
so
Harry
dropped
the
subject
of
Ron
and
recounted
all
that
he
had
overheard
between
Malfoy
and
Snape
when
he
had
finished
Hermione
sat
in
thought
for
a
moment
and
then
said
don't
you
think
he
was
pretending
to
offer
help
so
that
he
could
trick
Malfoy
into
telling
him
what
he's
doing
well
yes
said
Hermione
rons
dad
and
Lupin
think
so
Harry
said
grudgingly
but
this
definitely
proves
Malfoys
planning
something
you
can't
deny
that
no
I
can't
she
answered
slowly
and
he's
acting
on
voldemort's
orders
just
like
I
said
hmm
did
either
of
them
actually
mention
voldemort's
name
harry
frowned
trying
to
remember
i'm
not
sure
snape
definitely
said
your
master
and
who
else
would
that
be
i
don't
know
said
Hermione
biting
her
lip
maybe
his
father
she
stared
across
the
room
apparently
lost
in
thought
not
even
noticing
Lavender
tickling
Ron
how's
Lupin
not
great
said
Harry
and
he
told
her
all
about
Lupins
mission
among
the
werewolves
and
the
difficulties
he
was
facing
have
you
heard
of
this
Fenrir
Greyback
yes
I
have
said
Hermione
sounding
startled
and
so
have
you
Harry
when
History
of
Magic
you
know
full
well
I
never
listened
no
no
not
History
of
Magic
Malfoy
threatened
Borgin
with
Kim
said
Hermione
back
in
Knockturn
Alley
don't
you
remember
he
told
Borgin
that
Greyback
was
an
old
family
friend
and
that
he'd
be
checking
up
on
borgin's
progress
harry
gaped
at
her
i
forgot
but
this
proves
Malfoy
s
a
Death
Eater
how
else
could
he
be
in
contact
with
Greyback
and
telling
him
what
to
do
it
is
pretty
suspicious
breathed
Hermione
unless
oh
come
on
said
Harry
in
exasperation
you
can't
get
round
this
one
well
there
is
the
possibility
it
was
an
empty
threat
you're
unbelievable
you
are
said
Harry
shaking
his
head
we'll
see
who's
right
you'll
be
eating
your
words
Hermione
just
like
the
Ministry
oh
yeah
had
a
row
with
Rufus
Scrimgeour
as
well
and
the
rest
of
the
evening
passed
amicably
with
both
of
them
abusing
the
Minister
of
Magic
for
Hermione
like
Ron
thought
that
after
all
the
Ministry
had
put
Harry
through
the
previous
year
they
had
a
great
deal
of
nerve
asking
him
for
help
now
the
new
term
started
next
morning
with
a
pleasant
surprise
for
the
sixth
years
a
large
sign
had
been
pinned
to
the
common
room
notice
boards
overnight
apparition
lessons
if
you
are
seventeen
years
of
age
or
will
turn
seventeen
on
or
before
the
st
August
next
you
are
eligible
for
a
twelve-week
course
of
Apparition
Lessons
from
a
Ministry
of
Magic
Apparition
instructor
please
sign
below
if
you
would
like
to
participate
cost
Galleons
harry
and
Ron
joined
the
crowd
that
was
jostling
around
the
notice
and
taking
it
in
turns
to
write
their
names
at
the
bottom
ron
was
just
taking
out
his
quill
to
sign
after
Hermione
when
Lavender
crept
up
behind
him
slipped
her
hands
over
his
eyes
and
trilled
Guess
who
Won-Won
harry
turned
to
see
Hermione
stalking
off
he
caught
up
with
her
having
no
wish
to
stay
behind
with
Ron
and
Lavender
but
to
his
surprise
Ron
caught
up
with
them
only
a
little
way
beyond
the
portrait
hole
his
ears
bright
red
and
his
expression
disgruntled
without
a
word
Hermione
sped
up
to
walk
with
Neville
so
Apparition
said
Ron
his
tone
making
it
perfectly
plain
that
Harry
was
not
to
mention
what
had
just
happened
should
be
a
laugh
eh
i
dunno
said
Harry
maybe
it's
better
when
you
do
it
yourself
I
didnt
enjoy
it
much
when
Dumbledore
took
me
along
for
the
ride
i
forgot
you'd
already
done
it
i'd
better
pass
my
test
first
time
said
Ron
looking
anxious
fred
and
George
did
Charlie
failed
though
didn't
he
yeah
but
charlie's
bigger
than
me
Ron
held
his
arms
out
from
his
body
as
though
he
was
a
gorilla
so
Fred
and
George
didn't
go
on
about
it
much
not
to
his
face
anyway
when
can
we
take
the
actual
test
soon
as
we're
seventeen
that's
only
March
for
me
yeah
but
you
wouldn't
be
able
to
Apparate
in
here
not
in
the
castle
not
the
point
is
it
everyone
would
know
I
could
Apparate
if
I
wanted
ron
was
not
the
only
one
to
be
excited
at
the
prospect
of
Apparition
all
that
day
there
was
much
talk
about
the
forthcoming
lessons
a
great
deal
of
store
was
set
by
being
able
to
vanish
and
reappear
at
will
how
cool
will
it
be
when
we
can
just
Seamus
clicked
his
ringers
to
indicate
disappearance
me
cousin
Fergus
does
it
just
to
annoy
me
you
wait
till
I
can
do
it
back
he'll
never
have
another
peaceful
moment
lost
in
visions
of
this
happy
prospect
he
flicked
his
wand
a
little
too
enthusiastically
so
that
instead
of
producing
the
fountain
of
pure
water
that
was
the
object
of
today's
Charms
lesson
he
let
out
a
hoselike
jet
that
ricocheted
off
the
ceiling
and
knocked
Professor
Flitwick
flat
on
his
face
harrys
already
Apparated
Ron
told
a
slightly
abashed
Seamus
after
Professor
Flitwick
had
dried
himself
off
with
a
wave
of
his
wand
and
set
Seamus
lines
I
am
a
wizard
not
a
baboon
brandishing
a
stick
dum
er
someone
took
him
side-Along-Apparition
you
know
whoa
whispered
Seamus
and
he
Dean
and
Neville
put
their
heads
a
little
closer
to
hear
what
Apparition
felt
like
for
the
rest
of
the
day
Harry
was
besieged
with
requests
from
the
other
sixth
years
to
describe
the
sensation
of
Apparition
all
of
them
seemed
awed
rather
than
put
off
when
he
told
them
how
uncomfortable
it
was
and
he
was
still
answering
detailed
questions
at
ten
to
eight
that
evening
when
he
was
forced
to
lie
and
say
that
he
needed
to
return
a
book
to
the
library
so
as
to
escape
in
time
for
his
lesson
with
Dumbledore
the
lamps
in
Dumbledores
office
were
lit
the
portraits
of
previous
headmasters
were
snoring
gently
in
their
frames
and
the
pen-sieve
was
ready
upon
the
desk
once
more
dumbledores
hands
lay
on
either
side
of
it
the
right
one
as
blackened
and
burnt-looking
as
ever
it
did
not
seem
to
have
healed
at
all
and
Harry
wondered
for
perhaps
the
hundredth
time
what
had
caused
such
a
distinctive
injury
but
did
not
ask
Dumbledore
had
said
that
he
would
know
eventually
and
there
was
in
any
case
another
subject
he
wanted
to
discuss
but
before
Harry
could
say
anything
about
Snape
and
Malfoy
Dumbledore
spoke
i
hear
that
you
met
the
Minister
of
Magic
over
Christmas
yes
said
Harry
he's
not
very
happy
with
me
no
sighed
Dumbledore
he
is
not
very
happy
with
me
either
we
must
try
not
to
sink
beneath
our
anguish
Harry
but
battle
on
harry
grinned
he
wanted
me
to
tell
the
Wizarding
community
that
the
ministry's
doing
a
wonderful
job
dumbledore
smiled
it
was
fudge's
idea
originally
you
know
during
his
last
days
in
office
when
he
was
trying
desperately
to
cling
to
his
post
he
sought
a
meeting
with
you
hoping
that
you
would
give
him
your
support
after
everything
Fudge
did
last
year
said
Harry
angrily
after
Umbridge
i
told
Cornelius
there
was
no
chance
of
it
but
the
idea
did
not
die
when
he
left
office
within
hours
of
scrimgeour's
appointment
we
met
and
he
demanded
that
I
arrange
a
meeting
with
you
so
that's
why
you
argued
harry
blurted
out
it
was
in
the
Daily
Prophet
the
Prophet
is
bound
to
report
the
truth
occasionally
said
Dumbledore
if
only
accidentally
yes
that
was
why
we
argued
well
it
appears
that
Rufus
found
a
way
to
corner
you
at
last
he
accused
me
of
being
dumbledore's
man
through
and
through
how
very
rude
of
him
i
told
him
I
was
dumbledore
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
and
then
closed
it
again
behind
Harry
Fawkes
the
phoenix
let
out
a
low
soft
musical
cry
to
Harrys
intense
embarrassment
he
suddenly
realized
that
dumbledore's
bright
blue
eyes
looked
rather
watery
ami
stared
hastily
at
his
own
knees
when
Dumbledore
spoke
however
his
voice
was
quite
steady
i
am
very
touched
Harry
scrimgeour
wanted
to
know
where
you
go
when
you're
not
at
Hogwarts
said
Harry
still
looking
fixedly
at
his
knees
yes
he
is
very
nosy
about
that
said
Dumbledore
now
sounding
cheerful
and
Harry
thought
it
safe
to
look
up
again
he
has
even
attempted
to
have
me
followed
amusing
really
he
set
Dawlish
to
tail
me
it
wasn't
kind
i
have
already
been
forced
to
jinx
Dawlish
once
I
did
it
again
with
the
greatest
regret
so
they
still
don't
know
where
you
go
asked
Harry
hoping
for
more
information
on
this
intriguing
subject
but
Dumbledore
merely
smiled
over
the
top
of
his
half-moon
spectacles
no
they
don't
and
the
time
is
not
quite
right
for
you
to
know
either
now
I
suggest
we
press
on
unless
there's
anything
else
there
is
actually
sir
said
Harry
it's
about
Malfoy
and
Snape
professor
Snape
Harry
yes
sir
i
overheard
them
during
Professor
Slughorns
party
well
I
followed
them
actually
dumbledore
listened
to
harry's
story
with
an
impassive
face
when
Harry
had
finished
he
did
not
speak
for
a
few
moments
then
said
Thank
you
for
telling
me
this
Harry
but
I
suggest
that
you
put
it
out
of
your
mind
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
of
great
importance
not
of
great
importance
repeated
Harry
incredulously
professor
did
you
understand
yes
Harry
blessed
as
I
am
with
extraordinary
brainpower
I
understood
everything
you
told
me
said
Dumbledore
a
little
sharply
i
think
you
might
even
consider
the
possibility
that
I
understood
more
than
you
did
again
I
am
glad
that
you
have
con-lided
in
me
but
let
me
reassure
you
that
you
have
not
told
me
anything
that
causes
me
disquiet
harry
sat
in
seething
silence
glaring
at
Dumbledore
what
was
going
on
did
this
mean
that
Dumbledore
had
indeed
ordered
Snape
to
find
out
what
Malfoy
was
doing
in
which
case
he
had
already
heard
everything
Harry
had
just
told
him
from
Snape
or
was
he
really
worried
by
what
he
had
heard
but
pretending
not
to
be
so
sir
said
Harry
in
what
he
hoped
was
a
polite
calm
voice
you
definitely
still
trust
i
have
been
tolerant
enough
to
answer
that
question
already
said
Dumbledore
but
he
did
not
sound
very
tolerant
anymore
my
answer
has
not
changed
i
should
think
not
said
a
snide
voice
Phineas
Nigellus
was
evidently
only
pretending
to
be
asleep
dumbledore
ignored
him
and
now
Harry
I
must
insist
that
we
press
on
i
have
more
important
things
to
discuss
with
you
this
evening
harry
sat
there
feeling
mutinous
how
would
it
be
if
he
refused
to
permit
the
change
of
subject
if
he
insisted
upon
arguing
the
case
against
Malfoy
as
though
he
had
read
harry's
mind
Dumbledore
shook
his
head
ah
Harry
how
often
this
happens
even
between
the
best
of
friends
each
of
us
believes
that
what
he
has
to
say
is
much
more
important
than
anything
the
other
might
have
to
contribute
i
don't
think
what
you've
got
to
say
is
unimportant
sir
said
Harry
stiffly
well
you
are
quite
right
because
it
is
not
said
Dumbledore
briskly
i
have
two
more
memories
to
show
you
this
evening
both
obtained
with
enormous
difficulty
and
the
second
of
them
is
think
the
most
important
I
have
collected
harry
did
not
say
anything
to
this
he
still
felt
angry
at
the
reception
his
confidences
had
received
but
could
not
see
what
was
to
be
gained
by
arguing
further
so
said
Dumbledore
in
a
ringing
voice
we
meet
this
evening
to
continue
the
tale
of
Tom
Riddle
whom
we
left
last
lesson
poised
on
the
threshold
of
his
years
at
Hogwarts
you
will
remember
how
excited
he
was
to
hear
that
he
was
a
wizard
that
he
refused
my
company
on
a
trip
to
Diagon
Alley
and
that
I
in
turn
warned
him
against
continued
thievery
when
he
arrived
at
school
well
the
start
of
the
school
year
arrived
and
with
it
came
Tom
Riddle
a
quiet
boy
in
his
secondhand
robes
who
lined
up
with
the
other
first
years
to
be
sorted
he
was
placed
in
Slytherin
House
almost
the
moment
that
the
Sorting
Hat
touched
his
head
continued
Dumbledore
waving
his
blackened
hand
toward
the
shelf
over
his
head
where
the
Sorting
Hat
sat
ancient
and
unmoving
how
soon
Riddle
learned
that
the
famous
founder
of
the
House
could
talk
to
snakes
I
do
not
know
perhaps
that
very
evening
the
knowledge
can
only
have
excited
him
and
increased
his
sense
of
self-importance
however
if
he
was
frightening
or
impressing
fellow
Slytherins
with
displays
of
Parseltongue
in
their
common
room
no
hint
of
it
reached
the
staff
he
showed
no
sign
of
outward
arrogance
or
aggression
at
all
as
an
unusually
talented
and
very
good-looking
orphan
he
naturally
drew
attention
and
sympathy
from
the
staff
almost
from
the
moment
of
his
arrival
he
seemed
police
quiet
and
thirsty
for
knowledge
nearly
all
were
most
favorably
impressed
by
him
didn't
you
tell
them
sir
what
he'd
been
like
when
you
met
him
at
the
orphanage
asked
Harry
no
I
did
not
though
he
had
shown
no
hint
of
remorse
it
was
possible
that
he
felt
sorry
for
how
he
had
behaved
before
and
was
resolved
to
turn
over
a
fresh
leaf
i
chose
to
give
him
that
chance
dumbledore
paused
and
looked
inquiringly
at
Harry
who
had
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
here
again
was
dumbledore's
tendency
to
trust
people
in
spite
of
overwhelming
evidence
that
they
did
not
deserve
it
but
then
Harry
remembered
something
but
you
didn't
really
trust
him
sir
did
you
he
told
me
the
Riddle
who
came
out
of
that
diary
said
Dumbledore
never
seemed
to
like
me
as
much
as
the
other
teachers
did
let
us
say
that
I
did
not
take
it
for
granted
that
he
was
trustworthy
said
Dumbledore
i
had
as
I
have
already
indicated
resolved
to
keep
a
close
eye
upon
him
and
so
I
did
i
cannot
pretend
that
I
gleaned
a
great
deal
from
my
observations
at
first
he
was
very
guarded
with
me
he
felt
I
am
sure
that
in
the
thrill
of
discovering
his
true
identity
he
had
told
me
a
little
too
much
he
was
careful
never
to
reveal
as
much
again
but
he
could
not
take
back
what
he
had
let
slip
in
his
excitement
nor
what
Mrs
cole
had
confided
in
me
however
he
had
the
sense
never
to
try
and
charm
me
as
he
charmed
so
many
of
my
colleagues
as
he
moved
up
the
school
he
gathered
about
him
a
group
of
dedicated
friends
I
call
them
that
for
want
of
a
better
term
although
as
I
have
already
indicated
Riddle
undoubtedly
felt
no
affection
for
any
of
them
this
group
had
a
kind
of
dark
glamour
within
the
castle
they
were
a
motley
collection
a
mixture
of
the
weak
seeking
protection
the
ambitious
seeking
some
shared
glory
and
the
thuggish
gravitating
toward
a
leader
who
could
show
them
more
refined
forms
of
cruelty
in
other
words
they
were
the
forerunners
of
the
Death
Eaters
and
indeed
some
of
them
became
the
first
Death
Eaters
after
leaving
Hogwarts
rigidly
controlled
by
Riddle
they
were
never
detected
in
open
wrongdoing
although
their
seven
years
at
Hogwarts
were
marked
by
a
number
of
nasty
incidents
to
which
they
were
never
satisfactorily
linked
the
most
serious
of
which
was
of
course
the
opening
of
the
Chamber
of
Secrets
which
resulted
in
the
death
of
a
girl
as
you
know
Hagrid
was
wrongly
accused
of
that
crime
i
have
not
been
able
to
find
many
memories
of
Riddle
at
Hogwarts
said
Dumbledore
placing
his
withered
hand
on
the
Pensieve
few
who
knew
him
then
are
prepared
to
talk
about
him
they
are
too
terrified
what
I
know
I
found
out
after
he
had
left
Hogwarts
after
much
painstaking
effort
after
tracing
those
few
who
could
be
tricked
into
speaking
after
searching
old
records
and
questioning
Muggle
and
wizard
witnesses
alike
those
whom
I
could
persuade
to
talk
told
me
that
Riddle
was
obsessed
with
his
parentage
this
is
understandable
of
course
he
had
grown
up
in
an
orphanage
and
naturally
wished
to
know
how
he
came
to
be
there
it
seems
that
he
searched
in
vain
for
some
trace
of
Tom
Riddle
senior
on
the
shields
in
the
trophy
room
on
the
lists
of
prefects
in
the
old
school
records
even
in
the
books
of
Wizarding
history
finally
he
was
forced
to
accept
that
his
father
had
never
set
foot
in
Hogwarts
i
believe
that
it
was
then
that
he
dropped
the
name
forever
assumed
the
identity
of
Lord
volde-mort
and
began
his
investigations
into
his
previously
despised
mother's
family
the
woman
whom
you
will
remember
he
had
thought
could
not
be
a
witch
if
she
had
succumbed
to
the
shameful
human
weakness
of
death
all
he
had
to
go
upon
was
the
single
name
Marvolo
which
he
knew
from
those
who
ran
the
orphanage
had
been
his
mother's
father's
name
finally
after
painstaking
research
through
old
books
of
Wizarding
families
he
discovered
the
existence
of
slytherin's
surviving
line
in
the
summer
of
his
sixteenth
year
he
left
the
orphanage
to
which
he
returned
annually
and
set
off
to
find
his
Gaunt
relatives
and
now
Harry
if
you
will
stand
dumbledore
rose
and
Harry
saw
that
he
was
again
holding
a
small
crystal
bottle
filled
with
swirling
pearly
memory
i
was
very
lucky
to
collect
this
he
said
as
he
poured
the
gleaming
mass
into
the
Pensieve
as
you
will
understand
when
we
have
experienced
it
shall
we
harry
stepped
up
to
the
stone
basin
and
bowed
obediently
until
his
face
sank
through
the
surface
of
the
memory
he
felt
the
familiar
sensation
of
falling
through
nothingness
and
then
landed
upon
a
dirty
stone
floor
in
almost
total
darkness
it
took
him
several
seconds
to
recognize
the
place
by
which
time
Dumbledore
had
landed
beside
him
the
Gaunts
house
was
now
more
indescribably
filthy
than
anywhere
Harry
had
ever
seen
the
ceiling
was
thick
with
cobwebs
the
floor
coated
in
grime
moldy
and
rotting
food
lay
upon
the
table
amidst
a
mass
of
crusted
pots
the
only
light
came
from
a
single
guttering
candle
placed
at
the
feet
of
a
man
with
hair
and
beard
so
overgrown
Harry
could
see
neither
eyes
nor
mouth
he
was
slumped
in
an
armchair
by
the
fire
and
Harry
wondered
for
a
moment
whether
he
was
dead
but
then
there
came
a
loud
knock
on
the
door
and
the
man
jerked
awake
raising
a
wand
in
his
right
hand
and
a
short
knife
in
his
left
the
door
creaked
open
there
on
the
threshold
holding
an
old-fashioned
lamp
stood
a
boy
Harry
recognized
at
once
tall
pale
dark-haired
and
handsome
the
teenage
Voldemort
voldemort's
eyes
moved
slowly
around
the
hovel
and
then
found
the
man
in
the
armchair
for
a
few
seconds
they
looked
at
each
other
then
the
man
staggered
upright
the
many
empty
bottles
at
his
feet
clattering
and
tinkling
across
the
floor
you
he
bellowed
you
and
he
hurtled
drunkenly
at
Riddle
wand
and
knife
held
aloft
stop
riddle
spoke
in
Parseltongue
the
man
skidded
into
the
table
sending
moldy
pots
crashing
to
the
floor
he
stared
at
Riddle
there
was
a
long
silence
while
they
contemplated
each
other
the
man
broke
it
you
speak
it
yes
I
speak
it
said
Riddle
he
moved
forward
into
the
room
allowing
the
door
to
swing
shut
behind
him
harry
could
not
help
but
feel
a
resentful
admiration
for
voldemort's
complete
lack
of
fear
his
race
merely
expressed
disgust
and
perhaps
disappointment
where
is
Marvolo
he
asked
dead
said
the
other
died
years
ago
didn't
he
riddle
frowned
who
are
you
then
im
Morfin
ain't
I
marvolo's
son
course
I
am
then
morfin
pushed
the
hair
out
of
his
dirty
face
the
better
to
see
Riddle
and
Harry
saw
that
he
wore
marvolo's
black-stoned
ring
on
his
right
hand
i
thought
you
was
that
Muggle
whispered
Morfin
you
look
mighty
like
that
Muggle
what
Muggle
said
Riddle
sharply
that
Muggle
what
my
sister
took
a
fancy
to
that
Muggle
what
lives
in
the
big
house
over
the
way
said
Morfin
and
he
spat
unexpectedly
upon
the
floor
between
them
you
look
right
like
him
riddle
but
he's
older
now
in
e
he's
older'n
you
now
I
think
on
it
morfin
looked
slightly
dazed
and
swayed
a
little
still
clutching
the
edge
of
the
table
for
support
he
come
back
see
he
added
stupidly
voldemort
was
gazing
at
Morfin
as
though
appraising
his
possibilities
now
he
moved
a
little
closer
and
said
Riddle
came
back
ar
he
left
her
and
serve
her
right
marrying
filth
said
Morfin
spitting
on
the
floor
again
robbed
us
mind
before
she
ran
off
where's
the
locket
eh
where's
slytherin's
locket
voldemort
did
not
answer
morfin
was
working
himself
into
a
rage
again
he
brandished
his
knife
and
shouted
Dishonored
us
she
did
that
little
slut
and
whore
you
coming
here
and
asking
questions
about
all
that
it's
over
innit
it's
over
he
looked
away
staggering
slightly
and
Voldemort
moved
forward
as
he
did
so
an
unnatural
darkness
fell
extinguishing
voldemort's
lamp
and
morfin's
candle
extinguishing
everything
dumbledore's
fingers
closed
tightly
around
harry's
arm
and
they
were
soaring
back
into
the
present
again
the
soft
golden
light
in
dumbledore's
office
seemed
to
dazzle
harry's
eyes
after
that
impenetrable
darkness
is
that
all
said
Harry
at
once
why
did
it
go
dark
what
happened
because
Morfin
could
not
remember
anything
from
that
point
onward
said
Dumbledore
gesturing
Harry
back
into
his
seat
when
he
awoke
next
morning
he
was
lying
on
the
floor
quite
alone
marvolo's
ring
had
gone
meanwhile
in
the
village
of
Little
Hangleton
a
maid
was
running
along
the
High
Street
screaming
that
there
were
three
bodies
lying
in
the
drawing
room
of
the
big
house
Tom
Riddle
Senior
and
his
mother
and
father
the
Muggle
authorities
were
perplexed
as
far
as
I
am
aware
they
do
not
know
to
this
day
how
the
Riddles
died
for
the
Avadu
Kedavra
curse
does
not
usually
leave
any
sign
of
damage
the
exception
sits
before
me
Dumbledore
added
with
a
nod
to
harry's
scar
the
Ministry
on
the
other
hand
knew
at
once
that
this
was
a
wizard's
murder
they
also
knew
that
a
convicted
muggle-hater
lived
across
the
valley
from
the
Riddle
house
a
muggle-hater
who
had
already
been
imprisoned
once
for
attacking
one
of
the
murdered
people
so
the
Ministry
called
upon
Morfin
they
did
not
need
to
question
him
to
use
Veritaserum
or
Legilimency
he
admitted
to
the
murder
on
the
spot
giving
details
only
the
murderer
could
know
he
was
proud
he
said
to
have
killed
the
Muggles
had
been
awaiting
his
chance
all
these
years
he
handed
over
his
wand
which
was
proved
at
once
to
have
been
used
to
kill
the
Riddles
and
he
permitted
himself
to
be
led
off
to
Azkaban
without
a
fight
all
that
disturbed
him
was
the
fact
that
his
fathers
ring
had
disappeared
he'll
kill
me
for
losing
it
he
told
his
captors
over
and
over
again
he'll
kill
me
for
losing
his
ring
and
that
apparently
was
all
he
ever
said
again
he
lived
out
the
remainder
of
his
life
in
Azkaban
lamenting
the
loss
of
marvolo's
last
heirloom
and
is
buried
beside
the
prison
alongside
the
other
poor
souls
who
have
expired
within
its
walls
so
Voldemort
stole
morfin's
wand
and
used
it
said
Harry
sitting
up
straight
that's
right
said
Dumbledore
we
have
no
memories
to
show
us
this
but
I
think
we
can
be
fairly
sure
what
happened
voldemort
Stupefied
his
uncle
took
his
wand
and
proceeded
across
the
valley
to
the
big
house
over
the
way
there
he
murdered
the
Muggle
man
who
had
abandoned
his
witch
mother
and
for
good
measure
his
Muggle
grandparents
thus
obliterating
the
last
of
the
unworthy
Riddle
line
and
revenging
himself
upon
the
father
who
never
wanted
him
then
he
returned
to
the
Gaunt
hovel
performed
the
complex
bit
of
magic
that
would
implant
a
false
memory
in
his
uncle's
mind
laid
morfin's
wand
beside
its
unconscious
owner
pocketed
the
ancient
ring
he
wore
and
departed
and
Morfin
never
realized
he
hadn't
done
it
never
said
Dumbledore
he
gave
as
I
say
a
full
and
boastful
confession
but
he
had
this
real
memory
in
him
all
the
time
yes
but
it
took
a
great
deal
of
skilled
Legilimency
to
coax
it
out
of
him
said
Dumbledore
and
why
should
anybody
delve
further
into
morfin's
mind
when
he
had
already
confessed
to
the
crime
however
I
was
able
to
secure
a
visit
to
Morfin
in
the
last
weeks
of
his
life
by
which
time
I
was
attempting
to
discover
as
much
as
I
could
about
voldemort's
past
i
extracted
this
memory
with
difficulty
when
I
saw
what
it
contained
I
attempted
to
use
it
to
secure
morfin's
release
from
Azkaban
before
the
Ministry
reached
their
decision
however
Morfin
had
died
but
how
come
the
Ministry
didn't
realize
that
Voldemort
had
done
all
that
to
Morfin
harry
asked
angrily
He
was
underage
at
the
time
wasn't
he
i
thought
they
could
detect
underage
magic
you
are
quite
right
they
can
detect
magic
but
not
the
perpetrator
You
will
remember
that
you
were
blamed
by
the
Ministry
for
the
Hover
Charm
that
was
in
fact
cast
by
dobby
growled
Harry
this
injustice
still
rankled
so
if
you're
underage
and
you
do
magic
inside
an
adult
witch
or
wizard's
house
the
Ministry
won't
know
they
will
certainly
be
unable
to
tell
who
performed
the
magic
said
Dumbledore
smiling
slightly
at
the
look
of
great
indignation
on
Harrys
face
they
rely
on
witch
and
wizard
parents
to
enforce
their
offspring's
obedience
while
within
their
walls
well
that's
rubbish
snapped
Harry
look
what
happened
here
look
what
happened
to
Morfin
i
agree
said
Dumbledore
whatever
Morfin
was
he
did
not
deserve
to
die
as
he
did
blamed
for
murders
he
had
not
committed
but
it
is
getting
late
and
I
want
you
to
see
this
other
memory
before
we
part
dumbledore
took
from
an
inside
pocket
another
crystal
phial
and
Harry
fell
silent
at
once
remembering
that
Dumbledore
had
said
it
was
the
most
important
one
he
had
collected
harry
noticed
that
the
contents
proved
difficult
to
empty
into
the
Pensieve
as
though
they
had
congealed
slightly
did
memories
go
bad
this
will
not
take
long
said
Dumbledore
when
he
had
finally
emptied
the
phial
we
shall
be
back
before
you
know
it
once
more
into
the
Pensieve
then
and
Harry
fell
again
through
the
silver
surface
landing
this
time
right
in
front
of
a
man
he
recognized
at
once
it
was
a
much
younger
Horace
Slughorn
harry
was
so
used
to
him
bald
that
he
found
the
sight
of
Slughorn
with
thick
shiny
straw-colored
hair
quite
disconcerting
it
looked
as
though
he
had
had
his
head
thatched
though
there
was
already
a
shiny
galleon-sized
bald
patch
on
his
crown
his
mustache
less
massive
than
it
was
these
days
was
gingery-blond
he
was
not
quite
as
rotund
as
the
Slughorn
Harry
knew
though
the
golden
buttons
on
his
richly
embroidered
waistcoat
were
taking
a
fair
amount
of
strain
his
little
feet
resting
upon
a
velvet
pouffe
he
was
sitting
well
back
in
a
comfortable
winged
armchair
one
hand
grasping
a
small
glass
of
wine
the
other
searching
through
a
box
of
crystalized
pineapple
harry
looked
around
as
Dumbledore
appeared
beside
him
and
saw
that
they
were
standing
in
slughorn's
office
haifa
dozen
boys
were
sitting
around
Slughorn
all
on
harder
or
lower
seats
than
his
and
all
in
their
mid-teens
harry
recognized
Voldemort
at
once
his
was
the
most
handsome
face
and
he
looked
the
most
relaxed
of
all
the
boys
his
right
hand
lay
negligently
upon
the
arm
of
his
chair
with
a
jolt
Harry
saw
that
he
was
wearing
marvolo's
gold-and-black
ring
he
had
already
killed
his
father
sir
is
it
true
that
Professor
Merrythought
is
retiring
he
asked
tom
Tom
if
I
knew
I
couldn't
tell
you
said
Slughorn
wagging
a
reproving
sugar-covered
finger
at
Riddle
though
ruining
the
effect
slightly
by
winking
i
must
say
i'd
like
to
know
where
you
get
your
information
boy
more
knowledgeable
than
half
the
staff
you
are
riddle
smiled
the
other
boys
laughed
and
cast
him
admiring
looks
what
with
your
uncanny
ability
to
know
things
you
shouldnt
and
your
careful
flattery
of
the
people
who
matter
thank
you
fm
the
pineapple
by
the
way
you're
quite
right
it
is
my
favorite
as
several
of
the
boys
tittered
something
very
odd
happened
the
whole
room
was
suddenly
filled
with
a
thick
white
fog
so
that
Harry
could
see
nothing
but
the
face
of
Dumbledore
who
was
standing
beside
him
then
slughorn's
voice
rang
out
through
the
mist
unnaturally
loudly
you'll
go
wrong
boy
mark
my
words
the
fog
cleared
as
suddenly
as
it
had
appeared
and
yet
nobody
made
any
allusion
to
it
nor
did
anybody
look
as
though
anything
unusual
had
just
happened
bewildered
Harry
looked
around
as
a
small
golden
clock
standing
upon
slughorn's
desk
chimed
eleven
o'clock
good
gracious
is
it
that
time
already
said
Slughorn
you'd
better
get
going
boys
or
we'll
all
be
in
trouble
lestrange
I
want
your
essay
by
tomorrow
or
it's
detention
same
goes
for
you
Avery
slughorn
pulled
himself
out
of
his
armchair
and
carried
his
empty
glass
over
to
his
desk
as
the
boys
filed
out
voldemort
however
stayed
behind
harry
could
tell
he
had
dawdled
deliberately
wanting
to
be
last
in
the
room
with
Slughorn
look
sharp
Tom
said
Slughorn
turning
around
and
finding
him
still
present
you
don't
want
to
be
caught
out
of
bed
out
of
hours
and
you
a
prefect
sir
I
wanted
to
ask
you
something
ask
away
then
m'boy
ask
away
sir
I
wondered
what
you
know
about
about
Horcruxes
and
it
happened
all
over
again
The
dense
fog
filled
the
room
so
that
Harry
could
not
see
Slughorn
or
Voldemort
at
all
only
Dumbledore
smiling
serenely
beside
him
then
slughorn's
voice
boomed
out
again
just
as
it
had
done
before
i
don't
know
anything
about
Horcruxes
and
I
wouldn't
tell
you
if
I
did
now
get
out
of
here
at
once
and
dont
let
me
catch
you
mentioning
them
again
well
that's
that
said
Dumbledore
placidly
beside
Harry
time
to
go
and
harry's
feet
left
the
floor
to
fall
seconds
later
back
onto
the
rug
in
front
of
dumbledore's
desk
that's
all
there
is
said
Harry
blankly
dumbledore
had
said
that
this
was
the
most
important
memory
of
all
but
he
could
not
see
what
was
so
significant
about
it
admittedly
the
fog
and
the
fact
that
nobody
seemed
to
have
noticed
it
was
odd
but
other
than
that
nothing
seemed
to
have
happened
except
that
Voldemort
had
asked
a
question
and
failed
to
get
an
answer
as
you
might
have
noticed
said
Dumbledore
reseating
himself
behind
his
desk
that
memory
has
been
tampered
with
tampered
with
repeated
Harry
sitting
back
down
too
certainly
said
Dumbledore
professor
Slughorn
has
meddled
with
his
own
recollections
but
why
would
he
do
that
because
I
think
he
is
ashamed
of
what
he
remembers
said
Dumbledore
he
has
tried
to
rework
the
memory
to
show
himself
in
a
better
light
obliterating
those
parts
which
he
does
not
wish
me
to
see
it
is
as
you
will
have
noticed
very
crudely
done
and
that
is
all
to
the
good
for
it
shows
that
the
true
memory
is
still
there
beneath
the
alterations
and
so
for
the
first
time
I
am
giving
you
homework
Harry
it
will
be
your
job
to
persuade
Professor
Slughorn
to
divulge
the
real
memory
which
will
undoubtedly
be
our
most
crucial
piece
of
information
of
all
harry
stared
at
him
but
surely
sir
he
said
keeping
his
voice
as
respectful
as
possible
you
don't
need
me
you
could
use
Legilimency
or
Veritaserum
professor
Slughorn
is
an
extremely
able
wizard
who
will
be
expecting
both
said
Dumbledore
he
is
much
more
accomplished
at
Occlumency
than
poor
Morfin
Gaunt
and
I
would
be
astonished
if
he
has
not
carried
an
antidote
to
Veritaserum
with
him
ever
since
I
coerced
him
into
giving
me
this
travesty
of
a
recollection
no
I
think
it
would
be
foolish
to
attempt
to
wrest
the
truth
from
Professor
Slughorn
by
force
and
might
do
much
more
harm
than
good
I
do
not
wish
him
to
leave
Hogwarts
however
he
has
his
weaknesses
like
the
rest
of
us
and
I
believe
that
you
are
the
one
person
who
might
be
able
to
penetrate
his
defenses
it
is
most
important
that
we
secure
the
true
memory
Harry
how
important
we
will
only
know
when
we
have
seen
the
real
thing
so
good
luck
and
good
night
a
little
taken
aback
by
the
abrupt
dismissal
Harry
got
to
his
feet
quickly
good
night
sir
as
he
closed
the
study
door
behind
him
he
distinctly
heard
Phineas
Nigellus
say
I
can't
see
why
the
boy
should
be
able
to
do
it
better
than
you
Dumbledore
i
wouldn't
expect
you
to
Phineas
replied
Dumbledore
and
Fawkes
gave
another
low
musical
cry
chapter
Birthday
Surprises
the
next
day
Harry
confided
in
both
Ron
and
Hermione
the
task
that
Dumbledore
had
set
him
though
separately
for
Hermione
still
refused
to
remain
in
ron's
presence
longer
than
it
took
to
give
him
a
contemptuous
look
ron
thought
that
Harry
was
unlikely
to
have
any
trouble
with
Slughorn
at
all
he
loves
you
he
said
over
breakfast
waving
an
airy
forkful
of
fried
egg
won't
refuse
you
anything
will
he
not
his
little
Potions
Prince
just
hang
back
after
class
this
afternoon
and
ask
him
hermione
however
took
a
gloomier
view
he
must
be
determined
to
hide
what
really
happened
if
Dumbledore
couldn't
get
it
out
of
him
she
said
in
a
low
voice
as
they
stood
in
the
deserted
snowy
courtyard
at
break
horcruxes
horcruxes
i've
never
even
heard
of
them
you
haven't
harry
was
disappointed
he
had
hoped
that
Hermione
might
have
been
able
to
give
him
a
clue
as
to
what
Horcruxes
were
they
must
be
really
advanced
Dark
magic
or
why
would
Voldemort
have
wanted
to
know
about
them
i
think
it's
going
to
be
difficult
to
get
the
information
Harry
you'll
have
to
be
very
careful
about
how
you
approach
Slughorn
think
out
a
strategy
ron
reckons
should
just
hang
back
after
Potions
this
afternoon
oh
well
if
Won-Won
thinks
that
you'd
better
do
it
she
said
flaring
up
at
once
after
all
when
has
won-won's
judgement
ever
been
faulty
hermione
can't
you
no
she
said
angrily
and
stormed
away
leaving
Harry
alone
and
ankle-deep
in
snow
potions
lessons
were
uncomfortable
enough
these
days
seeing
as
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
had
to
share
a
desk
today
Hermione
moved
her
cauldron
around
the
table
so
that
she
was
close
to
Ernie
and
ignored
both
Harry
and
Ron
what've
you
done
ron
muttered
to
Harry
looking
at
hermione's
haughty
profile
but
before
Harry
could
answer
Slughorn
was
calling
for
silence
from
the
front
of
the
room
settle
down
settle
down
please
quickly
now
lots
of
work
to
get
through
this
afternoon
golpalott's
Third
Law
who
can
tell
me
but
Miss
Granger
can
of
course
hermione
recited
at
top
speed
Golpalott's-Third-Law
states-that-the-antidote-for-a-blended-poison-will-be-equal-to
more-than-the-sum-of-the-antidotes-for-each-of-the-separale
components
precisely
beamed
Slughorn
ten
points
for
Gryffindor
now
if
we
accept
golpalott's
Third
Law
as
true
harry
was
going
to
have
to
take
slughorn's
word
for
it
that
golpalott's
Third
Law
was
true
because
he
had
not
under-stood
any
of
it
nobody
apart
from
Hermione
seemed
to
be
following
what
Slughorn
said
next
either
which
means
of
course
that
assuming
we
have
achieved
correct
identification
of
the
potion's
ingredients
by
scarpin's
Revelaspell
our
primary
aim
is
not
the
relatively
simple
one
of
selecting
antidotes
to
those
ingredients
in
a
of
themselves
but
to
find
that
added
component
which
will
by
an
almost
alchemical
process
transform
these
disparate
elements
ron
was
sitting
beside
Harry
with
his
mouth
half-open
doodling
absently
on
his
new
copy
of
Advanced
Potion-Making
ron
kept
forgetting
that
he
could
no
longer
rely
on
Hermione
to
help
him
out
of
trouble
when
he
failed
to
grasp
what
was
going
on
and
so
finished
Slughorn
I
want
each
of
you
to
come
and
take
one
of
these
phials
from
my
desk
you
are
to
create
an
antidote
for
the
poison
within
it
before
the
end
of
the
lesson
good
luck
and
don't
forget
your
protective
gloves
hermione
had
left
her
stool
and
was
halfway
towards
siughorn's
desk
before
the
rest
of
the
class
had
realised
it
was
time
to
move
and
by
the
time
Harry
Ron
and
Ernie
returned
to
the
table
she
had
already
tipped
the
contents
of
her
phial
into
her
cauldron
and
was
kindling
a
fire
underneath
it
it's
a
shame
that
the
Prince
won't
be
able
to
help
you
much
with
this
Harry
she
said
brightly
as
she
straightened
up
you
have
to
understand
the
principles
involved
this
time
no
short
cuts
or
cheats
annoyed
Harry
uncorked
the
poison
he
had
taken
from
siughorn's
desk
which
was
a
garish
shade
of
pink
tipped
it
into
his
cauldron
and
lit
a
fire
underneath
it
he
did
not
have
the
faintest
idea
what
he
was
supposed
to
do
next
he
glanced
at
Ron
who
was
now
standing
there
looking
rather
gormless
having
copied
everything
Harry
had
done
you
sure
the
Prince
hasn't
got
any
tips
ron
muttered
to
Harry
harry
pulled
out
his
trusty
copy
of
Advanced
Potion-Making
and
turned
to
the
chapter
on
Antidotes
there
was
golpalott's
Third
Law
stated
word
for
word
as
Hermione
had
recited
it
but
not
a
single
illuminating
note
in
the
prince's
hand
to
explain
what
it
meant
apparently
the
Prince
like
Hermione
had
had
no
difficulty
understanding
it
nothing
said
Harry
gloomily
hermione
was
now
waving
her
wand
enthusiastically
over
her
cauldron
unfortunately
they
could
not
copy
the
spell
she
was
doing
because
she
was
now
so
good
at
non-verbal
incan-tations
that
she
did
not
need
to
say
the
words
aloud
ernie
Macmillan
however
was
muttering
Specialis
revelio
over
his
cauldron
which
sounded
impressive
so
Harry
and
Ron
hastened
to
imitate
him
it
took
Harry
only
five
minutes
to
realise
that
his
reputa-tion
as
the
best
potion-maker
in
the
class
was
crashing
around
his
ears
slughorn
had
peered
hopefully
into
his
cauldron
on
his
first
circuit
of
the
dungeon
preparing
to
exclaim
in
delight
as
he
usually
did
and
instead
had
with-drawn
his
head
hastily
coughing
as
the
smell
of
bad
eggs
overwhelmed
him
hermione's
expression
could
not
have
been
any
smugger
she
had
loathed
being
out-performed
in
every
Potions
class
she
was
now
decanting
the
mysteriously
separated
ingredients
of
her
poison
into
ten
different
crystal
phials
more
to
avoid
watching
this
irritating
sight
than
any-thing
else
Harry
bent
over
the
Half-Blood
prince's
book
and
turned
a
few
pages
with
unnecessary
force
and
there
it
was
scrawled
right
across
a
long
list
of
antidotes
just
shove
a
bezoar
down
their
throats
harry
stared
at
these
words
for
a
moment
hadn't
he
once
long
ago
heard
of
bezoars
hadn't
Snape
mentioned
them
in
their
first
ever
Potions
lesson
a
stone
taken
from
the
stomach
of
a
goat
which
will
protect
from
most
poisons
it
was
not
an
answer
to
the
Golpalott
problem
and
had
Snape
still
been
their
teacher
Harry
would
not
have
dared
do
it
but
this
was
a
moment
for
desperate
measures
he
hastened
towards
the
store
cupboard
and
rummaged
within
it
pushing
aside
unicorn
horns
and
tangles
of
dried
herbs
until
he
found
at
the
very
back
a
small
card
box
on
which
had
been
scribbled
the
word
Bezoars
he
opened
the
box
just
as
Slughorn
called
Two
minutes
left
everyone
inside
were
half
a
dozen
shrivelled
brown
objects
looking
more
like
dried-up
kidneys
than
real
stones
harry
seized
one
put
the
box
back
in
the
cupboard
and
hurried
back
to
his
cauldron
time's
up
called
Slughorn
genially
well
let's
see
how
you've
done
blaise
what
have
you
got
for
me
slowly
Slughorn
moved
around
the
room
examining
the
various
antidotes
nobody
had
finished
the
task
although
Hermione
was
trying
to
cram
a
few
more
ingredients
into
her
bottle
before
Slughorn
reached
her
ron
had
given
up
com-pletely
and
was
merely
trying
to
avoid
breathing
in
the
putrid
fumes
issuing
from
his
cauldron
harry
stood
there
waiting
the
bezoar
clutched
in
a
slightly
sweaty
hand
slughorn
reached
their
table
last
he
sniffed
ernie's
potion
and
passed
on
to
ron's
with
a
grimace
he
did
not
linger
over
ron's
cauldron
but
backed
away
swiftly
retching
slightly
and
you
Harry
he
said
what
have
you
got
to
show
me
harry
held
out
his
hand
the
bezoar
sitting
on
his
palm
slughorn
looked
down
at
it
for
a
full
ten
seconds
harry
wondered
for
a
moment
whether
he
was
going
to
shout
at
him
then
he
threw
back
his
head
and
roared
with
laughter
you've
got
a
nerve
boy
he
boomed
taking
the
bezoar
and
holding
it
up
so
that
the
class
could
see
it
oh
you're
like
your
mother
well
can't
fault
you
a
bezoar
would
certainly
act
as
an
antidote
to
all
these
potions
hermione
who
was
sweaty-faced
and
had
soot
on
her
nose
looked
livid
her
half-finished
antidote
comprising
fifty-two
ingredients
including
a
chunk
of
her
own
hair
bubbled
sluggishly
behind
Slughorn
who
had
eyes
for
nobody
but
Harry
and
you
thought
of
a
bezoar
all
by
yourself
did
you
Harry
she
asked
through
gritted
teeth
that's
the
individual
spirit
a
real
potion-maker
needs
said
Slughorn
happily
before
Harry
could
reply
just
like
his
mother
she
had
the
same
intuitive
grasp
of
potion-making
it's
undoubtedly
from
Lily
he
gets
it
yes
Harry
yes
if
you've
got
a
bezoar
to
hand
of
course
that
would
do
the
trick
although
as
they
don't
work
on
everything
and
are
pretty
rare
it's
still
worth
knowing
how
to
mix
antidotes
the
only
person
in
the
room
looking
angrier
than
Hermione
was
Malfoy
who
Harry
was
pleased
to
see
had
spilled
some-thing
that
looked
like
cat
sick
over
himself
before
either
of
them
could
express
their
fury
that
Harry
had
come
top
of
the
class
by
not
doing
any
work
however
the
bell
rang
time
to
pack
up
said
Slughorn
and
an
extra
ten
points
to
Gryffindor
for
sheer
cheek
still
chuckling
he
waddled
back
to
his
desk
at
the
front
of
the
dungeon
harry
dawdled
behind
taking
an
inordinate
amount
of
time
to
do
up
his
bag
neither
Ron
nor
Hermione
wished
him
luck
as
they
left
both
looked
rather
annoyed
at
last
Harry
and
Slughorn
were
the
only
two
left
in
the
room
come
on
now
Harry
you'll
be
late
for
your
next
lesson
said
Slughorn
affably
snapping
the
gold
clasps
shut
on
his
dragonskin
briefcase
sir
said
Harry
reminding
himself
irresistibly
of
Voldemort
wanted
to
ask
you
something
ask
away
then
my
dear
boy
ask
away
sir
wondered
what
you
know
about
about
Horcruxes
slughorn
froze
his
round
face
seemed
to
sink
in
upon
itself
he
licked
his
lips
and
said
hoarsely
What
did
you
say
i
asked
whether
you
know
anything
about
Horcruxes
sir
you
see
dumbledore
put
you
up
to
this
whispered
Slughorn
his
voice
had
changed
completely
it
was
not
genial
any
more
but
shocked
terrified
he
fumbled
in
his
breast
pocket
and
pulled
out
a
handkerchief
mopping
his
sweating
brow
dumbledore's
shown
you
that
that
memory
said
Slughorn
well
hasn't
he
yes
said
Harry
deciding
on
the
spot
that
it
was
best
not
to
lie
yes
of
course
said
Slughorn
quietly
still
dabbing
at
his
white
face
of
course
well
if
you've
seen
that
memory
Harry
you'll
know
that
I
don't
know
anything
anything
he
repeated
the
word
forcefully
about
Horcruxes
he
seized
his
dragonskin
briefcase
stuffed
his
handkerchief
back
into
his
pocket
and
marched
to
the
dungeon
door
sir
said
Harry
desperately
I
just
thought
there
might
be
a
bit
more
to
the
memory
did
you
said
Slughorn
then
you
were
wrong
weren't
you
wrong
he
bellowed
the
last
word
and
before
Harry
could
say
another
word
slammed
the
dungeon
door
behind
him
neither
Ron
nor
Hermione
was
at
all
sympathetic
when
Harry
told
them
of
this
disastrous
interview
Hermione
was
still
seething
at
the
way
Harry
had
triumphed
without
doing
the
work
properly
ron
was
resentful
that
Harry
hadn't
slipped
him
a
bezoar
too
it
would've
just
looked
stupid
if
we'd
both
done
it
said
Harry
irritably
look
I
had
to
try
and
soften
him
up
so
I
could
ask
him
about
Voldemort
didn't
I
oh
will
you
gel
a
grip
he
added
in
exasperation
as
Ron
winced
at
the
sound
of
the
name
infuriated
by
his
failure
and
by
Ron
and
hermione's
atti
tudes
Harry
brooded
for
the
next
few
days
over
what
to
do
next
about
Slughorn
he
decided
that
for
the
time
being
he
would
let
Slughorn
think
that
he
had
forgotten
all
about
Horcruxes
it
was
surely
best
to
lull
him
into
a
false
sense
of
security
before
returning
to
the
attack
when
Harry
did
noi
question
Slughorn
again
the
Potions
master
reverted
to
his
usual
affectionate
treatment
of
him
and
appeared
to
have
put
the
matter
from
his
mind
harry
awaited
an
invitation
to
one
of
his
little
evening
parties
determined
to
accept
this
time
even
if
he
had
to
reschedule
Quidditch
prac
tice
unfortunately
however
no
such
invitation
arrived
harry
checked
with
Hermione
and
Ginny
neither
of
them
had
received
an
invitation
and
nor
as
far
as
they
knew
had
anybody
else
harry
could
not
help
wondering
whether
this
meant
that
Slughorn
was
not
quite
as
forgetful
as
he
appeared
simply
determined
to
give
Harry
no
additional
opportunities
to
question
him
meanwhile
the
Hogwarts
library
had
failed
Hermione
for
the
first
lime
in
living
memory
she
was
so
shocked
she
even
forgot
that
she
was
annoyed
at
Harry
for
his
trick
with
the
bezoar
i
haven't
found
one
single
explanation
of
what
Horcruxes
do
she
told
him
not
a
single
one
i've
been
right
through
the
restricted
section
and
even
in
the
most
horrible
books
where
they
tell
you
how
to

the
most
gruesome
potions
nothing
all
I
could
find

this
in

listen
of
the
Horcrux
wickedest
of

we
shall

it
then
she
said
impatiently
slamming
the
old
book
shut
it
let
out
a
ghostly
wail
oh
shut
up
she
snapped
stuffing
it
back
into
her
bag
i

the
snow
melted
around
the
school
as
February
arrived
to
be
replaced
by
cold
dreary
wetness
purplish-grey
clouds
hung
low
over
the
castle
and
a
constant
fall
of
chilly
rain
made
the
lawns
slippery
and
muddy
the
upshot
of
this
was
that
the
sixth-years
first
Apparition
lesson
which
was
sched-uled
for
a
Saturday
morning
so
that
no
normal
lessons
would
be
missed
took
place
in
the
Great
Hall
instead
of
in
the
grounds
when
Harry
and
Hermione
arrived
in
the
Hall
Ron
had
come
down
with
Lavender
they
found
that
the
tables
had
disappeared
rain
lashed
against
the
high
windows
and
the
enchanted
ceiling
swirled
darkly
above
them
as
they
assembled
in
front
of
Professors
McGonagall
Snape
Flitwick
and
Sprout
the
Heads
of
House
and
a
small
wizard
whom
Harry
took
to
be
the
Apparition
Instructor
from
the
Ministry
he
was
oddly
colourless
with
transparent
eyelashes
wispy
hair
and
an
insubstantial
air
as
though
a
single
gust
of
wind
might
blow
him
away
harry
wondered
whether
constant
dis-appearances
and
reappearances
had
somehow
diminished
his
substance
or
whether
this
frail
build
was
ideal
for
anyone
wishing
to
vanish
good
morning
said
the
Ministry
wizard
when
all
the
stu-dents
had
arrived
and
the
Heads
of
House
had
called
for
quiet
my
name
is
Wilkie
Twycross
and
I
shall
be
your
Ministry-Apparition
Instructor
for
the
next
twelve
weeks
hope
to
be
able
to
prepare
you
for
your
Apparition
test
in
this
time
malfoy
be
quiet
and
pay
attention
barked
Professor
McGonagall
everybody
looked
round
malfoy
had
flushed
a
dull
pink
he
looked
furious
as
he
stepped
away
from
Crabbe
with
whom
he
appeared
to
have
been
having
a
whispered
argu-ment
harry
glanced
quickly
at
Snape
who
also
looked
annoyed
though
Harry
strongly
suspected
that
this
was
less
because
of
malfoy's
rudeness
than
the
fact
that
McGonagall
had
reprimanded
one
of
his
house
by
which
time
many
of
you
may
be
ready
to
take
your
test
Twycross
continued
as
though
there
had
been
no
interruption
as
you
may
know
it
is
usually
impossible
to
Apparate
or
Disapparate
within
Hogwarts
the
Headmaster
has
lifted
this
enchantment
purely
within
the
Great
Hall
for
one
hour
so
as
to
enable
you
to
practise
may
I
emphasise
that
you
will
not
be
able
to
Apparate
outside
the
walls
of
this
Hall
and
that
you
would
be
unwise
to
try
i
would
like
each
of
you
to
place
yourselves
now
so
that
you
have
a
clear
five
feet
of
space
in
front
of
you
there
was
a
great
scrambiing
and
jostling
as
people
separ-ated
banged
into
each
other
and
ordered
others
out
of
their
space
the
Heads
of
House
moved
among
the
students
marshalling
them
into
position
and
breaking
up
arguments
harry
where
are
you
going
demanded
Hermione
but
Harry
did
not
answer
he
was
moving
quickly
through
the
crowd
past
the
place
where
Professor
Flitwick
was
making
squeaky
attempts
to
position
a
few
Ravenclaws
all
of
whom
wanted
to
be
near
the
front
past
Professor
Sprout
who
was
chivvying
the
Hufflepuffs
into
line
until
by
dodging
around
Ernie
Macmillan
he
managed
to
position
himself
right
at
the
back
of
the
crowd
directly
behind
Malfoy
who
was
taking
advantage
of
the
general
upheaval
to
continue
his
argument
with
Crabbe
standing
five
feet
away
and
looking
mutinous
i
don't
know
how
much
longer
all
right
malfoy
shot
at
him
oblivious
to
Harry
standing
right
behind
him
it's
taking
longer
than
I
thought
it
would
crabbe
opened
his
mouth
but
Malfoy
appeared
to
second-guess
what
he
was
going
to
say
look
it's
none
of
your
business
what
i'm
doing
Crabbe
you
and
Goyle
just
do
as
you're
told
and
keep
a
lookout
tell
my
friends
what
i'm
up
to
if
I
want
them
to
keep
a
lookout
for
me
Harry
said
just
loud
enough
for
Malfoy
to
hear
him
malfoy
spun
round
on
the
spot
his
hand
flying
to
his
wand
but
at
thai
precise
moment
the
four
Heads
of
House
shouted
Quiet
and
silence
fell
again
malfoy
turned
slowly
to
face
the
front
thank
you
said
Twycross
Now
then
he
waved
his
wand
old-fashioned
wooden
hoops
instantly
appeared
on
the
floor
in
from
of
every
student
the
important
things
to
remember
when
Apparating
are
the
three
Ds
said
Twycross
destination
Determination
Deliberation
step
one
fix
your
mind
firmly
upon
the
desired
destin-ation
said
Twycross
in
this
case
the
interior
of
your
hoop
kindly
concentrate
upon
that
destination
now
everybody
looked
around
furtively
to
check
that
everyone
else
was
staring
into
their
hoop
then
hastily
did
as
they
were
told
harry
gazed
at
the
circular
patch
of
dusty
floor
enclosed
by
his
hoop
and
tried
hard
to
think
of
nothing
else
this
proved
impossible
as
he
couldn't
stop
puzzling
over
what
Malfoy
was
doing
that
needed
lookouts
step
two
said
Twycross
focus
your
determination
to
occupy
the
visualised
space
let
your
yearning
to
enter
it
flood
from
your
mind
to
every
particle
of
your
body
harry
glanced
around
surreptitiously
a
little
way
to
his
left
Ernie
Macmillan
was
contemplating
his
hoop
so
hard
that
his
face
had
turned
pink
it
looked
as
though
he
was
straining
to
lay
a
quaffle-sized
egg
harry
bit
back
a
laugh
and
hastily
returned
his
gaze
to
his
own
hoop
step
three
called
Twycross
and
only
when
give
the
com-mand
lum
on
the
spot
feeiing
your
way
into
nothingness
moving
with
deliberation
on
my
command
now
one
harry
glanced
around
again
lots
of
people
were
looking
positively
alarmed
at
being
asked
to
Apparate
so
quickly
harry
tried
to
fix
his
thoughts
on
his
hoop
again
he
had
already
forgotten
what
the
three
Ds
stood
for
three
harry
spun
on
the
spot
lost
his
balance
and
nearly
fell
over
he
was
not
the
only
one
the
whole
Hall
was
suddenly
full
of
staggering
people
Neville
was
flat
on
his
back
Ernie
Macmillan
on
the
other
hand
had
done
a
kind
of
pirouet-ting
leap
into
his
hoop
and
looked
momentarily
thrilled
until
he
caught
sight
of
Dean
Thomas
roaring
with
laughter
at
him
never
mind
never
mind
said
Twycross
dryly
who
did
not
seem
to
have
expected
anything
better
adjust
your
hoops
please
and
back
to
your
original
positions
the
second
atlem
pt
was
no
better
than
the
first
the
third
was
just
as
bad
not
until
the
fourth
did
anything
exciting
happen
there
was
a
horrible
screech
of
pain
and
everybody
looked
around
terrified
to
see
Susan
Bones
of
Hufflepuff
wobbling
in
her
hoop
with
her
left
leg
still
standing
five
feet
away
where
she
had
started
the
Heads
of
House
converged
on
her
there
was
a
great
bang
and
a
puff
of
purple
smoke
which
cleared
to
reveal
Susan
sobbing
reunited
with
her
leg
but
looking
horrified
sph'nching
or
the
separation
of
random
body
parts
said
Wilkie
Twycross
dispassionately
occurs
when
the
mind
is
insufficiently
determined
you
must
concentrate
continually
upon
your
destination
and
move
without
hasie
but
with
deliberation
thus
twycross
stepped
forwards
turned
gracefully
on
the
spot
with
his
arms
outstretched
and
vanished
in
a
swirl
of
robes
reappearing
at
the
back
of
the
Hall
remember
the
three
Ds
he
said
and
try
again
one
two
three
but
an
hour
later
susan's
Splinching
was
still
ihe
most
interesting
thing
that
had
happened
twycross
did
not
seem
discouraged
fastening
his
cloak
at
his
neck
he
merely
said
Until
next
Saturday
everybody
and
do
not
forget
destin-ation
determination
deliberation
with
that
he
waved
his
wand
Vanishing
the
hoops
and
walked
out
of
the
Hall
accompanied
by
Professor
McGonagall
talk
broke
out
at
once
as
people
began
moving
towards
the
Entrance
Hall
how
did
you
do
asked
Ron
hurrying
towards
Harry
think
felt
something
the
last
time
I
tried
a
kind
of
tingling
in
my
feet
expect
your
trainers
are
too
small
Won-Won
said
a
voice
behind
them
and
Hermione
stalked
past
smirking
didn't
feel
anything
said
Harry
ignoring
this
inter-ruption
but
don't
care
about
that
now
what
d'you
mean
you
don't
care
don't
you
want
to
leam
to
Apparate
said
Ron
incredulously
i'm
not
fussed
really
i
prefer
flying
said
Harry
glancing
over
his
shoulder
to
see
where
Malfoy
was
and
speeding
up
as
they
came
into
the
Entrance
Hall
look
hurry
up
will
you
there's
something
I
want
to
do
perplexed
Ron
followed
Harry
back
to
Gryffindor
Tower
at
a
run
they
were
temporarily
detained
by
Peeves
who
had
jammed
a
door
on
the
fourth
floor
shut
and
was
refusing
to
let
anyone
pass
until
they
set
fire
to
their
own
pants
but
Harry
and
Ron
simply
turned
back
and
took
one
of
their
trusted
short
cuts
within
five
minutes
they
were
climbing
through
the
portrait
hole
are
you
going
to
tell
me
what
we're
doing
then
asked
Ron
panting
slightly
up
here
said
Harry
and
he
crossed
the
common
room
and
led
the
way
through
the
door
to
the
boys
staircase
their
dormitory
was
as
Ham
had
hoped
empty
he
flung
open
his
trunk
and
began
to
rummage
in
it
while
Ron
watched
impatiently
harry
malfoy's
using
Crabbe
and
Goyle
as
lookouts
he
was
argu-ing
with
Crabbe
just
now
want
to
know
aha
he
had
found
it
a
folded
square
of
apparently
blank
parchment
which
he
now
smoothed
out
and
tapped
with
he
tip
of
his
wand
i
solemn
swear
that
I
am
up
to
no
good
or
Malfoy
is
at
once
the
marauder's
Map
appeared
on
the
parchment's
surface
here
was
a
detailed
plan
of
every
one
of
the
castle's
floors
and
moving
around
it
the
tiny
labelled
black
dots
that
signified
each
of
the
castle's
occupants
help
me
find
Malfoy
said
Harry
urgently
he
laid
the
map
upon
his
bed
and
he
and
Ron
leaned
over
it
searching
there
said
Ron
after
a
minute
or
so
he's
in
the
Slytherin
common
room
look
with
Parkinson
and
Zabini
and
Crabbe
and
Goyle
harry
looked
down
at
the
map
disappointed
but
rallied
almost
at
once
well
i'm
keeping
an
eye
on
him
from
now
on
he
said
firmly
and
the
moment
see
him
lurking
somewhere
with
Crabbe
and
Goyle
keeping
watch
outside
it'll
be
on
with
the
old
Invisibility
Cloak
and
off
to
find
out
what
he's
he
broke
off
as
Neville
entered
the
dormitory
bringing
with
him
a
strong
smell
of
singed
material
and
began
rum-maging
in
his
trunk
for
a
fresh
pair
of
pants
despite
his
determination
catch
Malfoy
out
Harry
had
no
luck
at
all
over
the
next
couple
of
weeks
although
he
consulted
the
map
as
often
as
he
could
sometimes
making
unnecessary
visits
to
the
bathroom
between
lessons
to
search
it
he
did
not
once
see
Malfoy
anywhere
suspicious
admit-tedly
he
spotted
Crabbe
and
Goyle
moving
around
the
castle
on
their
own
more
often
than
usual
sometimes
remaining
stationary
in
deserted
corridors
but
at
these
times
Malfoy
was
not
only
nowhere
near
them
but
impossible
to
locate
on
the
map
at
all
this
was
most
mysterious
harry
toyed
with
the
possibility
that
Malfoy
was
actually
leaving
the
school
grounds
but
could
not
see
how
he
could
be
doing
it
given
the
very
high
leve
of
security
now
operating
within
the
castle
he
could
only
suppose
ihat
he
was
missing
Malfoy
amongst
the
hundreds
of
tiny
black
dots
upon
the
map
as
for
the
fact
that
Malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
appeared
to
be
going
their
dif-ferent
ways
when
they
were
usually
inseparable
these
things
happened
as
people
got
older
Ron
and
Hermione
Harry
reflected
sadly
were
living
proof
february
moved
towards
March
with
no
change
in
the
weather
except
that
it
became
windy
as
well
as
wet
to
general
indignation
a
sign
went
up
on
all
common-room
noticeboards
that
the
next
trip
into
Hogsmeade
had
been
cancelled
ron
was
furious
it
was
on
my
birthday
he
said
i
was
looking
forward
to
that
not
a
big
surprise
though
is
it
said
Harry
not
after
what
happened
to
Katie
she
had
still
not
returned
from
Si
mungo's
what
was
more
further
disappearances
had
been
reported
in
the
Daily
Prophet
including
several
relatives
of
students
at
Hogwarts
but
now
all
i've
got
to
look
forward
to
is
stupid
appar-ition
said
Ron
grumpily
big
birthday
treat
three
lessons
on
Apparition
was
proving
as
difficult
as
ever
though
a
few
more
people
had
managed
to
Splinch
themselves
frustration
was
running
high
and
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
ill-feeling
towards
Wilkie
Twycross
and
his
three
Ds
which
had
inspired
a
number
of
nicknames
for
him
the
politest
of
which
were
dog-breath
and
dung-head
happy
birthday
Ron
said
Harry
when
they
were
woken
on
the
first
of
March
by
Seamus
and
Dean
leaving
noisily
for
breakfast
have
a
present
he
threw
the
package
across
on
to
ron's
bed
where
it
joined
a
small
pile
of
them
that
must
Harry
assumed
have
been
delivered
by
house-elves
in
the
night
cheers
said
Ron
drowsily
and
as
he
ripped
off
the
paper
Harry
got
out
of
bed
opened
his
own
crunk
and
began
rum-maging
in
it
for
the
marauder's
Map
which
he
hid
after
every
use
he
turfed
out
half
the
contents
of
his
trunk
before
he
found
it
hiding
beneath
the
rolled-up
socks
in
which
he
was
still
keeping
his
bottle
of
lucky
potion
Felix
Felicis
right
he
murmured
taking
it
back
to
bed
with
him
tap-ping
it
quietly
and
murmuring
I
solemnly
swear
that
I
am
up
to
no
good
so
that
Neville
who
was
passing
the
foot
of
his
bed
at
the
time
would
not
hear
nice
one
Harry
said
Ron
enthusiastically
waving
the
new
pair
of
Quidditch
keeper's
gloves
Harry
had
given
him
no
problem
said
Harry
absent-mindedly
as
he
searched
the
Slytherin
dormitory
closely
for
Malfoy
hey
i
don't
think
he's
in
his
bed
ron
did
not
answer
he
was
too
busy
unwrapping
presents
every
now
and
then
letting
out
an
exclamation
of
pleasure
seriously
good
haul
this
year
he
announced
holding
up
a
heavy
gold
watch
with
odd
symbols
around
the
edge
and
tiny
moving
stars
instead
of
hands
see
what
Mum
and
Dad
got
me
blimey
I
think
i'll
come
of
age
next
year
too
cool
muttered
Harry
sparing
the
watch
a
glance
before
peering
more
closely
at
the
map
where
was
Malfoy
he
did
not
seem
to
be
at
the
Slytherin
table
in
the
Great
Hall
eating
breakfast
he
was
nowhere
near
Snape
who
was
sitting
in
his
study
he
wasn't
in
any
of
the
bathrooms
or
in
the
hospital
wing
want
one
said
Ron
thickly
holding
out
a
box
of
Chocolate
Cauldrons
no
thanks
said
Harry
looking
up
malfoy's
gone
again
can't
have
done
said
Ron
stuffing
a
second
Cauldron
into
his
mouth
as
he
slid
out
of
bed
to
get
dressed
come
on
if
you
don't
hurry
up
you'll
have
to
Apparate
on
an
empty-stomach
might
make
it
easier
suppose
ron
looked
thoughtfully
ai
the
box
of
Chocolate
Cauldrons
then
shrugged
and
helped
himself
to
a
third
harry
tapped
the
map
with
his
wand
muttered
Mischief
managed
though
it
hadn't
been
and
got
dressed
thinking
hard
there
had
to
be
an
explanation
for
malfoy's
periodic
disappearances
but
he
simply
could
not
think
what
it
could
be
the
best
way
of
finding
out
would
be
to
tail
him
bur
even
with
the
Invisibility
Cloak
this
was
an
impractical
idea
he
had
lessons
Quidditch
practice
homework
and
Apparition
he
could
not
follow
Malfoy
around
school
all
day
wilhout
his
absence
being
remarked
upon
ready
he
said
to
Ron
he
was
halfway
to
the
dormitory
door
when
he
realised
that
Ron
had
not
moved
but
was
leaning
on
his
bedpost
staring
out
of
the
rain-washed
window
with
a
strangely
un-focused
look
on
his
face
ron
breakfast
i'm
not
hungry
harry
stared
ai
him
i
thought
you
just
said
Well
all
right
i'll
come
down
with
you
sighed
Ron
but
I
don't
want
to
eat
harry
scrutinised
him
suspiciously
you've
just
eaten
half
a
box
of
Chocolate
Cauldrons
haven't
you
it's
not
that
Ron
sighed
again
you
you
wouldn't
understand
fair
enough
said
Harry
albeit
puzzled
as
he
turned
to
open
the
door
harry
said
Ron
suddenly
what
harry
I
can't
stand
it
you
can't
stand
what
asked
Harry
now
starling
to
feel
definitely
alarmed
ron
was
rather
pale
and
looked
as
though
he
was
about
to
be
sick
i
can't
stop
thinking
about
her
said
Ron
hoarsely
harry
gaped
at
him
he
had
not
expected
this
and
was
not
sure
he
wanted
to
hear
it
friends
they
might
be
but
if
Ron
started
calling
Lavender
Lav-Lav
he
would
have
to
pui
his
foot
down
why
does
that
stop
you
having
breakfast
harry
asked
trying
to
inject
a
note
of
common
sense
into
the
proceedings
i
don't
think
she
knows
I
exist
said
Ron
with
a
desperate
gesture
she
definitely
knows
you
exist
said
Harry
bewildered
she
keeps
snogging
you
doesn't
she
ron
blinked
who
are
you
talking
about
who
are
you
talking
about
said
Harry
with
an
increasing
sense
that
all
reason
had
dropped
out
of
the
conversation
romilda
Vane
said
Ron
softly
and
his
whole
face
seemed
to
illuminate
as
he
said
it
as
though
hit
by
a
ray
of
purest
sunlight
they
stared
at
each
other
for
almost
a
whole
minute
before
Harry
said
This
is
a
joke
right
you're
joking
t
think
harry
ihink
I
love
her
said
Ron
in
a
strangled
voice
ok
said
Harry
walking
up
to
Ron
get
a
better
look
at
the
glazed
eyes
and
the
pallid
complexion
ok
say
that
again
with
a
straight
face
i
love
her
repeated
Ron
breathlessly
have
you
seen
her
hair
it's
all
black
and
shiny
and
silky
and
her
eyes
her
big
dark
eyes
and
her
this
is
really
funny
and
everything
said
Harry
impatiently
but
joke's
over
all
right
drop
it
he
turned
to
leave
he
had
got
two
steps
towards
the
door
when
a
crashing
blow
hit
him
on
the
right
ear
staggering
he
looked
round
ron's
fist
was
drawn
right
back
his
face
was
contorted
with
rage
he
was
about
to
strike
again
harry
reacted
instinctively
his
wand
was
out
of
his
pocket
and
the
incantation
sprang
to
mind
without
conscious
thought
Leicorpus
ron
yelled
as
his
heel
was
wrenched
upwards
once
more
he
dangled
helplessly
upside-down
his
robes
hanging
off
him
what
was
that
for
harry
bellowed
you
insulted
her
Harry
you
said
it
was
a
joke
shouted
Ron
who
was
slowly
turning
purple
in
the
face
as
all
the
blood
rushed
to
his
head
this
is
insane
said
Harry
what's
got
into
and
then
he
saw
the
box
lying
open
on
ron's
bed
and
the
truth
hit
him
with
the
force
of
a
stampeding
troll
where
did
you
get
those
Chocolate
Cauldrons
they
were
a
birthday
present
shouted
Ron
revolving
slowly
in
midair
as
he
struggled
to
get
free
offered
you
one
didn't
you
just
picked
them
up
off
the
floor
didn't
you
they'd
fallen
off
my
bed
all
right
let
me
go
they
didn't
fall
off
your
bed
you
prat
don't
you
under-stand
they
were
mine
chucked
them
out
of
my
trunk
when
was
looking
for
the
map
they're
the
Chocolate
Cauldrons
Romilda
gave
me
before
Christmas
and
they're
all
spiked
with
love
potion
but
only
one
word
of
this
seemed
to
have
registered
with
Ron
romilda
he
repeated
did
you
say
Romilda
harry
do
you
know
her
can
you
introduce
me
harry
stared
at
the
dangling
Ron
whose
face
now
looked
tremendously
hopeful
and
fought
a
strong
desire
to
laugh
a
part
of
him
the
part
closest
to
his
throbbing
right
ear
was
quite
keen
on
the
idea
of
letting
Ron
down
and
watching
him
run
amok
until
the
effects
of
the
potion
wore
off
but
on
the
other
hand
they
were
supposed
to
be
friends
Ron
had
not
been
himself
when
he
had
attacked
and
Harry
thought
that
he
would
deserve
another
punching
if
he
permitted
Ron
to
declare
undying
love
for
Romilda
Vane
yeah
i'll
introduce
you
said
Harry
thinking
fast
i'm
going
to
let
you
down
now
ok
he
sent
Ron
crashing
back
to
the
floor
his
ear
did
hurt
quite
a
lot
but
Ron
simply
bounded
to
his
feet
again
grinning
she'll
be
in
slughorn's
office
said
Harry
confidently
leading
the
way
to
the
door
why
will
she
be
in
there
asked
Ron
anxiously
hurrying
to
keep
up
oh
she
has
extra
Potions
lessons
with
him
said
Harry
inventing
wildly
maybe
could
ask
if
can
have
them
with
her
said
Ron
eagerly
great
idea
said
Harry
lavender
was
waiting
beside
the
portrait
hole
a
complication
Harry
had
not
foreseen
you're
lace
Won-Won
she
pouted
i've
got
you
a
birth-day
leave
me
alone
said
Ron
impatiently
harry's
going
to
introduce
me
to
Romilda
Vane
and
without
another
word
to
her
he
pushed
his
way
oui
of
the
portrait
hole
harry
tried
to
make
an
apologetic
face
to
Lavender
but
it
might
have
turned
out
simply
amused
because
she
looked
more
offended
than
ever
as
the
Fat
Lady
swung
shut
behind
them
harry
had
been
slightly
worried
that
Slughorn
might
be
at
breakfast
but
he
answered
his
office
door
at
the
first
knock
wearing
a
green
velvet
dressing-gown
and
matching
nightcap
and
looking
rather
bleary-eyed
harry
he
mumbled
this
is
very
early
for
a
call
i
generally
sleep
late
on
a
Saturday
professor
i'm
really
sorry
to
disturb
you
said
Harry
as
quietly
as
possible
while
Ron
stood
on
tiptoe
attempting
to
see
past
Slughorn
into
his
room
but
my
friend
ron's
swallowed
a
love
potion
by
mistake
you
couldn't
make
him
an
antidote
could
you
i'd
take
him
to
Madam
Pomfrey
but
we're
not
supposed
to
have
anything
from
Weasleys
Wizard
Wheezes
and
you
know
awkward
questions
td
have
thought
you
could
have
whipped
him
up
a
remedy
Harry
an
expert
potioneer
like
you
asked
Slughorn
er
said
Harry
somewhat
distracted
by
the
fact
that
Ron
was
now
elbowing
him
in
the
ribs
in
an
attempt
to
force
his
way
into
the
room
well
i've
never
mixed
an
antidote
for
a
love
potion
sir
and
by
the
time
I
get
it
right
Ron
might've
done
something
serious
helpfully
Ron
chose
this
moment
to
moan
I
can't
see
her
harry
is
he
hiding
her
was
this
potion
within
date
asked
Slughorn
now
eyeing
Ron
with
professional
interest
they
can
strengthen
you
know
the
longer
they're
kept
that
would
explain
a
lot
panted
Harry
now
positively
wrestling
with
Ron
to
keep
him
from
knocking
Slughorn
over
it's
his
birthday
Professor
he
added
imploringly
oh
all
right
come
in
then
come
in
said
Slughorn
relenting
i've
got
the
necessary
here
in
my
bag
it's
not
a
difficult
antidote
ron
burst
through
the
door
into
slughorn's
overheated
crowded
study
tripped
over
a
tasselled
footstool
regained
his
balance
by
seizing
Harry
around
the
neck
and
muttered
She
didn't
see
that
did
she
she's
not
here
yet
said
Harry
watching
Slughorn
opening
his
potion
kit
and
adding
a
few
pinches
of
this
and
that
to
a
small
crystal
bottle
that's
good
said
Ron
fervently
how
do
I
look
very
handsome
said
Slughorn
smoothly
handing
Ron
a
glass
of
clear
liquid
now
drink
that
up
it's
a
tonic
for
the
nerves
keep
you
calm
when
she
arrives
you
know
brilliant
said
Ron
eagerly
and
he
gulped
the
antidote
down
noisily
harry
and
Slughorn
watched
him
for
a
moment
Ron
beamed
at
them
then
very
slowly
his
grin
sagged
and
van-ished
to
be
replaced
by
an
expression
of
utmost
horror
back
to
normal
then
said
Harry
grinning
slughorn
chuckled
thanks
a
lot
Professor
don't
mention
it
m'boy
don't
mention
it
said
Slughorn
as
Ron
collapsed
into
a
nearby
armchair
looking
devastated
pick-me-up
that's
what
he
needs
Slughorn
continued
now-bustling
over
to
a
table
loaded
with
drinks
i've
got
butter-beer
i've
got
wine
i've
got
one
last
bottle
of
this
oak-matured
mead
hmm
meant
to
give
that
to
Dumbledore
for
christmas
ah
well
he
shrugged
he
can't
miss
what
he's
never
had
why
don't
we
open
it
now
and
celebrate
Mr
weasley's
birthday
nothing
like
a
fine
spirit
to
chase
away
the
pangs
of
disappointed
love
he
chortled
again
and
Harry
joined
in
this
was
the
firsi
time
he
had
found
himself
almost
alone
with
Slughorn
since
his
disastrous
first
attempt
to
extract
the
true
memory
from
him
perhaps
if
he
could
just
keep
Slughorn
in
a
good
mood
perhaps
if
they
got
through
enough
of
the
oak-matured
mead
there
you
are
then
said
Slughorn
handing
Harry
and
Ron
a
glass
of
mead
each
before
raising
his
own
well
a
very
happy
birthday
Ralph
Ron
whispered
Harry
but
Ron
who
did
not
appear
to
be
listening
to
the
toast
had
already
thrown
the
mead
into
his
mouth
and
swallowed
it
there
was
one
second
hardly
more
than
a
heartbeat
in
which
Harry
knew
there
was
something
terribly
wrong
and
Slughorn
it
seemed
did
not
and
may
you
have
many
more
ron
ron
had
dropped
his
glass
he
half-rose
from
his
chair
and
then
crumpled
his
extremities
jerking
uncontrollably
foam
was
dribbling
from
his
mouth
and
his
eyes
were
bulging
from
their
sockets
professor
harry
bellowed
do
something
but
Slughorn
seemed
paralysed
by
shock
ron
twitched
and
choked
his
skin
was
turning
blue
what
but
spluttered
Slughorn
harry
leapt
over
a
low
table
and
sprinted
towards
slughorn's
open
potion
kit
pulling
out
jars
and
pouches
while
the
terrible
sound
of
ron's
gargling
breath
filled
the
room
then
he
found
it
the
shrivelled
kidney-like
stone
Slughorn
had
taken
from
him
in
Potions
he
hurtled
back
to
ron's
side
wrenched
open
his
jaw
and
thrust
the
bezoar
into
his
mouth
ron
gave
a
great
shudder
a
rattling
gasp
and
his
body
became
limp
and
still
chapter
Elf
Tails
so
all
in
all
not
one
of
ron's
better
birthdays
said
Fred
it
was
evening
the
hospital
wing
was
quiet
the
windows
curtained
the
lamps
lit
ron's
was
the
only
occupied
bed
harry
Hermione
and
Ginny
were
sitting
around
him
they
had
spent
all
day
waiting
outside
the
double
doors
trying
to
see
inside
whenever
somebody
went
in
or
out
madam
Pomfrey
had
only
let
them
enter
at
eight
o'clock
fred
and
George
had
arrived
at
ten
past
this
isn't
how
we
imagined
handing
over
our
present
said
George
grimly
putting
down
a
large
wrapped
gift
on
ron's
bedside
cabinet
and
sitting
beside
Ginny
yeah
when
we
pictured
the
scene
he
was
conscious
said
Fred
there
we
were
in
Hogsmeade
waiting
to
surprise
him
said
George
you
were
in
Hogsmeade
asked
Ginny
looking
up
we
were
thinking
of
buying
zonko's
said
Fred
gloomily
a
Hogsmeade
branch
you
know
but
a
fat
lot
of
good
it'll
do
us
if
you
lot
aren't
allowed
out
at
weekends
to
buy
our
stuff
anymon
but
never
mind
that
now
he
drew
up
a
chair
beside
Harry
and
looked
at
ron's
pale
face
how
exactly
did
it
happen
Harry
harry
retold
the
story
he
had
already
recounted
it
felt
like
a
hundred
times
to
Dumbledore
to
McGonagall
to
Madam
Pomfrey
to
Hermione
and
to
Ginny
and
then
I
got
the
bezoar
down
his
throat
and
his
breathing
eased
up
a
bit
Slughorn
ran
for
help
McGonagall
and
Madam
Pomfrey
turned
up
and
they
brought
Ron
up
here
they
reckon
he'll
be
all
right
madam
Pomfrey
says
he'll
have
to
stay
here
a
week
or
so
keep
taking
essence
of
rue
blimey
it
was
lucky
you
thought
of
a
bezoar
said
George
in
a
low
voice
lucky
there
was
one
in
the
room
said
Harry
who
kept
turning
cold
at
the
thought
of
what
would
have
happened
if
he
had
not
been
able
to
lay
hands
on
the
little
stone
hermione
gave
an
almost
inaudible
sniff
she
had
been
exceptionally
quiet
all
day
having
hurtled
white-faced
up
to
Harry
outside
the
hospital
wing
and
demanded
to
know
what
had
happened
she
had
taken
almost
no
part
in
Harry
and
ginny's
obsessive
discussion
about
how
Ron
had
been
poisoned
but
merely
stood
beside
them
clench-jawed
and
frightened-looking
until
ai
last
they
had
been
allowed
in
to
see
him
do
Mum
and
Dad
know
fred
asked
Ginny
they've
already
seen
him
they
arrived
an
hour
ago
they're
in
dumbledore's
office
now
but
they'll
be
back
soon
there
was
a
pause
while
they
all
watched
Ron
mumble
a
little
in
his
sleep
so
the
poison
was
in
the
drink
said
Fred
quietly
yes
said
Harry
at
once
he
could
think
of
nothing
else
and
was
glad
for
the
opportunity
to
start
discussing
it
again
slughorn
poured
it
out
would
he
have
been
able
to
slip
something
into
ron's
glass
without
you
seeing
probably
said
Harry
but
why
would
Slughorn
want
to
poison
Ron
no
idea
said
Fred
frowning
you
don't
think
he
could
have
mixed
up
the
glasses
by
mistake
meaning
to
get
you
why
would
Slughorn
want
to
poison
Harry
asked
Ginny
i
dunno
said
Fred
but
there
must
be
loads
of
people
who'd
like
to
poison
Harry
mustn't
there
the
Chosen
One
and
all
that
so
you
think
slughorn's
a
Death
Eater
said
Ginny
anything's
possible
said
Fred
darkly
he
could
be
under
the
Imperius
Curse
said
George
or
he
could
be
innocent
said
Ginny
the
poison
could
have
been
in
the
bottle
in
which
case
it
was
probably
meant
for
Slughorn
himself
who'd
want
to
kill
Slughorn
dumbledore
reckons
Voldemort
wanted
Slughorn
on
his
side
said
Harry
slughorn
was
in
hiding
for
a
year
before
he
came
to
Hogwarts
and
he
thought
of
the
memory
Dumbledore
had
not
yet
been
able
to
extract
from
Slughorn
and
maybe
Voldemort
wants
him
out
of
the
way
maybe
he
thinks
he
could
be
valuable
to
Dumbledore
but
you
said
Slughorn
had
been
planning
to
give
th
u
Untie
to
Dumbledore
for
Christmas
Ginny
reminded
him
so
the
poisoner
could
just
as
easily
have
been
after
Dumbledore
then
the
poisoner
didn't
know
Slughorn
very
well
said
Hermione
speaking
for
the
first
time
in
hours
and
sounding
as
though
she
had
a
bad
head
cold
anyone
who
knew
Slughorn
would
have
I
known
there
was
a
good
chance
he'd
keep
something
that
tasty
for
himself
er-my-nee
croaked
Ron
unexpectedly
from
between
them
they
all
fell
silent
watching
him
anxiously
but
after
muttering
incomprehensibly
for
a
moment
he
merely
started
snoring
the
dormitory
doors
flew
open
making
them
all
jump
Hagrid
came
striding
toward
them
his
hair
rain-flecked
his
bearskin
coat
flapping
behind
him
a
crossbow
in
his
hand
leaving
a
trail
of
muddy
dolphin-sized
footprints
all
over
the
floor
bin
in
the
forest
all
day
he
panted
aragog's
worse
I
bin
readin
to
him
didn
get
up
ter
dinner
till
jus
now
an
then
Professor
Sprout
told
me
abou
Ron
how
is
he
not
bad
said
Harry
they
say
he'll
be
okay
no
more
than
six
visitors
at
a
time
said
Madam
Pomfrey
hurrying
out
of
her
office
hagrid
makes
six
George
pointed
out
oh
yes
said
Madam
Pomfrey
who
seemed
to
have
been
counting
Hagrid
as
several
people
due
to
his
vastness
to
cover
her
confusion
she
hurried
off
to
clear
up
his
muddy
foot
prints
with
her
wand
i
don
believe
this
said
Hagrid
hoarsely
shaking
his
great
shaggy
head
as
he
stared
down
at
Ron
jus
don
believe
it
look
at
him
lyin
there
who'd
want
ter
hurt
him
eh
that's
just
what
we
were
discussing
said
Harry
we
don't
know
someone
couldn
have
a
grudge
against
the
Gryfinndor
Quidditch
team
could
they
said
Hagrid
anxiously
firs
Katie
now
Ron
i
cant
see
anyone
trying
to
bump
off
a
Quidditch
team
said
i
m
urge
wood
might've
done
the
Slytherins
if
he
could've
got
away
with
it
said
Fred
fairly
well
I
don't
think
it's
Quidditch
but
I
think
there's
a
connection
between
the
attacks
said
Hermione
quietly
how
d'you
work
that
out
asked
Fred
well
for
one
thing
they
both
ought
to
have
been
fatal
and
weren't
although
that
was
pure
luck
and
for
another
neither
the
poison
nor
the
necklace
seems
to
have
reached
the
person
who
was
supposed
to
be
killed
of
course
she
added
broodingly
that
makes
the
person
behind
this
even
more
dangerous
in
a
way
because
they
don't
seem
to
care
how
many
people
they
finish
off
In
lore
they
actually
reach
their
victim
before
anybody
could
respond
to
this
ominous
pronouncement
tin
dormitory
doors
opened
again
and
mr.
and
Mrs
weasley
hurried
up
the
ward
they
had
done
no
more
than
satisfy
themselves
that
Ron
would
make
a
full
recovery
on
their
last
visit
to
the
ward
now
Mrs
weasley
seized
hold
of
Harry
and
hugged
him
very
tighty
dumbledore's
told
us
how
you
saved
him
with
the
bezoar
she
sobbed
oh
Harry

can

say

Ginny

saved
Arthur
now

saved
Ron

be
i
didn't
muttered
Harry
awkwardly
half
our
family
does
seem
to
owe
you
their
lives
now
I
stop
and
think
about
it
mr.
Weasley
said
in
a
constricted
voice
well
all
I
can
say
is
that
it
was
a
lucky
clay
for
the
Weasleys
when
Ron
decided
to
sit
in
your
compartment
on
the
Hogwarts
Expirv
Harry
harry
could
not
think
of
any
reply
to
this
and
was
almost
gl
il
when
Madam
Pomfrey
reminded
them
that
there
were
only
supposed
to
be
six
visitors
around
ron's
bed
he
and
Hermione
rose
h
once
to
leave
and
Hagrid
decided
to
go
with
them
leaving
Ron
with
his
family
it's
terrible
growled
Hagrid
into
his
beard
as
the
three
ol
them
walked
back
along
the
corridor
to
the
marble
staircase
ml
this
new
security
an
kids
are
still
gettin
hurt
dumbledoiv's
worried
sick
he
don
say
much
but
I
can
tell
hasn't
he
got
any
ideas
Hagrid
asked
Hermione
desperately
i
spect
he's
got
hundreds
of
ideas
brain
like
his
said
Hagrid
but
he
doesn
know
who
sent
that
necklace
nor
put
poison
in
that
wine
or
they'dve
bin
caught
wouldn
they
wha
worries
me
said
Hagrid
lowering
his
voice
and
glancing
over
his
shoulder
Harry
for
good
measure
checked
the
ceiling
for
Peeves
is
how
long
Hogwarts
can
stay
open
if
kids
are
bein
attacked
chamber
o
Secrets
all
over
again
isn
it
there'll
be
panic
more
parents
takin
their
kids
outta
school
an
nex
thing
yeh
know
the
board
o
governors
hagrid
stopped
talking
as
the
ghost
of
a
long-haired
woman
drifted
serenely
past
then
resumed
in
a
hoarse
whisper
the
board
o
governors'll
be
talkin
about
shuttin
us
up
fer
good
surely
not
said
Hermione
looking
worried
gotta
see
it
from
their
point
o
view
said
Hagrid
heavily
i
mean
it's
always
bin
a
bit
of
a
risk
sendin
a
kid

Hogwarts

it
yer
expect
accidents

yeh
with
hundreds
of
underage
wizards
all
locked
up
tergether
but
attempted
murder
tha's
tliff'rent
s'no
wonder
dumbledore's
angry
with
Sn
hagrid
stopped
in
his
tracks
a
familiar
guilty
expression
on
what
was
visible
of
his
face
above
his
tangled
black
beard
what
said
Harry
quickly
dumbledore's
angry
with
Snape
i
never
said
tha
said
Hagrid
though
his
look
of
panic
could
not
have
been
a
bigger
giveaway
look
at
the
time
it's
gettin
on
fer
midnight
I
need
ter
hagrid
why
is
Dumbledore
angry
with
Snape
harry
asked
loudly
shhhh

Hagrid
looking
both
nervous
and
angry
don
shout
stuff
like
that
Harry
d'yeh
wan

Care

said
Harry
forcefully
what's
Snape
done
i
dunno
Harry
I
shouldn'ta
heard
it
at
all
i
well
I
was
comin
outta
the
forest
the
other
evenin
an
I
overheard
em
talking
well
arguin
didn't
like
ter
draw
attention
to
meself
so
I
sorta
skulked
an
tried
not
ter
listen
but
it
was
a
well
a
heated
discussion
an
it
wasn
easy
ter
block
it
out
well
harry
urged
him
as
Hagrid
shuffled
his
enormous
feet
uneasily
well
I
jus
heard
Snape
sayin
Dumbledore
took
too
much
fer
granted
an
maybe
he
Snape
didn
wan
ter
do
it
any
more
do
what
i
dunno
Harry
it
sounded
like
Snape
was
feelin
a
bit
overworked
tha's
all
anyway
Dumbledore
told
him
flat
out
he'd
agreed
ter
do
it
an
that
was
all
there
was
to
it
pretty
firm
with
him
an
then
he
said
summat
abou
Snape
makin
investigations
in
his
House
in
Slytherin
well
there's
nothin
strange
abou
that
hagrid
added
hastily
as
Harry
and
Hermione
exchanged
looks
full
of
meaning
all
the
Heads
o
Houses
were
asked
ter
look
inter
that
necklace
business
yeah
but
dumbledore's
not
having
rows
with
the
rest
of
them
is
he
said
Harry
look
Hagrid
twisted
his
crossbow
uncomfortably
in
his
hands
there
was
a
loud
splintering
sound
and
it
snapped
in
two
i
know
what
yeh're
like
abou
Snape
Harry
an
I
don
want
yeh
ter
go
readin
more
inter
this
than
there
is
look
out
said
Hermione
tersely
they
turned
just
in
time
to
see
the
shadow
of
Argus
Filch
looming
over
the
wall
behind
them
before
the
man
himself
turned
the
corner
hunchbacked
his
jowls
aquiver
oho
he
wheezed
out
of
bed
so
late
this'll
mean
detention
no
it
won
Filch
said
Hagrid
shortly
they're
with
me
aren
they
and
what
difference
does
that
make
asked
Filch
obnoxiously
i'm
a
ruddy
teacher
aren
I
yeh
sneakin
Squib
said
Hagrid
firing
up
at
once
there
was
a
nasty
hissing
noise
as
Filch
swelled
with
fury
Mrs
norris
had
arrived
unseen
and
was
twisting
herself
sinuously
around
filch's
skinny
ankles
get
goin
said
Hagrid
out
of
the
corner
of
his
mouth
harry
did
not
need
telling
twice
he
and
Hermione
both
hurried
off
hagrid's
and
filch's
raised
voices
echoed
behind
them
as
they
ran
they
passed
Peeves
near
the
turning
into
Gryffindor
Tower
but
he
was
streaking
happily
toward
the
source
of
the
yelling
cackling
and
calling
when
there's
strife
and
when
there's
trouble
call
on
Peevsie
he'll
make
double
the
Fat
Lady
was
snoozing
and
not
pleased
to
be
woken
but
swung
forward
grumpily
to
allow
them
to
clamber
into
the
mercifully
peaceful
and
empty
common
room
it
did
not
seem
that
people
knew
about
Ron
yet
Harry
was
very
relieved
He
had
been
interrogated
enough
that
day
hermione
bade
him
good
night
and
set
off
for
the
girls
dormitory
harry
however
remained
behind
taking
a
seat
beside
the
fire
and
looking
down
into
the
dying
embers
so
Dumbledore
had
argued
with
Snape
in
spite
of
all
he
had
told
Harry
in
spite
of
his
insistence
that
he
trusted
Snape
completely
he
had
lost
his
temper
with
him
he
did
not
think
that
Snape
had
tried
hard
enough
to
investigate
the
Slytherins
or
perhaps
to
investigate
a
single
Slytherin
Malfoy
was
it
because
Dumbledore
did
not
want
Harry
to
do
anything
foolish
to
take
matters
into
his
own
hands
that
he
had
pretended
there
was
nothing
in
harry's
suspicions
that
seemed
likely
it
might
even
be
that
Dumbledore
did
not
want
anything
to
distract
Harry
from
their
lessons
or
from
procuring
that
memory
from
Slughorn
perhaps
Dumbledore
did
not
think
it
right
to
confide
suspicions
about
his
staff
to
sixteen-year-olds
there
you
are
Potter
harry
jumped
to
his
feet
in
shock
his
wand
at
the
ready
he
had
been
quite
convinced
that
the
common
room
was
empty
he
had
not
been
at
all
prepared
for
a
hulking
figure
to
rise
suddenly
out
of
a
distant
chair
a
closer
look
showed
him
that
it
was
Cormac
McLaggen
i've
been
waiting
for
you
to
come
back
said
McLaggen
disregarding
Harrys
drawn
wand
mustve
fallen
asleep
look
I
saw
them
taking
Weasley
up
to
the
hospital
wing
earlier
didn't
look
like
he'll
be
fit
for
next
week's
match
it
took
Harry
a
few
moments
to
realize
what
McLaggen
was
talking
about
oh
right
quidditch
he
said
putting
his
wand
back
into
the
belt
of
his
jeans
and
running
a
hand
wearily
through
his
hair
yeah
he
might
not
make
it
well
then
i'll
be
playing
Keeper
won't
I
said
McLaggen
yeah
said
Harry
yeah
I
suppose
so
he
could
not
think
of
an
argument
against
it
after
all
McLaggen
had
certainly
performed
second-best
in
the
trials
excellent
said
McLaggen
in
a
satisfied
voice
so
when's
practice
what
oh
there's
one
tomorrow
evening
good
listen
Potter
we
should
have
a
talk
beforehand
i've
got
some
ideas
on
strategy
you
might
find
useful
right
said
Harry
unenthusiastically
well
i'll
hear
them
tomorrow
then
i'm
pretty
tired
now
see
you
the
news
that
Ron
had
been
poisoned
spread
quickly
next
day
but
it
did
not
cause
the
sensation
that
katie's
attack
had
done
people
seemed
to
think
that
it
might
have
been
an
accident
given
that
he
had
been
in
the
Potions
master's
room
at
the
time
and
that
as
he
had
been
given
an
antidote
immediately
there
was
no
real
harm
done
in
fact
the
Gryffindors
were
generally
much
more
interested
in
the
upcoming
Quidditch
match
against
Hufflepuff
for
many
of
them
wanted
to
see
Zacharias
Smith
who
played
Chaser
on
the
Hufflepuff
team
punished
soundly
for
his
commentary
during
the
opening
match
against
Slytherin
harry
however
had
never
been
less
interested
in
Quidditch
he
was
rapidly
becoming
obsessed
with
Draco
Malfoy
still
checking
the
marauder's
Map
whenever
he
got
a
chance
he
sometimes
made
detours
to
wherever
Malfoy
happened
to
be
but
had
not
yet
detected
him
doing
anything
out
of
the
ordinary
and
still
there
were
those
inexplicable
times
when
Malfoy
simply
vanished
from
the
map
but
Harry
did
not
get
a
lot
of
time
to
consider
the
problem
what
with
Quidditch
practice
homework
and
the
fact
that
he
was
now
being
dogged
wherever
he
went
by
Cormac
McLaggen
and
Lavender
Brown
he
could
not
decide
which
of
them
was
more
annoying
mcLaggen
kept
up
a
constant
stream
of
hints
that
he
would
make
a
better
permanent
Keeper
for
the
team
than
Ron
and
that
now
that
Harry
was
seeing
him
play
regularly
he
would
surely
come
around
to
this
way
of
thinking
too
he
was
also
keen
to
criticize
the
other
players
and
provide
Harry
with
detailed
training
schemes
so
that
more
than
once
Harry
was
forced
to
remind
him
who
was
Captain
meanwhile
Lavender
kept
sidling
up
to
Harry
to
discuss
Ron
which
Harry
found
almost
more
wearing
than
mclaggen's
Quidditch
lectures
at
first
Lavender
had
been
very
annoyed
that
nobody
had
thought
to
tell
her
that
Ron
was
in
the
hospital
wing
I
mean
I
am
his
girlfriend
but
unfortunately
slit-had
now
decided
to
forgive
Harry
this
lapse
of
memory
and
was
keen
to
have
lots
of
in-depth
chats
with
him
about
ron's
feelings
a
most
uncomfortable
experience
that
Harry
would
have
happily
forgone
look
why
don't
you
talk
to
Ron
about
all
this
harry
asked
after
a
particularly
long
interrogation
from
Lavender
that
took
in
everything
from
precisely
what
Ron
had
said
about
her
new
drew
robes
to
whether
or
not
Harry
thought
that
Ron
considered
his
relationship
with
Lavender
to
be
serious
well
I
would
but
he's
always
asleep
when
I
go
and
see
him
said
Lavender
fretfully
is
he
said
Harry
surprised
for
he
had
found
Ron
perfectly
alert
every
time
he
had
been
up
to
the
hospital
wing
both
highly
interested
in
the
news
of
Dumbledore
and
snape's
row
and
keen
m
abuse
McLaggen
as
much
as
possible
is
Hermione
Granger
still
visiting
him
lavender
demanded
suddenly
yeah
I
think
so
well
they're
friends
aren't
they
said
Harry
uncomfortably
friends
don't
make
me
laugh
said
Lavender
scornfully
she
didn't
talk
to
him
for
weeks
after
he
started
going
out
with
me
but
I
suppose
she
wants
to
make
up
with
him
now
he's
all
interesting
would
you
call
getting
poisoned
being
interesting
asked
Harry
anyway
sorry
got
to
go
there's
McLaggen
coming
for
a
talk
about
Quidditch
said
Harry
hurriedly
and
he
dashed
sideways
through
a
door
pretending
to
be
solid
wall
and
sprinted
down
the
shortcut
that
would
take
him
off
to
Potions
where
thankfully
neither
Lavender
nor
McLaggen
could
follow
him
on
the
morning
of
the
Quidditch
match
against
Hufflepuff
Harry
dropped
in
on
the
hospital
wing
before
heading
down
to
the
pitch
ron
was
very
agitated
Madam
Pomfrey
would
not
let
him
go
down
to
watch
the
match
feeling
it
would
overexcite
him
so
how's
McLaggen
shaping
up
he
asked
Harry
nervously
apparently
forgetting
that
he
had
already
asked
the
same
question
twice
i've
told
you
said
Harry
patiently
he
could
be
world-class
and
I
wouldn't
want
to
keep
him
he
keeps
trying
to
tell
everyone
what
to
do
he
thinks
he
could
play
every
position
better
than
the
rest
of
us
i
can't
wait
to
be
shot
of
him
and
speaking
of
getting
shot
of
people
Harry
added
getting
to
his
feet
and
picking
up
his
Firebolt
will
you
stop
pretending
to
be
asleep
when
Lavender
comes
to
see
you
she's
driving
me
mad
as
well
oh
said
Ron
looking
sheepish
yeah
all
right
if
you
don't
want
to
go
out
with
her
anymore
just
tell
her
said
Harry
yeah
well
it's
not
that
easy
is
it
said
Ron
he
paused
hermione
going
to
look
in
before
the
match
he
added
casually
no
she's
already
gone
down
to
the
pitch
with
Ginny
oh
said
Ron
looking
rather
glum
right
well
good
luck
hope
you
hammer
McLag
I
mean
Smith
i'll
try
said
Harry
shouldering
his
broom
see
you
after
the
match
he
hurried
down
through
the
deserted
corridors
the
whole
school
was
outside
either
already
seated
in
the
stadium
or
heading
down
toward
it
he
was
looking
out
of
the
windows
he
passed
trying
to
gauge
how
much
wind
they
were
facing
when
a
noise
ahead
made
him
glance
up
and
he
saw
Malfoy
walking
toward
him
accompanied
by
two
girls
both
of
whom
looked
sulky
and
resentful
malfoy
stopped
short
at
the
sight
of
Harry
then
gave
a
short
humorless
laugh
and
continued
walking
where're
you
going
harry
demanded
yeah
i'm
really
going
to
tell
you
because
it's
your
business
Potter
sneered
Malfoy
you'd
better
hurry
up
they'll
be
waiting
for
the
Chosen
Captain
the
Boy
Who
Scored
whatever
they
call
you
these
days
one
of
the
girls
gave
an
unwilling
giggle
harry
stared
at
her
she
blushed
malfoy
pushed
past
Harry
and
she
and
her
friend
followed
at
a
trot
turning
the
corner
and
vanishing
from
view
harry
stood
rooted
on
the
spot
and
watched
them
disappear
this
was
infuriating
he
was
already
cutting
it
fine
to
get
to
the
match
on
time
and
yet
there
was
Malfoy
skulking
off
while
the
rest
of
the
school
was
absent
harry's
best
chance
yet
of
discovering
what
Malfoy
was
up
to
the
silent
seconds
trickled
past
and
Harry
remained
where
he
was
frozen
gazing
at
the
place
where
Malfoy
had
vanished
where
have
you
been
demanded
Ginny
as
Harry
sprinted
into
the
changing
rooms
the
whole
team
was
changed
and
ready
Coote
and
Peakes
the
Beaters
were
both
hitting
their
clubs
nervously
against
their
legs
i
met
Malfoy
Harry
told
her
quietly
as
he
pulled
his
scarlet
robes
over
his
head
so
I
wanted
to
know
how
come
he's
up
at
the
castle
with
a
couple
of
girlfriends
while
everyone
else
is
down
here
does
it
matter
right
now
well
i'm
not
likely
to
find
out
am
I
said
Harry
seizing
his
Firebolt
and
pushing
his
glasses
straight
come
on
then
and
without
another
word
he
marched
out
onto
the
pitch
to
deafening
cheers
and
boos
there
was
little
wind
the
clouds
were
patchy
every
now
and
then
there
were
dazzling
flashes
of
bright
sunlight
tricky
conditions
mcLaggen
said
bracingly
to
the
team
coote
Peakes
you'll
want
to
fly
out
of
the
sun
so
they
don't
see
you
coming
i'm
the
Captain
McLaggen
shut
up
giving
them
instructions
said
Harry
angrily
just
get
up
by
the
goal
posts
once
McLaggen
had
marched
off
Harry
turned
to
Coote
and
Peakes
make
sure
you
do
fly
out
of
the
sun
he
told
them
grudgingly
he
shook
hands
with
the
Hufflepuff
Captain
and
then
on
Madam
hooch's
whistle
kicked
off
and
rose
into
the
air
higher
than
the
rest
of
his
team
streaking
around
the
pitch
in
search
of
the
Snitch
if
he
could
catch
it
good
and
early
there
might
be
a
chance
he
could
get
back
up
to
the
castle
seize
the
marauder's
Map
and
find
out
what
Malfoy
was
doing
and
that's
Smith
of
Hufflepuff
with
the
Quaffle
said
a
dreamy
voice
echoing
over
the
grounds
he
did
the
commentary
last
time
of
course
and
Ginny
Weasley
flew
into
him
I
think
probably
on
purpose
it
looked
like
it
smith
was
being
quite
rude
about
Gryffindor
I
expect
he
regrets
that
now
he's
playing
them
oh
look
he's
lost
the
Quaffle
Ginny
took
it
from
him
I
do
like
her
she's
very
nice
harry
stared
down
at
the
commentator's
podium
surely
nobody
in
their
right
mind
would
have
let
Luna
Lovegood
commentate
but
even
from
above
there
was
no
mistaking
that
long
dirty-blonde
hair
nor
the
necklace
of
butterbeer
corks
beside
Luna
Professor
McGonagall
was
looking
slightly
uncomfortable
as
though
she
was
indeed
having
second
thoughts
about
this
appointment
but
now
that
big
Hufflepuff
player's
got
the
Quaffle
from
her
I
can't
remember
his
name
it's
something
like
Bibble
no
Buggins
it's
Cadwallader
said
Professor
McGonagall
loudly
from
beside
Luna
the
crowd
laughed
harry
stared
around
for
the
Snitch
there
was
no
sign
of
it
moments
later
Cadwallader
scored
mcLaggen
had
been
shouting
criticism
at
Ginny
for
allowing
the
Quaffle
out
of
her
possession
with
the
result
that
he
had
not
noticed
the
large
red
ball
soaring
past
his
right
ear
mcLaggen
will
you
pay
attention
to
what
you're
supposed
to
be
doing
and
leave
everyone
else
alone
bellowed
Harry
wheeling
around
to
face
his
Keeper
you're
not
setting
a
great
example
mcLaggen
shouted
back
red-faced
and
furious
and
Harry
potter's
now
having
an
argument
with
his
Keeper
said
Luna
serenely
while
both
Hufflepuffs
and
Slytherins
below
in
the
crowd
cheered
and
jeered
i
don't
think
that'll
help
him
find
the
Snitch
but
maybe
it's
a
clever
ruse
swearing
angrily
Harry
spun
round
and
set
off
around
the
pitch
again
scanning
the
skies
for
some
sign
of
the
tiny
winged
golden
ball
ginny
and
Demelza
scored
a
goal
apiece
giving
the
red-and-gold-clad
supporters
below
something
to
cheer
about
then
Cadwallader
scored
again
making
things
level
but
Luna
did
not
seem
to
have
noticed
she
appeared
singularly
uninterested
in
such
mundane
things
as
the
score
and
kept
attempting
to
draw
the
crowd's
attention
to
such
things
as
interestingly
shaped
clouds
and
the
possibility
that
Zacharias
Smith
who
had
so
far
failed
to
maintain
possession
of
the
Quaffle
for
longer
than
a
minute
was
suffering
from
something
called
loser's
Lurgy
seventy-forty
to
Hufflepuff
barked
Professor
McGonagall
into
luna's
megaphone
is
it
already
said
Luna
vaguely
oh
look
the
Gryffindor
keeper's
got
hold
of
one
of
the
beater's
bats
harry
spun
around
in
midair
sure
enough
McLaggen
for
reasons
best
known
to
himself
had
pulled
peakes's
bat
from
him
and
appeared
to
be
demonstrating
how
to
hit
a
Bludger
toward
an
oncoming
Cadwallader
will
you
give
him
back
his
bat
and
get
back
to
the
goal
posts
roared
Harry
pelting
toward
McLaggen
just
as
McLaggen
took
a
ferocious
swipe
at
the
Bludger
and
mishit
it
a
blinding
sickening
pain
a
flash
of
light
distant
screams
and
the
sensation
of
falling
down
a
long
tunnel
and
the
next
thing
Harry
knew
he
was
lying
in
a
remarkably
warm
and
comfortable
bed
and
looking
up
at
a
lamp
that
was
throwing
a
circle
of
golden
light
onto
a
shadowy
ceiling
he
raised
his
head
awkwardly
there
on
his
left
was
a
familiar-looking
freckly
red-haired
person
nice
of
you
to
drop
in
said
Ron
grinning
harry
blinked
and
looked
around
of
course
He
was
in
the
hospital
wing
the
sky
outside
was
indigo
streaked
with
crimson
the
match
must
have
finished
hours
ago
as
had
any
hope
of
cornering
Malfoy
harry's
head
felt
strangely
heavy
he
raised
a
hand
and
felt
a
stiff
turban
of
bandages
what
happened
cracked
skull
said
Madam
Pomfrey
bustling
up
and
pushing
him
back
against
his
pillows
nothing
to
worry
about
I
mended
it
at
once
but
i'm
keeping
you
in
overnight
you
shouldn't
over
exert
yourself
for
a
few
hours
i
don't
want
to
stay
here
overnight
said
Harry
angrily
sitting
up
and
throwing
back
his
covers
i
want
to
find
McLaggen
and
kill
him
i'm
afraid
that
would
come
under
the
heading
of
overexertion
said
Madam
Pomfrey
pushing
him
firmly
back
onto
the
bed
and
raising
her
wand
in
a
threatening
manner
you
will
stay
here
until
I
discharge
you
Potter
or
I
shall
call
the
headmaster
she
bustled
back
into
her
office
and
Harry
sank
back
into
his
pillows
fuming
d'you
know
how
much
we
lost
by
he
asked
Ron
through
clenched
teeth
well
yeah
I
do
said
Ron
apologetically
final
score
was
three
hundred
and
twenty
to
sixty
brilliant
said
Harry
savagely
really
brilliant
when
I
get
hold
of
McLaggen
you
don't
want
to
get
hold
of
him
he's
the
size
of
a
troll
said
ron
reasonably
personally
I
think
there's
a
lot
to
be
said
for
hexing
him
with
that
toenail
thing
of
the
prince's
anyway
the
rest
of
the
team
might've
dealt
with
him
before
you
get
out
of
here
they're
not
happy
there
was
a
note
of
badly
suppressed
glee
in
Rons
voice
Harry
could
tell
he
was
nothing
short
of
thrilled
that
McLaggen
had
messed
up
so
badly
harry
lay
there
staring
up
at
the
patch
of
light
on
the
ceiling
his
recently
mended
skull
not
hurting
precisely
but
feeling
slightly
tender
underneath
all
the
bandaging
i
could
hear
the
match
commentary
from
here
said
Ron
his
voice
now
shaking
with
laughter
i
hope
Luna
always
commentates
from
now
on
loser's
Lurgy
but
Harry
was
still
too
angry
to
see
much
humor
in
the
situation
and
after
a
while
ron's
snorts
subsided
ginny
came
in
to
visit
while
you
were
unconscious
he
said
after
a
long
pause
and
harry's
imagination
zoomed
into
overdrive
rapidly
constructing
a
scene
in
which
Ginny
weeping
over
his
lifeless
form
confessed
her
feelings
of
deep
attraction
to
him
while
Ron
gave
them
his
blessing
she
reckons
you
only
just
arrived
on
time
for
the
match
how
come
you
left
here
early
enough
oh
said
Harry
as
the
scene
in
his
mind's
eye
imploded
yeah
well
I
saw
Malfoy
sneaking
off
with
a
couple
of
girls
who
didn't
look
like
they
wanted
to
be
with
him
and
that's
the
second
time
he's
made
sure
he
isn't
down
on
the
Quidditch
pitch
with
the
rest
of
the
school
he
skipped
the
last
match
too
remember
harry
sighed
wish
i'd
followed
him
now
the
match
was
such
a
fiasco
don't
be
stupid
said
Ron
sharply
you
couldn't
have
missed
a
Quidditch
match
just
to
follow
Malfoy
you're
the
Captain
i
want
to
know
what
he's
up
to
said
Harry
and
don't
tell
nn
its
all
in
my
head
not
after
what
I
overheard
between
him
and
Snape
i
never
said
it
was
all
in
your
head
said
Ron
hoisting
himself
up
on
an
elbow
in
turn
and
frowning
at
Harry
but
there's
no
rule
saying
only
one
person
at
a
time
can
be
plotting
anything
in
this
place
you're
getting
a
bit
obsessed
with
Malfoy
Harry
i
mean
thinking
about
missing
a
match
just
to
follow
him
i
want
to
catch
him
at
it
said
Harry
in
frustration
i
mean
where's
he
going
when
he
disappears
off
the
map
i
dunno
hogsmeade
suggested
Ron
yawning
i've
never
seen
him
going
along
any
of
the
secret
passageway
on
the
map
i
thought
they
were
being
watched
now
anyway
well
then
I
dunno
said
Ron
silence
fell
between
them
harry
stared
up
at
the
circle
of
lamp
light
above
him
thinking
if
only
he
had
Rufus
scrimgeour's
power
he
would
have
been
able
to
set
a
tail
upon
Malfoy
but
unfortunately
Harry
did
not
have
an
office
full
of
Aurors
at
his
command
he
thought
fleetingly
of
trying
to
set
something
up
with
the
D
a.
but
there
again
was
the
problem
that
people
would
be
missed
from
lessons
most
of
them
after
all
still
had
full
schedules
there
was
a
low
rumbling
snore
from
ron's
bed
after
a
while
Madam
Pomfrey
came
out
of
her
office
this
time
wearing
a
thick
dressing
gown
it
was
easiest
to
feign
sleep
Harry
rolled
over
onto
his
side
and
listened
to
all
the
curtains
closing
themselves
as
she
waved
her
wand
the
lamps
dimmed
and
she
returned
to
her
office
he
heard
the
door
click
behind
her
and
knew
that
she
was
off
to
bed
this
was
Harry
reflected
in
the
darkness
the
third
time
that
he
had
been
brought
to
the
hospital
wing
because
of
a
Quidditch
injury
last
time
he
had
fallen
off
his
broom
due
to
the
presence
of
dementors
around
the
pitch
and
the
time
before
that
all
the
bones
had
been
removed
from
his
arm
by
the
incurably
inept
Professor
Lockhart
that
had
been
his
most
painful
injury
by
far
he
remembered
the
agony
of
regrowing
an
armful
of
bones
in
one
night
a
discomfort
not
eased
by
the
arrival
of
an
unexpected
visitor
in
the
middle
of
the
harry
sat
bolt
upright
his
heart
pounding
his
bandage
turban
askew
he
had
the
solution
at
last
There
was
a
way
to
have
Malfoy
followed
how
could
he
have
forgotten
why
hadn't
he
thought
of
it
before
but
the
question
was
how
to
call
him
what
did
you
do
quietly
tentatively
Harry
spoke
into
the
darkness
kreacher
there
was
a
very
loud
crack
and
the
sounds
of
scuffling
and
squeaks
filled
the
silent
room
ron
awoke
with
a
yelp
what's
going
harry
pointed
his
wand
hastily
at
the
door
of
Madam
pomfrey's
office
and
muttered
Muffliato
so
that
she
would
not
come
running
then
he
scrambled
to
the
end
of
his
bed
for
a
better
look
at
what
was
going
on
two
house-elves
were
rolling
around
on
the
floor
in
the
middle
of
the
dormitory
one
wearing
a
shrunken
maroon
jumper
and
several
woolly
hats
the
other
a
filthy
old
rag
strung
over
his
hips
like
a
loincloth
then
there
was
another
loud
bang
and
Peeves
the
Poltergeist
appeared
in
midair
above
the
wrestling
elves
i
was
watching
that
Potty
he
told
Harry
indignantly
pointing
at
the
fight
below
before
letting
out
a
loud
cackle
look
at
the
ickle
creatures
squabbling
bitey
bitey
punchy
punchy
kreacher
will
not
insult
Harry
Potter
in
front
of
Dobby
no
he
won't
or
Dobby
will
shut
kreacher's
mouth
for
him
cried
Dobby
in
a
high-pitched
voice
kicky
scratchy
cried
Peeves
happily
now
pelting
bits
of
chalk
at
the
elves
to
enrage
them
further
tweaky
pokey
kreacher
will
say
what
he
likes
about
his
master
oh
yes
and
what
a
master
he
is
filthy
friend
of
Mudbloods
oh
what
would
poor
kreacher's
mistress
say
exactly
what
kreacher's
mistress
would
have
said
they
did
not
find
out
for
at
that
moment
Dobby
sank
his
knobbly
little
fist
into
Kreachers
mouth
and
knocked
out
half
of
his
teeth
harry
and
Ron
both
leapt
out
of
their
beds
and
wrenched
the
two
elves
apart
though
they
continued
to
try
and
kick
and
punch
each
other
egged
on
by
Peeves
who
swooped
around
the
lamp
squealing
Stick
your
fingers
up
his
nosey
draw
his
cork
and
pull
his
earsies
harry
aimed
his
wand
at
Peeves
and
said
Langlock
peeves
clutched
at
his
throat
gulped
then
swooped
from
the
room
making
obscene
gestures
but
unable
to
speak
owing
to
the
fact
that
his
tongue
had
just
glued
itself
to
the
roof
of
his
mouth
nice
one
said
Ron
appreciatively
lifting
Dobby
into
the
air
so
that
his
flailing
limbs
no
longer
made
contact
with
Kreacher
that
was
another
Prince
hex
wasn't
it
yeah
said
Harry
twisting
kreacher's
wizened
arm
into
a
half
nelson
right
i'm
forbidding
you
to
fight
each
other
well
Kreacher
you're
forbidden
to
fight
Dobby
dobby
I
know
i'm
not
allowed
to
give
you
orders
dobby
is
a
free
house-elf
and
he
can
obey
anyone
he
likes
and
Dobby
will
do
whatever
Harry
Potter
wants
him
to
do
said
Dobby
tears
now
streaming
down
his
shriveled
little
face
onto
his
jumper
okay
then
said
Harry
and
he
and
Ron
both
released
the
elves
who
fell
to
the
floor
but
did
not
continue
fighting
master
called
me
croaked
Kreacher
sinking
into
a
bow
even
as
he
gave
Harry
a
look
that
plainly
wished
him
a
painful
death
yeah
I
did
said
Harry
glancing
toward
Madam
pomfrey's
office
door
to
check
that
the
Muffliato
spell
was
still
working
there
was
no
sign
that
she
had
heard
any
of
the
commotion
i've
got
a
job
for
you
kreacher
will
do
whatever
Master
wants
said
Kreacher
sinking
so
low
that
his
lips
almost
touched
his
gnarled
toes
because
Kreacher
has
no
choice
but
Kreacher
is
ashamed
to
have
such
a
master
yes
dobby
will
do
it
Harry
Potter
squeaked
Dobby
his
tennis-ball-sized
eyes
still
swimming
in
tears
dobby
would
be
honored
to
help
Harry
Potter
come
to
think
of
it
it
would
be
good
to
have
both
of
you
said
Harry
okay
then
i
want
you
to
tail
Draco
Malfoy
ignoring
the
look
of
mingled
surprise
and
exasperation
on
ron's
face
Harry
went
on
I
want
to
know
where
he's
going
who
he's
meeting
and
what
he's
doing
i
want
you
to
follow
him
around
the
clock
yes
Harry
Potter
said
Dobby
at
once
his
great
eyes
shining
with
excitement
and
if
Dobby
does
it
wrong
Dobby
will
throw
himself
off
the
topmost
tower
Harry
Potter
there
won't
be
any
need
for
that
said
Harry
hastily
master
wants
me
to
follow
the
youngest
of
the
Malfoys
croaked
Kreacher
master
wants
me
to
spy
upon
the
pure-blood
great-nephew
of
my
old
mistress
that's
the
one
said
Harry
foreseeing
a
great
danger
and
determining
to
prevent
it
immediately
and
you're
forbidden
to
tip
him
off
Kreacher
or
to
show
him
what
you're
up
to
or
to
talk
to
him
at
all
or
to
write
him
messages
or
or
to
contact
him
in
any
way
got
it
he
thought
he
could
see
Kreacher
struggling
to
see
a
loophole
in
the
instructions
he
had
just
been
given
and
waited
after
a
moment
or
two
and
to
Harrys
great
satisfaction
Kreacher
bowed
deeply
again
and
said
with
bitter
resentment
Master
thinks
of
everything
and
Kreacher
must
obey
him
even
though
Kreacher
would
much
rather
be
the
servant
of
the
Malfoy
boy
oh
yes
that's
settled
then
said
Harry
i'll
want
regular
reports
but
make
sure
i'm
not
surrounded
by
people
when
you
turn
up
ron
and
Hermione
are
okay
and
don't
tell
anyone
what
you're
doing
just
stick
to
Malfoy
like
a
couple
of
wart
plasters
chapter
Lord
voldemort's
Request
harry
and
Ron
left
the
hospital
wing
first
thing
on
Monday
morning
restored
to
full
health
by
the
ministrations
of
Madam
Pomfrey
and
now
able
to
enjoy
the
benefits
of
having
been
knocked
out
and
poisoned
the
best
of
which
was
that
Hermione
was
friends
with
Ron
again
hermione
even
escorted
them
down
to
breakfast
bringing
with
her
the
news
that
Ginny
had
argued
with
Dean
the
drowsing
creature
in
harry's
chest
suddenly
raised
its
head
sniffing
the
air
hopefully
what
did
they
row
about
he
asked
trying
to
sound
casual
as
they
turned
onto
a
seventh-floor
corridor
that
was
deserted
but
for
a
very
small
girl
who
had
been
examining
a
tapestry
of
trolls
in
tutus
she
looked
terrified
at
the
sight
of
the
approaching
sixth
years
and
dropped
the
heavy
brass
scales
she
was
carrying
it's
all
right
said
Hermione
kindly
hurrying
forward
to
help
her
here
she
tapped
the
broken
scales
with
her
wand
and
said
Reparo
the
girl
did
not
say
thank
you
but
remained
rooted
to
the
spot
as
they
passed
and
watched
them
out
of
sight
Ron
glanced
back
at
her
i
swear
they're
getting
smaller
he
said
never
mind
her
said
Harry
a
little
impatiently
what
did
Ginny
and
Dean
row
about
Hermione
oh
Dean
was
laughing
about
McLaggen
hitting
that
Bludgu
at
you
said
Hermione
it
must've
looked
funny
said
Ron
reasonably
it
didn't
look
funny
at
all
said
Hermione
hotly
it
looked
terrible
and
if
Coote
and
Peakes
hadn't
caught
Harry
he
could
have
been
very
badly
hurt
yeah
well
there
was
no
need
for
Ginny
and
Dean
to
split
up
over
it
said
Harry
still
trying
to
sound
casual
or
are
they
still
together
yes
they
are
but
why
are
you
so
interested
asked
Hermione
giving
Harry
a
sharp
look
i
just
don't
want
my
Quidditch
team
messed
up
again
he
said
hastily
but
Hermione
continued
to
look
suspicious
and
he
was
most
relieved
when
a
voice
behind
them
called
Harry
giving
him
an
excuse
to
turn
his
back
on
her
oh
hi
Luna
I
went
to
the
hospital
wing
to
find
you
said
Luna
rummaging
in
her
bag
but
they
said
you'd
left
she
thrust
what
appeared
to
be
a
green
onion
a
large
spotted
toadstool
and
a
considerable
amount
of
what
looked
like
cat
litter
into
ron's
hands
finally
pulling
out
a
rather
grubby
scroll
of
parchment
that
she
handed
to
Harry
i've
been
told
to
give
you
this
it
was
a
small
roll
of
parchment
which
Harry
recognized
at
once
as
another
invitation
to
a
lesson
with
Dumbledore
tonight
he
told
Ron
and
Hermione
once
he
had
unrolled
it
nice
commentary
last
match
said
Ron
to
Luna
as
she
took
back
the
green
onion
the
toadstool
and
the
cat
litter
luna
smiled
vaguely
you're
making
fun
of
me
aren't
you
she
said
everyone
says
I
was
dreadful
no
i'm
serious
said
Ron
earnestly
i
can't
remember
enjoying
commentary
more
what
is
this
by
the
way
he
added
holding
the
onionlike
object
up
to
eye
level
oh
it's
a
Gurdyroot
she
said
stuffing
the
cat
litter
and
the
toadstool
back
into
her
bag
you
can
keep
it
if
you
like
i've
got
a
few
of
them
they're
really
excellent
for
warding
off
Gulping
Plimpies
and
she
walked
away
leaving
Ron
chortling
still
clutching
the
Gurdyroot
you
know
she's
grown
on
me
Luna
he
said
as
they
set
off
again
for
the
Great
Hall
i
know
she's
insane
but
it's
in
a
good
He
stopped
talking
very
suddenly
lavender
Brown
was
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
marble
staircase
looking
thunderous
hi
said
Ron
nervously
c'mon
Harry
muttered
to
Hermione
and
they
sped
past
though
not
before
they
had
heard
Lavender
say
Why
didn't
you
tell
me
you
were
getting
out
today
and
why
was
she
with
you
ron
looked
both
sulky
and
annoyed
when
he
appeared
at
breakfast
half
an
hour
later
and
though
he
sat
with
Lavender
Harry
did
not
see
them
exchange
a
word
all
the
time
they
were
together
hermione
was
acting
as
though
she
was
quite
oblivious
to
all
of
this
but
once
or
twice
Harry
saw
an
inexplicable
smirk
cross
her
face
all
that
day
she
seemed
to
be
in
a
particularly
good
mood
and
that
evening
in
the
common
room
she
even
consented
to
look
over
in
other
words
finish
writing
harry's
Herbology
essay
something
she
had
been
resolutely
refusing
to
do
up
to
this
point
because
she
had
known
that
Harry
would
then
let
Ron
copy
his
work
thanks
a
lot
Hermione
said
Harry
giving
her
a
hasty
pat
on
the
back
as
he
checked
his
watch
and
saw
that
it
was
nearly
eight
o'clock
listen
Ive
got
to
hurry
or
i'll
be
late
for
Dumbledore
she
did
not
answer
but
merely
crossed
out
a
few
of
his
feebler
sentences
in
a
weary
sort
of
way
grinning
Harry
hurried
out
through
the
portrait
hole
and
off
to
the
headmasters
office
the
gargoyle
leapt
aside
at
the
mention
of
toffee
eclairs
and
Harry
took
the
spiral
staircase
two
steps
at
a
time
knocking
on
the
door
just
as
a
clock
within
chimed
eight
enter
called
Dumbledore
but
as
Harry
put
out
a
hand
to
push
the
door
it
was
wrenched
open
from
inside
there
stood
Professor
Trelawney
aha
she
cried
pointing
dramatically
at
Harry
as
she
blinked
at
him
through
her
magnifying
spectacles
so
this
is
the
reason
I
am
to
be
thrown
unceremoniously
from
your
office
Dumbledore
my
dear
Sybill
said
Dumbledore
in
a
slightly
exasperated
voice
there
is
no
question
of
throwing
you
unceremoniously
from
anywhere
but
Harry
does
have
an
appointment
and
I
really
don't
think
there
is
any
more
to
be
said
very
well
said
Professor
Trelawney
in
a
deeply
wounded
voice
if
you
will
not
banish
the
usurping
nag
so
be
it
perhaps
I
shall
find
a
school
where
my
talents
are
better
appreciated
she
pushed
past
Harry
and
disappeared
down
the
spiral
staircase
they
heard
her
stumble
halfway
down
and
Harry
guessed
that
she
had
tripped
over
one
of
her
trailing
shawls
please
close
the
door
and
sit
down
Harry
said
Dumbledore
sounding
rather
tired
harry
obeyed
noticing
as
he
took
his
usual
seat
in
front
of
dumbledore's
desk
that
the
Pensieve
lay
between
them
once
more
as
did
two
more
tiny
crystal
bottles
full
of
swirling
memory
professor
Trelawney
still
isn't
happy
Firenze
is
teaching
then
harry
asked
no
said
Dumbledore
Divination
is
turning
out
to
be
much
more
trouble
than
I
could
have
foreseen
never
having
studied
the
subject
myself
i
cannot
ask
Firenze
to
return
to
the
forest
where
he
is
now
an
outcast
nor
can
I
ask
Sybill
Trelawney
to
leave
between
ourselves
she
has
no
idea
of
the
danger
she
would
be
in
outside
the
castle
she
does
not
know
and
I
think
it
would
be
unwise
to
enlighten
her
that
she
made
the
prophecy
about
you
and
Voldemort
you
see
dumbledore
heaved
a
deep
sigh
then
said
But
never
mind
my
staffing
problems
we
have
much
more
important
matters
to
discuss
firstly
have
you
managed
the
task
I
set
you
at
the
end
of
our
previous
lesson
ah
said
Harry
brought
up
short
what
with
Apparition
lessons
and
Quidditch
and
Ron
being
poisoned
and
getting
his
skull
cracked
and
his
determination
to
find
out
what
Draco
Malfoy
was
up
to
Harry
had
almost
forgotten
about
the
memory
Dumbledore
had
asked
him
to
extract
from
Professor
Slughorn
well
I
asked
Professor
Slughorn
about
it
at
the
end
of
Potions
sir
but
er
he
wouldn't
give
it
to
me
there
was
a
little
silence
i
see
said
Dumbledore
eventually
peering
at
Harry
over
the
top
of
his
half-moon
spectacles
and
giving
Harry
the
usual
sensation
that
he
was
being
x-rayed
and
you
feel
that
you
have
exerted
your
very
best
efforts
in
this
matter
do
you
that
you
have
exercised
all
of
your
considerable
ingenuity
that
you
have
left
no
depth
of
cunning
unplumbed
in
your
quest
to
retrieve
the
memory
well
Harry
stalled
at
a
loss
for
what
to
say
next
his
single
attempt
to
get
hold
of
the
memory
suddenly
seemed
embarrassingly
feeble
well
the
day
Ron
swallowed
love
potion
by
mistake
I
took
him
to
Professor
Slughorn
i
thought
maybe
if
I
got
Professor
Slughorn
in
a
good
enough
mood
And
did
that
work
asked
Dumbledore
well
no
sir
because
Ron
got
poisoned
which
naturally
made
you
forget
all
about
trying
to
retrieve
the
memory
I
would
have
expected
nothing
else
while
your
best
friend
was
in
danger
once
it
became
clear
that
mr.
Weasley
was
going
to
make
a
full
recovery
however
I
would
have
hoped
that
you
returned
to
the
task
I
set
you
i
thought
I
made
it
clear
to
you
how
very
important
that
memory
is
indeed
I
did
my
best
to
impress
upon
you
that
it
is
the
most
crucial
memory
of
all
and
that
we
will
be
wasting
our
time
without
it
a
hot
prickly
feeling
of
shame
spread
from
the
top
of
Harrys
head
all
the
way
down
his
body
dumbledore
had
not
raised
his
voice
he
did
not
even
sound
angry
but
Harry
would
have
preferred
him
to
yell
this
cold
disappointment
was
worse
than
anything
sir
he
said
a
little
desperately
it
isn't
that
I
wasn't
bothered
or
anything
i've
just
had
other
other
things
other
things
on
your
mind
Dumbledore
finished
the
sentence
for
him
i
see
silence
fell
between
them
again
the
most
uncomfortable
silence
Harry
had
ever
experienced
with
Dumbledore
it
seemed
to
go
on
and
on
punctuated
only
by
the
little
grunting
snores
of
the
portrait
of
Armando
Dippet
over
dumbledore's
head
harry
felt
strangely
diminished
as
though
he
had
shrunk
a
little
since
he
had
entered
the
room
when
he
could
stand
it
no
longer
he
said
Professor
Dumbledore
i'm
really
sorry
i
should
have
done
more
i
should
have
realized
you
wouldn't
have
asked
me
to
do
it
if
it
wasn't
really
important
thank
you
for
saying
that
Harry
said
Dumbledore
quietly
may
I
hope
then
that
you
will
give
this
matter
higher
priority
from
now
on
there
will
be
little
point
in
our
meeting
after
tonight
unless
we
have
that
memory
i'll
do
it
sir
i'll
get
it
from
him
he
said
earnestly
then
we
shall
say
no
more
about
it
just
now
said
Dumbledore
more
kindly
but
continue
with
our
story
where
we
left
off
you
remember
where
that
was
yes
sir
said
Harry
quickly
voldemort
killed
his
father
and
his
grandparents
and
made
it
look
as
though
his
Uncle
Morfin
did
it
then
he
went
back
to
Hogwarts
and
he
asked
he
asked
Professor
Slughorn
about
Horcruxes
he
mumbled
shamefacedly
very
good
said
Dumbledore
now
you
will
remember
I
hope
that
I
told
you
at
the
very
outset
of
these
meetings
of
ours
that
we
would
be
entering
the
realms
of
guesswork
and
speculation
yes
sir
thus
far
as
I
hope
you
agree
I
have
shown
you
reasonably
firm
sources
of
fact
for
my
deductions
as
to
what
Voldemort
did
until
the
age
of
seventeen
harry
nodded
but
now
Harry
said
Dumbledore
now
things
become
murkier
and
stranger
if
it
was
difficult
to
find
evidence
about
the
boy
Riddle
it
has
been
almost
impossible
to
find
anyone
prepared
to
reminisce
about
the
man
Voldemort
in
fact
I
doubt
whether
there
is
a
soul
alive
apart
from
himself
who
could
give
us
a
full
account
of
his
life
since
he
left
Hogwarts
however
I
have
two
last
memories
that
I
would
like
to
share
with
you
dumbledore
indicated
the
two
little
crystal
bottles
gleaming
beside
the
Pensieve
i
shall
then
be
glad
of
your
opinion
as
to
whether
the
conclusions
I
have
drawn
from
them
seem
likely
the
idea
that
Dumbledore
valued
his
opinion
this
highly
made
Harry
feel
even
more
deeply
ashamed
that
he
had
failed
in
the
task
of
retrieving
the
Horcrux
memory
and
he
shifted
guiltily
in
his
seat
as
Dumbledore
raised
the
first
of
the
two
bottles
to
the
light
and
examined
it
i
hope
you
are
not
tired
of
diving
into
other
people's
memories
for
they
are
curious
recollections
these
two
he
said
this
first
one
came
from
a
very
old
house-elf
by
the
name
of
Hokey
before
we
see
what
Hokey
witnessed
I
must
quickly
recount
how
Lord
Voldemort
left
Hogwarts
he
reached
the
seventh
year
of
his
schooling
with
as
you
might
have
expected
top
grades
in
every
examination
he
had
taken
all
around
him
his
classmates
were
deciding
which
jobs
they
were
to
pursue
once
they
had
left
Hogwarts
nearly
everybody
expected
spectacular
things
from
Tom
Riddle
prefect
Head
Boy
winner
of
the
Award
for
Special
Services
to
the
School
i
know
that
several
teachers
Professor
Slughorn
amongst
them
suggested
that
he
join
the
Ministry
of
Magic
offered
to
set
up
appointments
put
him
in
touch
with
useful
contacts
he
refused
all
offers
the
next
thing
the
staff
knew
Voldemort
was
working
at
Borgin
and
Burkes
at
Borgin
and
Burkes
harry
repeated
stunned
at
Borgin
and
Burkes
repeated
Dumbledore
calmly
i
think
you
will
see
what
attractions
the
place
held
for
him
when
we
have
entered
hokey's
memory
but
this
was
not
voldemort's
first
choice
of
job
hardly
anyone
knew
of
it
at
the
time
I
was
one
of
the
few
in
whom
the
then
headmaster
confided
but
Voldemort
first
approached
Professor
Dippet
and
asked
whether
he
could
remain
at
Hogwarts
as
a
teacher
he
wanted
to
stay
here
why
asked
Harry
more
amazed
still
i
believe
he
had
several
reasons
though
he
confided
none
of
them
to
Professor
Dippet
said
Dumbledore
firstly
and
very
importantly
Voldemort
was
I
believe
more
attached
to
this
school
than
he
has
ever
been
to
a
person
hogwarts
was
where
he
had
been
happiest
the
first
and
only
place
he
had
felt
at
home
harry
felt
slightly
uncomfortable
at
these
words
for
this
was
exactly
how
he
felt
about
Hogwarts
too
secondly
the
castle
is
a
stronghold
of
ancient
magic
undoubtedly
Voldemort
had
penetrated
many
more
of
its
secrets
than
most
of
the
students
who
pass
through
the
place
but
he
may
have
felt
that
there
were
still
mysteries
to
unravel
stores
of
magic
to
tap
and
thirdly
as
a
teacher
he
would
have
had
great
power
and
influence
over
young
witches
and
wizards
perhaps
he
had
gained
the
idea
from
Professor
Slughorn
the
teacher
with
whom
he
was
on
best
terms
who
had
demonstrated
how
influential
a
role
a
teacher
can
play
i
do
not
imagine
for
an
instant
that
Voldemort
envisaged
spending
the
rest
of
his
life
at
Hogwarts
but
I
do
think
that
he
saw
it
as
a
useful
recruiting
ground
and
a
place
where
he
might
begin
to
build
himself
an
army
but
he
didn't
get
the
job
sir
no
he
did
not
professor
Dippet
told
him
that
he
was
too
young
at
eighteen
but
invited
him
to
reapply
in
a
few
years
if
he
still
wished
to
teach
how
did
you
feel
about
that
sir
asked
Harry
hesitantly
deeply
uneasy
said
Dumbledore
i
had
advised
Armando
against
the
appointment
I
did
not
give
the
reasons
I
have
given
you
for
Professor
Dippet
was
very
fond
of
Voldemort
and
convinced
of
his
honesty
but
I
did
not
want
Lord
Voldemort
back
at
this
school
and
especially
not
in
a
position
of
power
which
job
did
he
want
sir
what
subject
did
he
want
to
teach
somehow
Harry
knew
the
answer
even
before
Dumbledore
gave
it
defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
it
was
being
taught
at
the
time
by
an
old
Professor
by
the
name
of
Galatea
Merrythought
who
had
been
at
Hogwarts
for
nearly
fifty
years
so
Voldemort
went
off
to
Borgin
and
Burkes
and
all
the
staff
who
had
admired
him
said
what
a
waste
it
was
a
brilliant
young
wizard
like
that
working
in
a
shop
however
Voldemort
was
no
mere
assistant
polite
and
handsome
and
clever
he
was
soon
given
particular
jobs
of
the
type
that
only
exist
in
a
place
like
Borgin
and
Burkes
which
specializes
as
you
know
Harry
in
objects
with
unusual
and
powerful
properties
voldemort
was
sent
to
persuade
people
to
part
with
their
treasures
for
sale
by
the
partners
and
he
was
by
all
accounts
unusually
gifted
at
doing
this
i'll
bet
he
was
said
Harry
unable
to
contain
himself
well
quite
said
Dumbledore
with
a
faint
smile
and
now
it
is
time
to
hear
from
Hokey
the
house-elf
who
worked
for
a
very
old
very
rich
witch
by
the
name
of
Hepzibah
Smith
dumbledore
tapped
a
bottle
with
his
wand
the
cork
flew
out
and
he
tipped
the
swirling
memory
into
the
Pensieve
saying
as
he
did
so
After
you
Harry
harry
got
to
his
feet
and
bent
once
more
over
the
rippling
silver
contents
of
the
stone
basin
until
his
face
touched
them
he
tumbled
through
dark
nothingness
and
landed
in
a
sitting
room
in
front
of
an
immensely
fat
old
lady
wearing
an
elaborate
ginger
wig
and
a
brilliant
pink
set
of
robes
that
flowed
all
around
her
giving
her
the
look
of
a
melting
iced
cake
she
was
looking
into
a
small
jeweled
mirror
and
dabbing
rouge
onto
her
already
scarlet
cheeks
with
a
large
powder
puff
while
the
tiniest
and
oldest
house-elf
Harry
had
ever
seen
laced
her
fleshy
feet
into
tight
satin
slippers
hurry
up
Hokey
said
Hepzibah
imperiously
he
said
he'd
come
at
four
it's
only
a
couple
of
minutes
to
and
he's
never
been
late
yet
she
tucked
away
her
powder
puff
as
the
house-elf
straightened
up
the
top
of
the
elf's
head
barely
reached
the
seat
of
hepzibah's
chair
and
her
papery
skin
hung
off
her
frame
just
like
the
crisp
linen
sheet
she
wore
draped
like
a
toga
how
do
I
look
said
Hepzibah
turning
her
head
to
admire
the
various
angles
of
her
face
in
the
mirror
lovely
madam
squeaked
Hokey
harry
could
only
assume
that
it
was
down
in
Hokeys
contract
that
she
must
lie
through
her
teeth
when
asked
this
question
because
Hepzibah
Smith
looked
a
long
way
from
lovely
in
his
opinion
a
tinkling
doorbell
rang
and
both
mistress
and
elf
jumped
quick
quick
he's
here
Hokey
cried
Hepzibah
and
the
elf
scurried
out
of
the
room
which
was
so
crammed
with
objects
that
it
was
difficult
to
see
how
anybody
could
navigate
their
way
across
it
without
knocking
over
at
least
a
dozen
things
There
were
cabinets
full
of
little
lacquered
boxes
cases
full
of
gold-embossed
books
shelves
of
orbs
and
celestial
globes
and
many
flourishing
potted
plants
in
brass
containers
in
fact
the
room
looked
like
a
cross
between
a
magical
antique
shop
and
a
conservatory
the
house-elf
returned
within
minutes
followed
by
a
tall
young
man
Harry
had
no
difficulty
whatsoever
in
recognizing
as
Voldemort
he
was
plainly
dressed
in
a
black
suit
his
hair
was
a
little
longer
than
it
had
been
at
school
and
his
cheeks
were
hollowed
but
all
of
this
suited
him
he
looked
more
handsome
than
ever
he
picked
his
way
through
the
cramped
room
with
an
air
that
showed
he
had
visited
many
times
before
and
bowed
low
over
hepzibah's
fat
little
hand
brushing
it
with
his
lips
i
brought
you
flowers
he
said
quietly
producing
a
bunch
of
roses
from
nowhere
you
naughty
boy
you
shouldn't
have
squealed
old
Hepzibah
though
Harry
noticed
that
she
had
an
empty
vase
standing
ready
on
the
nearest
little
table
you
do
spoil
this
old
lady
Tom
sit
down
sit
down
where's
Hokey
ah
the
house-elf
had
come
dashing
back
into
the
room
carrying
a
tray
of
little
cakes
which
she
set
at
her
mistress's
elbow
help
yourself
Tom
said
Hepzibah
I
know
how
you
love
my
cakes
now
how
are
you
you
look
pale
they
overwork
you
at
that
shop
i've
said
it
a
hundred
times
voldemort
smiled
mechanically
and
Hepzibah
simpered
well
what's
your
excuse
for
visiting
this
time
she
asked
bat-ring
her
lashes
mr.
Burke
would
like
to
make
an
improved
offer
for
the
goblin-made
armor
said
Voldemort
five
hundred
Galleons
he
feels
it
is
a
more
than
fair
now
now
not
so
fast
or
Ill
think
you're
only
here
for
my
trinkets
pouted
Hepzibah
i
am
ordered
here
because
of
them
said
Voldemort
quietly
i
am
only
a
poor
assistant
madam
who
must
do
as
he
is
told
mr.
Burke
wishes
me
to
inquire
oh
mr.
Burke
phooey
said
Hepzibah
waving
a
little
hand
i've
something
to
show
you
that
i've
never
shown
mr.
Burke
can
you
keep
a
secret
Tom
will
you
promise
you
won't
tell
mr.
Burke
i've
got
it
he'd
never
let
me
rest
if
he
knew
i'd
shown
it
to
you
and
i'm
not
selling
not
to
Burke
not
to
anyone
but
you
Tom
you'll
appreciate
it
for
its
history
not
how
many
Galleons
you
can
get
for
it
i'd
be
glad
to
see
anything
Miss
Hepzibah
shows
me
said
Voldemort
quietly
and
Hepzibah
gave
another
girlish
giggle
i
had
Hokey
bring
it
out
for
me
hokey
where
are
you
i
want
to
show
mr.
Riddle
our
finest
treasure
in
fact
bring
both
while
you're
at
it
here
madam
squeaked
the
house-elf
and
Harry
saw
two
leather
boxes
one
on
top
of
the
other
moving
across
the
room
as
if
of
their
own
volition
though
he
knew
the
tiny
elf
was
holding
them
over
her
head
as
she
wended
her
way
between
tables
pouffes
and
footstools
now
said
Hepzibah
happily
taking
the
boxes
from
the
elf
laying
them
in
her
lap
and
preparing
to
open
the
topmost
one
I
think
you'll
like
this
Tom
oh
if
my
family
knew
I
was
showing
you
they
can't
wait
to
get
their
hands
on
this
she
opened
the
lid
harry
edged
forward
a
little
to
get
a
better
view
and
saw
what
looked
like
a
small
golden
cup
with
two
finely
wrought
handles
i
wonder
whether
you
know
what
it
is
Tom
pick
it
up
have
a
good
look
whispered
Hepzibah
and
Voldemort
stretched
out
a
long-fingered
hand
and
lifted
the
cup
by
one
handle
out
of
its
snug
silken
wrappings
harry
thought
he
saw
a
red
gleam
in
his
dark
eyes
his
greedy
expression
was
curiously
mirrored
on
Hepzibahs
face
except
that
her
tiny
eyes
were
fixed
upon
voldemort's
handsome
features
a
badger
murmured
Voldemort
examining
the
engraving
upon
the
cup
then
this
was
helga
hufflepuff's
as
you
very
well
know
you
clever
boy
said
Hepzibah
leaning
forward
with
a
loud
creaking
of
corsets
and
actually
pinching
his
hollow
cheek
didn't
I
tell
you
I
was
distantly
descended
this
has
been
handed
down
in
the
family
for
years
and
years
lovely
isn't
it
and
all
sorts
of
powers
it's
supposed
to
possess
too
but
I
haven't
tested
them
thoroughly
I
just
keep
it
nice
and
safe
in
here
she
hooked
the
cup
back
off
voldemort's
long
forefinger
and
restored
it
gently
to
its
box
too
intent
upon
settling
it
carefully
back
into
position
to
notice
the
shadow
that
crossed
voldemort's
face
as
the
cup
was
taken
away
now
then
said
Hepzibah
happily
wheres
Hokey
oh
yes
there
you
are
take
that
away
now
Hokey
the
elf
obediently
took
the
boxed
cup
and
Hepzibah
turned
her
attention
to
the
much
flatter
box
in
her
lap
i
think
you'll
like
this
even
more
Tom
she
whispered
lean
in
a
little
dear
boy
so
you
can
see
of
course
Burke
knows
i've
got
this
one
I
bought
it
from
him
and
I
daresay
he'd
love
to
get
it
back
when
i'm
gone
she
slid
back
the
fine
filigree
clasp
and
flipped
open
the
box
there
upon
the
smooth
crimson
velvet
lay
a
heavy
golden
locket
voldemort
reached
out
his
hand
without
invitation
this
time
and
held
it
up
to
the
light
staring
at
it
slytherin's
mark
he
said
quietly
as
the
light
played
upon
an
ornate
serpentine
S
that's
right
said
Hepzibah
delighted
apparently
at
the
sight
of
Voldemort
gazing
at
her
locket
transfixed
i
had
to
pay
an
arm
and
a
leg
for
it
but
I
couldn't
let
it
pass
not
a
real
treasure
like
that
had
to
have
it
for
my
collection
burke
bought
it
apparently
from
a
ragged-looking
woman
who
seemed
to
have
stolen
it
but
had
no
idea
of
its
true
value
there
was
no
mistaking
it
this
time
voldemort's
eyes
flashed
scarlet
at
the
words
and
Harry
saw
his
knuckles
whiten
on
the
locket's
chain
I
daresay
Burke
paid
her
a
pittance
but
there
you
are
pretty
isn't
it
and
again
all
kinds
of
powers
attributed
to
it
though
I
just
keep
it
nice
and
safe
she
reached
out
to
take
the
locket
back
for
a
moment
Harry
thought
Voldemort
was
not
going
to
let
go
of
it
but
then
it
had
slid
through
his
fingers
and
was
back
in
its
red
velvet
cushion
so
there
you
are
Tom
clear
and
I
hope
you
enjoyed
that
she
looked
him
full
in
the
face
and
for
the
first
time
Harry
saw
her
foolish
smile
falter
are
you
all
right
dear
oh
yes
said
Voldemort
quietly
yes
i'm
very
well
i
thought
but
a
trick
of
the
light
I
suppose
said
Hepzibah
looking
unnerved
and
Harry
guessed
that
she
too
had
seen
the
momentary
red
gleam
in
voldemort's
eyes
here
Hokey
take
these
away
and
lock
them
up
again
the
usual
enchantments
time
to
leave
Harry
said
Dumbledore
quietly
and
as
the
in
tie
elf
bobbed
away
bearing
the
boxes
Dumbledore
grasped
Harry
once
again
above
the
elbow
and
together
they
rose
up
through
oblivion
and
back
to
dumbledore's
office
hepzibah
Smith
died
two
days
after
that
little
scene
said
Dumbledore
resuming
his
seat
and
indicating
that
Harry
should
do
the
same
hokey
the
house-elf
was
convicted
by
the
Ministry
of
poisoning
her
mistress's
evening
cocoa
by
accident
no
way
said
Harry
angrily
i
see
we
are
of
one
mind
said
Dumbledore
certainly
then
are
many
similarities
between
this
death
and
that
of
the
Riddles
in
both
cases
somebody
else
took
the
blame
someone
who
had
a
clear
memory
of
having
caused
the
death
Hokey
confessed
she
remembered
putting
something
in
her
mistress's
cocoa
that
turned
out
not
to
be
sugar
but
a
lethal
and
little-known
poison
said
Dumbledore
it
was
concluded
that
she
had
not
meant
to
do
it
but
being
old
and
confused
voldemort
modified
her
memory
just
like
he
did
with
Morfin
yes
that
is
my
conclusion
too
said
Dumbledore
and
just
as
with
Morfin
the
Ministry
was
predisposed
to
suspect
Hokey
because
she
was
a
house-elf
said
Harry
he
had
rarely
felt
more
in
sympathy
with
the
society
Hermione
had
set
up
S
p.e.w.
Precisely
said
Dumbledore
she
was
old
she
admitted
to
having
tampered
with
the
drink
and
nobody
at
the
Ministry
bothered
to
inquire
further
as
in
the
case
of
Morfin
by
the
time
I
traced
her
and
managed
to
extract
this
memory
her
life
was
almost
over
but
her
memory
of
course
proves
nothing
except
that
Voldemort
knew
of
the
existence
of
the
cup
and
the
locket
by
the
time
Hokey
was
convicted
hepzibah's
family
had
realized
that
two
of
her
greatest
treasures
were
missing
it
took
them
a
while
to
be
sure
of
this
for
she
had
many
hiding
places
having
always
guarded
her
collection
most
jealously
but
before
they
were
sure
beyond
doubt
that
the
cup
and
the
locket
were
both
gone
the
assistant
who
had
worked
at
Borgin
and
Burkes
the
young
man
who
had
visited
Hepzibah
so
regularly
and
charmed
her
so
well
had
resigned
his
post
and
vanished
his
superiors
had
no
idea
where
he
had
gone
they
were
as
surprised
as
anyone
at
his
disappearance
and
that
was
the
last
that
was
seen
or
heard
of
Tom
Riddle
for
a
very
long
time
now
said
Dumbledore
if
you
don't
mind
Harry
I
want
to
pause
once
more
to
draw
your
attention
to
certain
points
of
our
story
voldemort
had
committed
another
murder
whether
it
was
his
first
since
he
killed
the
Riddles
I
do
not
know
but
I
think
it
was
this
time
as
you
will
have
seen
he
killed
not
for
revenge
but
for
gain
he
wanted
the
two
fabulous
trophies
that
poor
besotted
old
woman
showed
him
just
as
he
had
once
robbed
the
other
children
at
his
orphanage
just
as
he
had
stolen
his
Uncle
Morfins
ring
so
he
ran
off
now
with
Hepzibahs
cup
and
locket
but
said
Harry
frowning
it
seems
mad
risking
everything
throwing
away
his
job
just
for
those
mad
to
you
perhaps
but
not
to
Voldemort
said
Dumbledore
i
hope
you
will
understand
in
due
course
exactly
what
those
objects
meant
to
him
Harry
but
you
must
admit
that
it
is
not
difficult
to
imagine
that
he
saw
the
locket
at
least
as
rightfully
his
the
locket
maybe
said
Harry
but
why
take
the
cup
as
well
it
had
belonged
to
another
of
Hogwartss
founders
said
Dumbledore
i
think
he
still
felt
a
great
pull
toward
the
school
and
that
he
could
not
resist
an
object
so
steeped
in
Hogwarts
history
there
were
other
reasons
I
think
i
hope
to
be
able
to
demonstrate
them
to
you
in
due
course
and
now
for
the
very
last
recollection
I
have
to
show
you
at
least
until
you
manage
to
retrieve
Professor
slughorn's
memory
for
us
ten
years
separates
Hokeys
memory
and
this
one
ten
years
during
which
we
can
only
guess
at
what
Lord
Voldemort
was
doing
harry
got
to
his
feet
once
more
as
Dumbledore
emptied
the
last
memory
into
the
Pensieve
whose
memory
is
it
he
asked
mine
said
Dumbledore
and
Harry
dived
after
Dumbledore
through
the
shifting
silver
mass
landing
in
the
very
office
he
had
just
left
there
was
Fawkes
slumbering
happily
on
his
perch
and
there
behind
the
desk
was
Dumbledore
who
looked
very
similar
to
the
Dumbledore
standing
beside
Harry
though
both
hands
were
whole
and
undamaged
and
his
face
was
perhaps
a
little
less
lined
the
one
difference
between
the
present-day
office
and
this
one
was
that
it
was
snowing
in
the
past
bluish
flecks
were
drifting
past
the
window
in
the
dark
and
building
up
on
the
outside
ledge
the
younger
Dumbledore
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
something
and
sure
enough
moments
after
their
arrival
there
was
a
knock
on
the
door
and
he
said
Enter
harry
let
out
a
hastily
stifled
gasp
voldemort
had
entered
the
room
his
features
were
not
those
Harry
had
seen
emerge
from
the
great
stone
cauldron
almost
two
years
ago
They
were
not
as
snake-like
the
eyes
were
not
yet
scarlet
the
face
not
yet
masklike
and
yet
he
was
no
longer
handsome
Tom
Riddle
it
was
as
though
his
features
had
been
burned
and
blurred
they
were
waxy
and
oddly
distorted
and
the
whites
of
the
eyes
now
had
a
permanently
bloody
look
though
the
pupils
were
not
yet
the
slits
that
Harry
knew
they
would
become
he
was
wearing
a
long
black
cloak
and
his
face
was
as
pale
as
the
snow
glistening
on
his
shoulders
the
Dumbledore
behind
the
desk
showed
no
sign
of
surprise
evidently
this
visit
had
been
made
by
appointment
good
evening
Tom
said
Dumbledore
easily
won't
you
sit
down
thank
you
said
Voldemort
and
he
took
the
seat
to
which
Dumbledore
had
gestured
the
very
seat
by
the
looks
of
it
that
Harry
had
just
vacated
in
the
present
i
heard
that
you
had
become
headmaster
he
said
and
his
voice
was
slightly
higher
and
colder
than
it
had
been
a
worthy
choice
i
am
glad
you
approve
said
Dumbledore
smiling
may
I
offer
you
a
drink
that
would
be
welcome
said
Voldemort
i
have
come
a
long
way
dumbledore
stood
and
swept
over
to
the
cabinet
where
he
now
kept
the
Pensieve
but
which
then
was
full
of
bottles
having
handed
Voldemort
a
goblet
of
wine
and
poured
one
for
himself
he
returned
to
the
seat
behind
his
desk
so
Tom
to
what
do
I
owe
the
pleasure
voldemort
did
not
answer
at
once
but
merely
sipped
his
wine
they
do
not
call
me
Tom
anymore
he
said
these
days
am
known
as
i
know
what
you
are
known
as
said
Dumbledore
smiling
pleasantly
but
to
me
i'm
afraid
you
will
always
be
Tom
Riddle
it
is
one
of
the
irritating
things
about
old
teachers
i
am
afraid
that
they
never
quite
forget
their
charges
youthful
beginnings
he
raised
his
glass
as
though
toasting
Voldemort
whose
face
remained
expressionless
nevertheless
Harry
felt
the
atmosphere
in
the
room
change
subtly
dumbledore's
refusal
to
use
Voldemorts
chosen
name
was
a
refusal
to
allow
Voldemort
to
dictate
the
terms
of
the
meeting
and
Harry
could
tell
that
Voldemort
took
it
as
such
i
am
surprised
you
have
remained
here
so
long
said
Voldemort
after
a
short
pause
i
always
wondered
why
a
wizard
such
as
yourself
never
wished
to
leave
school
well
said
Dumbledore
still
smiling
to
a
wizard
such
as
myself
there
can
be
nothing
more
important
than
passing
on
ancient
skills
helping
hone
young
minds
if
I
remember
correctly
you
once
saw
the
attraction
of
teaching
too
i
see
it
still
said
Voldemort
i
merely
wondered
why
you
who
are
so
often
asked
for
advice
by
the
Ministry
and
who
have
twice
I
think
been
offered
the
post
of
Minister
three
times
at
the
last
count
actually
said
Dumbledore
but
the
Ministry
never
attracted
me
as
a
career
again
something
we
have
in
common
I
think
voldemort
inclined
his
head
unsmiling
and
took
another
sip
of
wine
dumbledore
did
not
break
the
silence
that
stretched
between
them
now
but
waited
with
a
look
of
pleasant
expectancy
for
Voldemort
to
talk
first
i
have
returned
he
said
after
a
little
while
later
perhaps
than
Professor
Dippet
expected
but
I
have
returned
nevertheless
to
request
again
what
he
once
told
me
I
was
too
young
to
have
i
have
come
to
you
to
ask
that
you
permit
me
to
return
to
this
castle
to
teach
i
think
you
must
know
that
I
have
seen
and
done
much
since
I
left
this
place
i
could
show
and
tell
your
students
things
they
can
gain
from
no
other
wizard
dumbledore
considered
Voldemort
over
the
top
of
his
own
goblet
for
a
while
before
speaking
yes
I
certainly
do
know
that
you
have
seen
and
done
much
since
leaving
us
he
said
quietly
rumors
of
your
doings
have
reached
your
old
school
Tom
i
should
be
sorry
to
believe
half
of
them
voldemort's
expression
remained
impassive
as
he
said
Greatness
inspires
envy
envy
engenders
spite
spite
spawns
lies
you
must
know
this
Dumbledore
you
call
it
greatness
what
you
have
been
doing
do
you
asked
Dumbledore
delicately
certainly
said
Voldemort
and
his
eyes
seemed
to
burn
red
i
have
experimented
I
have
pushed
the
boundaries
of
magic
further
perhaps
than
they
have
ever
been
pushed
of
some
kinds
of
magic
Dumbledore
corrected
him
quietly
of
some
of
others
you
remain
forgive
me
woefully
ignorant
for
the
first
time
Voldemort
smiled
it
was
a
taut
leer
an
evil
thing
more
threatening
than
a
look
of
rage
the
old
argument
he
said
softly
but
nothing
I
have
seen
in
the
world
has
supported
your
famous
pronouncements
that
love
is
more
powerful
than
my
kind
of
magic
Dumbledore
perhaps
you
have
been
looking
in
the
wrong
places
suggested
Dumbledore
well
then
what
better
place
to
start
my
fresh
researches
than
here
at
Hogwarts
said
Voldemort
will
you
let
me
return
will
you
let
me
share
my
knowledge
with
your
students
i
place
myself
and
my
talents
at
your
disposal
i
am
yours
to
command
dumbledore
raised
his
eyebrows
and
what
will
become
of
those
whom
you
command
what
will
happen
to
those
who
call
themselves
or
so
rumor
has
it
the
Death
Eaters
harry
could
tell
that
Voldemort
had
not
expected
Dumbledore
to
know
this
name
he
saw
Voldemorts
eyes
flash
red
again
and
the
slitlike
nostrils
flare
my
friends
he
said
after
a
moment's
pause
will
carry
on
without
me
I
am
sure
i
am
glad
to
hear
that
you
consider
them
friends
said
Dumbledore
i
was
under
the
impression
that
they
are
more
in
the
order
of
servants
you
are
mistaken
said
Voldemort
then
if
I
were
to
go
to
the
hog's
Head
tonight
I
would
not
find
a
group
of
them
Nott
Rosier
Muldber
Dolohov
awaiting
your
return
devoted
friends
indeed
to
travel
this
far
with
you
on
a
snowy
night
merely
to
wish
you
luck
as
you
attempted
to
secure
a
teaching
post
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
dumbledore's
detailed
knowledge
of
those
with
whom
he
was
traveling
was
even
less
welcome
to
Voldemort
however
he
rallied
almost
at
once
you
are
omniscient
as
ever
Dumbledore
oh
no
merely
friendly
with
the
local
barmen
said
Dumbledore
lightly
now
Tom
dumbledore
set
down
his
empty
glass
and
drew
himself
up
in
his
seat
the
tips
of
his
fingers
together
in
a
very
characteristic
gesture
let
us
speak
openly
why
have
you
come
here
tonight
surrounded
by
henchmen
to
request
a
job
we
both
know
you
do
not
want
voldemort
looked
coldly
surprised
a
job
I
do
not
want
on
the
contrary
Dumbledore
I
want
it
very
much
oh
you
want
to
come
back
to
Hogwarts
but
you
do
not
want
to
teach
any
more
than
you
wanted
to
when
you
were
eighteen
what
is
it
you're
after
Tom
why
not
try
an
open
request
for
once
voldemort
sneered
if
you
do
not
want
to
give
me
a
job
of
course
I
don't
said
Dumbledore
and
I
don't
think
for
a
moment
you
expected
me
to
nevertheless
you
came
here
you
asked
you
must
have
had
a
purpose
voldemort
stood
up
he
looked
less
like
Tom
Riddle
than
ever
his
features
thick
with
rage
this
is
your
final
word
it
is
said
Dumbledore
also
standing
then
we
have
nothing
more
to
say
to
each
other
no
nothing
said
Dumbledore
and
a
great
sadness
filled
his
face
the
time
is
long
gone
when
I
could
frighten
you
with
a
burning
wardrobe
and
force
you
to
make
repayment
for
your
crimes
but
I
wish
I
could
Tom
i
wish
I
could
for
a
second
Harry
was
on
the
verge
of
shouting
a
pointless
warning
He
was
sure
that
voldemort's
hand
had
twitched
toward
his
pocket
and
his
wand
but
then
the
moment
had
passed
Voldemort
had
turned
away
the
door
was
closing
and
he
was
gone
harry
felt
dumbledore's
hand
close
over
his
arm
again
and
moments
later
they
were
standing
together
on
almost
the
same
spot
but
there
was
no
snow
building
on
the
window
ledge
and
dumbledore's
hand
was
blackened
and
dead-looking
once
more
why
said
Harry
at
once
looking
up
into
dumbledore's
face
why
did
he
come
back
did
you
ever
find
out
i
have
ideas
said
Dumbledore
but
no
more
than
that
what
ideas
sir
i
shall
tell
you
Harry
when
you
have
retrieved
that
memory
from
Professor
Slughorn
said
Dumbledore
when
you
have
that
last
piece
of
the
jigsaw
everything
will
I
hope
be
clear
to
both
of
us
harry
was
still
burning
with
curiosity
and
even
though
Dumbledore
had
walked
to
the
door
and
was
holding
it
open
for
him
he
did
not
move
at
once
was
he
after
the
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
job
again
sir
he
didn't
say
oh
he
definitely
wanted
the
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
job
said
Dumbledore
the
aftermath
of
our
little
meeting
proved
that
you
see
we
have
never
been
able
to
keep
a
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
teacher
for
longer
than
a
year
since
I
refused
the
post
to
Lord
Voldemort
chapter
The
Unknowable
Room
harry
wracked
his
brains
over
the
next
week
as
to
how
he
was
to
persuade
Slughorn
to
hand
over
the
true
memory
but
nothing
in
the
nature
of
a
brain
wave
occurred
and
he
was
reduced
to
doing
what
he
did
increasingly
these
days
when
at
a
loss
poring
over
his
Potions
book
hoping
that
the
Prince
would
have
scribbled
something
useful
in
a
margin
as
he
had
done
so
many
times
before
you
won't
find
anything
in
there
said
Hermione
firmly
late
on
Sunday
evening
don't
start
Hermione
said
Harry
if
it
hadn't
been
for
the
Prince
Ron
wouldn't
be
sitting
here
now
he
would
if
you'd
just
listened
to
Snape
in
our
first
year
said
Hermione
dismissively
harry
ignored
her
he
had
just
found
an
incantation
sectum-sempra
scrawled
in
a
margin
above
the
intriguing
words
For
enemies
and
was
itching
to
try
it
out
but
thought
it
best
not
to
in
front
of
Hermione
instead
he
surreptitiously
folded
down
the
corner
of
the
page
they
were
sitting
beside
the
fire
in
the
common
room
the
only
other
people
awake
were
fellow
sixth
years
there
had
been
a
cer-tain
amount
of
excitement
earlier
when
they
had
come
back
from
dinner
to
find
a
new
sign
on
the
notice
board
that
announced
the
date
for
their
Apparition
Test
those
who
would
be
seventeen
on
or
before
the
first
test
date
the
twenty-first
of
April
had
the
option
of
signing
up
for
additional
practice
sessions
which
would
take
place
heavily
supervised
in
Hogsmeade
ron
had
panicked
on
reading
this
notice
he
had
still
not
man-aged
to
Apparate
and
feared
he
would
not
be
ready
for
the
test
hermione
who
had
now
achieved
Apparition
twice
was
a
little
more
confident
but
Harry
who
would
not
be
seventeen
for
an-other
four
months
could
not
take
the
test
whether
ready
or
not
at
least
you
can
Apparate
though
said
Ron
tensely
you'll
have
no
trouble
come
July
i've
only
done
it
once
Harry
reminded
him
he
had
finally
managed
to
disappear
and
rematerialize
inside
his
hoop
during
their
previous
lesson
having
wasted
a
lot
of
time
worrying
aloud
about
Apparition
Ron
was
now
struggling
to
finish
a
viciously
difficult
essay
for
Snape
that
Harry
and
Hermione
had
already
completed
harry
fully
expected
to
receive
low
marks
on
his
because
he
had
disagreed
with
Snape
on
the
best
way
to
tackle
dementors
but
he
did
not
care
Slughorns
memory
was
the
most
important
thing
to
him
now
i'm
telling
you
the
stupid
Prince
isn't
going
to
be
able
to
help
you
with
this
Harry
said
Hermione
more
loudly
there's
only
one
way
to
force
someone
to
do
what
you
want
and
that's
the
Imperius
Curse
which
is
illegal
yeah
I
know
that
thanks
said
Harry
not
looking
up
from
the
book
that's
why
i'm
looking
for
something
different
dumbledorf
says
Veritaserum
won't
do
it
but
there
might
be
something
else
a
potion
or
a
spell
you're
going
about
it
the
wrong
way
said
Hermione
only
you
can
get
the
memory
Dumbledore
says
that
must
mean
you
can
persuade
Slughorn
where
other
people
cant
it's
not
a
question
of
slipping
him
a
potion
anyone
could
do
that
how
do
you
spell
belligerent
said
Ron
shaking
his
quill
very
hard
while
staring
at
his
parchment
it
can't
be
B
U
M
no
it
isn't
said
Hermione
pulling
ron's
essay
toward
her
and
augury
doesn't
begin
O
R
G
either
what
kind
of
quill
are
you
using
it's
one
of
Fred
and
george's
Spell-Check
ones
but
I
think
the
charm
must
be
wearing
off
yes
it
must
said
Hermione
pointing
at
the
title
of
his
essay
because
we
were
asked
how
we'd
deal
with
dementors
not
dug-bogs
and
I
don't
remember
you
changing
your
name
to
Roonil
Wazlib
either
ah
no
said
Ron
staring
horror-struck
at
the
parchment
don't
say
i'll
have
to
write
the
whole
thing
out
again
it's
okay
we
can
fix
it
said
Hermione
pulling
the
essay
toward
her
and
taking
out
her
wand
i
love
you
Hermione
said
Ron
sinking
back
in
his
chair
rub-bing
his
eyes
wearily
hermione
turned
faintly
pink
but
merely
said
don't
let
Lavender
hear
you
saying
that
won't
said
Ron
into
his
hands
or
maybe
I
will
then
she'll
ditch
me
why
don't
you
ditch
her
if
you
want
to
finish
it
asked
Harry
you
haven't
ever
chucked
anyone
have
you
said
Ron
you
and
Cho
just
sort
of
fell
apart
yeah
said
Harry
wish
that
would
happen
with
me
and
Lavender
said
Ron
gloomily
watching
Hermione
silently
tapping
each
of
his
mis-spelled
words
with
the
end
of
her
wand
so
that
they
corrected
themselves
on
the
page
but
the
more
I
hint
I
want
to
finish
it
the
tighter
she
holds
on
it's
like
going
out
with
the
giant
squid
there
said
Hermione
some
twenty
minutes
later
handing
back
ron's
essay
thanks
a
million
said
Ron
can
I
borrow
your
quill
for
the
conclusion
harry
who
had
found
nothing
useful
in
the
Half-Blood
prince's
notes
so
far
looked
around
the
three
of
them
were
now
the
only
ones
left
in
the
common
room
Seamus
having
just
gone
up
to
bed
cursing
Snape
and
his
essay
the
only
sounds
were
the
crackling
of
the
fire
and
Ron
scratching
out
one
last
paragraph
on
dementors
using
hermione's
quill
harry
had
just
closed
the
Half-Blood
prince's
book
yawning
when
crack
hermione
let
out
a
little
shriek
Ron
spilled
ink
all
over
his
freshly
completed
essay
and
Harry
said
Kreacher
the
house-elf
bowed
low
and
addressed
his
own
gnarled
toes
master
said
he
wanted
regular
reports
on
what
the
Malfoy
boy
is
doing
so
Kreacher
has
come
to
give
crack
dobby
appeared
alongside
Kreacher
his
tea-cozy
hat
askew
dobby
has
been
helping
too
Harry
Potter
he
squeaked
cast-ing
Kreacher
a
resentful
look
and
Kreacher
ought
to
tell
Dobby
when
he
is
coming
to
see
Harry
Potter
so
they
can
make
their
re-ports
together
what
is
this
asked
Hermione
still
looking
shocked
by
these
sudden
appearances
what's
going
on
Harry
harry
hesitated
before
answering
because
he
had
not
told
her-mione
about
setting
Kreacher
and
Dobby
to
tail
Malfoy
house-elves
were
always
such
a
touchy
subject
with
her
well
they've
been
following
Malfoy
for
me
he
said
night
and
day
croaked
Kreacher
dobby
has
not
slept
for
a
week
Harry
Potter
said
Dobby
proudly
swaying
where
he
stood
hermione
looked
indignant
you
haven't
slept
Dobby
but
surely
Harry
you
didn't
tell
him
not
to
no
of
course
I
didn't
said
Harry
quickly
dobby
you
can
sleep
all
right
but
has
either
of
you
found
out
anything
he
has-tened
to
ask
before
Hermione
could
intervene
again
master
Malfoy
moves
with
a
nobility
that
befits
his
pure
blood
croaked
Kreacher
at
once
his
features
recall
the
fine
bones
of
my
mistress
and
his
manners
are
those
of
draco
Malfoy
is
a
bad
boy
squeaked
Dobby
angrily
a
bad
boy
who
who
He
shuddered
from
the
tassel
of
his
tea
cozy
to
the
toes
of
his
socks
and
then
ran
at
the
fire
as
though
about
to
dive
into
it
harry
to
whom
this
was
not
entirely
unexpected
caught
him
around
the
middle
and
held
him
fast
for
a
few
seconds
Dobby
struggled
then
went
limp
thank
you
Harry
Potter
he
panted
dobby
still
finds
it
dif-ficult
to
speak
ill
of
his
old
masters
harry
released
him
Dobby
straightened
his
tea
cozy
and
said
defiantly
to
Kreacher
But
Kreacher
should
know
that
Draco
Malfoy
is
not
a
good
master
to
a
house-elf
yeah
we
don't
need
to
hear
about
you
being
in
love
with
Malfoy
Harry
told
Kreacher
let's
fast
forward
to
where
he's
actually
been
going
kreacher
bowed
again
looking
furious
and
then
said
Master
Malfoy
eats
in
the
Great
Hall
he
sleeps
in
a
dormitory
in
the
dun-geons
he
attends
his
classes
in
a
variety
of
dobby
you
tell
me
said
Harry
cutting
across
Kreacher
has
he
been
going
anywhere
he
shouldn't
have
harry
Potter
sir
squeaked
Dobby
his
great
orblike
eyes
shining
in
the
firelight
the
Malfoy
boy
is
breaking
no
rules
that
Dobby
can
discover
but
he
is
still
keen
to
avoid
detection
he
has
been
making
regular
visits
to
the
seventh
floor
with
a
variety
of
other
students
who
keep
watch
for
him
while
he
enters
the
Room
of
Requirement
said
Harry
smacking
himself
hard
on
the
forehead
with
Advanced
Potion-Making
hermione
and
Ron
stared
at
him
that's
where
he's
been
sneaking
off
to
that's
where
he's
doing
whatever
he's
doing
and
I
bet
that's
why
he's
been
disappearing
off
the
map
come
to
think
of
it
i've
never
seen
the
Room
of
Requirement
on
there
maybe
the
Marauders
never
knew
the
room
was
there
said
Ron
i
think
it'll
be
part
of
the
magic
of
the
room
said
Hermione
if
you
need
it
to
be
unplottable
it
will
be
dobby
have
you
managed
to
get
in
to
have
a
look
at
what
malfoy's
doing
said
Harry
eagerly
no
Harry
Potter
that
is
impossible
said
Dobby
no
it's
not
said
Harry
at
once
malfoy
got
into
our
head-quarters
there
last
year
so
i'll
be
able
to
get
in
and
spy
on
him
no
problem
but
I
don't
think
you
will
Harry
said
Hermione
slowly
mal-foy
already
knew
exactly
how
we
were
using
the
room
didn't
he
because
that
stupid
Marietta
had
blabbed
he
needed
the
room
to
become
the
headquarters
of
the
D
a.
so
it
did
but
you
don't
know
what
the
room
becomes
when
Malfoy
goes
in
there
so
you
don't
know
what
to
ask
it
to
transform
into
there'll
be
a
way
around
that
said
Harry
dismissively
you've
done
brilliantly
Dobby
kreachers
done
well
too
said
Hermione
kindly
but
far
from
looking
grateful
Kreacher
averted
his
huge
bloodshot
eyes
and
croaked
at
the
ceiling
The
Mudblood
is
speaking
to
Kreacher
Kreacher
will
pretend
he
cannot
hear
get
out
of
it
Harry
snapped
at
him
and
Kreacher
made
one
last
deep
bow
and
Disapparated
you'd
better
go
and
get
some
sleep
too
Dobby
thank
you
Harry
Potter
sir
squeaked
Dobby
happily
and
he
too
vanished
how
good
is
this
said
Harry
enthusiastically
turning
to
Ron
and
Hermione
the
moment
the
room
was
elf-free
again
we
know
where
malfoy's
going
we've
got
him
cornered
now
yeah
it's
great
said
Ron
glumly
who
was
attempting
to
mop
up
the
sodden
mass
of
ink
chat
had
recently
been
an
almost
com-pleted
essay
hermione
pulled
it
toward
her
and
began
siphoning
the
ink
off
with
her
wand
but
what's
all
this
about
him
going
up
there
with
a
variety
of
students
said
Hermione
how
many
people
are
in
on
it
you
wouldn't
think
he'd
trust
lots
of
them
to
know
what
he's
do-ing
yeah
that
is
weird
said
Harry
frowning
i
heard
him
telling
Crabbe
it
wasn't
crabbe's
business
what
he
was
doing
so
what's
he
telling
all
these
all
these
harry's
voice
tailed
away
he
was
staring
at
the
fire
god
i've
been
stupid
he
said
quietly
its
obvious
isn't
it
there
was
a
great
vat
of
it
down
in
the
dungeon
he
couldve
nicked
some
any
time
during
that
lesson
nicked
what
said
Ron
polyjuice
Potion
he
stole
some
of
the
Polyjuice
Potion
slug-horn
showed
us
in
our
first
Potions
lesson
there
aren't
a
whole
variety
of
students
standing
guard
for
Malfoy
it's
just
Crabbe
and
Goyle
as
usual
yeah
it
all
fits
said
Harry
jumping
up
and
starting
to
pace
in
front
of
the
fire
they're
stupid
enough
to
do
what
they're
told
even
if
he
won't
tell
them
what
he's
up
to
but
he
doesn't
want
them
to
be
seen
lurking
around
outside
the
Room
of
Requirement
so
he's
got
them
taking
Polyjuice
to
make
them
look
like
other
people
those
two
girls
I
saw
him
with
when
he
missed
Quidditch
ha
crabbe
and
Goyle
do
you
mean
to
say
said
Hermione
in
a
hushed
voice
that
that
little
girl
whose
scales
I
repaired
yeah
of
course
said
Harry
loudly
staring
at
her
of
course
malfoy
must've
been
inside
the
room
at
the
time
so
she
what
am
I
talking
about
he
dropped
the
scales
to
tell
Malfoy
not
to
corne
out
because
there
was
someone
there
and
there
was
that
girl
who
dropped
the
toadspawn
too
we've
been
walking
past
him
all
the
time
and
not
realizing
it
he's
got
Crabbe
and
Goyle
transforming
into
girls
guffawed
Ron
blimey
no
wonder
they
don't
look
too
happy
these
days
i'm
surprised
they
don't
tell
him
to
stuff
it
well
they
wouldn't
would
they
if
he's
shown
them
his
Dark
Mark
said
Harry
hmmm
the
Dark
Mark
we
don't
know
exists
said
hermi-one
skeptically
rolling
up
ron's
dried
essay
before
it
could
come
to
any
more
harm
and
handing
it
to
him
we'll
see
said
Harry
confidently
yes
we
will
Hermione
said
getting
to
her
feet
and
stretching
but
Harry
before
you
get
all
excited
I
still
don't
think
you'll
be
able
to
get
into
the
Room
of
Requirement
without
knowing
what's
there
first
and
I
don't
think
you
should
forget
she
heaved
her
bag
onto
her
shoulder
and
gave
him
a
very
serious
look
that
what
you're
supposed
to
be
concentrating
on
is
getting
that
memory
from
Slughorn
good
night
harry
watched
her
go
feeling
slightly
disgruntled
once
the
door
to
the
girls
dormitories
had
closed
behind
her
he
rounded
on
Ron
what
d'you
think
wish
I
could
Disapparate
like
a
house-elf
said
Ron
staring
at
the
spot
where
Dobby
had
vanished
i'd
have
that
Apparition
Test
in
the
bag
harry
did
not
sleep
well
that
night
he
lay
awake
for
what
felt
like
hours
wondering
how
Malfoy
was
using
the
Room
of
Requirement
and
what
he
Harry
would
see
when
he
went
in
there
the
following
day
for
whatever
Hermione
said
Harry
was
sure
that
if
Malfoy
had
been
able
to
see
the
headquarters
of
the
D
a.
he
would
be
able
to
see
malfoy's
what
could
it
be
a
meeting
place
a
hideout
a
ston
room
a
workshop
harrys
mind
worked
feverishly
and
his
dreams
when
he
finally
fell
asleep
were
broken
and
disturbed
by
images
of
Malfoy
who
turned
into
Slughorn
who
turned
into
Snape
harry
was
in
a
state
of
great
anticipation
over
breakfast
the
following
morning
he
had
a
free
period
before
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
and
was
determined
to
spend
it
trying
to
get
into
the
Room
of
Requirement
hermione
was
rather
ostentatiously
showing
no
interest
in
his
whispered
plans
for
forcing
entry
into
the
room
which
irritated
Harry
because
he
thought
she
might
be
a
lot
of
help
if
she
wanted
to
look
he
said
quietly
leaning
forward
and
putting
a
hand
on
the
Daily
Prophet
which
she
had
just
removed
from
a
post
owl
to
stop
her
from
opening
it
and
vanishing
behind
it
i
haven't
for-gotten
about
Slughorn
but
I
haven't
got
a
clue
how
to
get
that
memory
off
him
and
until
I
get
a
brain
wave
why
shouldn't
I
find
out
what
malfoy's
doing
i've
already
told
you
you
need
to
persuade
Slughorn
said
her-mione
it's
not
a
question
of
tricking
him
or
bewitching
him
or
Dumbledore
could
have
done
it
in
a
second
instead
of
messing
around
outside
the
Room
of
Requirement
she
jerked
the
Prophet
out
from
under
Harrys
hand
and
unfolded
it
to
look
at
the
front
page
you
should
go
and
find
Slughorn
and
start
appeal-ing
to
his
better
nature
anyone
we
know
asked
Ron
as
Hermione
scanned
the
headlines
yes
said
Hermione
causing
both
Harry
and
Ron
to
gag
on
their
breakfast
but
it's
all
right
he's
not
dead
its
Mundungus
he's
been
arrested
and
sent
to
Azkaban
something
to
do
with
impersonating
an
Inferius
during
an
attempted
burglary
and
someone
called
Octavius
Pepper
has
vanished
oh
and
how
horrible
a
nine-year-old
boy
has
been
arrested
for
trying
to
kill
his
grandparents
they
think
he
was
under
the
Imperius
Curse
they
finished
their
breakfast
in
silence
hermione
set
off
imme-diately
for
Ancient
Runes
Ron
for
the
common
room
where
he
still
had
to
finish
his
conclusion
on
snape's
dementor
essay
and
Harry
for
the
corridor
on
the
seventh
floor
and
the
stretch
of
wall
opposite
the
tapestry
of
Barnabas
the
Barmy
teaching
trolls
to
do
ballet
harry
slipped
on
his
Invisibility
Cloak
once
he
had
found
an
empty
passage
but
he
need
not
have
bothered
when
he
reached
his
destination
he
found
it
deserted
harry
was
not
sure
whether
his
chances
of
getting
inside
the
room
were
better
with
Malfoy
in-side
it
or
out
but
at
least
his
first
attempt
was
not
going
to
be
complicated
by
the
presence
of
Crabbe
or
Goyle
pretending
to
be
an
eleven-year-old
girl
he
closed
his
eyes
as
he
approached
the
place
where
the
Room
of
requirement's
door
was
concealed
he
knew
what
he
had
to
do
he
had
become
most
accomplished
at
it
last
year
concentrating
with
all
his
might
he
thought
I
need
to
see
what
malfoy's
doing
in
here
i
need
to
see
what
malfoy's
doing
in
here
i
need
to
see
what
malfoy's
doing
in
here
three
times
he
walked
past
the
door
then
his
heart
pounding
with
excitement
he
opened
his
eyes
and
faced
it
but
he
was
still
looking
at
a
stretch
of
mundanely
blank
wall
he
moved
forward
and
gave
it
an
experimental
push
the
stone
remained
solid
and
unyielding
okay
said
Harry
aloud
okay
i
thought
the
wrong
thing
he
pondered
for
a
moment
then
set
off
again
eyes
closed
con-centrating
as
hard
as
he
could
i
need
to
see
the
place
where
Malfoy
keeps
coming
secretly
i
need
to
see
the
place
where
Malfoy
keeps
coming
secretly
after
three
walks
past
he
opened
his
eyes
expectantly
there
was
no
door
oh
come
off
it
he
told
the
wall
irritably
that
was
a
clear
instruction
fine
he
thought
hard
for
several
minutes
before
striding
off
once
more
i
need
you
to
become
the
place
you
become
for
Draco
Malfoy
he
did
not
immediately
open
his
eyes
when
he
had
finished
his
patrolling
he
was
listening
hard
as
though
he
might
hear
the
door
pop
into
existence
he
heard
nothing
however
except
the
distant
twittering
of
birds
outside
he
opened
his
eyes
there
was
still
no
door
harry
swore
someone
screamed
he
looked
around
to
see
a
gaggle
of
first
years
running
back
around
the
corner
apparently
un-der
the
impression
that
they
had
just
encountered
a
particularly
foulmouthed
ghost
harry
tried
every
variation
of
I
need
to
see
what
Draco
Malfoy
is
doing
inside
you
that
he
could
think
of
for
a
whole
hour
at
the
end
of
which
he
was
forced
to
concede
that
Hermione
might
have
had
a
point
The
room
simply
did
not
want
to
open
for
him
frus-trated
and
annoyed
he
set
off
for
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
pulling
off
his
Invisibility
Cloak
and
stuffing
it
into
his
bag
as
he
went
late
again
Potter
said
Snape
coldly
as
Harry
hurried
into
the
candlelit
classroom
ten
points
from
Gryfrindor
harry
scowled
at
Snape
as
he
flung
himself
into
the
seat
beside
Ron
half
the
class
were
still
on
their
feet
taking
out
books
and
orga-nizing
their
things
he
could
not
be
much
later
than
any
of
them
before
we
start
I
want
your
dementor
essays
said
Snape
wav-ing
his
wand
carelessly
so
that
twenty-five
scrolls
of
parchment
soared
into
the
air
and
landed
in
a
neat
pile
on
his
desk
and
I
hope
for
your
sakes
they
are
better
than
the
tripe
I
had
to
endure
on
resisting
the
Imperius
Curse
now
if
you
will
all
open
your
books
to
page
what
is
it
mr.
Finnigan
sir
said
Seamus
i've
been
wondering
how
do
you
tell
the
difference
between
an
Inferius
and
a
ghost
because
there
was
something
in
the
paper
about
an
Inferius
no
there
wasn't
said
Snape
in
a
bored
voice
but
sir
I
heard
people
talking
if
you
had
actually
read
the
article
in
question
mr.
Finnigan
you
would
have
known
that
the
so-called
Inferius
was
nothing
but
a
smelly
sneak
thief
by
the
name
of
Mundungus
Fletcher
i
thought
Snape
and
Mundungus
were
on
the
same
side
mut-tered
Harry
to
Ron
and
Hermione
shouldn't
he
be
upset
mun-dungus
has
been
arrest
but
Potter
seems
to
have
a
lot
to
say
on
the
subject
said
Snape
pointing
suddenly
at
the
back
of
the
room
his
black
eyes
fixed
on
Harry
let
us
ask
Potter
how
we
would
tell
the
difference
between
an
Inferius
and
a
ghost
the
whole
class
looked
around
at
Harry
who
hastily
tried
to
recall
what
Dumbledore
had
told
him
the
night
that
they
had
gone
to
visit
Slughorn
er
well
ghosts
are
transparent
he
said
oh
very
good
interrupted
Snape
his
lip
curling
yes
it
in
easy
to
see
that
nearly
six
years
of
magical
education
have
not
been
wasted
on
you
Potter
ghosts
are
transparent
pansy
Parkinson
let
out
a
high-pitched
giggle
several
other
peo-ple
were
smirking
harry
took
a
deep
breath
and
continued
calmly
though
his
insides
were
boiling
Yeah
ghosts
are
transparent
but
Inferi
are
dead
bodies
aren't
they
so
they'd
be
solid
a
five-year-old
could
have
told
us
as
much
sneered
Snape
the
Inferius
is
a
corpse
that
has
been
reanimated
by
a
Dark
wiz-ard's
spells
it
is
not
alive
it
is
merely
used
like
a
puppet
to
do
the
wizard's
bidding
a
ghost
as
I
trust
that
you
are
all
aware
by
now
is
the
imprint
of
a
departed
soul
left
upon
the
earth
and
of
course
as
Potter
so
wisely
tells
us
transparent
well
what
Harry
said
is
the
most
useful
if
we're
trying
to
tell
them
apart
said
Ron
when
we
come
face-to-face
with
one
down
a
dark
alley
we're
going
to
be
having
a
look
to
see
if
its
solid
aren't
we
we're
not
going
to
be
asking
Excuse
me
are
you
the
imprint
of
a
departed
soul
there
was
a
ripple
of
laughter
instantly
quelled
by
the
look
Snape
gave
the
class
another
ten
points
from
Gryffindor
said
Snape
i
would
ex-pect
nothing
more
sophisticated
from
you
Ronald
Weasley
the
boy
so
solid
he
cannot
Apparate
half
an
inch
across
a
room
no
whispered
Hermione
grabbing
Harrys
arm
as
he
opened
his
mouth
furiously
there's
no
point
you'll
just
end
up
in
deten-tion
again
leave
it
now
open
your
books
to
page
two
hundred
and
thirteen
said
Snape
smirking
a
little
and
read
the
first
two
paragraphs
on
the
Cruciatus
Curse
ron
was
very
subdued
all
through
the
class
when
the
bell
sounded
at
the
end
of
the
lesson
Lavender
caught
up
with
Ron
and
Harry
Hermione
mysteriously
melted
out
of
sight
as
she
ap-proached
and
abused
Snape
hotly
for
his
jibe
about
ron's
appari-tion
but
this
seemed
to
merely
irritate
Ron
and
he
shook
her
off
by
making
a
detour
into
the
boys
bathroom
with
Harry
snape's
right
though
isn't
he
said
Ron
after
staring
into
a
cracked
mirror
for
a
minute
or
two
i
dunno
whether
it's
worth
me
taking
the
test
i
just
can't
get
the
hang
of
Apparition
you
might
as
well
do
the
extra
practice
sessions
in
Hogsmeade
and
see
where
they
get
you
said
Harry
reasonably
it'll
be
more
interesting
than
trying
to
get
into
a
stupid
hoop
anyway
then
if
you're
still
not
you
know
as
good
as
you'd
like
to
be
you
can
postpone
the
test
do
it
with
me
over
the
summer
Myrtle
this
is
the
boys
bathroom
the
ghost
of
a
girl
had
risen
out
of
the
toilet
in
a
cubicle
behind
them
and
was
now
floating
in
midair
staring
at
them
through
thick
white
round
glasses
oh
she
said
glumly
it's
you
two
who
were
you
expecting
said
Ron
looking
at
her
in
the
mirror
nobody
said
Myrtle
picking
moodily
at
a
spot
on
her
chin
he
said
he'd
come
back
and
see
me
but
then
you
said
you'd
pop
in
and
visit
me
too
she
gave
Harry
a
reproachful
look
and
I
haven't
seen
you
for
months
and
months
i've
learned
not
to
ex-pect
too
much
from
boys
i
thought
you
lived
in
that
girls
bathroom
said
Harry
who
had
been
careful
to
give
the
place
a
wide
berth
for
some
years
now
i
do
she
said
with
a
sulky
little
shrug
but
that
doesn't
mean
I
cant
visit
other
places
i
came
and
saw
you
in
your
bath
once
remember
vividly
said
Harry
but
I
thought
he
liked
me
she
said
plaintively
maybe
if
you
two
left
he'd
come
back
again
we
had
lots
in
common
i'm
sure
he
felt
it
and
she
looked
hopefully
toward
the
door
when
you
say
you
had
lots
in
common
said
Ron
sounding
rather
amused
now
d'you
mean
he
lives
in
an
s-bend
too
no
said
Myrtle
defiantly
her
voice
echoing
loudly
around
the
old
tiled
bathroom
i
mean
he's
sensitive
people
bully
him
too
and
he
feels
lonely
and
hasn't
got
anybody
to
talk
to
and
he's
not
afraid
to
show
his
feelings
and
cry
there's
been
a
boy
in
here
crying
said
Harry
curiously
a
young
boy
never
you
mind
said
Myrtle
her
small
leaky
eyes
fixed
on
Ron
who
was
now
definitely
grinning
i
promised
I
wouldn't
tell
anyone
and
i'll
take
his
secret
to
the
not
the
grave
surely
said
Ron
with
a
snort
the
sewers
maybe
myrtle
gave
a
howl
of
rage
and
dived
back
into
the
toilet
caus-ing
water
to
slop
over
the
sides
and
onto
the
floor
goading
Myrtle
seemed
to
have
put
fresh
heart
into
Ron
you're
right
he
said
swinging
his
schoolbag
back
over
his
shoulder
i'll
do
the
practice
sessions
in
Hogsmeade
before
I
de-cide
about
taking
the
test
and
so
the
following
weekend
Ron
joined
Hermione
and
the
rest
of
the
sixth
years
who
would
turn
seventeen
in
time
to
take
the
test
in
a
fortnight
harry
felt
rather
jealous
watching
them
all
get
ready
to
go
into
the
village
he
missed
making
trips
there
and
it
was
a
particularly
fine
spring
day
one
of
the
first
clear
skies
they
had
seen
in
a
long
time
however
he
had
decided
to
use
the
time
to
attempt
another
assault
on
the
Room
of
Requirement
you'd
do
better
said
Hermione
when
he
confided
this
plan
to
Ron
and
her
in
the
entrance
hall
to
go
straight
to
slughorn's
of-fice
and
try
and
get
that
memory
from
him
i've
been
trying
said
Harry
crossly
which
was
perfectly
true
he
had
lagged
behind
after
every
Potions
lesson
that
week
in
an
at-tempt
to
corner
Slughorn
but
the
Potions
master
always
left
the
dungeon
so
fast
that
Harry
had
not
been
able
to
catch
him
twice
Harry
had
gone
to
his
office
and
knocked
but
received
no
reply
though
on
the
second
occasion
he
was
sure
he
had
heard
the
quickly
stifled
sounds
of
an
old
gramophone
he
doesn't
want
to
talk
to
me
Hermione
he
can
tell
i've
been
trying
to
get
him
on
his
own
again
and
he's
not
going
to
let
it
happen
well
you've
just
got
to
keep
at
it
haven't
you
the
short
queue
of
people
waiting
to
file
past
Filch
who
was
do-ing
his
usual
prodding
act
with
the
Secrecy
Sensor
moved
forward
a
few
steps
and
Harry
did
not
answer
in
case
he
was
overheard
by
the
caretaker
he
wished
ron
and
Hermione
both
luck
then
turned
and
climbed
the
marble
staircase
again
determined
whatever
her-mione
said
to
devote
an
hour
or
two
to
the
Room
of
Requirement
once
out
of
sight
of
the
entrance
hall
Harry
pulled
the
ma-rauder's
Map
and
his
Invisibility
Cloak
from
his
bag
having
concealed
himself
he
tapped
the
map
murmured
I
solemnly
swear
that
I
am
up
to
no
good
and
scanned
it
carefully
as
it
was
Sunday
morning
nearly
all
the
students
were
inside
their
various
common
rooms
the
Gryffindors
in
one
tower
the
Ravenclaws
in
another
the
Slytherins
in
the
dungeons
and
the
Hufflepuffs
in
the
basement
near
the
kitchens
here
and
there
a
stray
person
meandered
around
the
library
or
up
a
corridor
there
were
a
few
people
out
in
the
grounds
and
there
alone
in
the
seventh-floor
corridor
was
Gregory
Goyle
there
was
no
sign
of
the
Room
of
Requirement
but
Harry
was
not
worried
about
that
if
Goyle
was
standing
guard
outside
it
the
room
was
open
whether
the
map
was
aware
of
it
or
not
he
therefore
sprinted
up
the
stairs
slowing
down
only
when
he
reached
the
corner
into
the
corridor
when
he
began
to
creep
very
slowly
toward
the
very
same
little
girl
clutching
her
heavy
brass
scales
that
Hermione
had
so
kindly
helped
a
fortnight
before
he
waited
until
he
was
right
be-hind
her
before
bending
very
low
and
whispering
Hello
you're
very
pretty
aren't
you
goyle
gave
a
high-pitched
scream
of
terror
threw
the
scales
up
into
the
air
and
sprinted
away
vanishing
from
sight
long
before
the
sound
of
the
scales
smashing
had
stopped
echoing
around
the
corri-dor
laughing
Harry
turned
to
contemplate
the
blank
wall
behind
which
he
was
sure
Draco
Malfoy
was
now
standing
frozen
aware
that
someone
unwelcome
was
out
there
but
not
daring
to
make
an
appearance
it
gave
Harry
a
most
agreeable
feeling
of
power
as
he
tried
to
remember
what
form
of
words
he
had
not
yet
tried
yet
this
hopeful
mood
did
not
last
long
half
an
hour
later
hav-ing
tried
many
more
variations
of
his
request
to
see
what
Malfoy
was
up
to
the
wall
was
just
as
doorless
as
ever
harry
felt
frustrated
beyond
belief-Malfoy
might
be
just
feet
away
from
him
and
there
was
still
not
the
tiniest
shred
of
evidence
as
to
what
he
was
doing
in
there
losing
his
patience
completely
Harry
ran
at
the
wall
and
kicked
it
ouch
he
thought
he
might
have
broken
his
toe
as
he
clutched
it
and
hopped
on
one
foot
the
Invisibility
Cloak
slipped
off
him
harry
he
spun
around
one-legged
and
toppled
over
there
to
his
utter
astonishment
was
Tonks
walking
toward
him
as
though
she
frequently
strolled
up
this
corridor
whatre
you
doing
here
he
said
scrambling
to
his
feet
again
why
did
she
always
have
to
find
him
lying
on
the
floor
i
came
to
see
Dumbledore
said
Tonks
harry
thought
she
looked
terrible
thinner
than
usual
her
mouse-colored
hair
lank
his
office
isn't
here
said
Harry
it's
round
the
other
side
of
the
castle
behind
the
gargoyle
i
know
said
Tonks
he's
not
there
apparently
he's
gone
away
again
has
he
said
Harry
putting
his
bruised
foot
gingerly
back
on
the
floor
hey
you
don't
know
where
he
goes
I
suppose
no
said
Tonks
what
did
you
want
to
see
him
about
nothing
in
particular
said
Tonks
picking
apparently
uncon-sciously
at
the
sleeve
of
her
robe
i
just
thought
he
might
know
what's
going
on
i've
heard
rumors
people
getting
hurt
yeah
I
know
it's
all
been
in
the
papers
said
Harry
that
lit-tle
kid
trying
to
kill
his
the
prophet's
often
behind
the
times
said
Tonks
who
didn't
seem
to
be
listening
to
him
you
haven't
had
any
letters
from
any-one
in
the
Order
recently
no
one
from
the
Order
writes
to
me
anymore
said
Harry
not
since
Sirius
He
saw
that
her
eyes
had
filled
with
tears
i'm
sorry
he
muttered
awkwardly
i
mean
i
miss
him
as
well
what
said
Tonks
blankly
as
though
she
had
not
heard
him
well
i'll
see
you
around
Harry
and
she
turned
abruptly
and
walked
back
down
the
corridor
leaving
Harry
to
stare
after
her
after
a
minute
or
so
he
pulled
the
Invisibility
Cloak
on
again
and
resumed
his
efforts
to
get
into
the
Room
of
Requirement
but
his
heart
was
not
in
it
finally
a
hollow
feeling
in
his
stomach
and
the
knowledge
that
Ron
and
Hermione
would
soon
be
back
for
lunch
made
him
abandon
the
attempt
and
leave
the
corridor
to
Malfoy
who
hopefully
would
be
too
afraid
to
leave
for
some
hours
to
come
he
found
Ron
and
Hermione
in
the
Great
Hall
already
halfway
through
an
early
lunch
i
did
it
well
kind
of
ron
told
Harry
enthusiastically
when
he
caught
sight
of
him
i
was
supposed
to
be
Apparating
to
out-side
Madam
Puddifoots
Tea
Shop
and
I
overshot
it
a
bit
ended
up
near
Scrivenshafts
but
at
least
I
moved
good
one
said
Harry
how'd
you
do
Hermione
oh
she
was
perfect
obviously
said
Ron
before
Hermione
could
answer
perfect
deliberation
divination
and
desperation
or
whatever
the
hell
it
is
we
all
went
for
a
quick
drink
in
the
Three
Broomsticks
after
and
you
should've
heard
Twycross
going
on
about
her
i'll
be
surprised
if
he
doesn't
pop
the
question
soon
and
what
about
you
asked
Hermione
ignoring
Ron
have
you
been
up
at
the
Room
of
Requirement
all
this
time
yep
said
Harry
and
guess
who
I
ran
into
up
there
tonks
tonks
repeated
Ron
and
Hermione
together
looking
surprised
yeah
she
said
she'd
come
to
visit
Dumbledore
if
you
ask
me
said
Ron
once
Harry
had
finished
describing
his
conversation
with
Tonks
she's
cracking
up
a
bit
losing
her
nerve
after
what
happened
at
the
Ministry
its
a
bit
odd
said
Hermione
who
for
some
reason
looked
very
concerned
she's
supposed
to
be
guarding
the
school
why
she
suddenly
abandoning
her
post
to
come
and
see
Dumbledore
when
he's
not
even
here
i
had
a
thought
said
Harry
tentatively
he
felt
strange
about
voicing
it
this
was
much
more
Hermiones
territory
than
his
you
don't
think
she
can
have
been
you
know
in
love
with
Sirius
hermione
stared
at
him
what
on
earth
makes
you
say
that
i
dunno
said
Harry
shrugging
but
she
was
nearly
crying
when
I
mentioned
his
name
and
her
Patronus
is
a
big
four-legged
thing
now
i
wondered
whether
it
hadn't
become
you
know
him
it's
a
thought
said
Hermione
slowly
but
I
still
don't
know
why
she'd
be
bursting
into
the
castle
to
see
Dumbledore
if
that's
re-ally
why
she
was
here
goes
back
to
what
I
said
doesn't
it
said
Ron
who
was
now
shoveling
mashed
potato
into
his
mouth
she's
gone
a
bit
funny
lost
her
nerve
women
he
said
wisely
to
Harry
they're
easily
upset
and
yet
said
Hermione
coming
out
of
her
reverie
I
doubt
you'd
find
a
woman
who
sulked
for
half
an
hour
because
Madam
Rosmerta
didn't
laugh
at
their
joke
about
the
hag
the
Healer
and
the
Mimbulus
mimbletonia
ron
scowled
chapter
After
the
Burial
patches
of
bright
blue
sky
were
beginning
to
appear
over
the
castle
turrets
but
these
signs
of
approaching
summer
did
not
lift
harry's
mood
he
had
been
thwarted
both
in
his
attempts
to
find
out
what
Malfoy
was
doing
and
in
his
efforts
to
start
a
conversation
with
Slughorn
that
might
lead
somehow
to
Slughorn
hand-ing
over
the
memory
he
had
apparently
suppressed
for
decades
for
the
last
time
just
forget
about
Malfoy
Hermione
told
Harry
firmly
they
were
sitting
with
Ron
in
a
sunny
corner
of
the
courtyard
after
lunch
hermione
and
Ron
were
both
clutching
a
Ministry
of
Magic
leaflet
Common
Apparition
Mistakes
and
How
to
Avoid
Them
for
they
were
taking
their
tests
that
very
afternoon
but
by
and
large
the
leaflets
had
not
proved
soothing
to
the
nerves
ron
gave
a
start
and
tried
to
hide
behind
Hermione
as
a
girl
came
around
the
corner
it
isn't
Lavender
said
Hermione
wearily
oh
good
said
Ron
relaxing
harry
Potter
said
the
girl
i
was
asked
to
give
you
this
thanks
harry's
heart
sank
as
he
took
the
small
scroll
of
parchment
once
the
girl
was
out
of
earshot
he
said
Dumbledore
said
we
wouldn't
be
having
any
more
lessons
until
I
got
the
memory
maybe
he
wants
to
check
on
how
you're
doing
suggested
Hermione
as
Harry
unrolled
the
parchment
but
rather
than
finding
dumbledore's
long
narrow
slanted
writing
he
saw
an
untidy
sprawl
very
difficult
to
read
due
to
the
presence
of
large
blotches
on
the
parchment
where
the
ink
had
run
dear
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
aragog
died
last
night
harry
and
Ron
you
met
him
and
you
know
how
special
he
was
hermione
I
know
you'd
have
liked
him
it
would
mean
a
lot
to
me
if
you'd
nip
down
for
the
burial
later
this
evening
i'm
planning
on
doing
it
round
dusk
that
was
his
favorite
time
of
day
i
know
you're
not
supposed
to
be
out
that
late
but
you
can
use
the
cloak
wouldn't
ask
but
I
can't
face
it
alone
hagrid
look
at
this
said
Harry
handing
the
note
to
Hermione
oh
for
heaven's
sake
she
said
scanning
it
quickly
and
passing
it
to
Ron
who
read
it
through
looking
increasingly
incredulous
he's
mental
he
said
furiously
that
thing
told
its
mates
to
eat
Harry
and
me
told
them
to
help
themselves
and
now
Hagrid
ex-pects
us
to
go
down
there
and
cry
over
its
horrible
hairy
body
its
not
just
that
said
Hermione
he's
asking
us
to
leave
the
castle
at
night
and
he
knows
security's
a
million
times
tighter
and
how
much
trouble
we'd
be
in
if
we
were
caught
we've
been
down
to
see
him
by
night
before
said
Harry
yes
but
for
something
like
this
said
Hermione
we've
risked
a
lot
to
help
Hagrid
out
but
after
all
aragog's
dead
if
it
were
a
question
of
saving
him
i'd
want
to
go
even
less
said
Ron
firmly
you
didn't
meet
him
Hermione
believe
me
being
dead
will
have
improved
him
a
lot
harry
took
the
note
back
and
stared
down
at
all
the
inky
blotches
all
over
it
tears
had
clearly
fallen
thick
and
fast
upon
the
parchment
harry
you
can't
be
thinking
of
going
said
Hermione
it's
such
a
pointless
thing
to
get
detention
for
harry
sighed
yeah
I
know
he
said
i
s'pose
hagrid'll
have
to
bury
Aragog
without
us
yes
he
will
said
Hermione
looking
relieved
look
Potions
will
be
almost
empty
this
afternoon
with
us
all
off
doing
our
tests
try
and
soften
Slughorn
up
a
bit
then
fifty-seventh
time
lucky
you
think
said
Harry
bitterly
lucky
said
Ron
suddenly
harry
that's
it
get
lucky
what
d'you
mean
use
your
lucky
potion
ron
that's
that's
it
said
Hermione
sounding
stunned
of
course
why
didn't
I
think
of
it
harry
stared
at
them
both
felix
Felicis
he
said
i
dunno
i
was
sort
of
saving
it
what
for
demanded
Ron
incredulously
what
on
earth
is
more
important
than
this
memory
Harry
asked
Hermione
harry
did
not
answer
the
thought
of
that
little
golden
bottle
had
hovered
on
the
edges
of
his
imagination
for
some
time
vague
and
unformulated
plans
that
involved
Ginny
splitting
up
with
Dean
and
Ron
somehow
being
happy
to
see
her
with
a
new
boyfriend
had
been
fermenting
in
the
depths
of
his
brain
unacknowledged
except
during
dreams
or
the
twilight
time
between
sleeping
and
waking
harry
are
you
still
with
us
asked
Hermione
wha
yeah
of
course
he
said
pulling
himself
together
well
okay
if
I
can't
get
Slughorn
to
talk
this
afternoon
i'll
take
some
Felix
and
have
another
go
this
evening
that's
decided
then
said
Hermione
briskly
getting
to
her
feet
and
performing
a
graceful
pirouette
destination
determina-tion
deliberation
she
murmured
oh
stop
that
Ron
begged
her
I
feel
sick
enough
as
it
is
quick
hide
me
it
isn't
Lavender
said
Hermione
impatiently
as
another
cou-ple
of
girls
appeared
in
the
courtyard
and
Ron
dived
behind
her
cool
said
Ron
peering
over
Hermiones
shoulder
to
check
blimey
they
don't
look
happy
do
they
they're
the
Montgomery
sisters
and
of
course
they
don't
look
happy
didn't
you
hear
what
happened
to
their
little
brother
said
Hermione
i'm
losing
track
of
what's
happening
to
everyone's
relatives
to
be
honest
said
Ron
well
their
brother
was
attacked
by
a
werewolf
the
rumor
is
that
their
mother
refused
to
help
the
Death
Eaters
anyway
the
boy
was
only
five
and
he
died
in
st.
Mungos
they
couldn't
save
him
he
died
repeated
Harry
shocked
but
surely
werewolves
don't
kill
they
just
turn
you
into
one
of
them
they
sometimes
kill
said
Ron
who
looked
unusually
grave
now
i've
heard
of
it
happening
when
the
werewolf
gets
carried
away
what
was
the
werewolf's
name
said
Harry
quickly
well
the
rumor
is
that
it
was
that
Fenrir
Greyback
said
Hermione
i
knew
it
the
maniac
who
likes
attacking
kids
the
one
Lupin
told
me
about
said
Harry
angrily
hermione
looked
at
him
bleakly
harry
you've
got
to
get
that
memory
she
said
it's
all
about
stopping
Voldemort
isn't
it
these
dreadful
things
that
are
hap-pening
are
all
down
to
him
the
bell
rang
overhead
in
the
castle
and
both
Hermione
and
Ron
jumped
to
their
feet
looking
terrified
you'll
do
fine
Harry
told
them
both
as
they
headed
toward
the
entrance
hall
to
meet
the
rest
of
the
people
taking
their
ap-parition
Test
good
luck
and
you
too
said
Hermione
with
a
significant
look
as
Harry
headed
off
to
the
dungeons
there
were
only
three
of
them
in
Potions
that
afternoon
Harry
Ernie
and
Draco
Malfoy
all
too
young
to
Apparate
just
yet
said
Slughorh
genially
Not
turned
seventeen
yet
they
shook
their
heads
ah
well
said
Slughorn
cheerily
as
we're
so
few
we'll
do
something
for
fun
i
want
you
all
to
brew
me
up
something
amusing
that
sounds
good
sir
said
Ernie
sycophantically
rubbing
his
hands
together
malfoy
on
the
other
hand
did
not
crack
a
smile
what
do
you
mean
something
amusing
he
said
irritably
oh
surprise
me
said
Slughorn
airily
malfoy
opened
his
copy
of
Advanced
Potion-Making
with
a
sulky
expression
it
could
not
have
been
plainer
that
he
thought
this
les-son
was
a
waste
of
time
undoubtedly
Harry
thought
watching
him
over
the
top
of
his
own
book
Malfoy
was
begrudging
the
time
he
could
otherwise
be
spending
in
the
Room
of
Requirement
was
it
his
imagination
or
did
Malfoy
like
Tonks
look
thinner
certainly
he
looked
paler
his
skin
still
had
that
grayish
tinge
probably
because
he
so
rarely
saw
daylight
these
days
but
there
was
no
air
of
smugness
excitement
or
superiority
none
of
the
swagger
that
he
had
had
on
the
hogwarts
Express
when
he
had
boasted
openly
of
the
mission
he
had
been
given
by
Voldemort
there
could
be
only
one
conclusion
in
harry's
opinion
The
mission
whatever
it
was
was
going
badly
cheered
by
this
thought
Harry
skimmed
through
his
copy
of
Advanced
Potion-Making
and
found
a
heavily
corrected
Half-Blood
prince's
version
of
An
Elixir
to
Induce
Euphoria
which
seemed
not
only
to
meet
slughorn's
instructions
but
which
might
harry's
heart
leapt
as
the
thought
struck
him
put
Slughorn
into
such
a
good
mood
that
he
would
be
prepared
to
hand
over
that
memory
if
Harry
could
persuade
him
to
taste
some
well
now
this
looks
absolutely
wonderful
said
Slughorn
an
hour
and
a
half
later
clapping
his
hands
together
as
he
stared
down
into
the
sunshine
yellow
contents
of
harry's
cauldron
euphoria
I
take
it
and
what's
that
I
smell
mmmm
you've
added
just
a
sprig
of
peppermint
haven't
you
unorthodox
but
what
a
stroke
of
inspiration
Harry
of
course
that
would
tend
to
counterbalance
the
occa-sional
side
effects
of
excessive
singing
and
nose-tweaking
i
really
don't
know
where
you
get
these
brain
waves
my
boy
unless
harry
pushed
the
Half-Blood
prince's
book
deeper
into
his
bag
with
his
foot
it's
just
your
mother's
genes
coming
out
in
you
oh
yeah
maybe
said
Harry
relieved
ernie
was
looking
rather
grumpy
determined
to
outshine
Harry
for
once
he
had
most
rashly
invented
his
own
potion
which
had
curdled
and
formed
a
kind
of
purple
dumpling
at
the
bottom
of
his
cauldron
malfoy
was
already
packing
up
sour-faced
Slughorn
had
pronounced
his
Hiccuping
Solution
merely
passable
the
bell
rang
and
both
Ernie
and
Malfoy
left
at
once
sir
Harry
began
but
Slughorn
immediately
glanced
over
his
shoulder
when
he
saw
that
the
room
was
empty
but
for
himself
and
Harry
he
hurried
away
as
fast
as
he
could
professor
Professor
don't
you
want
to
taste
my
po
called
Harry
desperately
but
Slughorn
had
gone
disappointed
Harry
emptied
the
caul-dron
packed
up
his
things
left
the
dungeon
and
walked
slowly
back
upstairs
to
the
common
room
ron
and
Hermione
returned
in
the
late
afternoon
harry
cried
Hermione
as
she
climbed
through
the
portrait
hole
harry
I
passed
well
done
he
said
and
Ron
he
he
just
failed
whispered
Hermione
as
Ron
came
slouching
into
the
room
looking
most
morose
it
was
really
unlucky
a
tiny
thing
the
examiner
just
spotted
that
he'd
left
half
an
eyebrow
behind
how
did
it
go
with
Slughorn
no
joy
said
Harry
as
Ron
joined
them
bad
luck
mate
but
you'll
pass
next
time
we
can
take
it
together
yeah
I
s'pose
said
Ron
grumpily
but
half
an
eyebrow
like
that
matters
i
know
said
Hermione
soothingly
it
does
seem
really
harsh
they
spent
most
of
their
dinner
roundly
abusing
the
Apparition
examiner
and
Ron
looked
fractionally
more
cheerful
by
the
time
they
set
off
back
to
the
common
room
now
discussing
the
continuing
problem
of
Slughorn
and
the
memory
so
Harry
you
going
to
use
the
Felix
Felicis
or
what
ron
demanded
yeah
I
s'pose
i'd
better
said
Harry
i
don't
reckon
i'll
need
all
of
it
not
twenty-four
hours
worth
it
can't
take
all
night
i'll
just
take
a
mouthful
two
or
three
hours
should
do
it
it's
a
great
feeling
when
you
take
it
said
Ron
reminiscently
like
you
can't
do
anything
wrong
what
are
you
talking
about
said
Hermione
laughing
you've
never
taken
any
yeah
but
I
thought
I
had
didn't
I
said
Ron
as
though
ex-plaining
the
obvious
same
difference
really
as
they
had
only
just
seen
Slughorn
enter
the
Great
Hall
and
knew
that
he
liked
to
take
time
over
meals
they
lingered
for
a
while
in
the
common
room
the
plan
being
that
Harry
should
go
to
Slughorn
s
office
once
the
teacher
had
had
time
to
get
back
there
when
the
sun
had
sunk
to
the
level
of
the
treetops
in
the
forbid-den
Forest
they
decided
the
moment
had
come
and
after
check-ing
carefully
that
Neville
Dean
and
Seamus
were
all
in
the
common
room
sneaked
up
to
the
boys
dormitory
harry
took
out
the
rolled-up
socks
at
the
bottom
of
his
trunk
and
extracted
the
tiny
gleaming
bottle
well
here
goes
said
Harry
and
he
raised
the
little
bottle
and
look
a
carefully
measured
gulp
what
does
it
feel
like
whispered
Hermione
harry
did
not
answer
for
a
moment
then
slowly
but
surely
an
exhilarating
sense
of
infinite
opportunity
stole
through
him
he
felt
as
though
he
could
have
done
anything
anything
at
all
and
getting
the
memory
from
Slughorn
seemed
suddenly
not
only
pos-sible
but
positively
easy
he
got
to
his
feet
smiling
brimming
with
confidence
excellent
he
said
really
excellent
right
i'm
going
down
to
hagrid's
what
said
Ron
and
Hermione
together
looking
aghast
no
Harry
you've
got
to
go
and
see
Slughorn
remember
said
Hermione
no
said
Harry
confidently
i'm
going
to
hagrid's
i've
got
a
good
feeling
about
going
to
hagrid's
you've
got
a
good
feeling
about
burying
a
giant
spider
asked
Ron
looking
stunned
yeah
said
Harry
pulling
his
Invisibility
Cloak
out
of
his
bag
i
feel
like
it's
the
place
to
be
tonight
you
know
what
I
mean
no
said
Ron
and
Hermione
together
both
looking
positively
alarmed
now
this
is
Felix
Felicis
I
suppose
said
Hermione
anxiously
holding
up
the
bottle
to
the
light
you
haven't
got
another
little
bottle
full
of
I
don't
know
essence
of
Insanity
suggested
Ron
as
Harry
swung
his
cloak
over
his
shoulders
harry
laughed
and
Ron
and
Hermione
looked
even
more
alarmed
trust
me
he
said
i
know
what
i'm
doing
or
at
least
he
strolled
confidently
to
the
door
Felix
does
he
pulled
the
Invisibility
Cloak
over
his
head
and
set
off
down
the
stairs
Ron
and
Hermione
hurrying
along
behind
him
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
Harry
slid
through
the
open
door
what
were
you
doing
up
there
with
her
shrieked
Lavender
Brown
staring
right
through
Harry
at
Ron
and
Hermione
emerging
together
from
the
boys
dormitories
harry
heard
Ron
splutter-ing
behind
him
as
he
darted
across
the
room
away
from
them
getting
through
the
portrait
hole
was
simple
as
he
approached
it
Ginny
and
Dean
came
through
it
and
Harry
was
able
to
slip
between
them
as
he
did
so
he
brushed
accidentally
against
Ginny
don't
push
me
please
Dean
she
said
sounding
annoyed
you're
always
doing
that
I
can
get
through
perfectly
well
on
my
own
the
portrait
swung
closed
behind
Harry
but
not
before
he
had
heard
Dean
make
an
angry
retort
his
feeling
of
elation
in-creasing
Harry
strode
off
through
the
castle
he
did
not
have
to
creep
along
for
he
met
nobody
on
his
way
but
this
did
not
surprise
him
in
the
slightest
this
evening
he
was
the
luckiest
person
at
Hogwarts
why
he
knew
that
going
to
hagrid's
was
the
right
thing
to
do
he
had
no
idea
it
was
as
though
the
potion
was
illuminating
a
few
steps
of
the
path
at
a
time
he
could
not
see
the
final
destination
he
could
not
see
where
Slughorn
came
in
but
he
knew
that
he
was
going
the
right
way
to
get
that
memory
when
he
reached
the
en-trance
hall
he
saw
that
Filch
had
forgotten
to
lock
the
front
door
beaming
Harry
threw
it
open
and
breathed
in
the
smell
of
clean
air
and
grass
for
a
moment
before
walking
down
the
steps
into
the
dusk
it
was
when
he
reached
the
bottom
step
that
it
occurred
to
him
how
very
pleasant
it
would
be
to
pass
the
vegetable
patch
on
his
walk
to
hagrid's
it
was
not
strictly
on
the
way
but
it
seemed
clear
to
Harry
that
this
was
a
whim
on
which
he
should
act
so
he
di-rected
his
feet
immediately
toward
the
vegetable
patch
where
he
was
pleased
but
not
altogether
surprised
to
find
Professor
Slughorn
in
conversation
with
Professor
Sprout
harry
lurked
be-hind
a
low
stone
wall
feeling
at
peace
with
the
world
and
listening
to
their
conversation
i
do
thank
you
for
taking
the
time
Pomona
Slughorn
was
saying
courteously
most
authorities
agree
that
they
are
at
their
most
efficacious
if
picked
at
twilight
oh
I
quite
agree
said
Professor
Sprout
warmly
that
enough
for
you
plenty
plenty
said
Slughorn
who
Harry
saw
was
carrying
an
armful
of
leafy
plants
this
should
allow
for
a
few
leaves
for
each
of
my
third
years
and
some
to
spare
if
anybody
over-stews
them
well
good
evening
to
you
and
many
thanks
again
professor
Sprout
headed
off
into
the
gathering
darkness
in
the
direction
of
her
greenhouses
and
Slughorn
directed
his
steps
to
the
spot
where
Harry
stood
invisible
seized
with
an
immediate
desire
to
reveal
himself
Harry
pullet
I
off
the
cloak
with
a
flourish
good
evening
Professor
merlins
beard
Harry
you
made
me
jump
said
Slughotn
stopping
dead
in
his
tracks
and
looking
wary
how
did
you
get
out
of
the
castle
i
think
Filch
must've
forgotten
to
lock
the
doors
said
Harry
cheerfully
and
was
delighted
to
see
Slughorn
scowl
i'll
be
reporting
that
man
he's
more
concerned
about
litter
than
proper
security
if
you
ask
me
but
why
are
you
out
then
Harry
well
sir
it's
Hagrid
said
Harry
who
knew
that
the
right
thing
to
do
just
now
was
to
tell
the
truth
he's
pretty
upset
but
you
won't
tell
anyone
Professor
i
don't
want
trouble
for
him
slughorn's
curiosity
was
evidently
aroused
well
I
can't
promise
that
he
said
gruffly
but
I
know
that
Dumbledore
trusts
Hagrid
to
the
hilt
so
i'm
sure
he
can't
be
up
to
anything
very
dreadful
well
it's
this
giant
spider
he's
had
it
for
years
it
lived
in
the
forest
it
could
talk
and
everything
i
heard
rumors
there
were
acromantulas
in
the
forest
said
Slughorn
softly
looking
over
at
the
mass
of
black
trees
it's
true
then
yes
said
Harry
but
this
one
Aragog
the
first
one
Hagrid
ever
got
it
died
last
night
he's
devastated
he
wants
company
while
he
buries
it
and
I
said
i'd
go
touching
touching
said
Slughorn
absentmindedly
his
large
droopy
eyes
fixed
upon
the
distant
lights
of
hagrid's
cabin
but
acromantula
venom
is
very
valuable
if
the
beast
only
just
died
it
might
not
yet
have
dried
out
of
course
I
wouldn't
want
to
do
anything
insensitive
if
Hagrid
is
upset
but
if
there
was
any
way
to
procure
some
i
mean
its
almost
impossible
to
get
venom
from
an
acromantula
while
its
alive
slughorn
seemed
to
be
talking
more
to
himself
than
Harry
now
seems
an
awful
waste
not
to
collect
it
might
get
a
hun-dred
Galleons
a
pint
to
be
frank
my
salary
is
not
large
and
now
Harry
saw
clearly
what
was
to
be
done
well
he
said
with
a
most
convincing
hesitancy
well
if
you
wanted
to
come
Professor
Hagrid
would
probably
be
really
pleased
give
Aragog
a
better
send-off
you
know
yes
of
course
said
Slughorn
his
eyes
now
gleaming
with
en-thusiasm
i
tell
you
what
Harry
i'll
meet
you
down
there
with
a
bottle
or
two
we'll
drink
the
poor
beast's
well
not
health
but
we'll
send
it
off
in
style
anyway
once
it's
buried
and
i'll
change
my
tie
this
one
is
a
little
exuberant
for
the
occa-sion
he
bustled
back
into
the
castle
and
Harry
sped
off
to
hagrid's
delighted
with
himself
yen
came
croaked
Hagrid
when
he
opened
the
door
and
saw
Harry
emerging
from
the
Invisibility
Cloak
in
front
of
him
yeah
Ron
and
Hermione
couldn't
though
said
Harry
they're
really
sorry
don
don
matter
hed've
bin
touched
yeh're
here
though
Harry
hagrid
gave
a
great
sob
he
had
made
himself
a
black
armband
out
of
what
looked
like
a
rag
dipped
in
boot
polish
and
his
eyes
were
puffy
red
and
swollen
harry
patted
him
consolingly
on
the
elbow
which
was
the
highest
point
of
Hagrid
he
could
easily
reach
where
are
we
burying
him
he
asked
the
forest
blimey
no
said
Hagrid
wiping
his
streaming
eyes
on
the
bot-tom
of
his
shirt
the
other
spiders
won
let
me
anywhere
near
their
webs
now
aragog's
gone
turns
out
it
was
only
on
his
orders
they
didn
eat
me
can
yeh
believe
that
Harry
the
honest
answer
was
yes
Harry
recalled
with
painful
ease
the
scene
when
he
and
Ron
had
come
face-to-face
with
the
aero-mantulas
they
had
been
quite
clear
that
Aragog
was
the
only
thing
that
stopped
them
from
eating
Hagrid
never
bin
an
area
o
the
forest
I
couldn
go
before
said
Hagrid
shaking
his
head
it
wasn
easy
gettin
aragog's
body
out
o
there
I
can
tell
yeh
they
usually
eat
their
dead
see
but
I
wanted
ter
give
im
a
nice
burial
a
proper
send-off
he
broke
into
sobs
again
and
Harry
resumed
the
patting
of
his
elbow
saying
as
he
did
so
for
the
potion
seemed
to
indicate
that
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
Professor
Slughorn
met
me
coming
down
here
Hagrid
not
in
trouble
are
yeh
said
Hagrid
looking
up
alarmed
yeh
shouldn
be
outta
the
castle
in
the
evenin
I
know
it
it's
my
fault
no
no
when
he
heard
what
I
was
doing
he
said
he'd
like
to
come
and
pay
his
last
respects
to
Aragog
too
said
Harry
he's
gone
to
change
into
something
more
suitable
I
think
and
he
said
he'd
bring
some
bottles
so
we
can
drink
to
aragog's
mem-ory
did
he
said
Hagrid
looking
both
astonished
and
touched
tha's
tha's
righ
nice
of
him
that
is
an
not
turnin
yeh
in
ei-ther
i've
never
really
had
a
lot
ter
do
with
Horace
Slughorn
before
comin
ter
see
old
Aragog
off
though
eh
well
hed've
liked
that
Aragog
would
harry
thought
privately
that
what
Aragog
would
have
liked
most
about
Slughorn
was
the
ample
amount
of
edible
flesh
he
pro-vided
but
he
merely
moved
to
the
rear
window
of
hagrid's
hut
where
he
saw
the
rather
horrible
sight
of
the
enormous
dead
spider
lying
on
its
back
outside
its
legs
curled
and
tangled
are
we
going
to
bury
him
here
Hagrid
in
your
garden
jus
beyond
the
pumpkin
patch
I
thought
said
Hagrid
in
a
choked
voice
i've
already
dug
the
yeh
know
grave
jus
thought
we'd
say
a
few
nice
things
over
him
happy
memories
yeh
know
his
voice
quivered
and
broke
there
was
a
knock
on
the
door
and
he
turned
to
answer
it
blowing
his
nose
on
his
great
spotted
handkerchief
as
he
did
so
slughorn
hurried
over
the
threshold
several
bottles
in
his
arms
and
wearing
a
somber
black
cravat
hagrid
he
said
in
a
deep
grave
voice
so
very
sorry
to
hear
of
your
loss
tha's
very
nice
of
yeh
said
Hagrid
thanks
a
lot
an
thanks
fer
not
givin
Harry
detention
neither
wouldn't
have
dreamed
of
it
said
Slughorn
sad
night
sad
night
where
is
the
poor
creature
out
here
said
Hagrid
in
a
shaking
voice
shall
we
shall
we
do
it
then
the
three
of
them
stepped
out
into
the
back
garden
the
moon
was
glistening
palely
through
the
trees
now
and
its
rays
mingled
with
the
light
spilling
from
hagrid's
window
to
illuminate
Aragogs
body
lying
on
the
edge
of
a
massive
pit
beside
a
ten-foot
high
mound
of
freshly
dug
earth
magnificent
said
Slughorn
approaching
the
spiders
head
where
eight
milky
eyes
stared
blankly
at
the
sky
and
two
huge
curved
pincers
shone
motionless
in
the
moonlight
harry
thougln
he
heard
the
tinkle
of
bottles
as
Slughorn
bent
over
the
pincers
apparently
examining
the
enormous
hairy
head
its
not
ev'ryone
appreciates
how
beau'iful
they
are
said
H
grid
to
slughorn's
back
tears
leaking
from
the
corners
of
his
crinkled
eyes
i
didn
know
yeh
were
interested
in
creatures
like
Aragog
Horace
interested
my
dear
Hagrid
I
revere
them
said
Slughorn
stepping
back
from
the
body
harry
saw
the
glint
of
a
bottle
disap-pear
beneath
his
cloak
though
Hagrid
mopping
his
eyes
once
more
noticed
nothing
now
shall
we
proceed
to
the
burial
hagrid
nodded
and
moved
forward
he
heaved
the
gigantic
spi-der
into
his
arms
and
with
an
enormous
grunt
rolled
it
into
the
dark
pit
it
hit
the
bottom
with
a
rather
horrible
crunchy
thud
hagrid
started
to
cry
again
of
course
it's
difficult
for
you
who
knew
him
best
said
Slughorn
who
like
Harry
could
reach
no
higher
than
hagrid's
el-bow
but
patted
it
all
the
same
why
don't
I
say
a
few
words
he
must
have
got
a
lot
of
good
quality
venom
from
Aragog
Harry
thought
for
Slughorn
wore
a
satisfied
smirk
as
he
stepped
up
to
the
rim
of
the
pit
and
said
in
a
slow
impressive
voice
Farewell
Aragog
king
of
arachnids
whose
long
and
faithful
friendship
those
who
knew
you
won't
forget
though
your
body
will
decay
your
spirit
lingers
on
in
the
quiet
web-spun
places
of
your
forest
home
may
your
many-eyed
descendants
ever
flourish
and
your
human
friends
find
solace
for
the
loss
they
have
sustained
tha
was
tha
was
beau'iful
howled
Hagrid
and
he
collapsed
onto
the
compost
heap
crying
harder
than
ever
there
there
said
Slughorn
waving
his
wand
so
that
the
huge
pile
of
earth
rose
up
and
then
fell
with
a
muffled
sort
of
crash
onto
the
dead
spider
forming
a
smooth
mound
lets
get
inside
and
have
a
drink
get
on
his
other
side
Harry
that's
it
up
you
come
Hagrid
well
done
they
deposited
Hagrid
in
a
chair
at
the
table
fang
who
had
been
skulking
in
his
basket
during
the
burial
now
came
padding
softly
across
to
them
and
put
his
heavy
head
into
harry's
lap
as
usual
slughorn
uncorked
one
of
the
bottles
of
wine
he
had
brought
i
have
had
it
all
tested
for
poison
he
assured
Harry
pouring
most
of
the
first
bottle
into
one
of
hagrid's
bucket-sized
mugs
and
handing
it
to
Hagrid
had
a
house-elf
taste
every
bottle
after
what
happened
to
your
poor
friend
Rupert
harry
saw
in
his
mind's
eye
the
expression
on
hermione's
face
if
she
ever
heard
about
this
abuse
of
houseelves
and
decided
never
to
mention
it
to
her
one
for
Harry
said
Slughorn
dividing
a
second
bottle
be-tween
two
mugs
and
one
for
me
well
he
raised
his
mug
high
to
Aragog
aragog
said
Harry
and
Hagrid
together
both
Slughorn
and
Hagrid
drank
deeply
harry
however
with
the
way
ahead
illuminated
for
him
by
Felix
Felicis
knew
that
he
must
not
drink
so
he
merely
pretended
to
take
a
gulp
and
then
set
the
mug
back
on
the
table
before
him
i
had
him
from
an
egg
yeh
know
said
Hagrid
morosely
tiny
little
thing
he
was
when
he
hatched
bout
the
size
of
a
Pekingese
sweet
said
Slughorn
used
ter
keep
him
in
a
cupboard
up
at
the
school
until
well
hagrid's
face
darkened
and
Harry
knew
why
Tom
Riddle
had
contrived
to
have
Hagrid
thrown
out
of
school
blamed
for
opening
the
Chamber
of
Secrets
slughorn
however
did
not
seem
to
be
listening
he
was
looking
up
at
the
ceiling
from
which
a
number
of
brass
pots
hung
and
also
a
long
silky
skein
of
bright
white
hair
that's
not
unicorn
hair
Hagrid
oh
yeah
said
Hagrid
indifferently
gets
pulled
out
of
their
tails
they
catch
it
on
branches
an
stuff
in
the
forest
yeh
know
but
my
dear
chap
do
you
know
how
much
that's
worth
i
use
it
fer
bindin
on
bandages
an
stuff
if
a
creature
gets
in
jured
said
Hagrid
shrugging
it's
dead
useful
very
strong
slughorn
took
another
deep
draught
from
his
mug
his
eyes
moving
carefully
around
the
cabin
now
looking
Harry
knew
for
more
treasures
that
he
might
be
able
to
convert
into
a
plentiful
su
ply
of
oak-matured
mead
crystalized
pineapple
and
velvet
smok-ing
jackets
he
refilled
hagrid's
mug
and
his
own
and
questioned
him
about
the
creatures
that
lived
in
the
forest
these
days
and
how
Hagrid
was
able
to
look
after
them
all
hagrid
becoming
expan-sive
under
the
influence
of
the
drink
and
slughorn's
flattering
in-terest
stopped
mopping
his
eyes
and
entered
happily
into
a
long
explanation
of
bowtruckle
husbandry
the
Felix
Felicis
gave
Harry
a
little
nudge
at
this
point
and
he
noticed
that
the
supply
of
drink
that
Slughorn
had
brought
was
running
out
fast
harry
had
not
yet
managed
to
bring
off
the
re-filling
Charm
without
saying
the
incantation
aloud
but
the
idea
that
he
might
not
be
able
to
do
it
tonight
was
laughable
Indeed
Harry
grinned
to
himself
as
unnoticed
by
either
Hagrid
or
slug-liorn
now
swapping
tales
of
the
illegal
trade
in
dragon
eggs
he
pointed
his
wand
under
the
table
at
the
emptying
bottles
and
they
immediately
began
to
refill
after
an
hour
or
so
Hagrid
and
Slughorn
began
making
extravagant
toasts
to
Hogwarts
to
Dumbledore
to
elf-made
wine
and
to
harry
Potter
bellowed
Hagrid
slopping
some
of
his
four-teenth
bucket
of
wine
down
his
chin
as
he
drained
it
yes
indeed
cried
Slughorn
a
little
thickly
Parry
Otter
the
Chosen
Boy
Who
well
something
of
that
sort
he
mumbled
and
drained
his
mug
too
not
long
after
this
Hagrid
became
tearful
again
and
pressed
the
whole
unicorn
tail
upon
Slughorn
who
pocketed
it
with
cries
of
To
friendship
to
generosity
to
ten
Galleons
a
hair
and
for
a
while
after
that
Hagrid
and
Slughorn
were
sitting
side
by
side
arms
around
each
other
singing
a
slow
sad
song
about
a
dying
wizard
called
Odo
aaargh
the
good
die
young
muttered
Hagrid
slumping
low
onto
the
table
a
little
cross-eyed
while
Slughorn
continued
to
war-ble
the
refrain
me
dad
was
no
age
ter
go
nor
were
yer
mum
an
dad
Harry
great
fat
tears
oozed
out
of
the
corners
of
hagrid's
crinkled
eyes
again
he
grasped
harry's
arm
and
shook
it
bes
wiz
and
witchard
o
their
age
i
never
knew
terrible
thing
terrible
thing
and
Odo
the
hero
they
bore
him
back
home
to
the
place
that
he'd
known
as
a
lad
sang
Slughorn
plaintively
they
laid
him
to
rest
with
his
hat
inside
out
and
his
wand
snapped
in
two
which
was
sad
terrible
Hagrid
grunted
and
his
great
shaggy
head
rolled
sideways
onto
his
arms
and
he
fell
asleep
snoring
deeply
sorry
said
Slughorn
with
a
hiccup
can't
carry
a
tune
to
save
my
life
hagrid
wasn't
talking
about
your
singing
said
Harry
quietly
he
was
talking
about
my
mum
and
dad
dying
oh
said
Slughorn
repressing
a
large
belch
oh
dear
yes
that
was
was
terrible
indeed
terrible
terrible
he
looked
quite
at
a
loss
for
what
to
say
and
resorted
to
refilling
their
mugs
i
don't
don't
suppose
you
remember
it
Harry
he
asked
awkwardly
no
well
I
was
only
one
when
they
died
said
Harry
his
eyes
on
the
flame
of
the
candle
flickering
in
hagrid's
heavy
snores
but
i've
found
out
pretty
much
what
happened
since
my
dad
died
first
did
you
know
that
i
I
didn't
said
Slughorn
in
a
hushed
voice
yeah
voldemort
murdered
him
and
then
stepped
over
his
body
toward
my
mum
said
Harry
slughorn
gave
a
great
shudder
but
he
did
not
seem
able
to
tear
his
horrified
gaze
away
from
harry's
face
he
told
her
to
get
out
of
the
way
said
Harry
remorselessly
he
told
me
she
needn't
have
died
he
only
wanted
me
she
could
have
run
oh
dear
breathed
Slughorn
she
could
have
she
needn't
that's
awful
it
is
isn't
it
said
Harry
in
a
voice
barely
more
than
a
whisper
but
she
didn't
move
dad
was
already
dead
but
she
didn't
want
me
to
go
too
she
tried
to
plead
with
Voldemort
but
he
just
laughed
that's
enough
said
Slughorn
suddenly
raising
a
shaking
hand
really
my
dear
boy
enough
i'm
an
old
man
i
don't
need
to
hear
i
don't
want
to
hear
i
forgot
lied
Harry
Felix
Felicis
leading
him
on
you
liked
her
didn't
you
liked
her
said
Slughorn
his
eyes
brimming
with
tears
once
more
i
don't
imagine
anyone
who
met
her
wouldn't
have
liked
her
very
brave
very
funny
it
was
the
most
horrible
thing
but
you
won't
help
her
son
said
Harry
she
gave
me
her
life
but
you
won't
give
me
a
memory
hagrid's
rumbling
snores
filled
the
cabin
harry
looked
steadily
into
slughorn's
tear-filled
eyes
the
Potions
master
seemed
unable
to
look
away
don't
say
that
he
whispered
it
isn't
a
question
if
it
were
to
help
you
of
course
but
no
purpose
can
be
served
it
can
said
Harry
clearly
dumbledore
needs
information
i
need
information
he
knew
he
was
safe
Felix
was
telling
him
that
Slughorn
would
remember
nothing
of
this
in
the
morning
looking
Slughorn
straight
in
the
eye
Harry
leaned
forward
a
little
i
am
the
Chosen
One
i
have
to
kill
him
i
need
that
memory
slughorn
turned
paler
than
ever
his
shiny
forehead
gleamed
with
sweat
you
are
the
Chosen
One
of
course
I
am
said
Harry
calmly
but
then
my
dear
boy
you're
asking
a
great
deal
you're
asking
me
in
fact
to
aid
you
in
your
attempt
to
destroy
you
don't
want
to
get
rid
of
the
wizard
who
killed
Lily
Evans
harry
Harry
of
course
I
do
but
you're
scared
he'll
find
out
you
helped
me
slughorn
said
nothing
he
looked
terrified
be
brave
like
my
mother
Professor
slughorn
raised
a
pudgy
hand
and
pressed
his
shaking
fingers
to
his
mouth
he
looked
for
a
moment
like
an
enormously
overgrown
baby
i
am
not
proud
he
whispered
through
his
fingers
i
am
ashamed
of
what
of
what
that
memory
shows
i
think
I
may
have
done
great
damage
that
day
you'd
cancel
out
anything
you
did
by
giving
me
the
memory
said
Harry
it
would
be
a
very
brave
and
noble
thing
to
do
hagrid
twitched
in
his
sleep
and
snored
on
slughorn
and
Harry
stared
at
each
other
over
the
guttering
candle
there
was
a
long
long
silence
but
Felix
Felicis
told
Harry
not
to
break
it
to
wait
then
very
slowly
Slughorn
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
pulled
out
his
wand
he
put
his
other
hand
inside
his
cloak
and
took
out
a
small
empty
bottle
still
looking
into
harry's
eyes
Slughorn
touched
the
tip
of
his
wand
to
his
temple
and
withdrew
it
so
that
a
long
silver
thread
of
memory
came
away
too
clinging
to
the
wand
tip
longer
and
longer
the
memory
stretched
until
it
broke
and
swung
silvery
bright
from
the
wand
slughorn
lowered
it
into
the
bottle
where
it
coiled
then
spread
swirling
like
gas
he
corked
the
bottle
with
a
trembling
hand
and
then
passed
it
across
the
table
to
Harry
thank
you
very
much
Professor
you're
a
good
boy
said
Professor
Slughorn
tears
trickling
down
his
fat
cheeks
into
his
walrus
mustache
and
you've
got
her
eyes
just
don't
think
too
badly
of
me
once
you've
seen
it
and
he
too
put
his
head
on
his
arms
gave
a
deep
sigh
and
fell
asleep
chapter
Horcruxes
harry
could
feel
the
Felix
Felicis
wearing
off
as
he
creeped
back
into
the
castle
the
front
door
had
remained
un
locked
for
him
but
on
the
third
floor
he
met
Peeves
and
only
narrowly
avoided
detection
by
diving
sideways
through
one
of
his
shortcuts
by
the
time
he
got
up
to
the
portrait
of
the
Fat
Lady
and
pulled
off
his
Invisibility
Cloak
he
was
not
surprised
to
find
her
in
a
most
unhelpful
mood
what
sort
of
time
do
you
call
this
i'm
really
sorry
I
had
to
go
out
for
something
important
well
the
password
changed
at
midnight
so
you'll
just
have
to
sleep
in
the
corridor
won't
you
you're
joking
said
Harry
why
did
it
have
to
change
at
midnight
that's
the
way
it
is
said
the
Fat
Lady
if
you're
angry
go
and
take
it
up
with
the
headmaster
he's
the
one
who's
tightened
security
fantastic
said
Harry
bitterly
looking
around
at
the
hard
floor
really
brilliant
yeah
I
would
go
and
take
it
up
with
Dumbledore
if
he
was
here
because
he's
the
one
who
wanted
me
to
he
is
here
said
a
voice
behind
Harry
professor
Dumbledore
returned
to
the
school
an
hour
ago
nearly
Headless
Nick
was
gliding
toward
Harry
his
head
wob-bling
as
usual
upon
his
ruff
i
had
it
from
the
Bloody
Baron
who
saw
him
arrive
said
Nick
he
appeared
according
to
the
Baron
to
be
in
good
spirits
though
a
little
tired
of
course
where
is
he
said
Harry
his
heart
leaping
oh
groaning
and
clanking
up
on
the
Astronomy
Tower
it's
a
favorite
pastime
of
his
not
the
Bloody
Baron
Dumbledore
oh
in
his
office
said
Nick
i
believe
from
what
the
Baron
said
that
he
had
business
to
attend
to
before
turning
in
yeah
he
has
said
Harry
excitement
blazing
in
his
chest
at
the
prospect
of
telling
Dumbledore
he
had
secured
the
memory
he
wheeled
about
and
sprinted
off
again
ignoring
the
Fat
Lady
who
was
calling
after
him
come
back
all
right
I
lied
i
was
annoyed
you
woke
me
up
the
password's
still
tapeworm
but
Harry
was
already
hurtling
back
along
the
corridor
and
within
minutes
he
was
saying
toffee
eclairs
to
dumbledore's
gar-goyle
which
leapt
aside
permitting
Harry
entrance
onto
the
spiral
staircase
enter
said
Dumbledore
when
Harry
knocked
he
sounded
exhausted
harry
pushed
open
the
door
there
was
dumbledore's
office
looking
the
same
as
ever
but
with
black
star-strewn
skies
beyond
the
windows
good
gracious
Harry
said
Dumbledore
in
surprise
to
what
do
I
owe
this
very
late
pleasure
sir
i've
got
it
ive
got
the
memory
from
Slughorn
harry
pulled
out
the
tiny
glass
bottle
and
showed
it
to
Dumbledore
for
a
moment
or
two
the
headmaster
looked
stunned
then
his
face
split
in
a
wide
smile
harry
this
is
spectacular
news
very
well
done
indeed
i
knew
you
could
do
it
all
thought
of
the
lateness
of
the
hour
apparently
forgotten
he
hurried
around
his
desk
took
the
bottle
with
slughorn's
memory
in
his
uninjured
hand
and
strode
over
to
the
cabinet
where
he
kepi
the
Pensieve
and
now
said
Dumbledore
placing
the
stone
basin
upon
the
desk
and
emptying
the
contents
of
the
bottle
into
it
now
at
last
we
shall
see
harry
quickly
harry
bowed
obediently
over
the
Pensieve
and
felt
his
feet
leave
the
office
floor
once
again
he
fell
through
darkness
and
landed
in
Horace
slughorn's
office
many
years
before
there
was
the
much
younger
Slughorn
with
his
thick
shiny
straw-colored
hair
and
his
gingery-blond
mustache
sitting
again
in
the
comfortable
winged
armchair
in
his
office
his
feet
resting
upon
a
velvet
pouffe
a
small
glass
of
wine
in
one
hand
the
other
rummaging
in
a
box
of
crystallized
pineapple
and
there
were
the
half
dozen
teenage
boys
sitting
around
Slughorn
with
Tom
Riddle
in
the
midst
of
them
marvolo's
gold-and-black
ring
gleaming
on
his
finger
dumbledore
landed
beside
Harry
just
as
Riddle
asked
Sir
is
it
true
that
Professor
Merrythought
is
retiring
tom
Tom
if
I
knew
I
couldn't
tell
you
said
Slughorn
wag-ging
his
finger
reprovingly
at
Riddle
though
winking
at
the
same
time
i
must
say
i'd
like
to
know
where
you
get
your
information
boy
more
knowledgeable
than
half
the
staff
you
are
riddle
smiled
the
other
boys
laughed
and
cast
him
admiring
looks
what
with
your
uncanny
ability
to
know
things
you
shouldn't
and
your
careful
flattery
of
the
people
who
matter
thank
you
for
the
pineapple
by
the
way
you're
quite
right
it
is
my
favorite
Several
of
the
boys
tittered
again
I
confidently
expect
you
to
rise
to
Minister
of
Magic
within
twenty
years
fifteen
if
you
keep
sending
me
pineapple
I
have
ex-cellent
contacts
at
the
Ministry
tom
Riddle
merely
smiled
as
the
others
laughed
again
harry
noticed
that
he
was
by
no
means
the
eldest
of
the
group
of
boys
but
that
they
all
seemed
to
look
to
him
as
their
leader
i
don't
know
that
politics
would
suit
me
sir
he
said
when
the
laughter
had
died
away
i
don't
have
the
right
kind
of
background
for
one
thing
a
couple
of
the
boys
around
him
smirked
at
each
other
harry
was
sure
they
were
enjoying
a
private
joke
undoubtedly
about
what
they
knew
or
suspected
regarding
their
gang
leader's
famous
ancestor
nonsense
said
Slughorn
briskly
couldn't
be
plainer
you
come
from
decent
Wizarding
stock
abilities
like
yours
no
you'll
go
far
Tom
i've
never
been
wrong
about
a
student
yet
the
small
golden
clock
standing
upon
slughorn's
desk
chimed
eleven
o'clock
behind
him
and
he
looked
around
good
gracious
is
it
that
time
already
you'd
better
get
going
boys
or
we'll
all
be
in
trouble
lestrange
I
want
your
essay
by
in
morrow
or
it's
detention
same
goes
for
you
Avery
one
by
one
the
boys
filed
out
of
the
room
slughorn
heaved
himself
out
of
his
armchair
and
carried
his
empty
glass
over
to
his
desk
a
movement
behind
him
made
him
look
around
Riddle
was
still
standing
there
look
shar
p
Tom
you
don't
want
to
be
caught
out
of
bed
out
of
hours
and
you
a
prefect
sir
I
wanted
to
ask
you
something
Ask
away
then
m'boy
ask
away
sir
I
wondered
what
you
know
about
about
Horcruxes
slughorn
stared
at
him
his
thick
ringers
absentmindedly
clawing
the
stem
of
his
wine
glass
project
for
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
is
it
but
Harry
could
tell
that
Slughorn
knew
perfectly
well
that
this
was
not
schoolwork
not
exactly
sir
said
Riddle
i
came
across
the
term
while
reading
and
I
didn't
fully
understand
it
no
well
you'd
be
hard-pushed
to
find
a
book
at
Hogwarts
that'll
give
you
details
on
Horcruxes
Tom
that's
very
Dark
stuff
very
Dark
indeed
said
Slughorn
but
you
obviously
know
all
about
them
sir
i
mean
a
wizard
like
you
sorry
I
mean
if
you
can't
tell
me
obviously
I
just
knew
if
anyone
could
tell
me
you
could
so
I
just
thought
i'd
it
was
very
well
done
thought
Harry
the
hesitancy
the
casual
tone
the
careful
flattery
none
of
it
overdone
he
Harry
had
had
too
much
experience
of
trying
to
wheedle
information
out
of
re-luctant
people
not
to
recognize
a
master
at
work
he
could
tell
that
Riddle
wanted
the
information
very
very
much
perhaps
had
been
working
toward
this
moment
for
weeks
well
said
Slughorn
not
looking
at
Riddle
but
fiddling
with
the
ribbon
on
top
of
his
box
of
crystallized
pineapple
well
it
can't
hurt
to
give
you
an
overview
of
course
just
so
that
you
understand
t
he
term
a
Horcrux
is
the
word
used
for
an
object
in
which
a
per-son
has
concealed
part
of
their
soul
i
don't
quite
understand
how
that
works
though
sir
said
Riddle
his
voice
was
carefully
controlled
but
Harry
could
sense
his
excitement
well
you
split
your
soul
you
see
said
Slughorn
and
hide
part
of
it
in
an
object
outside
the
body
then
even
if
one's
body
is
attacked
or
destroyed
one
cannot
die
for
part
of
the
soul
remains
earthbound
and
undamaged
but
of
course
existence
in
such
a
form
slughorn's
face
crumpled
and
Harry
found
himself
remember-ing
words
he
had
heard
nearly
two
years
before
I
was
ripped
from
my
body
I
was
less
than
spirit
less
than
the
meanest
ghost
but
still
I
was
alive
few
would
want
it
Tom
very
few
death
would
be
preferable
but
riddle's
hunger
was
now
apparent
his
expression
was
greedy
he
could
no
longer
hide
his
longing
how
do
you
split
your
soul
well
said
Slughorn
uncomfortably
you
must
understand
that
the
soul
is
supposed
to
remain
intact
and
whole
splitting
n
it
I
an
act
of
violation
it
is
against
nature
but
how
do
you
do
it
by
an
act
of
evil
the
supreme
act
of
evil
by
commiting
murder
killing
rips
the
soul
apart
the
wizard
intent
upon
creating
a
Horcrux
would
use
the
damage
to
his
advantage
He
would
encase
the
torn
portion
encase
but
how
there
is
a
spell
do
not
ask
me
I
don't
know
said
Slughoin
shaking
his
head
like
an
old
elephant
bothered
by
mosquitoes
do
I
look
as
though
I
have
tried
it
do
I
look
like
a
killer
no
sir
of
course
not
said
Riddle
quickly
i'm
sorry
i
didn't
mean
to
offend
not
at
all
not
at
all
not
offended
said
Slughorn
gruffly
It
is
natural
to
feel
some
curiosity
about
these
things
wizards
of
a
certain
caliber
have
always
been
drawn
to
that
aspect
of
magic
yes
sir
said
Riddle
what
I
don't
understand
though
just
out
of
curiosity
I
mean
would
one
Horcrux
be
much
use
can
you
only
split
your
soul
once
wouldn't
it
be
better
make
you
stronger
to
have
your
soul
in
more
pieces
I
mean
for
instance
isn't
seven
the
most
powerfully
magical
number
wouldn't
seven
merlin's
beard
Tom
yelped
Slughorn
seven
isn't
it
bad
enough
to
think
of
killing
one
person
and
in
any
case
bad
enough
to
divide
the
soul
but
to
rip
it
into
seven
pieces
slughorn
looked
deeply
troubled
now
He
was
gazing
at
Riddle
as
though
he
had
never
seen
him
plainly
before
and
Harry
could
tell
that
he
was
regretting
entering
into
the
conversation
at
all
of
course
he
muttered
this
is
all
hypothetical
what
we're
discussing
isn't
it
all
academic
yes
sir
of
course
said
Riddle
quickly
but
all
the
same
Tom
keep
it
quiet
what
i've
told
that's
to
say
what
we've
discussed
people
wouldn't
like
to
think
we've
been
chatting
about
Horcruxes
it's
a
banned
subject
at
Hogwarts
you
know
dumbledore's
particularly
fierce
about
it
i
won't
say
a
word
sir
said
Riddle
and
he
left
but
not
before
Harry
had
glimpsed
his
face
which
was
full
of
that
same
wild
hap-piness
it
had
worn
when
he
had
first
found
out
that
he
was
a
wiz-ard
the
sort
of
happiness
that
did
not
enhance
his
handsome
features
but
made
them
somehow
less
human
thank
you
Harry
said
Dumbledore
quietly
let
us
go
when
Harry
landed
back
on
the
office
floor
Dumbledore
was
already
sitting
down
behind
his
desk
harry
sat
too
and
waited
for
Dumbledore
to
speak
i
have
been
hoping
for
this
piece
of
evidence
for
a
very
long
time
said
Dumbledore
at
last
it
confirms
the
theory
on
which
I
have
been
working
it
tells
me
that
I
am
right
and
also
how
very
far
there
is
still
to
go
harry
suddenly
noticed
that
every
single
one
of
the
old
head-masters
and
headmistresses
in
the
portraits
around
the
walls
was
awake
and
listening
in
on
their
conversation
a
corpulent
red
nosed
wizard
had
actually
taken
out
an
ear
trumpet
well
Harry
said
Dumbledore
I
am
sure
you
understood
the
significance
of
what
we
just
heard
at
the
same
age
as
you
are
now
give
or
take
a
few
months
Tom
Riddle
was
doing
all
he
could
to
find
out
how
to
make
himself
immortal
you
think
he
succeeded
then
sir
asked
Harry
he
made
a
Horcrux
and
that's
why
he
didn't
die
when
he
attacked
me
he
had
a
Horcrux
hidden
somewhere
a
bit
of
his
soul
was
safe
a
bit
or
more
said
Dumbledore
you
heard
Voldemort
what
he
particularly
wanted
from
Horace
was
an
opinion
on
what
would
happen
to
the
wizard
who
created
more
than
one
Horcrux
what
would
happen
to
the
wizard
so
determined
to
evade
death
that
he
would
be
prepared
to
murder
many
times
rip
his
soul
repeatedly
so
as
to
store
it
in
many
separately
concealed
Horcruxc
no
book
would
have
given
him
that
information
as
far
as
I
know
as
far
I
am
sure
as
Voldemort
knew
no
wizard
had
ever
done
more
than
tear
his
soul
in
two
dumbledore
paused
for
a
moment
marshaling
his
thought
and
then
said
Four
years
ago
I
received
what
I
considered
certain
proof
that
Voldemort
had
split
his
soul
where
asked
Harry
how
you
handed
it
to
me
Harry
said
Dumbledore
the
diary
Riddles
diary
the
one
giving
instructions
on
how
to
reopen
the
Chamber
of
Secrets
i
don't
understand
sir
said
Harry
well
although
I
did
not
see
the
Riddle
who
came
out
of
the
di-ary
what
you
described
to
me
was
a
phenomenon
I
had
never
wit-nessed
a
mere
memory
starting
to
act
and
think
for
itself
a
mere
memory
sapping
the
life
out
of
the
girl
into
whose
hands
it
had
fallen
no
something
much
more
sinister
had
lived
inside
that
book
a
fragment
of
soul
I
was
almost
sure
of
it
the
diary
had
been
a
Horcrux
but
this
raised
as
many
questions
as
it
answered
what
intrigued
and
alarmed
me
most
was
that
that
diary
had
been
intended
as
a
weapon
as
much
as
a
safeguard
still
don't
understand
said
Harry
well
it
worked
as
a
Horcrux
is
supposed
to
work
in
other
words
the
fragment
of
soul
concealed
inside
it
was
kept
safe
and
had
undoubtedly
played
its
part
in
preventing
the
death
of
its
owner
but
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
Riddle
really
wanted
that
diary
read
wanted
the
piece
of
his
soul
to
inhabit
or
possess
some-body
else
so
that
slytherin's
monster
would
be
unleashed
again
well
he
didn't
want
his
hard
work
to
be
wasted
said
Harry
he
wanted
people
to
know
he
was
slytherin's
heir
because
he
couldn't
take
credit
at
the
time
quite
correct
said
Dumbledore
nodding
but
don't
you
see
Harry
that
if
he
intended
the
diary
to
be
passed
to
or
planted
on
some
future
Hogwarts
student
he
was
being
remarkably
blase
about
that
precious
fragment
of
his
soul
concealed
within
it
the
point
of
a
Horcrux
is
as
Professor
Slughorn
explained
to
keep
part
of
the
self
hidden
and
safe
not
to
fling
it
into
somebody
else's
path
and
run
the
risk
that
they
might
destroy
it
as
indeed
happened
That
particular
fragment
of
soul
is
no
more
you
saw
to
that
the
careless
way
in
which
Voldemort
regarded
this
Horcrux
seemed
most
ominous
to
me
it
suggested
that
he
must
have
made
or
had
been
planning
to
make
more
Horcruxes
so
that
the
loss
of
his
first
would
not
be
so
detrimental
i
did
not
wish
to
be-lieve
it
but
nothing
else
seemed
to
make
sense
then
you
told
me
two
years
later
that
on
the
night
that
volde-mort
returned
to
his
body
he
made
a
most
illuminating
and
alarm-ing
statement
to
his
Death
Eaters
i
who
have
gone
further
than
anybody
along
the
path
that
leads
to
immortality
that
was
what
you
told
me
he
said
further
than
anybody
and
I
thought
I
knew
what
that
meant
though
the
Death
Eaters
did
not
he
was
referring
to
his
Horcruxes
Horcruxes
in
the
plural
Harry
which
I
dont
believe
any
other
wizard
has
ever
had
yet
it
fitted
Lord
Voldomort
has
seemed
to
grow
less
human
with
the
passing
years
and
the
transformation
he
had
undergone
seemed
to
me
to
be
only
explainable
if
his
soul
was
mutilated
beyond
the
realms
of
what
we
might
call
usual
evil
so
he's
made
himself
impossible
to
kill
by
murdering
other
people
said
Harry
why
couldn't
he
make
a
sorcerer's
Stone
or
steal
one
if
he
was
so
interested
in
immortality
well
we
know
that
he
tried
to
do
just
that
five
years
ago
snl
Dumbledore
but
there
are
several
reasons
why
I
think
a
sorcerer's
Stone
would
appeal
less
than
Horcruxes
to
Lord
Voldemort
while
the
Elixir
of
Life
does
indeed
extend
life
it
must
lie
drunk
regularly
for
all
eternity
if
the
drinker
is
to
maintain
the
immortality
therefore
Voldemort
would
be
entirely
dependant
on
the
Elixir
and
if
it
ran
out
or
was
contaminated
or
if
the
Stone
was
stolen
he
would
die
just
like
any
other
man
voldemort
likes
to
operate
alone
remember
i
believe
that
he
would
have
found
the
thought
of
being
dependent
even
on
the
Elixir
intolerable
of
course
he
was
prepared
to
drink
it
if
it
would
take
him
out
of
the
horrible
part-life
to
which
he
was
condemned
after
attacking
you
but
only
to
regain
a
body
thereafter
I
am
convinced
he
intended
to
continue
to
rely
on
his
Horcruxes
he
would
need
nothing
more
if
only
he
could
regain
a
human
form
he
was
already
im-mortal
you
see
or
as
close
to
immortal
as
any
man
can
be
but
now
Harry
armed
with
this
information
the
crucial
memory
you
have
succeeded
in
procuring
for
us
we
are
closer
to
the
se-cret
of
finishing
Lord
Voldemort
than
anyone
has
ever
been
before
you
heard
him
Harry
wouldn't
it
be
better
make
you
stronger
to
have
your
soul
in
more
pieces
isn't
seven
the
most
powerfully
magical
number
isn't
seven
the
most
powerfully
magical
number
yes
I
think
the
idea
of
a
seven-part
soul
would
greatly
appeal
to
Lord
Voldemort
he
made
seven
Horcruxes
said
Harry
horror-struck
while
several
of
the
portraits
on
the
walls
made
similar
noises
of
shock
mid
outrage
but
they
could
be
anywhere
in
the
world
hidden
buried
or
invisible
i
am
glad
to
see
you
appreciate
the
magnitude
of
the
problem
said
Dumbledore
calmly
but
firstly
no
Harry
not
seven
hor-cruxes
six
the
seventh
part
of
his
soul
however
maimed
resides
inside
his
regenerated
body
that
was
the
part
of
him
that
lived
a
spectral
existence
for
so
many
years
during
his
exile
without
that
he
has
no
self
at
all
that
seventh
piece
of
soul
will
be
the
last
that
anybody
wishing
to
kill
Voldemort
must
attack
the
piece
that
lives
in
his
body
but
the
six
Horcruxes
then
said
Harry
a
little
desperately
how
are
we
supposed
to
find
them
you
are
forgetting
you
have
already
destroyed
one
of
them
and
I
have
destroyed
another
you
have
said
Harry
eagerly
yes
indeed
said
Dumbledore
and
he
raised
his
blackened
burned-looking
hand
the
ring
Harry
marvolo's
ring
and
a
ter-rible
curse
there
was
upon
it
too
had
it
not
been
forgive
me
the
lack
of
seemly
modesty
for
my
own
prodigious
skill
and
for
Professor
snape's
timely
action
when
I
returned
to
Hogwarts
des-perately
injured
I
might
not
have
lived
to
tell
the
tale
however
a
withered
hand
does
not
seem
an
unreasonable
exchange
for
a
sev-enth
of
voldemort's
soul
the
ring
is
no
longer
a
Horcrux
but
how
did
you
find
it
well
as
you
now
know
for
many
years
I
have
made
it
my
business
to
discover
as
much
as
I
can
about
voldemort's
past
life
i
have
traveled
widely
visiting
those
places
he
once
knew
i
stumbled
across
the
ring
hidden
in
the
ruin
of
the
Gaunts
house
it
seem
that
once
Voldemort
had
succeeded
in
sealing
a
piece
of
his
soul
in
side
it
he
did
not
want
to
wear
it
anymore
he
hid
it
protected
by
many
powerful
enchantments
in
the
shack
where
his
ancestors
had
once
lived
Morfin
having
been
carted
off
to
azkaban
of
course
never
guessing
that
I
might
one
day
take
the
trouble
to
visit
the
ruin
or
that
I
might
be
keeping
an
eye
open
for
traces
of
magical
concealment
however
we
should
not
congratulate
ourselves
too
heartily
you
destroyed
the
diary
and
I
the
ring
but
if
we
are
right
in
our
theory
of
a
seven-part
soul
four
Horcruxes
remain
and
they
could
be
anything
said
Harry
they
could
be
oh
in
tin
cans
or
I
dunno
empty
potion
bottles
you
are
thinking
of
Portkeys
Harry
which
must
be
ordinary
objects
easy
to
overlook
but
would
Lord
Voldemort
use
tin
cans
or
old
potion
bottles
to
guard
his
own
precious
soul
you
are
forgetting
what
I
have
showed
you
lord
Voldemort
liked
to
collect
trophies
and
he
preferred
objects
with
a
powerful
magical
history
His
pride
his
belief
in
his
own
superiority
his
determination
to
carve
for
himself
a
startling
place
in
magical
history
these
things
suggest
to
me
that
Voldemort
would
have
chosen
his
Horcruxr
with
some
care
favoring
objects
worthy
of
the
honor
the
diary
wasn't
that
special
the
diary
as
you
have
said
yourself
was
proof
that
he
was
the
Hire
of
Slytherin
i
am
sure
that
Voldemort
considered
it
of
stu-pendous
importance
so
the
other
Horcruxes
said
Harry
do
you
think
you
know
what
they
are
sir
i
can
only
guess
said
Dumbledore
for
the
reasons
I
have
al-ready
given
I
believe
that
Lord
Voldemort
would
prefer
objects
that
in
themselves
have
a
certain
grandeur
i
have
therefore
trawled
back
through
voldemort's
past
to
see
if
I
can
find
evidence
that
such
artifacts
have
disappeared
around
him
the
locket
said
Harry
loudly
hufflepuff's
cup
yes
said
Dumbledore
smiling
I
would
be
prepared
to
bet
perhaps
not
my
other
hand
but
a
couple
of
fingers
that
they
be-came
Horcruxes
three
and
four
the
remaining
two
assuming
again
that
he
created
a
total
of
six
are
more
of
a
problem
but
I
will
hazard
a
guess
that
having
secured
objects
from
Hufflepuff
and
Slytherin
he
set
out
to
track
down
objects
owned
by
Gryffindor
or
Ravenclaw
four
objects
from
the
four
founders
would
I
am
sure
have
exerted
a
powerful
pull
over
voldemort's
imagination
i
can-not
answer
for
whether
he
ever
managed
to
find
anything
of
ravenclaw's
i
am
confident
however
that
the
only
known
relic
of
Gryffindor
remains
safe
dumbledore
pointed
his
blackened
fingers
to
the
wall
behind
him
where
a
ruby-encrusted
sword
reposed
within
a
glass
case
do
you
think
that's
why
he
really
wanted
to
come
back
to
Hogwarts
sir
said
Harry
to
try
and
find
something
from
one
of
the
other
founders
my
thoughts
precisely
said
Dumbledore
but
unfortunately
that
does
not
advance
us
much
further
for
he
was
turned
away
or
so
I
believe
without
the
chance
to
search
the
school
i
am
forced
to
conclude
that
he
never
fulfilled
his
ambition
of
collecting
four
founders
objects
he
definitely
had
two
he
may
have
found
three
that
is
the
best
we
can
do
for
now
even
if
he
got
something
of
ravenclaw's
or
of
gryffindor's
that
leaves
a
sixth
Horcrux
said
Harry
counting
on
his
fingers
unless
hes
got
both
i
don't
think
so
said
Dumbledore
i
think
I
know
what
the
sixth
Horcrux
is
i
wonder
what
you
will
say
when
I
confess
that
I
have
been
curious
for
a
while
about
the
behavior
of
the
snake
Nagini
the
snake
said
Harry
startled
you
can
use
animals
as
Horcruxes
well
it
is
inadvisable
to
do
so
said
Dumbledore
because
to
confide
a
part
of
your
soul
to
something
that
can
think
and
move
for
itself
is
obviously
a
very
risky
business
however
if
my
calculations
are
correct
Voldemort
was
still
at
least
one
Horcrux
short
of
his
goal
of
six
when
he
entered
your
parents
house
with
the
inten-tion
of
killing
you
he
seems
to
have
reserved
the
process
of
making
Horcruxes
for
particularly
significant
deaths
you
would
certainly
have
been
that
he
believed
that
in
killing
you
he
was
destroying
the
danger
the
prophecy
had
outlined
he
believed
he
was
making
himself
invin-cible
i
am
sure
that
he
was
intending
to
make
his
final
Horcrux
with
your
death
as
we
know
he
failed
after
an
interval
of
some
years
however
he
used
Nagini
to
kill
an
old
Muggle
man
and
it
might
then
have
occurred
to
him
to
turn
her
into
his
last
Horcrux
she
underlines
the
Slytherin
connection
which
enhances
Lord
Voldemorts
mys-tique
I
think
he
is
perhaps
as
fond
of
her
as
he
can
be
of
anything
he
certainly
likes
to
keep
her
close
and
he
seems
to
have
an
un-usual
amount
of
control
over
her
even
for
a
Parselmouth
so
said
Harry
the
diary's
gone
the
ring's
gone
the
cup
the
locket
and
the
snake
are
still
intact
and
you
think
there
might
be
a
Horcrux
that
was
once
ravenclaw's
or
gryffindor's
an
admirably
succinct
and
accurate
summary
yes
said
dum-bledore
bowing
his
head
so
are
you
still
looking
for
them
sir
is
that
where
you've
been
going
when
you've
been
leaving
the
school
correct
said
Dumbledore
i
have
been
looking
for
a
very
long
time
i
think
perhaps
i
may
be
close
to
finding
an-other
one
there
are
hopeful
signs
and
if
you
do
said
Harry
quickly
can
I
come
with
you
and
help
get
rid
of
it
dumbledore
looked
at
Harry
very
intently
for
a
moment
before
saying
Yes
I
think
so
i
can
said
Harry
thoroughly
taken
aback
oh
yes
said
Dumbledore
smiling
slightly
i
think
you
have
earned
that
right
harry
felt
his
heart
lift
it
was
very
good
not
to
hear
words
of
caution
and
protection
for
once
the
headmasters
and
head-mistresses
around
the
walls
seemed
less
impressed
by
dumbledore's
decision
Harry
saw
a
few
of
them
shaking
their
heads
and
Phineas
Nigellus
actually
snorted
does
Voldemort
know
when
a
Horcrux
is
destroyed
sir
can
he
feel
it
harry
asked
ignoring
the
portraits
a
very
interesting
question
Harry
i
believe
not
i
believe
that
Voldemort
is
now
so
immersed
in
evil
and
these
crucial
parts
of
himself
have
been
detached
for
so
long
he
does
not
feel
as
we
do
perhaps
at
the
point
of
death
he
might
be
aware
of
his
loss
but
he
was
not
aware
for
instance
that
the
diary
had
been
destroyed
until
he
forced
the
truth
out
of
Lucius
Malfoy
when
Voldemort
discovered
that
the
diary
had
been
mutilated
and
robbed
of
all
its
powers
I
am
told
that
his
anger
was
terrible
to
behold
but
I
thought
he
meant
Lucius
Malfoy
to
smuggle
it
into
Hogwarts
yes
he
did
years
ago
when
he
was
sure
he
would
be
able
to
create
more
Horcruxes
but
still
Lucius
was
supposed
to
wait
for
Voldemorts
say-so
and
he
never
received
it
for
Voldemort
van-ished
shortly
after
giving
him
the
diary
no
doubt
he
thought
that
Lucius
would
not
dare
do
anything
with
the
Horcrux
other
than
guard
it
carefully
but
he
was
counting
too
much
upon
Luciuss
fear
of
a
master
who
had
been
gone
for
years
and
whom
Lucius
believed
dead
of
course
Lucius
did
not
know
what
the
diary
really
was
i
understand
that
Voldemort
had
told
him
the
diary
would
cause
the
Chamber
of
Secrets
to
reopen
because
it
was
cleverly
enchanted
had
Lucius
known
he
held
a
portion
of
his
mas-ters
soul
in
his
hands
he
would
undoubtedly
have
treated
it
with
more
reverence
but
instead
he
went
ahead
and
carried
out
the
old
plan
for
his
own
ends
by
planting
the
diary
upon
Arthur
Weasleys
daughter
he
hoped
to
discredit
Arthur
and
get
rid
of
a
highly
incrim-inating
magical
object
in
one
stroke
ah
poor
Lucius
what
with
Voldemorts
fury
about
the
fact
that
he
threw
away
the
Horcrux
for
his
own
gain
and
the
fiasco
at
the
Ministry
last
year
I
would
not
be
sur-prised
if
he
is
not
secretly
glad
to
be
safe
in
Azkaban
at
the
moment
harry
sat
in
thought
for
a
moment
then
asked
So
if
all
of
his
Horcruxes
are
destroyed
Voldemort
couldbe
killed
yes
I
think
so
said
Dumbledore
without
his
Horcruxes
Voldemort
will
be
a
mortal
man
with
a
maimed
and
diminished
soul
never
forget
though
that
while
his
soul
may
be
damaged
be-yond
repair
his
brain
and
his
magical
powers
remain
intact
it
will
take
uncommon
skill
and
power
to
kill
a
wizard
like
Voldemort
even
without
his
Horcruxes
but
I
haven't
got
uncommon
skill
and
power
said
Harry
be-fore
he
could
stop
himself
yes
you
have
said
Dumbledore
firmly
you
have
a
power
that
Voldemort
has
never
had
you
can
i
know
said
Harry
impatiently
i
can
love
it
was
only
with
difficulty
that
he
stopped
himself
adding
Big
deal
yes
Harry
you
can
love
said
Dumbledore
who
looked
as
though
he
knew
perfectly
well
what
Harry
had
just
refrained
from
saying
which
given
everything
that
has
happened
to
you
is
a
great
and
remarkable
thing
you
are
still
too
young
to
understand
how
unusual
you
are
Harry
so
when
the
prophecy
says
that
i'll
have
power
the
Dark
Lord
knows
not
it
just
means
love
asked
Harry
feeling
a
little
let
down
yes
just
love
said
Dumbledore
but
Harry
never
forget
that
what
the
prophecy
says
is
only
significant
because
Voldemort
made
it
so
i
told
you
this
at
the
end
of
last
year
voldemort
singled
you
out
as
the
person
who
would
be
most
dangerous
to
him
and
in
doing
so
he
made
you
the
person
who
would
be
most
dan-gerous
to
him
but
it
comes
to
the
same
no
it
doesn't
said
Dumbledore
sounding
impatient
now
pointing
at
Harry
with
his
black
withered
hand
he
said
You
are
setting
too
much
store
by
the
prophecy
but
spluttered
Harry
but
you
said
the
prophecy
means
if
Voldemort
had
never
heard
of
the
prophecy
would
it
have
been
fulfilled
would
it
have
meant
anything
of
course
not
ho
you
think
every
prophecy
in
the
Hall
of
Prophecy
has
been
fulfilled
but
said
Harry
bewildered
but
last
year
you
said
one
of
us
would
have
to
kill
the
other
harry
Harry
only
because
Voldemort
made
a
grave
error
and
acted
on
Professor
trelawney's
words
if
Voldemort
had
never
murdered
your
father
would
he
have
imparted
in
you
a
furious
desire
for
revenge
of
course
not
if
he
had
not
forced
your
mother
to
die
for
you
would
he
have
given
you
a
magical
protection
he
could
not
penetrate
of
course
not
Harry
don't
you
see
voldemort
himself
created
his
worst
enemy
just
as
tyrants
everywhere
do
have
you
any
idea
how
much
tyrants
fear
the
people
they
oppress
all
of
them
realize
that
one
day
amongst
their
many
victims
there
is
sure
to
be
one
who
rises
against
them
and
strikes
back
voldemort
is
no
different
always
he
was
on
the
lookout
for
the
one
who
would
challenge
him
he
heard
the
prophecy
and
he
leapt
into
ac-tion
with
the
result
that
he
not
only
handpicked
the
man
most
likely
to
finish
him
he
handed
him
uniquely
deadly
weapons
but
it
is
essential
that
you
understand
this
said
Dumbledore
standing
up
and
striding
about
the
room
his
glittering
robes
swooshing
in
his
wake
Harry
had
never
seen
him
so
agitated
by
attempting
to
kill
you
Voldemort
himself
singled
out
the
remark-able
person
who
sits
here
in
front
of
me
and
gave
him
the
tools
for
the
job
it
is
voldemort's
fault
that
you
were
able
to
see
into
his
thoughts
his
ambitions
that
you
even
understand
the
snakelike
language
in
which
he
gives
orders
and
yet
Harry
despite
your
privileged
insight
into
voldemort's
world
which
incidentally
is
a
gift
any
Death
Eater
would
kill
to
have
you
have
never
been
se-duced
by
the
Dark
Arts
never
even
for
a
second
shown
the
slight-est
desire
to
become
one
of
voldemort's
followers
of
course
I
haven't
said
Harry
indignantly
he
killed
my
mum
and
dad
you
are
protected
in
short
by
your
ability
to
love
said
dum-bledore
loudly
the
only
protection
that
can
possibly
work
against
the
lure
of
power
like
voldemort's
in
spite
of
all
the
temptation
you
have
endured
all
the
suffering
you
remain
pure
of
heart
just
as
pure
as
you
were
at
the
age
of
eleven
when
you
stared
into
a
mir-ror
that
reflected
your
heart's
desire
and
it
showed
you
only
the
way
to
thwart
Lord
Voldemort
and
not
immortality
or
riches
harry
have
you
any
idea
how
few
wizards
could
have
seen
what
you
saw
in
that
mirror
voldemort
should
have
known
then
what
he
was
dealing
with
but
he
did
not
but
he
knows
it
now
you
have
flitted
into
Lord
voldemort's
mind
without
damage
to
yourself
but
he
cannot
possess
you
with-out
enduring
mortal
agony
as
he
discovered
in
the
Ministry
i
do
not
think
he
understands
why
Harry
but
then
he
was
in
such
a
hurry
to
mutilate
his
own
soul
he
never
paused
to
understand
the
incomparable
power
of
a
soul
that
is
untarnished
and
whole
but
sir
said
Harry
making
valiant
efforts
not
to
sound
argu-mentative
it
all
comes
to
the
same
thing
doesn't
it
i've
got
to
try
and
kill
him
or
got
to
said
Dumbledore
of
course
you've
got
to
but
not
because
of
the
prophecy
because
you
yourself
will
never
rest
until
you've
tried
we
both
know
it
imagine
please
just
for
a
moment
that
you
had
never
heard
that
prophecy
how
would
you
feel
about
Voldemort
now
think
harry
watched
Dumbledore
striding
up
and
down
in
front
ol
him
and
thought
he
thought
of
his
mother
his
father
and
Sinus
he
thought
of
Cedric
Diggory
he
thought
of
all
the
terrible
deeds
he
knew
Lord
Voldemort
had
done
a
flame
seemed
to
leap
inside
his
chest
searing
his
throat
i'd
want
him
finished
said
Harry
quietly
and
i'd
want
to
do
it
of
course
you
would
cried
Dumbledore
you
see
the
prophecy
does
not
mean
you
have
to
do
anything
but
the
prophecy
caused
Lord
Voldemort
to
mark
you
as
his
equal
in
other
words
you
are
free
to
choose
your
way
quite
free
to
turn
your
back
on
the
prophecy
but
Voldemort
continues
to
set
store
by
the
prophecy
he
will
continue
to
hunt
you
which
makes
it
certain
really
that
that
one
of
us
is
going
to
end
up
killing
the
other
said
Harry
yes
but
he
understood
at
last
what
Dumbledore
had
been
trying
to
tell
him
it
was
he
thought
the
difference
between
being
dragged
into
the
arena
to
face
a
battle
to
the
death
and
walking
into
the
arena
with
your
head
held
high
some
people
perhaps
would
say
that
there
was
little
to
choose
between
the
two
ways
but
dumble-dore
knew
and
so
do
I
thought
Harry
with
a
rush
of
fierce
pride
and
so
did
my
parents
that
there
was
all
the
difference
in
the
world
chapter
Sectumsempra
exhausted
but
delighted
with
his
night's
work
Harry
told
Ron
and
Hermione
everything
that
had
happened
during
next
morning's
Charms
lesson
having
first
cast
the
Muffliato
spell
upon
those
nearest
them
they
were
both
satisfyingly
impressed
by
the
way
he
had
wheedled
the
memory
out
of
Slughorn
and
positively
awed
when
he
told
them
about
voldemort's
Horcruxes
and
dumbledore's
promise
to
take
Harry
along
should
he
find
another
one
wow
said
Ron
when
Harry
had
finally
finished
telling
them
everything
Ron
was
waving
his
wand
very
vaguely
in
the
direction
of
the
ceiling
without
paying
the
slightest
bit
of
attention
to
what
he
was
doing
wow
you're
actually
going
to
go
with
Dumbledore
and
try
and
destroy
wow
ron
you're
making
it
snow
said
Hermione
patiently
grabbing
his
wrist
and
redirecting
his
wand
away
from
the
ceiling
from
which
sure
enough
large
white
flakes
had
started
to
fall
lavender
Brown
Harry
noticed
glared
at
Hermione
from
a
neighboring
table
through
very
red
eyes
and
Hermione
immediately
let
go
of
Rons
arm
oh
yeah
said
Ron
looking
down
at
his
shoulders
in
vague
surprise
sorry
looks
like
we've
all
got
horrible
dandruff
now
he
brushed
some
of
the
fake
snow
off
Hermiones
shoulder
Lavender
burst
into
tears
ron
looked
immensely
guilty
and
turned
his
back
on
her
we
split
up
he
told
Harry
out
of
the
corner
of
his
mouth
Last
night
when
she
saw
me
coming
out
of
the
dormitory
with
Hermione
obviously
she
couldn't
see
you
so
she
thought
it
had
just
been
the
two
of
us
ah
said
Harry
well
you
don't
mind
it's
over
do
you
No
Ron
admitted
it
was
pretty
bad
while
she
was
yelling
but
at
least
I
didn't
have
to
finish
it
coward
said
Hermione
though
she
looked
amused
well
it
was
a
bad
night
for
romance
all
around
ginny
and
Dean
split
up
too
Harry
harry
thought
there
was
a
rather
knowing
look
in
her
eye
as
she
told
him
that
but
she
could
not
possibly
know
that
his
insides
were
suddenly
dancing
the
conga
keeping
his
face
as
immobile
and
his
voice
as
indifferent
as
he
could
he
asked
How
come
oh
something
really
silly
she
said
he
was
always
trying
to
help
her
through
the
portrait
hole
like
she
couldn't
climb
in
herself
but
they've
been
a
bit
rocky
for
ages
harry
glanced
over
at
Dean
on
the
other
side
of
the
classroom
he
certainly
looked
unhappy
of
course
this
puts
you
in
a
bit
of
a
dilemma
doesn't
it
said
Hermione
what
d'you
mean
said
Harry
quickly
the
Quidditch
team
said
Hermione
if
Ginnyand
Dean
aren't
speaking
oh
oh
yeah
said
Harry
flitwick
said
Ron
in
a
warning
tone
the
tiny
little
Charms
master
was
bobbing
his
way
toward
them
and
Hermione
was
the
only
one
who
had
managed
to
turn
vinegar
into
wine
her
glass
flask
was
full
of
deep
crimson
liquid
whereas
the
contents
of
harry's
and
ron's
were
still
murky
brown
now
now
boys
squeaked
Professor
Flitwick
reproachfully
a
little
less
talk
a
little
more
action
let
me
see
you
try
together
they
raised
their
wands
concentrating
with
all
their
might
and
pointed
them
at
their
flasks
harry's
vinegar
turned
to
ice
Rons
flask
exploded
yes
for
homework
said
Professor
Flitwick
reemerging
from
under
the
table
and
pulling
shards
of
glass
out
of
the
top
of
his
hat
practice
they
had
one
of
their
rare
joint
free
periods
after
Charms
and
walked
back
to
the
common
room
together
ron
seemed
to
be
positively
lighthearted
about
the
end
of
his
relationship
with
Lavender
and
Hermione
seemed
cheery
too
though
when
asked
what
she
was
grinning
about
she
simply
said
it's
a
nice
day
neither
of
them
seemed
to
have
noticed
that
a
fierce
battle
was
raging
inside
harry's
brain
she's
Rons
sister
but
she's
ditched
Dean
she's
still
Rons
sister
i'm
his
best
mate
that'll
make
it
worse
if
I
talked
to
him
first
he'd
hit
you
what
if
I
don't
care
he's
your
best
mate
harry
barely
noticed
that
they
were
climbing
through
the
portrait
hole
into
the
sunny
common
room
and
only
vaguely
registered
the
small
group
of
seventh
years
clustered
together
there
until
Hermione
cried
Katie
you're
back
are
you
okay
harry
stared
It
was
indeed
Katie
Bell
looking
completely
healthy
and
surrounded
by
her
jubilant
friends
i'm
really
well
she
said
happily
they
let
me
out
of
st.
Mungos
on
Monday
I
had
a
couple
of
days
at
home
with
Mum
and
Dad
and
then
came
back
here
this
morning
leanne
was
just
telling
me
about
McLaggen
and
the
last
match
Harry
yeah
said
Harry
well
now
you're
back
and
ron's
fit
we'll
have
a
decent
chance
of
thrashing
Ravenclaw
which
means
we
could
still
be
in
the
running
for
the
Cup
listen
Katie
he
had
to
put
the
question
to
her
at
once
his
curiosity
even
drove
Ginny
temporarily
from
his
brain
he
dropped
his
voice
as
katie's
friends
started
gathering
up
their
things
apparently
they
were
late
for
Transfiguration
that
necklace
can
you
remember
who
gave
it
to
you
now
no
said
Katie
shaking
her
head
ruefully
everyone's
been
asking
me
but
I
haven't
got
a
clue
the
last
thing
I
remember
was
walking
into
the
ladies
in
the
Three
Broomsticks
you
definitely
went
into
the
bathroom
then
said
Hermione
well
I
know
I
pushed
open
the
door
said
Katie
so
I
suppose
whoever
Imperiused
me
was
standing
just
behind
it
after
that
my
memory's
a
blank
until
about
two
weeks
ago
in
st.
mungo's
listen
i'd
better
go
I
wouldn't
put
it
past
McGonagall
to
give
me
lines
even
if
it
is
my
first
day
back
she
caught
up
her
bag
and
books
and
hurried
after
her
friends
leaving
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
to
sit
down
at
a
window
table
and
ponder
what
she
had
told
them
so
it
must
have
been
a
girl
or
a
woman
who
gave
Katie
the
necklace
said
Hermione
to
be
in
the
ladies
bathroom
or
someone
who
looked
like
a
girl
or
a
woman
said
Harry
don't
forget
there
was
a
cauldron
full
of
Polyjuice
Potion
at
hog-warts
we
know
some
of
it
got
stolen
in
his
mind's
eye
he
watched
a
parade
of
Crabbes
and
Goyles
prance
past
all
transformed
into
girls
i
think
i'm
going
to
take
another
swig
of
Felix
said
Harry
and
have
a
go
at
the
Room
of
Requirement
again
that
would
be
a
complete
waste
of
potion
said
Hermione
flatly
putting
down
the
copy
of
Spellmans
Syllabary
she
had
just
taken
out
of
her
bag
luck
can
only
get
you
so
far
Harry
the
situation
with
Slughorn
was
different
you
always
had
the
ability
to
persuade
him
you
just
needed
to
tweak
the
circumstances
a
bit
luck
isn't
enough
to
get
you
through
a
powerful
enchantment
though
don't
go
wasting
the
rest
of
that
potion
you'll
need
all
the
luck
you
can
get
if
Dumbledore
takes
you
along
with
him
she
dropped
her
voice
to
a
whisper
couldn't
we
make
some
more
ron
asked
Harry
ignoring
Hermione
it'd
be
great
to
have
a
stock
of
it
have
a
look
in
the
book
harry
pulled
his
copy
of
Advanced
Potion-Making
out
of
his
bap
and
looked
up
Felix
Felicis
blimey
its
seriously
complicated
he
said
running
an
eye
down
the
list
of
ingredients
and
it
takes
six
months
you've
got
to
let
it
stew
typical
said
Ron
harry
was
about
to
put
his
book
away
again
when
he
noticed
the
corner
of
a
page
folded
down
turning
to
it
he
saw
the
sectum-sempra
spell
captioned
For
Enemies
that
he
had
marked
a
few
weeks
previously
he
had
still
not
found
out
what
it
did
mainly
because
he
did
not
want
to
test
it
around
Hermione
but
he
was
considering
trying
it
out
on
McLaggen
next
time
he
came
up
behind
him
unawares
the
only
person
who
was
not
particularly
pleased
to
see
Katie
Bell
back
at
school
was
Dean
Thomas
because
he
would
no
longer
be
required
to
fill
her
place
as
Chaser
he
took
the
blow
stoically
enough
when
Harry
told
him
merely
grunting
and
shrugging
but
Harry
had
the
distinct
feeling
as
he
walked
away
that
Dean
and
Seamus
were
muttering
mutinously
behind
his
back
the
following
fortnight
saw
the
best
Quidditch
practices
Harry
had
known
as
Captain
his
team
was
so
pleased
to
be
rid
of
McLaggen
so
glad
to
have
Katie
back
at
last
that
they
were
flying
extremely
well
ginny
did
not
seem
at
all
upset
about
the
breakup
with
Dean
on
the
contrary
she
was
the
life
and
soul
of
the
team
her
imitations
of
Ron
anxiously
bobbing
up
and
down
in
front
of
the
goal
posts
as
the
Quaffle
sped
toward
him
or
of
Harry
bellowing
orders
at
McLaggen
before
being
knocked
out
cold
kept
them
all
highly
amused
harry
laughing
with
the
others
was
glad
to
have
an
innocent
reason
to
look
at
Ginny
he
had
received
several
more
Bludger
injuries
during
practice
because
he
had
not
been
keeping
his
eyes
on
the
Snitch
the
battle
still
raged
inside
his
head
Ginny
or
Ron
sometimes
he
thought
that
the
post-Lavender
Ron
might
not
mind
too
much
if
he
asked
Ginny
out
but
then
he
remembered
ron's
expression
when
he
had
seen
her
kissing
Dean
and
was
sure
that
Ron
would
consider
it
base
treachery
if
Harry
so
much
as
held
her
hand
yet
Harry
could
not
help
himself
talking
to
Ginny
laughing
with
her
walking
back
from
practice
with
her
however
much
his
conscience
ached
he
found
himself
wondering
how
best
to
get
her
on
her
own
it
would
have
been
ideal
if
Slughorn
had
given
another
of
his
little
parties
for
Ron
would
not
be
around
but
unfortunately
Slughorn
seemed
to
have
given
them
up
once
or
twice
Harry
considered
asking
for
hermione's
help
but
he
did
not
think
he
could
stand
seeing
the
smug
look
on
her
face
he
thought
he
caught
it
sometimes
when
Hermione
spotted
him
staring
at
Ginny
or
laughing
at
her
jokes
and
to
complicate
matters
he
had
the
nagging
worry
that
if
he
didn't
do
it
somebody
else
was
sure
to
ask
Ginny
out
soon
He
and
Ron
were
at
least
agreed
on
the
fact
that
she
was
too
popular
for
her
own
good
all
in
all
the
temptation
to
take
another
gulp
of
Felix
Felicis
was
becoming
stronger
by
the
day
for
surely
this
was
a
case
for
as
Hermione
put
it
tweaking
the
circumstances
the
balmy
days
slid
gently
through
May
and
Ron
seemed
to
be
there
at
harry's
shoulder
every
time
he
saw
Ginny
harry
found
himself
longing
for
a
stroke
of
luck
that
would
somehow
cause
Ron
to
realize
that
nothing
would
make
him
happier
than
his
best
friend
and
his
sister
falling
for
each
other
and
to
leave
them
alone
together
for
longer
than
a
few
seconds
there
seemed
no
chance
of
either
while
the
final
Quidditch
game
of
the
season
was
looming
Ron
wanted
to
talk
tactics
with
Harry
all
the
time
and
had
little
thought
for
anything
else
ron
was
not
unique
in
this
respect
interest
in
the
Gryffindor-Ravenclaw
game
was
running
extremely
high
throughout
the
school
for
the
match
would
decide
the
Championship
which
was
still
wide
open
if
Gryffindor
beat
Ravenclaw
by
a
margin
of
three
hundred
points
a
tall
order
and
yet
Harry
had
never
known
his
team
to
fly
better
then
they
would
win
the
Championship
if
they
won
by
less
than
three
hundred
points
they
would
come
second
to
Ravenclaw
if
they
lost
by
a
hundred
points
they
would
be
third
behind
Hufflepuff
and
if
they
lost
by
more
than
a
hundred
they
would
be
in
fourth
place
and
nobody
Harry
thought
would
ever
ever
let
him
forget
that
it
had
been
he
who
had
captained
Gryffindor
to
their
first
bottom-of-the-table
defeat
in
two
centuries
the
run-up
to
this
crucial
match
had
all
the
usual
features
members
of
rival
Houses
attempting
to
intimidate
opposing
teams
in
the
corridors
unpleasant
chants
about
individual
players
being
rehearsed
loudly
as
they
passed
the
team
members
themselves
either
swaggering
around
enjoying
all
the
attention
or
else
dashing
into
bathrooms
between
classes
to
throw
up
somehow
the
game
had
become
inextricably
linked
in
harry's
mind
with
success
or
failure
in
his
plans
for
Ginny
he
could
not
help
feeling
that
if
they
won
by
more
than
three
hundred
points
the
scenes
of
euphoria
and
a
nice
loud
after-match
party
might
be
just
as
good
as
a
hearty
swig
of
Felix
Felicis
in
the
midst
of
all
his
preoccupations
Harry
had
not
forgotten
his
other
ambition
finding
out
what
Malfoy
was
up
to
in
the
Room
of
Requirement
he
was
still
checking
the
marauder's
Map
and
as
he
was
unable
to
locate
Malfoy
on
it
deduced
that
Malfoy
was
still
spending
plenty
of
time
within
the
room
although
Harry
was
losing
hope
that
he
would
ever
succeed
in
getting
inside
the
Room
of
Requirement
he
attempted
it
whenever
he
was
in
the
vicinity
but
no
matter
how
he
reworded
his
request
the
wall
remained
firmly
doorless
a
few
days
before
the
match
against
Ravenclaw
Harry
found
himself
walking
down
to
dinner
alone
from
the
common
room
Ron
having
rushed
off
into
a
nearby
bathroom
to
throw
up
yet
again
and
Hermione
having
dashed
off
to
see
Professor
Vector
about
a
mistake
she
thought
she
might
have
made
in
her
last
Arithmancy
essay
more
out
of
habit
than
anything
Harry
made
his
usual
detour
along
the
seventh-floor
corridor
checking
the
marauder's
Map
as
he
went
for
a
moment
he
could
not
find
Malfoy
anywhere
and
assumed
he
must
indeed
be
inside
the
Room
of
Requirement
again
but
then
he
saw
malfoy's
tiny
labeled
dot
standing
in
a
boys
bathroom
on
the
floor
below
accompanied
not
by
Crabbe
or
Goyle
but
by
Moaning
Myrtle
harry
only
stopped
staring
at
this
unlikely
coupling
when
he
walked
right
into
a
suit
of
armor
the
loud
crash
brought
him
out
of
his
reverie
hurrying
from
the
scene
lest
Filch
turn
up
he
dashed
down
the
marble
staircase
and
along
the
passageway
below
outside
the
bathroom
he
pressed
his
ear
against
the
door
he
could
not
hear
anything
he
very
quietly
pushed
the
door
open
draco
Malfoy
was
standing
with
his
back
to
the
door
his
hands
clutching
either
side
of
the
sink
his
white-blond
head
bowed
don't
crooned
Moaning
myrtle's
voice
from
one
of
the
cubicles
don't
tell
me
what's
wrong
i
can
help
you
no
one
can
help
me
said
Malfoy
his
whole
body
was
shaking
i
can't
do
it
i
can't
it
won't
work
and
unless
do
it
soon
he
says
he'll
kill
me
and
Harry
realized
with
a
shock
so
huge
it
seemed
to
root
him
to
the
spot
that
Malfoy
was
crying
actually
crying
tears
streaming
down
his
pale
face
into
the
grimy
basin
malfoy
gasped
and
gulped
and
then
with
a
great
shudder
looked
up
into
flu-cracked
mirror
and
saw
Harry
staring
at
him
over
his
shoulder
malfoy
wheeled
around
drawing
his
wand
instinctively
Harry
pulled
out
his
own
malfoy's
hex
missed
Harry
by
inches
shattering
the
lamp
on
the
wall
beside
him
Harry
threw
himself
sideways
thought
Levicorpus
and
flicked
his
wand
but
Malfoy
blocked
the
jinx
and
raised
his
wand
for
another
no
no
stop
it
squealed
Moaning
Myrtle
her
voice
echoing
loudly
around
the
tiled
room
stop
stop
there
was
a
loud
bang
and
the
bin
behind
Harry
exploded
Harry
attempted
a
Leg-Locker
Curse
that
backfired
off
the
wall
be-hind
malfoy's
ear
and
smashed
the
cistern
beneath
Moaning
myr-tle
who
screamed
loudly
water
poured
everywhere
and
Harry
slipped
as
Malfoy
his
face
contorted
cried
Cruci
sectumsempra
bellowed
Harry
from
the
floor
waving
his
wand
wildly
blood
spurted
from
malfoy's
face
and
chest
as
though
he
had
been
slashed
with
an
invisible
sword
he
staggered
backward
and
collapsed
onto
the
waterlogged
floor
with
a
great
splash
his
wand
falling
from
his
limp
right
hand
no
gasped
Harry
slipping
and
staggering
Harry
got
to
his
feet
and
plunged
toward
Malfoy
whose
face
was
now
shining
scarlet
his
white
hands
scrabbling
at
his
blood-soaked
chest
no
I
didn't
harry
did
not
know
what
he
was
saying
he
fell
to
his
knees
beside
Malfoy
who
was
shaking
uncontrollably
in
a
pool
of
his
own
blood
moaning
Myrtle
let
out
a
deafening
scream
murder
murder
in
the
bathroom
murder
the
door
banged
open
behind
Harry
and
he
looked
up
terrified
Snape
had
burst
into
the
room
his
face
livid
pushing
Harry
roughly
aside
he
knelt
over
Malfoy
drew
his
wand
and
traced
it
over
the
deep
wounds
harry's
curse
had
made
muttering
an
incantation
that
sounded
almost
like
song
the
flow
of
blood
seemed
to
ease
Snape
wiped
the
residue
from
malfoy's
face
and
repeated
his
spell
now
the
wounds
seemed
to
be
knitting
harry
was
still
watching
horrified
by
what
he
had
done
barely
aware
that
he
too
was
soaked
in
blood
and
water
moaning
Myrtle
was
still
sobbing
and
wailing
overhead
when
Snape
had
performed
his
countercurse
for
the
third
time
he
half-lifted
Malfoy
into
a
standing
position
you
need
the
hospital
wing
there
may
be
a
certain
amount
of
scarring
but
if
you
take
dittany
immediately
we
might
avoid
even
that
come
he
supported
Malfoy
across
the
bathroom
turning
at
the
door
to
say
in
a
voice
of
cold
fury
And
you
Potter
you
wait
here
for
me
it
did
not
occur
to
Harry
for
a
second
to
disobey
he
stood
up
slowly
shaking
and
looked
down
at
the
wet
floor
there
were
bloodstains
floating
like
crimson
flowers
across
its
surface
he
could
not
even
find
it
in
himself
to
tell
Moaning
Myrtle
to
be
quiet
as
she
continued
to
wail
and
sob
with
increasingly
evident
enjoyment
snape
returned
ten
minutes
later
he
stepped
into
the
bathroom
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
go
he
said
to
Myrtle
and
she
swooped
back
into
her
toilet
at
once
leaving
a
ringing
silence
behind
her
i
didn't
mean
it
to
happen
said
Harry
at
once
his
voice
echoed
in
the
cold
watery
space
i
didn't
know
what
that
spell
did
but
Snape
ignored
this
apparently
I
underestimated
you
Potter
he
said
quietly
who
would
have
thought
you
knew
such
Dark
Magic
who
taught
you
that
spell
i
read
about
it
somewhere
where
it
was
a
library
book
Harry
invented
wildly
i
can't
remember
what
it
was
call
liar
said
Snape
harry's
throat
went
dry
he
knew
what
Snape
was
going
to
do
and
he
had
never
been
able
to
prevent
it
the
bathroom
seemed
to
shimmer
before
his
eyes
he
struggled
to
block
out
all
thought
but
try
as
he
might
the
Half-Blood
prince's
copy
of
Advanced
Potion-Making
swam
hazily
to
the
forefront
of
his
mind
and
then
he
was
staring
at
Snape
again
in
the
midst
of
this
wrecked
soaked
bathroom
he
stared
into
snape's
black
eyes
hoping
against
hope
that
Snape
had
not
seen
what
he
feared
but
bring
me
your
schoolbag
said
Snape
softly
and
all
of
your
schoolbooks
all
of
them
bring
them
to
me
here
now
there
was
no
point
arguing
harry
turned
at
once
and
splashed
out
of
the
bathroom
once
in
the
corridor
he
broke
into
a
run
toward
Gryffindor
Tower
most
people
were
walking
the
other
way
they
gaped
at
him
drenched
in
water
and
blood
but
he
answered
none
of
the
questions
fired
at
him
as
he
ran
past
he
felt
stunned
it
was
as
though
a
beloved
pet
had
turned
suddenly
savage
what
had
the
Prince
been
thinking
to
copy
such
a
spell
into
his
book
and
what
would
happen
when
Snape
saw
it
would
he
tell
Slughorn
harry's
stomach
churned
how
Harry
had
been
achieving
such
good
results
in
Potions
all
year
would
he
confiscate
or
destroy
the
book
that
had
taught
Harry
so
much
the
book
that
had
become
a
kind
of
guide
and
friend
harry
could
not
let
it
happen
he
could
not
where've
you
why
are
you
soaking
is
that
blood
ron
was
standing
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
looking
bewildered
at
the
sight
of
Harry
i
need
your
book
Harry
panted
your
Potions
book
quick
give
it
to
me
but
what
about
the
Half-Blood
i'll
explain
later
ron
pulled
his
copy
of
Advanced
Potion-Making
out
of
his
bag
and
handed
it
over
Harry
sprinted
off
past
him
and
back
to
the
common
room
here
he
seized
his
schoolbag
ignoring
the
amazed
looks
of
several
people
who
had
already
finished
their
dinner
threw
himself
back
out
of
the
portrait
hole
and
hurtled
off
along
the
seventh-floor
corridor
he
skidded
to
a
halt
beside
the
tapestry
of
dancing
trolls
closed
his
eyes
and
began
to
walk
i
need
a
place
to
hide
my
book
i
need
a
place
to
hide
my
book
i
need
a
place
to
hide
my
book
three
times
he
walked
up
and
down
in
front
of
the
stretch
of
blank
wall
when
he
opened
his
eyes
there
it
was
at
last
the
door
to
the
Room
of
Requirement
harry
wrenched
it
open
flung
him
self
inside
and
slammed
it
shut
he
gasped
despite
his
haste
his
panic
his
fear
of
what
awaited
him
back
in
the
bathroom
he
could
not
help
but
be
overawed
by
what
he
was
looking
at
he
was
standing
in
a
room
the
size
of
a
large
cathedral
whose
high
windows
were
sending
shafts
of
light
down
upon
what
looked
like
a
city
with
towering
walls
built
of
what
Harry
knew
must
be
objects
hidden
by
generations
of
Hogwarts
inhabitants
there
were
alleyways
and
roads
bordered
by
tetering
piles
of
broken
and
damaged
furniture
stowed
away
perhaps
to
hide
the
evidence
of
mishandled
magic
or
else
hidden
by
castle-proud
house-elves
there
were
thousands
and
thousands
of
books
no
doubt
banned
or
graffitied
or
stolen
there
were
winged
catapults
and
Fanged
Frisbees
some
still
with
enough
life
in
them
to
hover
halfheartedly
over
the
mountains
of
other
forbidden
items
there
were
chipped
bottles
of
congealed
potions
hats
jewels
cloaks
there
were
what
looked
like
dragon
eggshells
corked
bottles
whose
contents
still
shimmered
evilly
several
rusting
swords
and
a
heavy
bloodstained
axe
harry
hurried
forward
into
one
of
the
many
alleyways
between
all
this
hidden
treasure
he
turned
right
past
an
enormous
stuffed
troll
ran
on
a
short
way
took
a
left
at
the
broken
Vanishing
Cabinet
in
which
Montague
had
got
lost
the
previous
year
finally
pausing
beside
a
large
cupboard
that
seemed
to
have
had
acid
thrown
at
its
blistered
surface
he
opened
one
of
the
cupboard's
creaking
doors
It
had
already
been
used
as
a
hiding
place
for
something
in
a
cage
that
had
long
since
died
its
skeleton
had
five
legs
he
stuffed
the
Half-Blood
Princes
book
behind
the
cage
and
slammed
the
door
he
paused
for
a
moment
his
heart
thumping
horribly
gazing
around
at
all
the
clutter
would
he
be
able
to
find
this
spot
again
amidst
all
this
junk
seizing
the
chipped
bust
of
an
ugly
old
warlock
from
on
top
of
a
nearby
crate
he
stood
it
on
top
of
the
cupboard
where
the
book
was
now
hidden
perched
a
dusty
old
wig
and
a
tarnished
tiara
on
the
statues
head
to
make
it
more
distinctive
then
sprinted
back
through
the
alleyways
of
hidden
junk
as
fast
as
he
could
go
back
to
the
door
back
out
onto
the
corridor
where
he
slammed
the
door
behind
him
and
it
turned
at
once
back
into
stone
harry
ran
flat-out
toward
the
bathroom
on
the
floor
below
cramming
ron's
copy
of
Advanced
Potion-Making
into
his
bag
as
he
did
so
a
minute
later
he
was
back
in
front
of
Snape
who
held
out
his
hand
wordlessly
for
harry's
schoolbag
harry
handed
it
over
panting
a
searing
pain
in
his
chest
and
waited
one
by
one
Snape
extracted
Harrys
books
and
examined
them
Finally
the
only
book
left
was
the
Potions
book
which
he
looked
at
very
carefully
before
speaking
this
is
your
copy
of
Advanced
Potion-Making
is
it
Potter
yes
said
Harry
still
breathing
hard
you're
quite
sure
of
that
are
you
Potter
yes
said
Harry
with
a
touch
more
defiance
this
is
the
copy
of
Advanced
Potion-Making
that
you
purchased
from
Flourish
and
Blotts
yes
said
Harry
firmly
then
why
asked
Snape
does
it
have
the
name
Roonil
Wazlib
written
inside
the
front
cover
harrys
heart
missed
a
beat
that's
my
nickname
he
said
your
nickname
repeated
Snape
Yeah
that's
what
my
friends
call
me
said
Harry
i
understand
what
a
nickname
is
said
Snape
the
cold
black
eyes
were
boring
once
more
into
harry's
he
tried
not
to
look
into
them
close
your
mind
close
your
mind
but
he
had
never
learned
how
to
do
it
properly
do
you
know
what
I
think
Potter
said
Snape
very
quietly
i
think
that
you
are
a
liar
and
a
cheat
and
that
you
deserve
detention
with
me
every
Saturday
until
the
end
of
term
what
do
you
think
Potter
i
I
don't
agree
sir
said
Harry
still
refusing
to
look
into
snape's
eyes
well
we
shall
see
how
you
feel
after
your
detentions
said
Snape
ten
o'clock
Saturday
morning
Potter
my
office
but
sir
said
Harry
looking
up
desperately
quidditch
the
last
match
of
the
ten
o'clock
whispered
Snape
with
a
smile
that
showed
his
yellow
teeth
poor
Gryffindor
fourth
place
this
year
I
fear
and
he
left
the
bathroom
without
another
word
leaving
Harry
to
stare
into
the
cracked
mirror
feeling
sicker
he
was
sure
than
Ron
had
ever
felt
in
his
life
i
won't
say
I
told
you
so
said
Hermione
an
hour
later
in
the
common
room
leave
it
Hermione
said
Ron
angrily
harry
had
never
made
it
to
dinner
he
had
no
appetite
at
all
he
had
just
finished
telling
Ron
Hermione
and
Ginny
what
had
happened
not
that
there
seemed
to
have
been
much
need
the
news
had
traveled
very
fast
Apparently
Moaning
Myrtle
had
taken
it
upon
herself
to
pop
up
in
every
bathroom
in
the
castle
to
tell
the
story
Malfoy
had
already
been
visited
in
the
hospital
wing
by
Pansy
Parkinson
who
had
lost
no
time
in
vilifying
Harry
far
and
wide
and
Snape
had
told
the
staff
precisely
what
had
happened
harry
had
already
been
called
out
of
the
common
room
to
endure
fifteen
highly
unpleasant
minutes
in
the
company
of
Professor
McGonagall
who
had
told
him
he
was
lucky
not
to
have
been
expelled
and
that
she
supported
wholeheartedly
snape's
punishment
of
detention
every
Saturday
until
the
end
of
term
i
told
you
there
was
something
wrong
with
that
Prince
person
Hermione
said
evidently
unable
to
stop
herself
and
I
was
right
wasn't
I
no
I
don't
think
you
were
said
Harry
stubbornly
he
was
having
a
bad
enough
time
without
Hermione
lecturing
him
the
looks
on
the
Gryffindor
team's
faces
when
he
had
told
them
he
would
not
be
able
to
play
on
Saturday
had
been
the
worst
punishment
of
all
he
could
feel
ginny's
eyes
on
him
now
but
did
not
meet
them
he
did
not
want
to
see
disappointment
or
anger
there
he
had
just
told
her
that
she
would
be
playing
Seeker
on
Saturday
and
that
Dean
would
be
rejoining
the
team
as
Chaser
in
her
place
perhaps
if
they
won
Ginny
and
Dean
would
make
up
during
the
post-match
euphoria
the
thought
went
through
Harry
like
an
icy
knife
harry
said
Hermione
how
can
you
still
stick
up
for
that
book
when
that
spell
will
you
stop
harping
on
about
the
book
snapped
Harry
the
Prince
only
copied
it
out
it's
not
like
he
was
advising
anyone
to
use
it
for
all
we
know
he
was
making
a
note
of
something
that
had
been
used
against
him
i
don't
believe
this
said
Hermione
you're
actually
defending
i'm
not
defending
what
I
did
said
Harry
quickly
i
wish
hadn't
done
it
and
not
just
because
i've
got
about
a
dozen
detentions
you
know
I
wouldn't've
used
a
spell
like
that
not
even
on
Malfoy
but
you
can't
blame
the
Prince
he
hadn't
written
try
this
out
it's
really
good
he
was
just
making
notes
for
himself
wasn't
he
not
for
anyone
else
are
you
telling
me
said
Hermione
that
you're
going
to
go
back
and
get
the
book
yeah
I
am
said
Harry
forcefully
listen
without
the
Prince
i'd
never
have
won
the
Felix
Felicis
i'd
never
have
known
how
to
save
Ron
from
poisoning
i'd
never
have
got
a
reputation
for
Potions
brilliance
you
don't
deserve
said
Hermione
nastily
give
it
a
rest
Hermione
said
Ginny
and
Harry
was
so
amazed
so
grateful
he
looked
up
by
the
sound
of
it
Malfoy
was
trying
to
use
an
Unforgivable
Curse
you
should
be
glad
Harry
had
something
good
up
his
sleeve
well
of
course
i'm
glad
Harry
wasn't
cursed
said
Hermione
clearly
stung
but
you
can't
call
that
Sectumsempra
spell
good
Ginny
look
where
it's
landed
him
and
i'd
have
thought
seeing
what
this
has
done
to
your
chances
in
the
match
oh
don't
start
acting
as
though
you
understand
Quidditch
snapped
Ginny
you'll
only
embarrass
yourself
harry
and
Ron
stared
Hermione
and
Ginny
who
had
always
got
on
together
very
well
were
now
sitting
with
their
arms
folded
glaring
in
opposite
directions
ron
looked
nervously
at
Harry
then
snatched
up
a
book
at
random
and
hid
behind
it
harry
however
little
though
he
knew
he
deserved
it
felt
unbelievably
cheerful
all
of
a
sudden
even
though
none
of
them
spoke
again
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
his
lightheartedness
was
short-lived
there
were
Slytherin
taunts
to
be
endured
next
day
not
to
mention
much
anger
from
fellow
Gryffindors
who
were
most
unhappy
that
their
Captain
had
got
himself
banned
from
the
final
match
of
the
season
by
Saturday
morning
whatever
he
might
have
told
Hermione
Harry
would
have
gladly
exchanged
all
the
Felix
Felicis
in
the
world
to
be
walking
down
to
the
Quidditch
pitch
with
Ron
Ginny
and
the
others
it
was
almost
unbearable
to
turn
away
from
the
mass
of
students
streaming
out
into
the
sunshine
all
of
them
wearing
rosettes
and
hats
and
brandishing
banners
and
scarves
to
descend
the
stone
steps
into
the
dungeons
and
walk
until
the
distant
sounds
of
the
crowd
were
quite
obliterated
knowing
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
hear
a
word
of
commentary
or
a
cheer
or
groan
ah
Potter
said
Snape
when
Harry
had
knocked
on
his
door
and
entered
the
unpleasantly
familiar
office
that
Snape
despite
teaching
floors
above
now
had
not
vacated
it
was
as
dimly
lit
as
ever
and
the
same
slimy
dead
objects
were
suspended
in
colored
potions
all
around
the
walls
ominously
there
were
many
cob-webbed
boxes
piled
on
a
table
where
Harry
was
clearly
supposed
to
sit
they
had
an
aura
of
tedious
hard
and
pointless
work
about
them
mr.
Filch
has
been
looking
for
someone
to
clear
out
these
old
files
said
Snape
softly
they
are
the
records
of
other
Hogwarts
wrongdoers
and
their
punishments
where
the
ink
has
grown
faint
or
the
cards
have
suffered
damage
from
mice
we
would
like
you
to
copy
out
the
crimes
and
punishments
afresh
and
making
sure
that
they
are
in
alphabetical
order
replace
them
in
the
boxes
you
will
not
use
magic
right
Professor
said
Harry
with
as
much
contempt
as
he
could
put
into
the
last
three
syllables
i
thought
you
could
start
said
Snape
a
malicious
smile
on
his
lips
with
boxes
one
thousand
and
twelve
to
one
thousand
and
fifty-six
you
will
find
some
familiar
names
in
there
which
should
add
interest
to
the
task
here
you
see
he
pulled
out
a
card
from
one
of
the
topmost
boxes
with
a
flourish
and
read
James
Potter
and
Sirius
Black
apprehended
using
an
illegal
hex
upon
Bertram
Aubrey
aubreys
head
twice
normal
size
double
detention
snape
sneered
it
must
be
such
a
comforting
thing
that
though
they
are
gone
a
record
of
their
great
achievements
remains
harry
felt
the
familiar
boiling
sensation
in
the
pit
of
his
stomach
biting
his
tongue
to
prevent
himself
retaliating
he
sat
down
in
front
of
the
boxes
and
pulled
one
toward
him
it
was
as
Harry
had
anticipated
useless
boring
work
punctuated
as
Snape
had
clearly
planned
with
the
regular
jolt
in
the
stomach
that
meant
he
had
just
read
his
father
or
sirius's
names
usually
coupled
together
in
various
petty
misdeeds
occasionally
accompanied
by
those
of
Remus
Lupin
and
Peter
Pettigrew
and
while
he
copied
out
all
their
various
offenses
and
punishments
he
wondered
what
was
going
on
outside
where
the
match
would
have
just
started
ginny
playing
Seeker
against
Cho
harry
glanced
again
and
again
at
the
large
clock
ticking
on
the
wall
it
seemed
to
be
moving
half
as
fast
as
a
regular
clock
perhaps
Snape
had
bewitched
it
to
go
extra
slowly
he
could
not
have
been
here
for
only
half
an
hour
an
hour
an
hour
and
a
half
harry's
stomach
started
rumbling
when
the
clock
showed
half
past
twelve
snape
who
had
not
spoken
at
all
since
setting
Harry
his
task
finally
looked
up
at
ten
past
one
i
think
that
will
do
he
said
coldly
mark
the
place
you
have
reached
you
will
continue
at
ten
o'clock
next
Saturday
yes
sir
harry
stuffed
a
bent
card
into
the
box
at
random
and
hurried
out
of
the
door
before
Snape
could
change
his
mind
racing
back
up
the
stone
steps
straining
his
ears
to
hear
a
sound
from
the
pitch
but
all
was
quiet
it
was
over
then
he
hesitated
outside
the
crowded
Great
Hall
then
ran
up
the
marble
staircase
whether
Gryffindor
had
won
or
lost
the
team
usually
celebrated
or
commiserated
in
their
own
common
room
quid
agis
he
said
tentatively
to
the
Fat
Lady
wondering
what
he
would
find
inside
her
expression
was
unreadable
as
she
replied
you'll
see
and
she
swung
forward
a
roar
of
celebration
erupted
from
the
hole
behind
her
harry
gaped
as
people
began
to
scream
at
the
sight
of
him
several
hands
pulled
him
into
the
room
we
won
yelled
Ron
bounding
into
sight
and
brandishing
the
silver
Cup
at
Harry
we
won
four
hundred
and
fifty
to
a
hundred
and
forty
we
won
harry
looked
around
there
was
Ginny
running
toward
him
she
had
a
hard
blazing
look
in
her
face
as
she
threw
her
arms
around
him
and
without
thinking
without
planning
it
without
worrying
about
the
fact
that
fifty
people
were
watching
Harry
kissed
her
after
several
long
moments
or
it
might
have
been
half
an
hour
or
possibly
several
sunlit
days
they
broke
apart
the
room
had
gone
very
quiet
then
several
people
wolf-whistled
and
there
was
an
outbreak
of
nervous
giggling
harry
looked
over
the
top
of
ginny's
head
to
see
Dean
Thomas
holding
a
shattered
glass
in
his
hand
and
Romilda
Vane
looking
as
though
she
might
throw
something
hermione
was
beaming
but
harry's
eyes
sought
Ron
at
last
he
found
him
still
clutching
the
Cup
and
wearing
an
expression
appropriate
to
having
been
clubbed
over
the
head
for
a
fraction
of
a
second
they
looked
at
each
other
then
Ron
gave
a
tiny
jerk
of
the
head
that
Harry
understood
to
mean
Wellif
you
must
the
creature
in
his
chest
roaring
in
triumph
he
grinned
down
at
Ginny
and
gestured
wordlessly
out
of
the
portrait
hole
a
long
walk
in
the
grounds
seemed
indicated
during
which
if
they
had
time
they
might
discuss
the
match
chapter
The
Seer
Overheard
the
fact
that
Harry
Potter
was
going
out
with
Ginny
Weasley
seemed
to
interest
a
great
number
of
people
most
of
them
girls
yet
Harry
found
himself
newly
and
happily
impervious
to
gossip
over
the
next
few
weeks
after
all
it
made
a
very
nice
change
to
be
talked
about
because
of
something
that
was
making
him
happier
than
he
could
remember
being
for
a
very
long
time
rather
than
because
he
had
been
involved
in
hor-rific
scenes
of
Dark
magic
you'd
think
people
had
better
things
to
gossip
about
said
Ginny
as
she
sat
on
the
common-room
floor
leaning
against
harry's
legs
and
reading
the
Daily
Prophet
three
Dementor
attacks
in
a
week
and
all
Romilda
Vane
does
is
ask
me
if
it's
true
you've
got
a
Hippogriff
tattooed
across
your
chest
ron
and
Hermione
both
roared
with
laughter
harry
ignored
them
what
did
you
tell
her
told
her
it's
a
Hungarian
Horntail
said
Ginny
turning
a
page
of
the
newspaper
idly
much
more
macho
thanks
said
Harry
grinning
and
what
did
you
tell
her
ron's
got
a
Pygmy
Puff
but
I
didn't
say
where
ron
scowled
as
Hermione
rolled
around
laughing
watch
it
he
said
pointing
wamingly
at
Harry
and
Ginny
just
because
i've
given
my
permission
doesn't
mean
I
can't
withdraw
it
tour
permission
scoffed
Ginny
since
when
did
you
give
me
permission
to
do
anything
anyway
you
said
yourself
you'd
rather
it
was
Harry
than
Michael
or
Dean
yeah
would
said
Ron
grudgingly
and
just
as
long
as
you
don't
start
snogging
each
other
in
public
you
filthy
hypocrite
what
about
you
and
Lavender
thrash-ing
around
like
a
pair
of
eels
all
over
the
place
demanded
Ginny
but
ron's
tolerance
was
not
to
be
tested
much
as
they
moved
into
June
for
Harry
and
ginny's
time
together
was
becoming
increasingly
restricted
ginny's
O
w.l.s
were
approaching
and
she
was
therefore
forced
to
revise
for
hours
into
the
night
on
one
such
evening
when
Ginny
had
retired
to
the
library
and
Harry
was
sitting
beside
the
window
in
the
common
room
supposedly
finishing
his
Herbology
home-work
but
in
reality
reliving
a
particularly
happy
hour
he
had
spent
down
by
the
lake
with
Ginny
at
lunch-time
Hermione
dropped
into
the
seat
between
him
and
Ron
with
an
unpleasantly
purposeful
look
on
her
face
i
want
to
talk
to
you
Harry
what
about
said
Harry
suspiciously
only
the
previous
day
Hermione
had
told
him
off
for
distracting
Ginny
when
she
ought
to
be
working
hard
for
her
examinations
the
so-called
Half-Blood
Prince
oh
not
again
he
groaned
will
you
please
drop
it
he
had
not
dared
to
return
to
the
Room
of
Requirement
to
retrieve
his
book
and
his
performance
in
Potions
was
suffer-ing
accordingly
though
Slughorn
who
approved
of
Ginny
had
jocularly
attributed
this
to
Harry
being
lovesick
but
Harry
was
sure
that
Snape
had
not
yet
given
up
hope
of
laying
hands
on
the
prince's
book
and
was
determined
to
leave
it
where
it
was
while
Snape
remained
on
the
lookout
i'm
not
dropping
it
said
Hermione
firmly
until
you've
heard
me
out
now
i've
been
trying
to
find
out
a
bit
about
who
might
make
a
hobby
of
inventing
Dark
spells
he
didn't
make
a
hobby
of
it
he
he
who
says
it's
a
he
we've
been
through
this
said
Harry
crossly
prince
Hermione
Prince
right
said
Hermione
red
patches
blazing
in
her
cheeks
as
she
pulled
a
very
old
piece
of
newsprint
out
of
her
pocket
and
slammed
it
down
on
the
table
in
front
of
Harry
look
at
that
look
at
the
picture
harry
picked
up
the
crumbling
piece
of
paper
and
stared
at
the
moving
photograph
yellowed
with
age
Ron
leaned
over
for
a
look
too
the
picture
showed
a
skinny
girl
of
around
fifteen
she
was
not
pretty
she
looked
simultaneously
cross
and
sullen
with
heavy
brows
and
a
long
pallid
face
under-neath
the
photograph
was
the
caption
Eileen
Prince
Captain
of
the
Hogwarts
Gobstones
Team
so
said
Harry
scanning
the
short
news
item
to
which
the
picture
belonged
it
was
a
rather
dull
story
about
inter-school
competitions
her
name
was
Eileen
Prince
prince
Harry
they
looked
at
each
other
and
Harry
realised
what
Hermione
was
trying
to
say
he
burst
out
laughing
no
way
what
you
think
she
was
the
Half-Blood
oh
come
on
well
why
not
harry
there
aren't
any
real
princes
in
the
wizarding
world
it's
either
a
nickname
a
made-up
title
somebody's
given
themselves
or
it
could
be
their
actual
name
couldn't
it
no
listen
if
say
her
father
was
a
wizard
whose
surname
was
Prince
and
her
mother
was
a
Muggle
then
that
would
make
her
a
half-blood
Prince
yeah
very
ingenious
Hermione
but
it
would
maybe
she
was
proud
of
being
half
a
Prince
listen
Hermione
I
can
tell
it's
not
a
girl
i
can
just
tell
the
truth
is
that
you
don't
think
a
girl
would
have
been
clever
enough
said
Hermione
angrily
how
can
I
have
hung
round
with
you
for
five
years
and
not
think
girls
are
clever
said
Harry
stung
by
this
it's
the
way
he
writes
i
just
know
the
Prince
was
a
bloke
I
can
tell
this
girl
hasn't
got
anything
to
do
with
it
where
did
you
get
this
anyway
the
library
said
Hermione
predictably
there's
a
whole
collection
of
old
Prophets
up
there
well
i'm
going
to
find
out
more
about
Eileen
Prince
if
I
can
enjoy
yourself
said
Harry
irritably
i
will
said
Hermione
and
the
first
place
i'll
look
she
shot
at
him
as
she
reached
the
portrait
hole
is
records
of
old
Potions
awards
harry
scowled
after
her
for
a
moment
then
continued
his
contemplation
of
the
darkening
sky
she's
just
never
got
over
you
outperforming
her
in
Potions
said
Ron
returning
to
his
copy
of
One
Thousand
Magical
Herbs
and
Fungi
you
don't
think
i'm
mad
wanting
that
book
back
do
you
course
not
said
Ron
robustly
he
was
a
genius
the
Prince
anyway
without
his
bezoar
tip
he
drew
his
finger
significantly
across
his
own
throat
I
wouldn't
be
here
to
discuss
it
would
I
i
mean
i'm
not
saying
that
spell
you
used
on
Malfoy
was
great
nor
am
I
said
Harry
quickly
but
he
healed
all
right
didn't
he
back
on
his
feet
in
no
time
yeah
said
Harry
this
was
perfectly
true
although
his
con-science
squirmed
slightly
all
the
same
thanks
to
Snape
you
still
got
detention
with
Snape
this
Saturday
ron
continued
yeah
and
the
Saturday
after
that
and
the
Saturday
after
that
sighed
Harry
and
he's
hinting
now
that
if
I
don't
get
all
the
boxes
done
by
the
end
of
term
we'll
carry
on
next
year
he
was
finding
these
detentions
particularly
irksome
because
they
cut
into
the
already
limited
time
he
could
have
been
spending
with
Ginny
indeed
he
had
frequently
won-dered
lately
whether
Snape
did
not
know
this
for
he
was
keeping
Harry
later
and
later
every
time
while
making
pointed
asides
about
Harry
having
to
miss
the
good
weather
and
the
varied
opportunities
it
offered
harry
was
shaken
from
these
bitter
reflections
by
the
appearance
at
his
side
of
Jimmy
Peakes
who
was
holding
out
a
scroll
of
parchment
thanks
Jimmy
hey
it's
from
Dumbledore
said
Harry
excitedly
unrolling
the
parchment
and
scanning
it
he
wants
me
to
go
to
his
office
as
quick
as
can
they
stared
at
each
other
blimey
whispered
Ron
you
don't
reckon
he
hasn't
found
better
go
and
see
hadn't
I
said
Harry
jumping
to
his
feet
he
hurried
out
of
the
common
room
and
along
the
seventh
floor
as
fast
as
he
could
passing
nobody
but
Peeves
who
swooped
past
in
the
opposite
direction
throwing
bits
of
chalk
at
Harry
in
a
routine
sort
of
way
and
cackling
loudly
as
he
dodged
harry's
defensive
jinx
once
Peeves
had
vanished
there
was
silence
in
the
corridors
with
only
fifteen
minutes
left
until
curfew
most
people
had
already
returned
to
their
common
rooms
and
then
Harry
heard
a
scream
and
a
crash
he
stopped
in
his
tracks
listening
how
dare
you
aaaaargh
the
noise
was
coming
from
a
corridor
nearby
Harry
sprinted
towards
it
his
wand
at
the
ready
hurtled
round
another
corner
and
saw
Professor
Trelawney
sprawled
upon
the
floor
her
head
covered
in
one
of
her
many
shawls
several
sherry
bottles
lying
beside
her
one
broken
professor
harry
hurried
forwards
and
helped
Professor
Trelawney
to
her
feet
some
of
her
glittering
beads
had
become
entangled
with
her
glasses
she
hiccoughed
loudly
patted
her
hair
and
pulled
herself
up
on
harry's
helping
arm
what
happened
Professor
you
may
well
ask
she
said
shrilly
i
was
strolling
along
brooding
upon
certain
Dark
portents
happen
to
have
glimpsed
but
Harry
was
not
paying
much
attention
he
had
just
noticed
where
they
were
standing
there
on
the
right
was
the
tapestry
of
dancing
trolls
and
on
the
left
that
smoothly
impenetrable
stretch
of
stone
wall
that
concealed
professor
were
you
trying
to
get
into
the
Room
of
Requirement
omens
I
have
been
vouchsafed
what
she
looked
suddenly
shifty
the
Room
of
Requirement
repeated
Harry
were
you
try-ing
to
get
in
there
i
well
I
didn't
know
students
knew
about
not
all
of
them
do
said
Harry
but
what
happened
you
screamed
it
sounded
as
though
you
were
hurt
i
well
said
Professor
Trelawney
drawing
her
shawls
around
her
defensively
and
staring
down
at
him
with
her
vastly
magnified
eyes
i
wished
to
ah
deposit
certain
um
personal
items
in
the
Room
and
she
muttered
something
about
nasty
accusations
right
said
Harry
glancing
down
at
the
sherry
bottles
but
you
couldn't
get
in
and
hide
them
he
found
this
very
odd
the
Room
had
opened
for
him
after
all
when
he
had
wanted
to
hide
the
Half-Blood
prince's
book
oh
I
got
in
all
right
said
Professor
Trelawney
glaring
at
the
wall
but
there
was
somebody
already
in
there
somebody
in
who
demanded
Harry
who
was
in
there
have
no
idea
said
Professor
Trelawney
looking
slightly
taken
aback
at
the
urgency
in
harry's
voice
i
walked
into
the
Room
and
I
heard
a
voice
which
has
never
happened
before
in
all
my
years
of
hiding
of
using
the
Room
I
mean
a
voice
saying
what
i
don't
know
that
it
was
saying
anything
said
Professor
Trelawney
it
was
whooping
whooping
gleefully
she
said
nodding
harry
stared
at
her
was
it
male
or
female
would
hazard
a
guess
at
male
said
Professor
Trelawney
and
it
sounded
happy
very
happy
said
Professor
Trelawney
sniffily
as
though
it
was
celebrating
most
definitely
and
then
and
then
I
called
out
who's
there
you
couldn't
have
found
out
who
it
was
without
asking
harry
asked
her
slightly
frustrated
the
Inner
Eye
said
Professor
Trelawney
with
dignity
straightening
her
shawls
and
many
strands
of
glittering
beads
was
fixed
upon
matters
well
outside
the
mundane
realms
of
whooping
voices
right
said
Harry
hastily
he
had
heard
about
Professor
trelawney's
Inner
Eye
all
too
often
before
and
did
the
voice
say
who
was
there
no
it
did
not
she
said
everything
went
pitch
black
and
the
next
thing
I
knew
I
was
being
hurled
headfirst
out
of
the
Room
and
you
didn't
see
that
coming
said
Harry
unable
to
help
himself
no
I
did
not
as
I
say
it
was
pitch
She
stopped
and
glared
at
him
suspiciously
i
think
you'd
better
tell
Professor
Dumbledore
said
Harry
he
ought
to
know
malfoy's
celebrating
I
mean
that
some-one
threw
you
out
of
the
Room
to
his
surprise
Professor
Trelawney
drew
herself
up
at
this
suggestion
looking
haughty
the
Headmaster
has
intimated
that
he
would
prefer
fewer
visits
from
me
she
said
coldly
i
am
not
one
to
press
my
company
upon
those
who
do
not
value
it
if
Dumbledore
chooses
to
ignore
the
warnings
the
cards
show
her
bony
hand
closed
suddenly
around
harry's
wrist
again
and
again
no
matter
how
I
lay
them
out
and
she
pulled
a
card
dramatically
from
underneath
her
shawls
the
lightning-struck
tower
she
whispered
calamity
disaster
coming
nearer
all
the
time
right
said
Harry
again
well
i
still
think
you
should
tell
Dumbledore
about
this
voice
and
everything
going
dark
and
being
thrown
out
of
the
Room
you
think
so
professor
Trelawney
seemed
to
consider
the
matter
for
a
moment
but
Harry
could
tell
that
she
liked
the
idea
of
retelling
her
little
adventure
i'm
going
to
see
him
right
now
said
Harry
i've
got
a
meeting
with
him
we
could
go
together
oh
well
in
that
case
said
Professor
Trelawney
with
a
smile
she
bent
down
scooped
up
her
sherry
bottles
and
dumped
them
unceremoniously
in
a
large
blue
and
white
vase
standing
in
a
nearby
niche
i
miss
having
you
in
my
classes
Harry
she
said
soulfully
as
they
set
off
together
you
were
never
much
of
a
Seer
but
you
were
a
wonderful
Object
harry
did
not
reply
he
had
loathed
being
the
Object
of
Professor
trelawney's
continual
predictions
of
doom
i
am
afraid
she
went
on
that
the
nag
i'm
sorry
the
centaur
knows
nothing
of
cartomancy
i
asked
him
one
Seer
to
another
had
he
not
too
sensed
the
distant
vibra-tions
of
coming
catastrophe
but
he
seemed
to
find
me
almost
comical
yes
comical
her
voice
rose
rather
hysterically
and
Harry
caught
a
powerful
whiff
of
sherry
even
though
the
bottles
had
been
left
behind
perhaps
the
horse
has
heard
people
say
that
I
have
not
inherited
my
great-great-grandmother's
gift
those
rumours
have
been
bandied
about
by
the
jealous
for
years
you
know
what
I
say
to
such
people
Harry
would
Dumbledore
have
let
me
teach
at
this
great
school
put
so
much
trust
in
me
all
these
years
had
I
not
proved
myself
to
him
harry
mumbled
something
indistinct
i
well
remember
my
first
interview
with
Dumbledore
went
on
Professor
Trelawney
in
throaty
tones
he
was
deeply
impressed
of
course
deeply
impressed
i
was
staying
at
the
hog's
Head
which
I
do
not
advise
incidentally
bed
bugs
dear
boy
but
funds
were
low
dumbledore
did
me
the
courtesy
of
calling
upon
me
in
my
room
at
the
inn
he
questioned
me
i
must
confess
that
at
first
I
thought
he
seemed
ill-disposed
towards
Divination
and
I
remember
I
was
starting
to
feel
a
little
odd
I
had
not
eaten
much
that
day
but
then
and
now
Harry
was
paying
attention
properly
for
the
first
time
for
he
knew
what
had
happened
then
Professor
Trelawney
had
made
the
prophecy
that
had
altered
the
course
of
his
whole
life
the
prophecy
about
him
and
Voldemort
but
then
we
were
rudely
interrupted
by
Severus
Snape
what
yes
there
was
a
commotion
outside
the
door
and
it
flew
open
and
there
was
that
rather
uncouth
barman
standing
with
Snape
who
was
waffling
about
having
come
the
wrong
way
up
the
stairs
although
i'm
afraid
that
I
myself
rather
thought
he
had
been
apprehended
eavesdropping
on
my
interview
with
Dumbledore
you
see
he
himself
was
seeking
a
job
at
the
time
and
no
doubt
hoped
to
pick
up
tips
well
after
that
you
know
Dumbledore
seemed
much
more
dis-posed
to
give
me
a
job
and
I
could
not
help
thinking
Harry
that
it
was
because
he
appreciated
the
stark
contrast
between
my
own
unassuming
manners
and
quiet
talent
compared
to
the
pushing
thrusting
young
man
who
was
prepared
to
listen
at
keyholes
Harry
dear
she
looked
back
over
her
shoulder
having
only
just
real-ised
that
Harry
was
no
longer
with
her
he
had
stopped
walking
and
they
were
now
ten
feet
from
each
other
harry
she
repeated
uncertainly
perhaps
his
face
was
white
to
make
her
look
so
concerned
and
frightened
harry
was
standing
stock-still
as
waves
of
shock
crashed
over
him
wave
after
wave
obliterating
every-thing
except
the
information
that
had
been
kept
from
him
for
so
long
it
was
Snape
who
had
overheard
the
prophecy
it
was
Snape
who
had
carried
the
news
of
the
prophecy
to
Voldemort
snape
and
Peter
Pettigrew
together
had
sent
Voldemort
hunt-ing
after
Lily
and
James
and
their
son
nothing
else
mattered
to
Harry
just
now
harry
said
Professor
Trelawney
again
harry
I
thought
we
were
going
to
see
the
Headmaster
together
you
stay
here
said
Harry
through
numb
lips
but
dear
i
was
going
to
tell
him
how
I
was
assaulted
in
the
Room
of
you
stay
here
harry
repeated
angrily
she
looked
alarmed
as
he
ran
past
her
round
the
corner
into
dumbledore's
corridor
where
the
lone
gargoyle
stood
sentry
harry
shouted
the
password
at
the
gargoyle
and
ran
up
the
moving
spiral
staircase
three
steps
at
a
time
he
did
not
knock
upon
dumbledore's
door
he
hammered
and
the
calm
voice
answered
Enter
after
Harry
had
already
flung
himself
into
the
room
fawkes
the
phoenix
looked
round
his
bright
black
eyes
gleaming
with
reflected
gold
from
the
sunset
beyond
the
window
dumbledore
was
standing
at
the
window
look-ing
out
at
the
grounds
a
long
black
travelling
cloak
in
his
arms
well
Harry
I
promised
that
you
could
come
with
me
for
a
moment
or
two
Harry
did
not
understand
the
con-versation
with
Trelawney
had
driven
everything
else
out
of
his
head
and
his
brain
seemed
to
be
moving
very
slowly
come
with
you
only
if
you
wish
it
of
course
if
I
and
then
Harry
remembered
why
he
had
been
eager
to
come
to
dumbledore's
office
in
the
first
place
you've
found
one
you've
found
a
Horcrux
i
believe
so
rage
and
resentment
fought
shock
and
excitement
for
several
moments
Harry
could
not
speak
it
is
natural
to
be
afraid
said
Dumbledore
i'm
not
scared
said
Harry
at
once
and
it
was
perfectly
true
fear
was
one
emotion
he
was
not
feeling
at
all
which
Horcrux
is
it
where
is
it
i
am
not
sure
which
it
is
though
I
think
we
can
rule
out
the
snake
but
I
believe
it
to
be
hidden
in
a
cave
on
the
coast
many
miles
from
here
a
cave
I
have
been
trying
to
locate
for
a
very
long
time
the
cave
in
which
Tom
Riddle
once
terror-ised
two
children
from
his
orphanage
on
their
annual
trip
you
remember
yes
said
Harry
how
is
it
protected
i
do
not
know
I
have
suspicions
that
may
be
entirely
wrong
dumbledore
hesitated
then
said
Harry
I
promised
you
that
you
could
come
with
me
and
I
stand
by
that
prom-ise
but
it
would
be
very
wrong
of
me
not
to
warn
you
that
this
will
be
exceedingly
dangerous
i'm
coming
said
Harry
almost
before
Dumbledore
had
finished
speaking
boiling
with
anger
at
Snape
his
desire
to
do
something
desperate
and
risky
had
increased
tenfold
in
the
last
few
minutes
this
seemed
to
show
on
harry's
face
for
Dumbledore
moved
away
from
the
window
and
looked
more
closely
at
Harry
a
slight
crease
between
his
silver
eyebrows
what
has
happened
to
you
nothing
lied
Harry
promptly
what
has
upset
you
i'm
not
upset
harry
you
were
never
a
good
Occlumens
the
word
was
the
spark
that
ignited
harry's
fury
snape
he
said
very
loudly
and
Fawkes
gave
a
soft
squawk
behind
them
snape's
what's
happened
he
told
Voldemort
about
the
prophecy
it
was
him
he
listened
outside
the
door
Trelawney
told
me
dumbledore's
expression
did
not
change
but
Harry
thought
his
face
whitened
under
the
bloody
tinge
cast
by
the
setting
sun
for
a
long
moment
Dumbledore
said
nothing
when
did
you
find
out
about
this
he
asked
at
last
just
now
said
Many
who
was
refraining
from
yelling
with
enormous
difficulty
and
then
suddenly
he
could
not
stop
himself
and
you
let
him
teach
here
and
he
told
voldemort
to
go
after
my
mum
and
dad
breathing
hard
as
though
he
were
fighting
Harry
turned
away
from
Dumbledore
who
still
had
not
moved
a
muscle
and
paced
up
and
down
the
study
rubbing
his
knuckles
in
his
hand
and
exercising
every
last
bit
of
restraint
to
prevent
himself
knocking
things
over
he
wanted
to
rage
and
storm
at
Dumbledore
but
he
also
wanted
to
go
with
him
to
try
and
destroy
the
Horcrux
he
wanted
to
tell
him
that
he
was
a
fool-ish
old
man
for
trusting
Snape
but
he
was
terrified
that
Dumbledore
would
not
take
him
along
unless
he
mastered
his
anger
harry
said
Dumbledore
quietly
please
listen
to
me
it
was
as
difficult
to
stop
his
relentless
pacing
as
to
refrain
from
shouting
harry
paused
biting
his
lip
and
looked
into
dumbledore's
lined
face
professor
Snape
made
a
terrible
don't
tell
me
it
was
a
mistake
sir
he
was
listening
at
the
door
please
let
me
finish
dumbledore
waited
until
Harry
had
nodded
curtly
then
went
on
professor
Snape
made
a
terrible
mistake
he
was
still
in
Lord
voldemort's
employ
on
the
night
he
heard
the
first
half
of
Professor
trelawney's
prophecy
naturally
he
hastened
to
tell
his
master
what
he
had
heard
for
it
concerned
his
master
most
deeply
but
he
did
not
know
he
had
no
possible
way
of
knowing
which
boy
Voldemort
would
hunt
from
then
onwards
or
that
the
parents
he
would
destroy
in
his
murderous
quest
were
people
that
Professor
Snape
knew
that
they
were
your
mother
and
father
harry
let
out
a
yell
of
mirthless
laughter
he
hated
my
dad
like
he
hated
Sirius
haven't
you
noticed
Professor
how
the
people
Snape
hates
tend
to
end
up
dead
you
have
no
idea
of
the
remorse
Professor
Snape
felt
when
he
realised
how
Lord
Voldemort
had
interpreted
the
prophecy
Harry
i
believe
it
to
be
the
greatest
regret
of
his
life
and
the
reason
that
he
returned
but
he's
a
very
good
Occlumens
isn't
he
sir
said
Harry
whose
voice
was
shaking
with
the
effort
of
keeping
it
steady
and
isn't
Voldemort
convinced
that
snape's
on
his
side
even
now
professor
how
can
you
be
sure
snape's
on
our
side
dumbledore
did
not
speak
for
a
moment
he
looked
as
though
he
was
trying
to
make
up
his
mind
about
something
at
last
he
said
I
am
sure
i
trust
Severus
Snape
completely
harry
breathed
deeply
for
a
few
moments
in
an
effort
to
steady
himself
it
did
not
work
well
I
don't
he
said
as
loudly
as
before
he's
up
to
something
with
Draco
Malfoy
right
now
right
under
your
nose
and
you
still
we
have
discussed
this
Harry
said
Dumbledore
and
now
he
sounded
stern
again
i
have
told
you
my
views
you're
leaving
the
school
tonight
and
i'll
bet
you
haven't
even
considered
that
Snape
and
Malfoy
might
decide
to
to
what
asked
Dumbledore
his
eyebrows
raised
what
is
it
that
you
suspect
them
of
doing
precisely
they're
up
to
something
said
Harry
and
his
hands
curled
into
fists
as
he
said
it
professor
Trelawney
was
just
in
the
Room
of
Requirement
trying
to
hide
her
sherry
bottles
and
she
heard
Malfoy
whooping
celebrating
he's
trying
to
mend
something
dangerous
in
there
and
if
you
ask
me
he's
fixed
it
at
last
and
you're
about
to
just
walk
out
of
school
without
enough
said
Dumbledore
he
said
it
quite
calmly
and
yet
Harry
fell
silent
at
once
he
knew
that
he
had
finally
crossed
some
invisible
line
do
you
think
that
I
have
once
left
the
school
unprotected
during
my
absences
this
year
i
have
not
tonight
when
I
leave
there
will
again
be
additional
protec-tion
in
place
please
do
not
suggest
that
I
do
not
take
the
safety
of
my
students
seriously
Harry
i
didn't
mumbled
Harry
a
little
abashed
but
Dumbledore
cut
across
him
do
not
wish
to
discuss
the
matter
any
further
harry
bit
back
his
retort
scared
that
he
had
gone
too
far
that
he
had
ruined
his
chance
of
accompanying
Dumbledore
but
Dumbledore
went
on
Do
you
wish
to
come
with
me
tonight
yes
said
Harry
at
once
very
well
then
listen
dumbledore
drew
himself
up
to
his
full
height
i
take
you
with
me
on
one
condition
that
you
obey
any
command
I
might
give
you
at
once
and
without
question
of
course
be
sure
to
understand
me
Harry
i
mean
that
you
must
follow
even
such
orders
as
run
hide
or
go
back
do
I
have
your
word
i
yes
of
course
if
tell
you
to
hide
you
will
do
so
yes
if
I
tell
you
to
flee
you
will
obey
yes
if
I
tell
you
to
leave
me
and
save
yourself
you
will
do
as
I
tell
you
i
harry
they
looked
at
each
other
for
a
moment
yes
sir
very
good
then
I
wish
you
to
go
and
fetch
your
Cloak
and
meet
me
in
the
Entrance
Hall
in
five
minutes
time
dumbledore
turned
back
to
look
out
of
the
fiery
window
the
sun
was
now
a
ruby-red
glare
along
the
horizon
harry
walked
quickly
from
the
office
and
down
the
spiral
staircase
his
mind
was
oddly
clear
all
of
a
sudden
he
knew
what
to
do
ron
and
Hermione
were
sitting
together
in
the
common
room
when
he
came
back
what
does
Dumbledore
want
hermione
said
at
once
harry
are
you
ok
she
added
anxiously
i'm
fine
said
Harry
shortly
racing
past
them
he
dashed
up
the
stairs
and
into
his
dormitory
where
he
flung
open
his
trunk
and
pulled
out
the
marauder's
Map
and
a
pair
of
balled-up
socks
then
he
sped
back
down
the
stairs
and
into
the
common
room
skidding
to
a
halt
where
Ron
and
Hermione
sat
looking
stunned
i
haven't
got
much
time
Harry
panted
Dumbledore
thinks
i'm
getting
my
Invisibility
Cloak
listen
quickly
he
told
them
where
he
was
going
and
why
he
did
not
pause
either
for
hermione's
gasps
of
horror
or
for
ron's
hasty
questions
they
could
work
out
the
finer
details
for
themselves
later
so
you
see
what
this
means
harry
finished
at
a
gallop
dumbledore
won't
be
here
tonight
so
malfoy's
going
to
have
another
clear
shot
at
whatever
he's
up
to
no
listen
to
me
he
hissed
angrily
as
both
Ron
and
Hermione
showed
every
sign
of
interrupting
i
know
it
was
Malfoy
celebrating
in
the
Room
of
Requirement
here
He
shoved
the
marauder's
Map
into
hermione's
hand
you've
got
to
watch
him
and
you've
got
to
watch
Snape
too
use
anyone
else
who
you
can
rustle
up
from
the
da
hermione
those
contact
Galleons
will
still
work
right
dumbledore
says
he's
put
extra
protection
in
the
school
but
if
snape's
involved
he'll
know
what
dumbledore's
protection
is
and
how
to
avoid
it
but
he
won't
be
expecting
you
lot
to
be
on
the
watch
will
he
harry
began
Hermione
her
eyes
huge
with
fear
haven't
got
time
to
argue
said
Harry
curtly
take
this
as
well
He
thrust
the
socks
into
ron's
hands
thanks
said
Ron
er
why
do
I
need
socks
you
need
what's
wrapped
in
them
it's
the
Felix
Felicis
share
it
between
yourselves
and
Ginny
too
say
goodbye
to
her
from
me
i'd
better
go
dumbledore's
waiting
no
said
Hermione
as
Ron
unwrapped
the
tiny
little
bottle
of
golden
potion
looking
awestruck
we
don't
want
it
you
take
it
who
knows
what
you're
going
to
be
facing
i'Il
be
fine
i'll
be
with
Dumbledore
said
Harry
i
want
to
know
you
lot
are
ok
don't
look
like
that
Hermione
i'll
see
you
later
and
he
was
off
hurrying
back
through
the
portrait
hole
towards
the
Entrance
Hall
dumbledore
was
waiting
beside
the
oaken
front
doors
he
turned
as
Harry
came
skidding
out
on
to
the
topmost
stone
step
panting
hard
a
searing
stitch
in
his
side
i
would
like
you
to
wear
your
Cloak
please
said
Dumbledore
and
he
waited
until
Harry
had
thrown
it
on
before
saying
Very
good
shall
we
go
dumbledore
set
off
at
once
down
the
stone
steps
his
own
travelling
cloak
barely
stirring
in
the
still
summer
air
harry
hurried
alongside
him
under
the
Invisibility
Cloak
still
pant-ing
and
sweating
rather
a
lot
but
what
will
people
think
when
they
see
you
leaving
Professor
harry
asked
his
mind
on
Malfoy
and
Snape
that
I
am
off
into
Hogsmeade
for
a
drink
said
Dumbledore
lightly
i
sometimes
offer
Rosmerta
my
custom
or
else
visit
the
hog's
Head
or
I
appear
to
it
is
as
good
a
way
as
any
of
disguising
one's
true
destination
they
made
their
way
down
the
drive
in
the
gathering
twi-light
the
air
was
full
of
the
smells
of
warm
grass
lake
water
and
wood
smoke
from
hagrid's
cabin
it
was
difficult
to
believe
that
they
were
heading
for
anything
dangerous
or
frightening
professor
said
Harry
quietly
as
the
gates
at
the
bottom
of
the
drive
came
into
view
will
we
be
Apparating
yes
said
Dumbledore
you
can
Apparate
now
I
believe
yes
said
Harry
but
I
haven't
got
a
licence
he
felt
it
best
to
be
honest
what
if
he
spoiled
everything
by
turning
up
a
hundred
miles
from
where
he
was
supposed
to
go
no
matter
said
Dumbledore
I
can
assist
you
again
they
turned
out
of
the
gates
into
the
twilit
deserted
lane
to
Hogsmeade
darkness
descended
fast
as
they
walked
and
by
the
time
they
reached
the
High
Street
night
was
falling
in
earnest
lights
twinkled
from
windows
over
shops
and
as
they
neared
the
Three
Broomsticks
they
heard
raucous
shouting
and
stay
out
shouted
Madam
Rosmerta
forcibly
ejecting
a
grubby-looking
wizard
oh
hello
Albus
you're
out
late
good
evening
Rosmerta
good
evening
forgive
me
i'm
off
to
the
hog's
Head
no
offence
but
I
feel
like
a
quieter
atmosphere
tonight
a
minute
later
they
turned
the
corner
into
the
side
street
where
the
hog's
head's
sign
creaked
a
little
though
there
was
no
breeze
in
contrast
to
the
Three
Broomsticks
the
pub
appeared
to
be
completely
empty
it
will
not
be
necessary
for
us
to
enter
muttered
Dumbledore
glancing
around
as
long
as
nobody
sees
us
go
now
place
your
hand
upon
my
arm
Harry
there
is
no
need
to
grip
too
hard
I
am
merely
guiding
you
on
the
count
of
three
one
two
three
harry
turned
at
once
there
was
that
horrible
sensation
that
he
was
being
squeezed
through
a
thick
rubber
tube
he
could
not
draw
breath
every
part
of
him
was
being
com-pressed
almost
past
endurance
and
then
just
when
he
thought
he
must
suffocate
the
invisible
bands
seemed
to
burst
open
and
he
was
standing
in
cool
darkness
breathing
in
lungfuls
of
fresh
salty
air
chapter
The
Cave
harry
could
smell
salt
and
hear
rushing
waves
a
light
chilly
breeze
ruffled
his
hair
as
he
looked
out
at
moon-lit
sea
and
star-strewn
sky
he
was
standing
upon
a
high
outcrop
of
dark
rock
water
foaming
and
churning
below
him
he
glanced
over
his
shoulder
a
towering
cliff
stood
behind
them
a
sheer
drop
black
and
faceless
a
few
large
chunks
of
rock
such
as
the
one
upon
which
Harry
and
Dumbledore
were
standing
looked
as
though
they
had
broken
away
from
the
cliff
face
at
some
point
in
the
past
it
was
a
bleak
harsh
view
the
sea
and
the
rock
unrelieved
by
any
tree
or
sweep
of
grass
or
sand
what
do
you
think
asked
Dumbledore
he
might
have
been
asking
harry's
opinion
on
whether
it
was
a
good
site
for
a
picnic
they
brought
the
kids
from
the
orphanage
here
asked
Harry
who
could
not
imagine
a
less
cozy
spot
for
a
day
trip
not
here
precisely
said
Dumbledore
there
is
a
village
of
sorts
about
halfway
along
the
cliffs
behind
us
i
believe
the
orphans
were
taken
there
for
a
little
sea
air
and
a
view
of
the
waves
no
I
think
it
was
only
ever
Tom
Riddle
and
his
youthful
victims
who
visited
this
spot
no
Muggle
could
reach
this
rock
unless
they
were
uncommonly
good
mountaineers
and
boats
cannot
approach
the
cliffs
the
waters
around
them
are
too
dangerous
i
imagine
that
Riddle
climbed
down
magic
would
have
served
better
than
ropes
and
he
brought
two
small
children
with
him
probably
for
the
pleasure
of
terrorizing
them
i
think
the
journey
alone
would
have
done
it
don't
you
harry
looked
up
at
the
cliff
again
and
felt
goose
bumps
but
his
final
destination
and
ours
lies
a
little
farther
on
come
dumbledore
beckoned
Harry
to
the
very
edge
of
the
rock
where
a
series
of
jagged
niches
made
footholds
leading
down
to
boulders
that
lay
half-submerged
in
water
and
closer
to
the
cliff
it
was
a
treacherous
descent
and
Dumbledore
hampered
slightly
by
his
withered
hand
moved
slowly
the
lower
rocks
were
slippery
with
seawater
harry
could
feel
flecks
of
cold
salt
spray
hitting
his
face
lumos
said
Dumbledore
as
he
reached
the
boulder
closest
to
the
cliff
face
a
thousand
flecks
of
golden
light
sparkled
upon
the
dark
surface
of
the
water
a
few
feet
below
where
he
crouched
the
black
wall
of
rock
beside
him
was
illuminated
too
you
see
said
Dumbledore
quietly
holding
his
wand
a
little
higher
harry
saw
a
fissure
in
the
cliff
into
which
dark
water
was
swirling
you
will
not
object
to
getting
a
little
wet
no
said
Harry
then
take
off
your
Invisibility
Cloak
there
is
no
need
for
it
now
and
let
us
take
the
plunge
And
with
the
sudden
agility
of
a
much
younger
man
dumble-dore
slid
from
the
boulder
landed
in
the
sea
and
began
to
swim
with
a
perfect
breaststroke
toward
the
dark
slit
in
the
rock
face
his
lit
wand
held
in
his
teeth
harry
pulled
off
his
cloak
stuffed
it
into
his
pocket
and
followed
the
water
was
icy
harry's
waterlogged
clothes
billowed
around
him
and
weighed
him
down
taking
deep
breaths
that
filled
his
nostrils
with
the
tang
of
salt
and
seaweed
he
struck
out
for
the
shimmering
shrinking
light
now
moving
deeper
into
the
cliff
the
fissure
soon
opened
into
a
dark
tunnel
that
Harry
could
tell
would
be
filled
with
water
at
high
tide
the
slimy
walls
were
barely
three
feet
apart
and
glimmered
like
wet
tar
in
the
passing
light
of
dumbledore's
wand
a
little
way
in
the
passageway
curved
to
the
left
and
Harry
saw
that
it
extended
far
into
the
cliff
he
continued
to
swim
in
dumbledore's
wake
the
tips
of
his
benumbed
fingers
brushing
the
rough
wet
rock
then
he
saw
Dumbledore
rising
out
of
the
water
ahead
his
sil-ver
hair
and
dark
robes
gleaming
when
Harry
reached
the
spot
he
found
steps
that
led
into
a
large
cave
he
clambered
up
them
water
streaming
from
his
soaking
clothes
and
emerged
shivering
uncontrollably
into
the
still
and
freezing
air
dumbledore
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
cave
his
wand
held
high
as
he
turned
slowly
on
the
spot
examining
the
walls
and
ceiling
yes
this
is
the
place
said
Dumbledore
how
can
you
tell
harry
spoke
in
a
whisper
it
has
known
magic
said
Dumbledore
simply
harry
could
not
tell
whether
the
shivers
he
was
experiencing
were
due
to
his
spine-deep
coldness
or
to
the
same
awareness
of
enchantments
he
watched
as
Dumbledore
continued
to
revolve
on
the
spot
evidently
concentrating
on
things
Harry
could
not
see
this
is
merely
the
antechamber
the
entrance
hall
said
Dumbledore
after
a
moment
or
two
we
need
to
penetrate
the
inner
place
now
it
is
Lord
voldemort's
obstacles
that
stand
in
our
way
rather
than
those
nature
made
dumbledore
approached
the
wall
of
the
cave
and
caressed
it
with
his
blackened
fingertips
murmuring
words
in
a
strange
tongue
that
Harry
did
not
understand
twice
Dumbledore
walked
right
around
the
cave
touching
as
much
of
the
rough
rock
as
he
could
occasionally
pausing
running
his
fingers
backward
and
for-ward
over
a
particular
spot
until
finally
he
stopped
his
hand
pressed
flat
against
the
wall
here
he
said
we
go
on
through
here
the
entrance
is
con-cealed
harry
did
not
ask
how
Dumbledore
knew
he
had
never
seen
a
wizard
work
things
out
like
this
simply
by
looking
and
touching
but
Harry
had
long
since
learned
that
bangs
and
smoke
were
more
often
the
marks
of
ineptitude
than
expertise
dumbledore
stepped
back
from
the
cave
wall
and
pointed
his
wand
at
the
rock
for
a
moment
an
arched
outline
appeared
there
blazing
white
as
though
there
was
a
powerful
light
behind
the
crack
you've
d-done
it
said
Harry
through
chattering
teeth
but
before
the
words
had
left
his
lips
the
outline
had
gone
leaving
the
rock
as
bare
and
solid
as
ever
dumbledore
looked
around
harry
i'm
so
sorry
I
forgot
he
said
he
now
pointed
his
wand
at
Harry
and
at
once
harry's
clothes
were
as
warm
and
dry
as
if
they
had
been
hanging
in
front
of
a
blazing
fire
thank
you
said
Harry
gratefully
but
Dumbledore
had
al-ready
turned
his
attention
back
to
the
solid
cave
wall
he
did
not
try
any
more
magic
but
simply
stood
there
staring
at
it
intently
as
though
something
extremely
interesting
was
written
on
it
harry
stayed
quite
still
he
did
not
want
to
break
Dumbledores
concen-tration
then
after
two
solid
minutes
Dumbledore
said
quietly
Oh
surely
not
so
crude
what
is
it
Professor
i
rather
think
said
Dumbledore
putting
his
uninjured
hand
inside
his
robes
and
drawing
out
a
short
silver
knife
of
the
kind
Harry
used
to
chop
potion
ingredients
that
we
are
required
to
make
payment
to
pass
payment
said
Harry
you've
got
to
give
the
door
something
yes
said
Dumbledore
blood
if
I
am
not
much
mistaken
blood
i
said
it
was
crude
said
Dumbledore
who
sounded
disdainful
even
disappointed
as
though
Voldemort
had
fallen
short
of
higher
standards
Dumbledore
expected
the
idea
as
I
am
sure
you
will
have
gathered
is
that
your
enemy
must
weaken
him
or
herself
to
enter
once
again
Lord
Voldemort
fails
to
grasp
that
there
are
much
more
terrible
things
than
physical
injury
yeah
but
still
if
you
can
avoid
it
said
Harry
who
had
ex-perienced
enough
pain
not
to
be
keen
for
more
sometimes
however
it
is
unavoidable
said
Dumbledore
shaking
back
the
sleeve
of
his
robes
and
exposing
the
forearm
of
his
injured
hand
professor
protested
Harry
hurrying
forward
as
Dumbledore
raised
his
knife
i'll
do
it
i'm
He
did
not
know
what
he
was
going
to
say
younger
fitter
but
Dumbledore
merely
smiled
there
was
a
flash
of
silver
and
a
spurt
of
scarlet
the
rock
face
was
peppered
with
dark
glistening
drops
you
are
very
kind
Harry
said
Dumbledore
now
passing
the
tip
of
his
wand
over
the
deep
cut
he
had
made
in
his
own
arm
so
that
it
healed
instantly
just
as
Snape
had
healed
malfoy's
wound
But
your
blood
is
worth
more
than
mine
ah
that
seems
to
have
done
the
trick
doesn't
it
the
blazing
silver
outline
of
an
arch
had
appeared
in
the
wall
once
more
and
this
time
it
did
not
fade
away
The
blood-spattered
rock
within
it
simply
vanished
leaving
an
opening
into
what
seemed
total
darkness
after
me
I
think
said
Dumbledore
and
he
walked
through
the
archway
with
Harry
on
his
heels
lighting
his
own
wand
hastily
as
he
went
an
eerie
sight
met
their
eyes
They
were
standing
on
the
edge
of
a
great
black
lake
so
vast
that
Harry
could
not
make
out
the
distant
banks
in
a
cavern
so
high
that
the
ceiling
too
was
out
of
sight
a
misty
greenish
light
shone
far
away
in
what
looked
like
the
mid-dle
of
the
lake
it
was
reflected
in
the
completely
still
water
below
the
greenish
glow
and
the
light
from
the
two
wands
were
the
only
things
that
broke
the
otherwise
velvety
blackness
though
their
rays
did
not
penetrate
as
far
as
Harry
would
have
expected
the
dark-ness
was
somehow
denser
than
normal
darkness
let
us
walk
said
Dumbledore
quietly
be
very
careful
not
to
step
into
the
water
stay
close
to
me
he
set
off
around
the
edge
of
the
lake
and
Harry
followed
close
behind
him
their
footsteps
made
echoing
slapping
sounds
on
the
narrow
rim
of
rock
that
surrounded
the
water
on
and
on
they
walked
but
the
view
did
not
vary
on
one
side
of
them
the
rough
cavern
wall
on
the
other
the
boundless
expanse
of
smooth
glassy
blackness
in
the
very
middle
of
which
was
that
mysterious
greenish
glow
harry
found
the
place
and
the
silence
oppressive
unnerving
professor
he
said
finally
do
you
think
the
Horcrux
is
here
oh
yes
said
Dumbledore
yes
i'm
sure
it
is
the
question
is
how
do
we
get
to
it
we
couldn't
we
couldn't
just
try
a
Summoning
Charm
harry
said
sure
that
it
was
a
stupid
suggestion
but
he
was
much
keener
than
he
was
prepared
to
admit
on
getting
out
of
this
place
as
soon
as
possible
certainly
we
could
said
Dumbledore
stopping
so
suddenly
that
Harry
almost
walked
into
him
why
don't
you
do
it
me
oh
okay
harry
had
not
expected
this
but
cleared
his
throat
and
said
loudly
wand
aloft
Accio
Horcrux
with
a
noise
like
an
explosion
something
very
large
and
pale
erupted
out
of
the
dark
water
some
twenty
feet
away
before
Harry
could
see
what
it
was
it
had
vanished
again
with
a
crashing
splash
that
made
great
deep
ripples
on
the
mirrored
surface
harry
leapt
backward
in
shock
and
hit
the
wall
his
heart
was
still
thundering
as
he
turned
to
Dumbledore
what
was
that
something
I
think
that
is
ready
to
respond
should
we
attempt
to
seize
the
Horcrux
harry
looked
back
at
the
water
the
surface
of
the
lake
was
once
more
shining
black
glass
The
ripples
had
vanished
unnaturally
fast
harry's
heart
however
was
still
pounding
did
you
think
that
would
happen
sir
i
thought
something
would
happen
if
we
made
an
obvious
at-tempt
to
get
our
hands
on
the
Horcrux
that
was
a
very
good
idea
Harry
much
the
simplest
way
of
finding
out
what
we
are
facing
but
we
don't
know
what
the
thing
was
said
Harry
looking
at
the
sinisterly
smooth
water
what
the
things
are
you
mean
said
Dumbledore
i
doubt
very
much
that
there
is
only
one
of
them
shall
we
walk
on
professor
yes
Harry
do
you
think
we're
going
to
have
to
go
into
the
lake
into
it
only
if
we
are
very
unfortunate
you
don't
think
the
Horcrux
is
at
the
bottom
oh
no
i
think
the
Horcrux
is
in
the
middle
and
Dumbledore
pointed
toward
the
misty
green
light
in
the
center
of
the
lake
so
we're
going
to
have
to
cross
the
lake
to
get
to
it
yes
I
think
so
harry
did
not
say
anything
his
thoughts
were
all
of
water
mon-sters
of
giant
serpents
of
demons
kelpies
and
sprites
aha
said
Dumbledore
and
he
stopped
again
this
time
Harry
really
did
walk
into
him
for
a
moment
he
toppled
on
the
edge
of
the
dark
water
and
dumbledore's
uninjured
hand
closed
tightly
around
his
upper
arm
pulling
him
back
so
sorry
Harry
I
should
have
given
warning
stand
back
against
the
wall
please
I
think
I
have
found
the
place
harry
had
no
idea
what
Dumbledore
meant
this
patch
of
dark
bank
was
exactly
like
every
other
bit
as
far
as
he
could
tell
but
Dumbledore
seemed
to
have
detected
something
special
about
it
this
time
he
was
running
his
hand
not
over
the
rocky
wall
but
t
hrough
the
thin
air
as
though
expecting
to
find
and
grip
some-thing
invisible
oho
said
Dumbledore
happily
seconds
later
his
hand
had
closed
in
midair
upon
something
Harry
could
not
see
dumble-dore
moved
closer
to
the
water
Harry
watched
nervously
as
the
tips
of
dumbledore's
buckled
shoes
found
the
utmost
edge
of
the
rock
rim
keeping
his
hand
clenched
in
midair
Dumbledore
raised
his
wand
with
the
other
and
tapped
his
fist
with
the
point
immediately
a
thick
coppery
green
chain
appeared
out
of
thin
air
extending
from
the
depths
of
the
water
into
dumbledore's
clenched
hand
dumbledore
tapped
the
chain
which
began
to
slide
through
his
fist
like
a
snake
coiling
itself
on
the
ground
with
a
clinking
sound
that
echoed
noisily
off
the
rocky
walls
pulling
something
from
the
depths
of
the
black
water
harry
gasped
as
the
ghostly
prow
of
a
tiny
boat
broke
the
surface
glowing
as
green
as
the
chain
and
floated
with
barely
a
ripple
toward
the
place
on
the
bank
where
Harry
and
Dumbledore
stood
how
did
you
know
that
was
there
harry
asked
in
astonish-ment
magic
always
leaves
traces
said
Dumbledore
as
the
boat
hit
the
bank
with
a
gentle
bump
sometimes
very
distinctive
traces
i
taught
Tom
Riddle
i
know
his
style
is
is
this
boat
safe
oh
yes
I
think
so
voldemort
needed
to
create
a
means
to
cross
the
lake
without
attracting
the
wrath
of
those
creatures
he
had
placed
within
it
in
case
he
ever
wanted
to
visit
or
remove
his
Horcrux
so
the
things
in
the
water
won't
do
anything
to
us
if
we
cross
in
voldemort's
boat
i
think
we
must
resign
ourselves
to
the
fact
that
they
will
at
some
point
realize
we
are
not
Lord
Voldemort
thus
far
however
we
have
done
well
they
have
allowed
us
to
raise
the
boat
but
why
have
they
let
us
asked
Harry
who
could
not
shake
off
the
vision
of
tentacles
rising
out
of
the
dark
water
the
moment
they
were
out
of
sight
of
the
bank
voldemort
would
have
been
reasonably
confident
that
none
but
a
very
great
wizard
would
have
been
able
to
find
the
boat
said
Dumbledore
i
think
he
would
have
been
prepared
to
risk
what
was
to
his
mind
the
most
unlikely
possibility
that
somebody
else
would
find
it
knowing
that
he
had
set
other
obstacles
ahead
that
only
he
would
be
able
to
penetrate
we
shall
see
whether
he
was
right
harry
looked
down
into
the
boat
it
really
was
very
small
it
doesn't
look
like
it
was
built
for
two
people
will
it
hold
both
of
us
will
we
be
too
heavy
together
dumbledore
chuckled
voldemort
will
not
have
cared
about
the
weight
but
about
the
amount
of
magical
power
that
crossed
his
lake
i
rather
think
an
enchantment
will
have
been
placed
upon
this
boat
so
that
only
one
wizard
at
a
time
will
be
able
to
sail
in
it
but
then
i
do
not
think
you
will
count
Harry
You
are
underage
and
un-qualified
voldemort
would
never
have
expected
a
sixteen-year-old
to
reach
this
place
I
think
it
unlikely
that
your
powers
will
register
compared
to
mine
these
words
did
nothing
to
raise
Harrys
morale
perhaps
Dumbledore
knew
it
for
he
added
voldemort's
mistake
Harry
voldemort's
mistake
age
is
foolish
and
forgetful
when
it
underestimates
youth
now
you
first
this
time
and
be
careful
not
to
touch
the
water
dumbledore
stood
aside
and
Harry
climbed
carefully
into
the
boat
dumbledore
stepped
in
too
coiling
the
chain
onto
the
floor
they
were
crammed
in
together
Harry
could
not
comfortably
sit
but
crouched
his
knees
jutting
over
the
edge
of
the
boat
which
be-gan
to
move
at
once
there
was
no
sound
other
than
the
silken
rus-tle
of
the
boat's
prow
cleaving
the
water
it
moved
without
their
help
as
though
an
invisible
rope
was
pulling
it
onward
toward
the
light
in
the
center
soon
they
could
no
longer
see
the
walls
of
the
cavern
they
might
have
been
at
sea
except
that
there
were
no
waves
harry
looked
down
and
saw
the
reflected
gold
of
his
wandlight
sparkling
and
glittering
on
the
black
water
as
they
passed
the
boat
was
carving
deep
ripples
upon
the
glassy
surface
grooves
in
the
dark
mirror
and
then
Harry
saw
it
marble
white
floating
inches
below
the
surface
professor
he
said
and
his
startled
voice
echoed
loudly
over
the
silent
water
harry
i
think
I
saw
a
hand
in
the
water
a
human
hand
yes
I
am
sure
you
did
said
Dumbledore
calmly
harry
stared
down
into
the
water
looking
for
the
vanished
hand
and
a
sick
feeling
rose
in
his
throat
so
that
thing
that
jumped
out
of
the
water
but
Harry
had
his
answer
before
Dumbledore
could
reply
the
wandlight
had
slid
over
a
fresh
patch
of
water
and
showed
him
this
time
a
dead
man
lying
faceup
inches
beneath
the
surface
his
open
eyes
misted
as
though
with
cobwebs
his
hair
and
his
robes
swirling
around
him
like
smoke
there
are
bodies
in
here
said
Harry
and
his
voice
sounded
much
higher
than
usual
and
most
unlike
his
own
yes
said
Dumbledore
placidly
but
we
do
not
need
to
worry
about
them
at
the
moment
at
the
moment
harry
repeated
tearing
his
gaze
from
the
water
to
look
at
Dumbledore
not
while
they
are
merely
drifting
peacefully
below
us
said
Dumbledore
there
is
nothing
to
be
feared
from
a
body
Harry
any
more
than
there
is
anything
to
be
feared
from
the
darkness
lord
Voldemort
who
of
course
secretly
fears
both
disagrees
but
once
again
he
reveals
his
own
lack
of
wisdom
it
is
the
unknown
we
fear
when
we
look
upon
death
and
darkness
nothing
more
harry
said
nothing
he
did
not
want
to
argue
but
he
found
the
idea
that
there
were
bodies
floating
around
them
and
beneath
them
horrible
and
what
was
more
he
did
not
believe
that
they
were
not
dangerous
but
one
of
them
jumped
he
said
trying
to
make
his
voice
as
level
and
calm
as
dumbledore's
when
I
tried
to
Summon
the
Horcrux
a
body
leapt
out
of
the
lake
yes
said
Dumbledore
i
am
sure
that
once
we
take
the
Horcrux
we
shall
find
them
less
peaceable
however
like
many
creatures
that
dwell
in
cold
and
darkness
they
fear
light
and
warmth
which
we
shall
therefore
call
to
our
aid
should
the
need
arise
fire
Harry
Dumbledore
added
with
a
smile
in
response
to
harry's
bewildered
expression
oh
right
said
Harry
quickly
he
turned
his
head
to
look
at
the
greenish
glow
toward
which
the
boat
was
still
inexorably
sailing
he
could
not
pretend
now
that
he
was
not
scared
the
great
black
lake
teeming
with
the
dead
it
seemed
hours
and
hours
ago
that
he
had
met
Professor
Trelawney
that
he
had
given
Ron
and
Hermione
Felix
Felicis
he
suddenly
wished
he
had
said
a
better
good-bye
to
them
and
he
hadn't
seen
Ginny
at
all
nearly
there
said
Dumbledore
cheerfully
sure
enough
the
greenish
light
seemed
to
be
growing
larger
at
last
and
within
minutes
the
boat
had
come
to
a
halt
bumping
gently
into
something
that
Harry
could
not
see
at
first
but
when
he
raised
his
illuminated
wand
he
saw
that
they
had
reached
a
small
island
of
smooth
rock
in
the
center
of
the
lake
careful
not
to
touch
the
water
said
Dumbledore
again
as
Harry
climbed
out
of
the
boat
the
island
was
no
larger
than
dumbledore's
office
an
expanse
of
flat
dark
stone
on
which
stood
nothing
but
the
source
of
that
greenish
light
which
looked
much
brighter
when
viewed
close
to
harry
squinted
at
it
at
first
he
thought
it
was
a
lamp
of
some
kind
but
then
he
saw
that
the
light
was
coming
from
a
stone
basin
rather
like
the
Pensieve
which
was
set
on
top
of
a
pedestal
dumbledore
approached
the
basin
and
Harry
followed
side
by
side
they
looked
down
into
it
the
basin
was
full
of
an
emerald
liq-uid
emitting
that
phosphorescent
glow
what
is
it
asked
Harry
quietly
i
am
not
sure
said
Dumbledore
something
more
worrisome
than
blood
and
bodies
however
dumbledore
pushed
back
the
sleeve
of
his
robe
over
his
black-ened
hand
and
stretched
out
the
tips
of
his
burned
fingers
toward
the
surface
of
the
potion
sir
no
don't
touch
i
cannot
touch
said
Dumbledore
smiling
faintly
see
i
cannot
approach
any
nearer
than
this
you
try
staring
Harry
put
his
hand
into
the
basin
and
attempted
to
touch
the
potion
he
met
an
invisible
barrier
that
prevented
him
coming
within
an
inch
of
it
no
matter
how
hard
he
pushed
his
fingers
encountered
nothing
but
what
seemed
to
be
solid
and
flexible
air
out
of
the
way
please
Harry
said
Dumbledore
he
raised
his
wand
and
made
complicated
movements
over
the
surface
of
the-potion
murmuring
soundlessly
nothing
happened
except
per
haps
that
the
potion
glowed
a
little
brighter
harry
remained
silent
while
Dumbledore
worked
but
after
a
while
Dumbledore
with-drew
his
wand
and
Harry
felt
it
was
safe
to
talk
again
you
think
the
Horcrux
is
in
there
sir
oh
yes
dumbledore
peered
more
closely
into
the
basin
harry
saw
his
face
reflected
upside
down
in
the
smooth
surface
of
the
green
potion
but
how
to
reach
it
this
potion
cannot
be
pen-etrated
by
hand
Vanished
parted
scooped
up
or
siphoned
away
nor
can
it
be
Transfigured
Charmed
or
otherwise
made
to
change
its
nature
almost
absentmindedly
Dumbledore
raised
his
wand
again
twirled
it
once
in
midair
and
then
caught
the
crystal
goblet
that
he
had
conjured
out
of
nowhere
i
can
only
conclude
that
this
potion
is
supposed
to
be
drunk
what
said
Harry
no
yes
I
think
so
Only
by
drinking
it
can
I
empty
the
basin
and
see
what
lies
in
its
depths
but
what
if
what
if
it
kills
you
oh
I
doubt
that
it
would
work
like
that
said
Dumbledore
easily
lord
Voldemort
would
not
want
to
kill
the
person
who
reached
this
island
harry
couldn't
believe
it
was
this
more
of
dumbledore's
insane
determination
to
see
good
in
everyone
sir
said
Harry
trying
to
keep
his
voice
reasonable
sir
this
is
Voldemort
we're
i'm
sorry
Harry
I
should
have
said
he
would
not
want
to
im-mediately
kill
the
person
who
reached
this
island
Dumbledore
corrected
himself
he
would
want
to
keep
them
alive
long
enough
to
find
out
how
they
managed
to
penetrate
so
far
through
his
de-fenses
and
most
importantly
of
all
why
they
were
so
intent
upon
emptying
the
basin
do
not
forget
that
Lord
Voldemort
believes
that
he
alone
knows
about
his
Horcruxes
harry
made
to
speak
again
but
this
time
Dumbledore
raised
his
hand
for
silence
frowning
slightly
at
the
emerald
liquid
evidently
thinking
hard
undoubtedly
he
said
finally
this
potion
must
act
in
a
way
that
will
prevent
me
taking
the
Horcrux
it
might
paralyze
me
cause
me
to
forget
what
I
am
here
for
create
so
much
pain
I
am
dis-tracted
or
render
me
incapable
in
some
other
way
this
being
the
case
Harry
it
will
be
your
job
to
make
sure
I
keep
drinking
even
if
you
have
to
tip
the
potion
into
my
protesting
mouth
you
understand
their
eyes
met
over
the
basin
each
pale
face
lit
with
that
strange
green
light
harry
did
not
speak
was
this
why
he
had
been
invited
along
so
that
he
could
force-feed
Dumbledore
a
potion
that
might
cause
him
unendurable
pain
you
remember
said
Dumbledore
the
condition
on
which
I
brought
you
with
me
harry
hesitated
looking
into
the
blue
eyes
that
had
turned
green
in
the
reflected
light
of
the
basin
but
what
if
you
swore
did
you
not
to
follow
any
command
I
gave
you
yes
but
i
warned
you
did
I
not
that
there
might
be
danger
yes
said
Harry
but
well
then
said
Dumbledore
shaking
back
his
sleeves
once
more
and
raising
the
empty
goblet
you
have
my
orders
why
can't
I
drink
the
potion
instead
asked
Harry
desperately
because
I
am
much
older
much
cleverer
and
much
less
valuable
said
Dumbledore
once
and
for
all
Harry
do
I
have
your
word
that
you
will
do
all
in
your
power
to
make
me
keep
drinking
couldn't
do
I
have
it
but
your
word
Harry
i
all
right
but
before
Harry
could
make
any
further
protest
Dumbledore
low-ered
the
crystal
goblet
into
the
potion
for
a
split
second
Harry
hoped
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
touch
the
potion
with
the
gob-let
but
the
crystal
sank
into
the
surface
as
nothing
else
had
when
the
glass
was
full
to
the
brim
Dumbledore
lifted
it
to
his
mouth
your
good
health
Harry
and
he
drained
the
goblet
harry
watched
terrified
his
hands
gripping
the
rim
of
the
basin
so
hard
that
his
fingertips
were
numb
professor
he
said
anxiously
as
Dumbledore
lowered
the
empty
glass
how
do
you
feel
dumbledore
shook
his
head
his
eyes
closed
harry
wondered
whether
he
was
in
pain
dumbledore
plunged
the
glass
blindly
back
into
the
basin
refilled
it
and
drank
once
more
in
silence
Dumbledore
drank
three
gobletsful
of
the
potion
then
halfway
through
the
fourth
goblet
he
staggered
and
fell
for-ward
against
the
basin
his
eyes
were
still
closed
his
breathing
heavy
professor
Dumbledore
said
Harry
his
voice
strained
can
you
hear
me
dumbledore
did
not
answer
his
face
was
twitching
as
though
he
was
deeply
asleep
but
dreaming
a
horrible
dream
his
grip
on
the
goblet
was
slackening
the
potion
was
about
to
spill
from
it
harry
reached
forward
and
grasped
the
crystal
cup
holding
it
steady
professor
can
you
hear
me
he
repeated
loudly
his
voice
echo-ing
around
the
cavern
dumbledore
panted
and
then
spoke
in
a
voice
Harry
did
not
recognize
for
he
had
never
heard
Dumbledore
frightened
like
this
i
don't
want
don't
make
me
harry
stared
into
the
whitened
face
he
knew
so
well
at
the
crooked
nose
and
half-moon
spectacles
and
did
not
know
what
to
do
don't
like
want

stop
moaned
Dumbledore

Professor
said
Harry
you've
got
to
keep
drinking
remember
you
told
me
you
had
to
keep
drinking
here
hating
himself
repulsed
by
what
he
was
doing
Harry
forced
the
goblet
back
toward
dumbledore's
mouth
and
tipped
it
so
that
Dumbledore
drank
the
remainder
of
the
potion
inside
no
he
groaned
as
Harry
lowered
the
goblet
back
into
the
basin
and
refilled
it
for
him
i
don't
want
to
i
don't
want
to
let
me
go
its
all
right
Professor
said
Harry
his
hand
shaking
its
all
right
i'm

it
stop
make
it
stop
moaned
Dumbledore

make
it
stop
lied
Harry
he
tipped
the
con-tents
of
the
goblet
into
dumbledore's
open
mouth
dumbledore
screamed
the
noise
echoed
all
around
the
vast
chamber
across
the
dead
black
water
no
no
no
no
I
can't
I
can't
don't
make
me
I
don't
warn
to
it's
all
right
Professor
it's
all
right
said
Harry
loudly
his
hands
shaking
so
badly
he
could
hardly
scoop
up
the
sixth
goblei
ful
of
potion
the
basin
was
now
half
empty
nothing's
happening
to
you
you're
safe
it
isn't
real
I
swear
it
isn't
real
take
this
now
take
this
and
obediently
Dumbledore
drank
as
though
it
was
an
anti-dote
Harry
offered
him
but
upon
draining
the
goblet
he
sank
to
his
knees
shaking
uncontrollably
its
all
my
fault
all
my
fault
he
sobbed
please
make
it
stop
I
know
I
did
wrong
oh
please
make
it
stop
and
i'll
never
never
again
this
will
make
it
stop
Professor
Harry
said
his
voice
crack-ing
as
he
tipped
the
seventh
glass
of
potion
into
dumbledore's
mouth
dumbledore
began
to
cower
as
though
invisible
torturers
sur-rounded
him
his
flailing
hand
almost
knocked
the
refilled
goblet
from
harry's
trembling
hands
as
he
moaned
don't
hurt
them
don't
hurt
them
please
please
its
my
fault
hurt
me
instead
here
drink
this
drink
this
you'll
be
all
right
said
Harry
des-perately
and
once
again
Dumbledore
obeyed
him
opening
his
mouth
even
as
he
kept
his
eyes
tight
shut
and
shook
from
head
to
foot
and
now
he
fell
forward
screaming
again
hammering
his
fists
upon
the
ground
while
Harry
filled
the
ninth
goblet
please
please
please
no
not
that
not
that
i'll
do
any-thing
just
drink
Professor
just
drink
dumbledore
drank
like
a
child
dying
of
thirst
but
when
he
had
finished
he
yelled
again
as
though
his
insides
were
on
fire
no
more
please
no
more
harry
scooped
up
a
tenth
gobletful
of
potion
and
felt
the
crystal
scrape
the
bottom
of
the
basin
we're
nearly
there
Professor
drink
this
drink
it
he
supported
dumbledore's
shoulders
and
again
Dumbledore
drained
the
glass
then
Harry
was
on
his
feet
once
more
refilling
the
goblet
as
Dumbledore
began
to
scream
in
more
anguish
than
ever
I
want
to
die
i
want
to
die
make
it
stop
make
it
stop
I
want
to
die
drink
this
Professor
drink
this
dumbledore
drank
and
no
sooner
had
he
finished
than
he
yelled
kill
me
this
this
one
will
gasped
Harry
just
drink
this
it'll
be
over
all
over
dumbledore
gulped
at
the
goblet
drained
every
last
drop
and
then
with
a
great
rattling
gasp
rolled
over
onto
his
face
no
shouted
Harry
who
had
stood
to
refill
the
goblet
again
instead
he
dropped
the
cup
into
the
basin
flung
himself
down
beside
Dumbledore
and
heaved
him
over
onto
his
back
dumbledore's
glasses
were
askew
his
mouth
agape
his
eyes
closed
no.
said
Harry
shaking
Dumbledore
no
you're
not
dead
you
said
it
wasn't
poison
wake
up
wake
up
Rennervate
he
cried
his
wand
pointing
at
Dumbledores
chest
there
was
a
flash
of
red
light
but
nothing
happened
rennervate
sir
please
dumbledores
eyelids
flickered
harry's
heart
leapt
Sir
are
you
water
croaked
Dumbledore
water
panted
Harry
yes
He
leapt
to
his
feet
and
seized
the
goblet
he
had
dropped
in
the
basin
he
barely
registered
the
golden
locket
lying
curled
beneath
it
aguamenti
he
shouted
jabbing
the
goblet
with
his
wand
the
goblet
filled
with
clear
water
Harry
dropped
to
his
knees
beside
Dumbledore
raised
his
head
and
brought
the
glass
to
his
lips
but
it
was
empty
dumbledore
groaned
and
began
to
pant
but
I
had
some
wait
Aguamenti
said
Harry
again
pointing
his
wand
at
the
goblet
once
more
for
a
second
clear
wa-ter
gleamed
within
it
but
as
he
approached
Dumbledores
mouth
the
water
vanished
again
sir
i'm
trying
i'm
trying
said
Harry
desperately
but
he
did
not
think
that
Dumbledore
could
hear
him
he
had
rolled
onto
his
side
and
was
drawing
great
rattling
breaths
that
sounded
agoniz-ing
aguamenti
Aguamenti
aguamenti
the
goblet
filled
and
emptied
once
more
and
now
dumble-dores
breathing
was
fading
his
brain
whirling
in
panic
Harry
knew
instinctively
the
only
way
left
to
get
water
because
Voldemort
had
planned
it
so
he
flung
himself
over
to
the
edge
of
the
rock
and
plunged
the
goblet
into
the
lake
bringing
it
up
full
to
the
brim
of
icy
water
that
did
not
vanish
sir
here
harry
yelled
and
lunging
forward
he
tipped
the
water
clumsily
over
Dumbledores
face
it
was
the
best
he
could
do
for
the
icy
feeling
on
his
arm
not
holding
the
cup
was
not
the
lingering
chill
of
the
water
a
slimy
white
hand
had
gripped
his
wrist
and
the
creature
to
whom
it
be-longed
was
pulling
him
slowly
backward
across
the
rock
the
sur-face
of
the
lake
was
no
longer
mirror-smooth
it
was
churning
and
everywhere
Harry
looked
white
heads
and
hands
were
emerging
from
the
dark
water
men
and
women
and
children
with
sunken
sightless
eyes
were
moving
toward
the
rock
an
army
of
the
dead
rising
from
the
black
water
petrificus
Totalus
yelled
Harry
struggling
to
cling
to
the
smooth
soaked
surface
of
the
island
as
he
pointed
his
wand
at
the
Inferius
that
had
his
arm
it
released
him
falling
backward
into
the
water
with
a
splash
he
scrambled
to
his
feet
but
many
more
Inferi
were
already
climbing
onto
the
rock
their
bony
hands
clawing
at
its
slippery
surface
their
blank
frosted
eyes
upon
him
trailing
waterlogged
rags
sunken
faces
leering
petrificus
Totalus
harry
bellowed
again
backing
away
as
he
swiped
his
wand
through
the
air
six
or
seven
of
them
crumpled
but
more
were
coming
toward
him
impedimenta
incarcerous
a
few
of
them
stumbled
one
or
two
of
them
bound
in
ropes
but
those
climbing
onto
the
rock
behind
them
merely
stepped
over
or
on
the
fallen
bodies
still
slashing
at
the
air
with
his
wand
Harry
yelled
Sectumsempra
sectumsempra
but
though
gashes
appeared
in
their
sodden
rags
and
their
icy
skin
they
had
no
blood
to
spill
They
walked
on
unfeeling
their
shrunken
hands
outstretched
toward
him
and
as
he
backed
away
still
farther
he
felt
arms
enclose
him
from
behind
thin
fleshlcv
arms
cold
as
death
and
his
feet
left
the
ground
as
they
lifted
him
and
began
to
carry
him
slowly
and
surely
back
to
the
water
anil
he
knew
there
would
be
no
release
that
he
would
be
drowned
and
become
one
more
dead
guardian
of
a
fragment
of
Voldemorts
shattered
soul
but
then
through
the
darkness
fire
erupted
crimson
and
gold
a
ring
of
fire
that
surrounded
the
rock
so
that
the
Inferi
holding
Harry
so
tightly
stumbled
and
faltered
they
did
not
dare
pass
through
the
flames
to
get
to
the
water
they
dropped
Harry
he
hit
the
ground
slipped
on
the
rock
and
fell
grazing
his
arms
then
scrambled
back
up
raising
his
wand
and
staring
around
dumbledore
was
on
his
feet
again
pale
as
any
of
the
surround-ing
Inferi
but
taller
than
any
too
the
fire
dancing
in
his
eyes
his
wand
was
raised
like
a
torch
and
from
its
tip
emanated
the
flames
like
a
vast
lasso
encircling
them
all
with
warmth
the
Inferi
bumped
into
each
other
attempting
blindly
to
es-cape
the
fire
in
which
they
were
enclosed
dumbledore
scooped
the
locket
from
the
bottom
of
the
stone
basin
and
stowed
it
inside
his
robes
wordlessly
he
gestured
to
Harry
to
come
to
his
side
distracted
by
the
flames
the
Inferi
seemed
unaware
that
their
quarry
was
leaving
as
Dumbledore
led
Harry
back
to
the
boat
the
ring
of
fire
moving
with
them
around
them
the
bewildered
Inferi
accompanying
them
to
the
waters
edge
where
they
slipped
gratefully
back
into
their
dark
waters
harry
who
was
shaking
all
over
thought
for
a
moment
that
Dumbledore
might
not
be
able
to
climb
into
the
boat
he
staggered
a
little
as
he
attempted
it
all
his
efforts
seemed
to
be
going
into
maintaining
the
ring
of
protective
flame
around
them
harry
seized
him
and
helped
him
back
to
his
seat
once
they
were
both
safely
jammed
inside
again
the
boat
began
to
move
back
across
the
black
water
away
from
the
rock
still
encircled
by
that
ring
of
fire
and
it
seemed
that
the
Inferi
swarming
below
them
did
not
dare
resurface
sir
panted
Harry
sir
I
forgot
about
fire
they
were
coming
at
me
and
I
panicked
quite
understandable
murmured
Dumbledore
harry
was
alarmed
to
hear
how
faint
his
voice
was
they
reached
the
bank
with
a
little
bump
and
Harry
leapt
out
then
turned
quickly
to
help
Dumbledore
the
moment
that
dum-bledore
reached
the
bank
he
let
his
wand
hand
fall
the
ring
of
fire
vanished
but
the
Inferi
did
not
emerge
again
from
the
water
the
little
boat
sank
into
the
water
once
more
clanking
and
tinkling
its
chain
slithered
back
into
the
lake
too
dumbledore
gave
a
great
sigh
and
leaned
against
the
cavern
wall
i
am
weak
he
said
don't
worry
sir
said
Harry
at
once
anxious
about
dumbledore's
extreme
pallor
and
by
his
air
of
exhaustion
don't
worry
i'll
get
us
back
lean
on
me
sir
and
pulling
dumbledore's
uninjured
arm
around
his
shoulders
Harry
guided
his
headmaster
back
around
the
lake
bearing
most
of
his
weight
the
protection
was
after
all
well-designed
said
dum-bledore
faintly
one
alone
could
not
have
done
it
you
did
well
very
well
Harry
don't
talk
now
said
Harry
fearing
how
slurred
dumbledore's
voice
had
become
how
much
his
feet
dragged
save
your
energy
sir
we'll
soon
be
out
of
here
the
archway
will
have
sealed
again
my
knife
there's
no
need
I
got
cut
on
the
rock
said
Harry
firmly
just
tell
me
where
here
harry
wiped
his
grazed
forearm
upon
the
stone
Having
re-ceived
its
tribute
of
blood
the
archway
reopened
instantly
they
crossed
the
outer
cave
and
Harry
helped
Dumbledore
back
into
the
icy
seawater
that
filled
the
crevice
in
the
cliff
it's
going
to
be
all
right
sir
Harry
said
over
and
over
again
more
worried
by
dumbledore's
silence
than
he
had
been
by
his
weakened
voice
we're
nearly
there
i
can
Apparate
us
both
back
don't
worry
i
am
not
worried
Harry
said
Dumbledore
his
voice
a
little
stronger
despite
the
freezing
water
i
am
with
you
chapter
The
Lightning-Struck
Tower
once
back
under
the
starry
sky
Harry
heaved
Dumbledore
on
to
the
top
of
the
nearest
boulder
and
then
to
his
feet
sodden
and
shivering
dumbledore's
weight
still
upon
him
Harry
con
centrated
harder
than
he
had
ever
done
upon
his
destination
Hogsmeade
closing
his
eyes
gripping
dumbledore's
arm
as
tightly
as
he
could
he
stepped
forwards
into
that
feeling
of
horrible
compression
he
knew
it
had
worked
before
he
opened
his
eyes
the
smell
of
salt
the
sea
breeze
had
gone
he
and
Dumbledore
were
shivering
and
dripping
in
the
middle
of
the
dark
High
Street
in
Hogsmeade
for
one
horrible
moment
harry's
imagination
showed
him
more
Inferi
creeping
towards
him
around
the
sides
of
shops
but
he
blinked
and
saw
that
noth-ing
was
stirring
all
was
still
the
darkness
complete
but
for
a
few
streetlamps
and
lit
upper
windows
we
did
it
Professor
harry
whispered
with
difficulty
he
suddenly
realised
that
he
had
a
searing
stitch
in
his
chest
we
did
it
we
got
the
Horcrux
dumbledore
staggered
against
him
for
a
moment
Harry
thought
that
his
inexpert
Apparition
had
thrown
Dumbledore
off-balance
then
he
saw
his
face
paler
and
damper
than
ever
in
the
distant
light
of
a
streetlamp
sir
are
you
all
right
i've
been
better
said
Dumbledore
weakly
though
the
corners
of
his
mouth
twitched
that
potion
was
no
health
drink
and
to
harry's
horror
Dumbledore
sank
on
to
the
ground
sir
it's
ok
sir
you're
going
to
be
all
right
don't
worry
he
looked
around
desperately
for
help
but
there
was
nobody
to
be
seen
and
all
he
could
think
was
that
he
must
somehow
get
Dumbledore
quickly
to
the
hospital
wing
we
need
to
get
you
up
to
the
school
sir
madam
Pomfrey
no
said
Dumbledore
it
is
professor
Snape
whom
I
need
but
I
do
not
think
i
can
walk
very
far
just
yet
right
sir
listen
i'm
going
to
knock
on
a
door
find
a
place
you
can
stay
then
I
can
run
and
get
Madam
severus
said
Dumbledore
clearly
i
need
Severus
all
right
then
Snape
but
i'm
going
to
have
to
leave
you
for
a
moment
so
I
can
before
Harry
could
make
a
move
however
he
heard
run
ning
footsteps
his
heart
leapt
somebody
had
seen
somebody
knew
they
needed
help
and
looking
around
he
saw
Madam
Rosmerta
scurrying
down
the
dark
street
towards
them
on
high-heeled
fluffy
slippers
wearing
a
silk
dressing-gown
embroidered
with
dragons
i
saw
you
Apparate
as
I
was
pulling
my
bedroom
curtains
thank
goodness
thank
goodness
I
couldn't
think
what
to
but
what's
wrong
with
Albus
she
came
to
a
halt
panting
and
stared
down
wide-eyed
at
Dumbledore
he's
hurt
said
Harry
madam
Rosmerta
can
he
come
into
the
Three
Broomsticks
while
I
go
up
to
the
school
and
get
help
for
him
you
can't
go
up
there
alone
don't
you
realise
haven't
you
seen
if
you
help
me
support
him
said
Harry
not
listening
to
her
I
think
we
can
get
him
inside
what
has
happened
asked
Dumbledore
rosmerta
what's
wrong
the
the
Dark
Mark
Albus
and
she
pointed
into
the
sky
in
the
direction
of
Hogwarts
dread
flooded
Harry
at
the
sound
of
the
words
he
turned
and
looked
there
it
was
hanging
in
the
sky
above
the
school
the
blaz
ing
green
skull
with
a
serpent
tongue
the
mark
Death
Eaters
left
behind
whenever
they
had
entered
a
building
wherever
they
had
murdered
when
did
it
appear
asked
Dumbledore
and
his
hand
clenched
painfully
upon
harry's
shoulder
as
he
struggled
to
his
feet
must
have
been
minutes
ago
it
wasn't
there
when
I
put
the
cat
out
but
when
I
got
upstairs
we
need
to
return
to
the
castle
at
once
said
Dumbledore
rosmerta
and
though
he
staggered
a
little
he
seemed
wholly
in
command
of
the
situation
we
need
transport
brooms
i've
got
a
couple
behind
the
bar
she
said
looking
very
frightened
shall
I
run
and
fetch
no
Harry
can
do
it
harry
raised
his
wand
at
once
accio
rosmerta's
brooms
a
second
later
they
heard
a
loud
bang
as
the
front
door
of
the
pub
burst
open
two
brooms
had
shot
out
into
the
street
and
were
racing
each
other
to
harry's
side
where
they
stopped
dead
quivering
slightly
at
waist
height
rosmerta
please
send
a
message
to
the
Ministry
said
Dumbledore
as
he
mounted
the
broom
nearest
him
it
might
be
that
nobody
within
Hogwarts
has
yet
realised
anything
is
wrong
harry
put
on
your
Invisibility
Cloak
harry
pulled
his
Cloak
out
of
his
pocket
and
threw
it
over
himself
before
mounting
his
broom
Madam
Rosmerta
was
already
tottering
back
towards
her
pub
as
Harry
and
dumble-dore
kicked
off
from
the
ground
and
rose
up
into
the
air
as
they
sped
towards
the
castle
Harry
glanced
sideways
at
Dumbledore
ready
to
grab
him
should
he
fall
but
the
sight
of
the
Dark
Mark
seemed
to
have
acted
upon
Dumbledore
like
a
stimulant
he
was
bent
low
over
his
broom
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
Mark
his
long
silver
hair
and
beard
flying
behind
him
in
the
night
air
and
Harry
too
looked
ahead
at
the
skull
and
fear
swelled
inside
him
like
a
venomous
bubble
compressing
his
lungs
driving
all
other
discomfort
from
his
mind
how
long
had
they
been
away
had
Ron
Hermione
and
ginny's
luck
run
out
by
now
was
it
one
of
them
who
had
caused
the
Mark
to
be
set
over
the
school
or
was
it
Neville
or
Luna
or
some
other
member
of
the
da
and
if
it
was
he
was
the
one
who
had
told
them
to
patrol
the
corridors
he
had
asked
them
to
leave
the
safety
of
their
beds
would
he
be
responsible
again
for
the
death
of
a
friend
as
they
flew
over
the
dark
twisting
lane
down
which
they
had
walked
earlier
Harry
heard
over
the
whistling
of
the
night
air
in
his
ears
Dumbledore
muttering
in
some
strange
language
again
he
thought
he
understood
why
as
he
felt
his
broom
shudder
for
a
moment
when
they
flew
over
the
bound-ary
wall
into
the
grounds
Dumbledore
was
undoing
the
enchantments
he
himself
had
set
around
the
castle
so
that
they
could
enter
at
speed
the
Dark
Mark
was
glittering
directly
above
the
Astronomy
Tower
the
highest
of
the
castle
did
that
mean
the
death
had
occurred
there
dumbledore
had
already
crossed
the
crenellated
ramparts
and
was
dismounting
Harry
landed
next
to
him
seconds
later
and
looked
around
the
ramparts
were
deserted
the
door
to
the
spiral
staircase
that
led
back
into
the
castle
was
closed
there
was
no
sign
of
a
struggle
of
a
fight
to
the
death
of
a
body
what
does
it
mean
harry
asked
Dumbledore
looking
up
at
the
green
skull
with
its
serpent's
tongue
glinting
evilly
above
them
is
it
the
real
Mark
has
someone
definitely
been
Professor
in
the
dim
green
glow
from
the
Mark
Harry
saw
dumble-dore
clutching
at
his
chest
with
his
blackened
hand
go
and
wake
Severus
said
Dumbledore
faintly
but
clearly
tell
him
what
has
happened
and
bring
him
to
me
do
noth
ing
else
speak
to
nobody
else
and
do
not
remove
your
Cloak
i
shall
wait
here
but
you
swore
to
obey
me
Harry
go
harry
hurried
over
to
the
door
leading
to
the
spiral
stair-case
but
his
hand
had
only
just
closed
upon
the
iron
ring
of
the
door
when
he
heard
running
footsteps
on
the
other
side
he
looked
round
at
Dumbledore
who
gestured
to
him
to
retreat
harry
backed
away
drawing
his
wand
as
he
did
so
the
door
burst
open
and
somebody
erupted
through
it
and
shouted
Expelliarmus
harry's
body
became
instantly
rigid
and
immobile
and
he
felt
himself
fall
back
against
the
Tower
wall
propped
like
an
unsteady
statue
unable
to
move
or
speak
he
could
not
understand
how
it
had
happened
Expelliarmus
was
not
a
Freezing
Charm
then
by
the
light
of
the
Mark
he
saw
dumbledore's
wand
flying
in
an
arc
over
the
edge
of
the
ramparts
and
under-stood
dumbledore
had
wordlessly
immobilised
Harry
and
the
second
he
had
taken
to
perform
the
spell
had
cost
him
the
chance
of
defending
himself
standing
against
the
ramparts
very
white
in
the
face
Dumbledore
still
showed
no
sign
of
panic
or
distress
he
merely
looked
across
at
his
disarmer
and
said
Good
evening
Draco
malfoy
stepped
forwards
glancing
around
quickly
to
check
that
he
and
Dumbledore
were
alone
his
eyes
fell
upon
the
second
broom
who
else
is
here
a
question
might
ask
you
or
are
you
acting
alone
harry
saw
malfoy's
pale
eyes
shift
back
to
Dumbledore
in
the
greenish
glare
of
the
Mark
no
he
said
i've
got
back-up
there
are
Death
Eaters
here
in
your
school
tonight
well
well
said
Dumbledore
as
though
Malfoy
was
show
ing
him
an
ambitious
homework
project
very
good
indeed
you
found
a
way
to
let
them
in
did
you
yeah
said
Malfoy
who
was
panting
right
under
your
nose
and
you
never
realised
ingenious
said
Dumbledore
yet
forgive
me
where
are
they
now
you
seem
unsupported
they
met
some
of
your
guard
they're
having
a
fight
down
below
they
won't
be
long
i
came
on
ahead
i
i've
got
a
job
to
do
well
then
you
must
get
on
and
do
it
my
dear
boy
said
Dumbledore
softly
there
was
silence
harry
stood
imprisoned
within
his
own
invisible
paralysed
body
staring
at
the
two
of
them
his
ears
straining
to
hear
sounds
of
the
Death
Eaters
distant
fight
and
in
front
of
him
Draco
Malfoy
did
nothing
but
stare
at
Albus
Dumbledore
who
incredibly
smiled
draco
Draco
you
are
not
a
killer
how
do
you
know
said
Malfoy
at
once
he
seemed
to
realise
how
childish
the
words
had
sounded
Harry
saw
him
flush
in
the
mark's
greenish
light
you
don't
know
what
i'm
capable
of
said
Malfoy
more
forcefully
you
don't
know
what
i've
done
oh
yes
I
do
said
Dumbledore
mildly
you
almost
killed
Katie
Bell
and
Ronald
Weasley
you
have
been
trying
with
increasing
desperation
to
kill
me
all
year
forgive
me
Draco
but
they
have
been
feeble
attempts
so
feeble
to
be
honest
that
I
wonder
whether
your
heart
has
been
really
in
it
it
has
been
in
it
said
Malfoy
vehemently
i've
been
work
ing
on
it
all
year
and
tonight
somewhere
in
the
depths
of
the
castle
below
Harry
heard
a
muffled
yell
malfoy
stiffened
and
glanced
over
his
shoulder
somebody
is
putting
up
a
good
fight
said
Dumbledore
conversationally
but
you
were
saying
yes
you
have
man-aged
to
introduce
Death
Eaters
into
my
school
which
I
admit
I
thought
impossible
how
did
you
do
it
but
Malfoy
said
nothing
he
was
still
listening
to
whatever
was
happening
below
and
seemed
almost
as
paralysed
as
Harry
was
perhaps
you
ought
to
get
on
with
the
job
alone
suggested
Dumbledore
what
if
your
back-up
has
been
thwarted
by
my
guard
as
you
have
perhaps
realised
there
are
members
of
the
Order
of
the
Phoenix
here
tonight
too
and
after
all
you
don't
really
need
help
i
have
no
wand
at
the
moment
i
cannot
defend
myself
malfoy
merely
stared
at
him
i
see
said
Dumbledore
kindly
when
Malfoy
neither
moved
nor
spoke
you
are
afraid
to
act
until
they
join
you
i'm
not
afraid
snarled
Malfoy
though
he
still
made
no
move
to
hurt
Dumbledore
it's
you
who
should
be
scared
but
why
i
don't
think
you
will
kill
me
Draco
killing
is
not
nearly
as
easy
as
the
innocent
believe
so
tell
me
while
we
wait
for
your
friends
how
did
you
smuggle
them
in
here
it
seems
to
have
taken
you
a
long
time
to
work
out
how
to
do
it
malfoy
looked
as
though
he
was
fighting
down
the
urge
to
shout
or
to
vomit
he
gulped
and
took
several
deep
breaths
glaring
at
Dumbledore
his
wand
pointing
directly
at
the
latter's
heart
then
as
though
he
could
not
help
himself
he
said
had
to
mend
that
broken
Vanishing
Cabinet
that
no
one's
used
for
years
the
one
Montague
got
lost
in
last
year
aaaah
dumbledore's
sigh
was
half
a
groan
he
closed
his
eyes
for
a
moment
that
was
clever
there
is
a
pair
I
take
it
the
other's
in
Borgin
and
Burkes
said
Malfoy
and
they
make
a
kind
of
passage
between
them
montague
told
me
that
when
he
was
stuck
in
the
Hogwarts
one
he
was
trapped
in
limbo
but
sometimes
he
could
hear
what
was
going
on
at
school
and
sometimes
what
was
going
on
in
the
shop
as
if
the
Cabinet
was
travelling
between
them
but
he
couldn't
make
anyone
hear
him
in
the
end
he
managed
to
Apparate
out
even
though
he'd
never
passed
his
test
he
nearly
died
doing
it
everyone
thought
it
was
a
really
good
story
but
I
was
the
only
one
who
realised
what
it
meant
even
Borgin
didn't
know
was
the
one
who
realised
there
could
be
a
way
into
Hogwarts
through
the
Cabinets
if
I
fixed
the
broken
one
very
good
murmured
Dumbledore
so
the
Death
Eaters
were
able
to
pass
from
Borgin
and
Burkes
into
the
school
to
help
you
a
clever
plan
a
very
clever
plan
and
as
you
say
right
under
my
nose
yeah
said
Malfoy
who
bizarrely
seemed
to
draw
courage
and
comfort
from
dumbledore's
praise
yeah
it
was
but
there
were
times
Dumbledore
went
on
weren't
there
when
you
were
not
sure
you
would
succeed
in
mending
the
Cabinet
and
you
resorted
to
crude
and
badly
judged
meas-ures
such
as
sending
me
a
cursed
necklace
that
was
bound
to
reach
the
wrong
hands
poisoning
mead
there
was
only
the
slightest
chance
I
might
drink
yeah
well
you
still
didn't
realise
who
was
behind
that
stuff
did
you
sneered
Malfoy
as
Dumbledore
slid
a
little
down
the
ramparts
the
strength
in
his
legs
apparently
fading
and
Harry
struggled
fruitlessly
mutely
against
the
enchantment
binding
him
as
a
matter
of
fact
I
did
said
Dumbledore
i
was
sure
it
was
you
why
didn't
you
stop
me
then
malfoy
demanded
i
tried
Draco
professor
Snape
has
been
keeping
watch
over
you
on
my
orders
he
hasn't
been
doing
your
orders
he
promised
my
mother
of
course
that
is
what
he
would
tell
you
Draco
but
he's
a
double-agent
you
stupid
old
man
he
isn't
working
for
you
you
just
think
he
is
we
must
agree
to
differ
on
that
Draco
it
so
happens
that
I
trust
Professor
Snape
well
you're
losing
your
grip
then
sneered
Malfoy
he's
been
offering
me
plenty
of
help
wanting
all
the
glory
for
himself
wanting
a
bit
of
the
action
What
are
you
doing
did
you
do
the
necklace
that
was
stupid
it
could
have
blown
everything
But
I
haven't
told
him
what
i've
been
doing
in
the
Room
of
Requirement
he's
going
to
wake
up
tomorrow
and
it'll
all
be
over
and
he
won't
be
the
Dark
lord's
favourite
any
more
he'll
be
nothing
compared
to
me
nothing
very
gratifying
said
Dumbledore
mildly
we
all
like
appreciation
for
our
own
hard
work
of
course
but
you
must
have
had
an
accomplice
all
the
same
someone
in
Hogsmeade
someone
who
was
able
to
slip
Katie
the
the
aaaah
dumbledore
closed
his
eyes
again
and
nodded
as
though
he
was
about
to
fall
asleep
of
course
rosmerta
how
long
has
she
been
under
the
Imperius
Curse
got
there
at
last
have
you
malfoy
taunted
there
was
another
yell
from
below
rather
louder
than
the
last
malfoy
looked
nervously
over
his
shoulder
again
then
back
at
Dumbledore
who
went
on
So
poor
Rosmerta
was
forced
to
lurk
in
her
own
bathroom
and
pass
that
necklace
to
any
Hogwarts
student
who
entered
the
room
unaccompanied
and
the
poisoned
mead
well
naturally
Rosmerta
was
able
to
poison
it
for
you
before
she
sent
the
bottle
to
Slughorn
believing
that
it
was
to
be
my
Christmas
present
yes
very
neat
very
neat
poor
Mr
Filch
would
not
of
course
think
to
check
a
bottle
of
rosmerta's
tell
me
how
have
you
been
communicating
with
Rosmerta
i
thought
we
had
all
methods
of
communication
in
and
out
of
the
school
monitored
enchanted
coins
said
Malfoy
as
though
he
was
compelled
to
keep
talking
though
his
wand
hand
was
shaking
badly
i
had
one
and
she
had
the
other
and
could
send
her
messages
isn't
that
the
secret
method
of
communication
the
group
that
called
themselves
dumbledore's
Army
used
last
year
asked
Dumbledore
his
voice
was
light
and
conversational
but
Harry
saw
him
slip
an
inch
lower
down
the
wall
as
he
said
it
yeah
I
got
the
idea
from
them
said
Malfoy
with
a
twisted
smile
i
got
the
idea
of
poisoning
the
mead
from
the
Mudblood
Granger
as
well
I
heard
her
talking
in
the
library
about
Filch
not
recognising
potions
hogsmeade
someone
who
was
able
to
slip
Katie
the
the
aaaah
dumbledore
closed
his
eyes
again
and
nodded
as
though
he
was
about
to

rosmerta
how

please
do
not
use
that
offensive
word
in
front
of
me
said
Dumbledore
malfoy
gave
a
harsh
laugh
you
care
about
me
saying
Mudblood
when
i'm
about
to
kill
you
yes
I
do
said
Dumbledore
and
Harry
saw
his
feet
slide
a
little
on
the
floor
as
he
struggled
to
remain
upright
but
as
for
being
about
to
kill
me
Draco
you
have
had
several
long
minutes
now
we
are
quite
alone
i
am
more
defenceless
than
you
can
have
dreamed
of
finding
me
and
still
you
have
not
acted
malfoy's
mouth
contorted
involuntarily
as
though
he
had
tasted
something
very
bitter
now
about
tonight
Dumbledore
went
on
I
am
a
little
puzzled
about
how
it
happened
you
knew
that
I
had
left
the
school
but
of
course
he
answered
his
own
question
Rosmerta
saw
me
leaving
she
tipped
you
off
using
your
ingenious
coins
i'm
sure
that's
right
said
Malfoy
but
she
said
you
were
just
going
for
a
drink
you'd
be
back
well
I
certainly
did
have
a
drink
and
I
came
back
after
a
fashion
mumbled
Dumbledore
so
you
decided
to
spring
a
trap
for
me
we
decided
to
put
the
Dark
Mark
over
the
Tower
and
get
you
to
hurry
up
here
to
see
who'd
been
killed
said
Malfoy
and
it
worked
well
yes
and
no
said
Dumbledore
but
am
I
to
take
it
then
that
nobody
has
been
murdered
someone's
dead
said
Malfoy
and
his
voice
seemed
to
go
up
an
octave
as
he
said
it
one
of
your
people
i
don't
know
who
it
was
dark
i
stepped
over
the
body
i
was
supposed
to
be
waiting
up
here
when
you
got
back
only
your
Phoenix
lot
got
in
the
way
yes
they
do
that
said
Dumbledore
there
was
a
bang
and
shouts
from
below
louder
than
ever
it
sounded
as
though
people
were
fighting
on
the
actual
spiral
staircase
that
led
to
where
Dumbledore
Malfoy
and
Harry
stood
and
harry's
heart
thundered
unheard
in
his
invisible
chest
someone
was
dead
malfoy
had
stepped
over
the
body
but
who
was
it
there
is
little
time
one
way
or
another
said
Dumbledore
so
let
us
discuss
your
options
Draco
my
options
said
Malfoy
loudly
i'm
standing
here
with
a
wand
i'm
about
to
kill
you
my
dear
boy
let
us
have
no
more
pretence
about
that
if
you
were
going
to
kill
me
you
would
have
done
it
when
you
first
Disarmed
me
you
would
not
have
stopped
for
this
pleasant
chat
about
ways
and
means
i
haven't
got
any
options
said
Malfoy
and
he
was
sud
denly
as
white
as
Dumbledore
i've
got
to
do
it
he'll
kill
me
he'll
kill
my
whole
family
i
appreciate
the
difficulty
of
your
position
said
Dumbledore
why
else
do
you
think
I
have
not
confronted
you
before
now
because
I
knew
that
you
would
have
been
murdered
if
Lord
Voldemort
realised
that
I
suspected
you
malfoy
winced
at
the
sound
of
the
name
i
did
not
dare
speak
to
you
of
the
mission
with
which
I
knew
you
had
been
entrusted
in
case
he
used
Legilimency
against
you
continued
Dumbledore
but
now
at
last
we
can
speak
plainly
to
each
other
no
harm
has
been
done
you
have
hurt
nobody
though
you
are
very
lucky
that
your
unintentional
victims
survived
i
can
help
you
Draco
no
you
can't
said
Malfoy
his
wand
hand
shaking
very
badly
indeed
nobody
can
he
told
me
to
do
it
or
he'll
kill
me
i've
got
no
choice
come
over
to
the
right
side
Draco
and
we
can
hide
you
more
completely
than
you
can
possibly
imagine
what
is
more
I
can
send
members
of
the
Order
to
your
mother
tonight
to
hide
her
likewise
your
father
is
safe
at
the
moment
in
Azkaban
when
the
time
comes
we
can
protect
him
too
come
over
to
the
right
side
Draco
you
are
not
a
killer
malfoy
stared
at
Dumbledore
but
I
got
this
far
didn't
I
he
said
slowly
they
thought
i'd
die
in
the
attempt
but
i'm
here
and
you're
in
my
power
i'm
the
one
with
the
wand
you're
at
my
mercy
no
Draco
said
Dumbledore
quietly
it
is
my
mercy
and
not
yours
that
matters
now
malfoy
did
not
speak
his
mouth
was
open
his
wand
hand
still
trembling
harry
thought
he
saw
it
drop
by
a
fraction
but
suddenly
footsteps
were
thundering
up
the
stairs
and
a
second
later
Malfoy
was
buffeted
out
of
the
way
as
four
people
in
black
robes
burst
through
the
door
on
to
the
ram-parts
still
paralysed
his
eyes
staring
unblinkingly
Harry
gazed
in
terror
upon
four
strangers
it
seemed
the
Death
Eaters
had
won
the
fight
below
a
lumpy-looking
man
with
an
odd
lopsided
leer
gave
a
wheezy
giggle
dumbledore
cornered
he
said
and
he
turned
to
a
stocky
little
woman
who
looked
as
though
she
could
be
his
sister
and
who
was
grinning
eagerly
dumbledore
wandless
Dumbledore
alone
well
done
Draco
well
done
good
evening
Amycus
said
Dumbledore
calmly
as
though
welcoming
the
man
to
a
tea
party
and
you've
brought
Alecto
too
charming
the
woman
gave
an
angry
little
titter
think
your
little
jokes'll
help
you
on
your
death
bed
then
she
jeered
jokes
no
no
these
are
manners
replied
Dumbledore
do
it
said
the
stranger
standing
nearest
to
Harry
a
big
rangy
man
with
matted
grey
hair
and
whiskers
whose
black
Death
eater's
robes
looked
uncomfortably
tight
he
had
a
voice
like
none
that
Harry
had
ever
heard
a
rasping
bark
of
a
voice
harry
could
smell
a
powerful
mixture
of
dirt
sweat
and
unmistakeably
of
blood
coming
from
him
his
filthy
hands
had
long
yellowish
nails
is
that
you
Fenrir
asked
Dumbledore
that's
right
rasped
the
other
pleased
to
see
me
Dumbledore
no
I
cannot
say
that
I
am
fenrir
Greyback
grinned
showing
pointed
teeth
blood
trickled
down
his
chin
and
he
licked
his
lips
slowly
obscenely
but
you
know
how
much
I
like
kids
Dumbledore
am
I
to
take
it
that
you
are
attacking
even
without
the
full
moon
now
this
is
most
unusual
you
have
developed
a
taste
for
human
flesh
that
cannot
be
satisfied
once
a
month
that's
right
said
Greyback
shocks
you
that
does
it
Dumbledore
frightens
you
well
I
cannot
pretend
it
does
not
disgust
me
a
little
said
Dumbledore
and
yes
I
am
a
little
shocked
that
Draco
here
invited
you
of
all
people
into
the
school
where
his
friends
live
i
didn't
breathed
Malfoy
he
was
not
looking
at
Greyback
he
did
not
seem
to
want
to
even
glance
at
him
i
didn't
know
he
was
going
to
come
i
wouldn't
want
to
miss
a
trip
to
Hogwarts
Dumbledore
rasped
Greyback
not
when
there
are
throats
to
be
ripped
out
delicious
delicious
and
he
raised
a
yellow
fingernail
and
picked
at
his
front
teeth
leering
at
Dumbledore
could
do
you
for
afters
Dumbledore
no
said
the
fourth
Death
Eater
sharply
he
had
a
heavy
brutal-looking
face
we've
got
orders
draco's
got
to
do
it
now
Draco
and
quickly
malfoy
was
showing
less
resolution
than
ever
he
looked
terrified
as
he
stared
into
dumbledore's
face
which
was
even
paler
and
rather
lower
than
usual
as
he
had
slid
so
far
down
the
rampart
wall
he's
not
long
for
this
world
anyway
if
you
ask
me
said
the
lopsided
man
to
the
accompaniment
of
his
sister's
wheezing
giggles
look
at
him
what's
happened
to
you
then
Dumby
oh
weaker
resistance
slower
reflexes
Amycus
said
Dumbledore
old
age
in
short
one
day
perhaps
it
will
happen
to
you
if
you
are
lucky
what's
that
mean
then
what's
that
mean
yelled
the
Death
Eater
suddenly
violent
always
the
same
weren't
yeh
Dumby
talking
and
doing
nothing
nothing
I
don't
even
know
why
the
Dark
lord's
bothering
to
kill
yeh
come
on
Draco
do
it
but
at
that
moment
there
were
renewed
sounds
of
scuffling
from
below
and
a
voice
shouted
they've
blocked
the
stairs
Reducto
reducto
harry's
heart
leapt
so
these
four
had
not
eliminated
all
opposition
but
merely
broken
through
the
fight
to
the
top
of
the
Tower
and
by
the
sound
of
it
created
a
barrier
behind
them
now
Draco
quickly
said
the
brutal-faced
man
angrily
but
malfoy's
hand
was
shaking
so
badly
that
he
could
barely
aim
til
do
it
snarled
Greyback
moving
towards
Dumbledore
with
his
hands
outstretched
his
teeth
bared
i
said
no
shouted
the
brutal-faced
man
there
was
a
flash
of
light
and
the
werewolf
was
blasted
out
of
the
way
he
hit
the
ramparts
and
staggered
looking
furious
harry's
heart
was
hammering
so
hard
it
seemed
impossible
that
nobody
could
hear
him
standing
there
imprisoned
by
dumbledore's
spell
if
he
could
only
move
he
could
aim
a
curse
from
under
the
Cloak
draco
do
it
or
stand
aside
so
one
of
us
screeched
the
woman
but
at
that
precise
moment
the
door
to
the
ramparts
burst
open
once
more
and
there
stood
Snape
his
wand
clutched
in
his
hand
as
his
black
eyes
swept
the
scene
from
Dumbledore
slumped
against
the
wall
to
the
four
Death
Eaters
including
the
enraged
werewolf
and
Malfoy
we've
got
a
problem
Snape
said
the
lumpy
Amycus
whose
eyes
and
wand
were
fixed
alike
upon
Dumbledore
the
boy
doesn't
seem
able
but
somebody
else
had
spoken
snape's
name
quite
softly
severus
the
sound
frightened
Harry
beyond
anything
he
had
experienced
all
evening
for
the
first
time
Dumbledore
was
pleading
snape
said
nothing
but
walked
forwards
and
pushed
Malfoy
roughly
out
of
the
way
the
three
Death
Eaters
fell
back
without
a
word
even
the
werewolf
seemed
cowed
snape
gazed
for
a
moment
at
Dumbledore
and
there
was
revulsion
and
hatred
etched
in
the
harsh
lines
of
his
face
severus
please
snape
raised
his
wand
and
pointed
it
directly
at
Dumbledore
avada
Kedavra
a
jet
of
green
light
shot
from
the
end
of
snape's
wand
and
hit
Dumbledore
squarely
in
the
chest
harry's
scream
of
horror
never
left
him
silent
and
unmoving
he
was
forced
to
watch
as
Dumbledore
was
blasted
into
the
air
for
a
split
second
he
seemed
to
hang
suspended
beneath
the
shining
skull
and
then
he
fell
slowly
backwards
like
a
great
rag
doll
over
the
battlements
and
out
of
sight
chapter
Flight
of
the
Prince
harry
felt
as
though
he
too
were
hurtling
through
space
it
had
not
happened
it
could
not
have
happened
out
of
here
quickly
said
Snape
he
seized
Malfoy
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
and
forced
him
through
the
door
ahead
of
the
rest
Greyback
and
the
squat
brother
and
sister
followed
the
latter
both
panting
excitedly
as
they
vanished
through
the
door
Harry
realized
he
could
move
again
what
was
now
holding
him
paralyzed
against
the
wall
was
not
magic
but
horror
and
shock
he
threw
the
Invisibility
Cloak
aside
as
the
brutal-faced
Death
Eater
last
to
leave
the
tower
top
was
disappearing
through
the
door
petrificus
Totalus
the
Death
Eater
buckled
as
though
hit
in
the
back
with
something
solid
and
fell
to
the
ground
rigid
as
a
waxwork
but
he
had
barely
hit
the
floor
when
Harry
was
clambering
over
him
and
running
down
the
darkened
staircase
terror
tore
at
Harrys
heart
he
had
to
get
to
Dumbledore
and
he
had
to
catch
Snape
somehow
the
two
things
were
linked
he
could
reverse
what
had
happened
if
he
had
them
both
together
dumbledore
could
not
have
died
he
leapt
the
last
ten
steps
of
the
spiral
staircase
and
stopped
where
he
landed
his
wand
raised
the
dimly
lit
corridor
was
full
of
dust
half
the
ceiling
seemed
to
have
fallen
in
and
a
battle
was
raging
before
him
but
even
as
he
attempted
to
make
out
who
were
fighting
whom
he
heard
the
hated
voice
shout
it's
over
time
to
go
and
saw
Snape
disappearing
around
the
corner
at
the
far
end
of
the
corridor
he
and
Malfoy
seemed
to
have
forced
their
way
through
the
fight
unscathed
as
Harry
plunged
after
them
one
of
the
fighters
detached
themselves
from
the
fray
and
flew
at
him
it
was
the
werewolf
Fenrir
he
was
on
top
of
Harry
before
Harry
could
raise
his
wand
Harry
fell
backward
with
filthy
matted
hair
in
his
face
the
stench
of
sweat
and
blood
filling
his
nose
and
mouth
hot
greedy
breath
at
his
throat
petrificus
Totalus
harry
felt
Fenrir
collapse
against
him
with
a
stupendous
effort
he
pushed
the
werewolf
off
and
onto
the
floor
as
a
jet
of
green
light
came
flying
toward
him
he
ducked
and
ran
headfirst
into
the
fight
his
feet
met
something
squashy
and
slippery
on
the
floor
and
he
stumbled
There
were
two
bodies
lying
there
lying
facedown
in
a
pool
of
blood
but
there
was
no
time
to
investigate
harry
now
saw
red
hair
flying
like
flames
in
front
of
him
Ginny
was
locked
in
combat
with
the
lumpy
Death
Eater
Amycus
who
was
throwing
hex
after
hex
at
her
while
she
dodged
them
Amycus
was
giggling
enjoying
the
sport
Crucio
Crucio
you
can't
dance
forever
pretty
impedimenta
yelled
Harry
his
jinx
hit
Amycus
in
the
chest
He
gave
a
piglike
squeal
of
pain
was
lifted
off
his
feet
and
slammed
into
the
opposite
wall
slid
down
it
and
fell
out
of
sight
behind
Ron
Professor
McGonagall
and
Lupin
each
of
whom
was
battling
a
separate
Death
Eater
beyond
them
Harry
saw
Tonks
fighting
an
enormous
blond
wizard
who
was
sending
curses
flying
in
all
directions
so
that
they
ricocheted
off
the
walls
around
them
cracking
stone
shattering
the
nearest
window
harry
where
did
you
come
from
ginny
cried
but
there
was
no
time
to
answer
her
he
put
his
head
down
and
sprinted
forward
narrowly
avoiding
a
blast
that
erupted
over
his
head
showering
them
all
in
bits
of
wall
snape
must
not
escape
he
must
catch
up
with
Snape
take
that
shouted
Professor
McGonagall
and
Harry
glimpsed
the
female
Death
Eater
Alecto
sprinting
away
down
the
corridor
with
her
arms
over
her
head
her
brother
right
behind
her
he
launched
himself
after
them
but
his
foot
caught
on
something
and
next
moment
he
was
lying
across
someone's
legs
looking
around
he
saw
neville's
pale
round
face
flat
against
the
floor
neville
are
you
m'all
right
muttered
Neville
who
was
clutching
his
stomach
Harry
snape
n
Malfoy
ran
past
i
know
i'm
on
it
said
Harry
aiming
a
hex
from
the
floor
at
the
enormous
blond
Death
Eater
who
was
causing
most
of
the
chaos
the
man
gave
a
howl
of
pain
as
the
spell
hit
him
in
the
face
He
wheeled
around
staggered
and
then
pounded
away
after
the
brother
and
sister
harry
scrambled
up
from
the
floor
and
began
to
sprint
along
the
corridor
ignoring
the
bangs
issuing
from
behind
him
the
yells
of
the
others
to
come
back
and
the
mute
call
of
the
figures
on
the
ground
whose
fate
he
did
not
yet
know
he
skidded
around
the
corner
his
trainers
slippery
with
blood
Snape
had
an
immense
head
start
was
it
possible
that
he
had
already
entered
the
cabinet
in
the
Room
of
Requirement
or
had
the
Order
made
steps
to
secure
it
to
prevent
the
Death
Eaters
retreating
that
way
he
could
hear
nothing
but
his
own
pounding
feet
his
own
hammering
heart
as
he
sprinted
along
the
next
empty
corridor
but
then
spotted
a
bloody
footprint
that
showed
at
least
one
of
the
fleeing
Death
Eaters
was
heading
toward
the
front
doors
perhaps
the
Room
of
Requirement
was
indeed
blocked
he
skidded
around
another
corner
and
a
curse
flew
past
him
he
dived
behind
a
suit
of
armor
that
exploded
he
saw
the
brother
and
sister
running
down
the
marble
staircase
ahead
and
aimed
jinxes
at
them
but
merely
hit
several
bewigged
witches
in
a
portrait
on
the
landing
who
ran
screeching
into
neighboring
paintings
as
he
leapt
the
wreckage
of
armor
Harry
heard
more
shouts
and
screams
other
people
within
the
castle
seemed
to
have
awoken
he
pelted
toward
a
shortcut
hoping
to
overtake
the
brother
and
sister
and
close
in
on
Snape
and
Malfoy
who
must
surely
have
reached
the
grounds
by
now
remembering
to
leap
the
vanishing
step
halfway
down
the
concealed
staircase
he
burst
through
a
tapestry
at
the
bottom
and
out
into
a
corridor
where
a
number
of
bewildered
and
pajama-clad
Hufflepuffs
stood
harry
we
heard
a
noise
and
someone
said
something
aboui
the
Dark
Mark
began
Ernie
Macmillan
out
of
the
way
yelled
Harry
knocking
two
boys
aside
as
he
sprinted
toward
the
landing
and
down
the
remainder
of
the
marble
staircase
the
oak
front
doors
had
been
blasted
open
there
were
smears
of
blood
on
the
flagstones
and
several
terrified
students
stood
huddled
against
the
walls
one
or
two
still
cowering
with
their
arms
over
their
faces
the
giant
Gryffindor
hourglass
had
been
hit
by
a
curse
and
the
rubies
within
were
still
falling
with
a
loud
rattle
onto
the
flagstones
below
harry
flew
across
the
entrance
hall
and
out
into
the
dark
grounds
He
could
just
make
out
three
figures
racing
across
the
lawn
heading
for
the
gates
beyond
which
they
could
Disapparate
by
the
looks
of
them
the
huge
blond
Death
Eater
and
some
way
ahead
of
him
Snape
and
Malfoy
the
cold
night
air
ripped
at
harry's
lungs
as
he
tore
after
them
he
saw
a
flash
of
light
in
the
distance
that
momentarily
silhouetted
his
quarry
he
did
not
know
what
it
was
but
continued
to
run
not
yet
near
enough
to
get
a
good
aim
with
a
curse
another
flash
shouts
retaliatory
jets
of
light
and
Harry
understood
Hagrid
had
emerged
from
his
cabin
and
was
trying
to
stop
the
Death
Eaters
escaping
and
though
every
breath
seemed
to
shred
his
lungs
and
the
stitch
in
his
chest
was
like
fire
Harry
sped
up
as
an
unbidden
voice
in
his
head
said
not
Hagrid
not
Hagrid
too
something
caught
Harry
hard
in
the
small
of
the
back
and
he
fell
forward
his
face
smacking
the
ground
blood
pouring
out
of
both
nostrils
He
knew
even
as
he
rolled
over
his
wand
ready
that
the
brother
and
sister
he
had
overtaken
using
his
shortcut
were
closing
in
behind
him
impedimenta
he
yelled
as
he
rolled
over
again
crouching
close
to
the
dark
ground
and
miraculously
his
jinx
hit
one
of
them
who
stumbled
and
fell
tripping
up
the
other
Harry
leapt
to
his
feet
and
sprinted
on
after
Snape
and
now
he
saw
the
vast
outline
of
Hagrid
illuminated
by
the
light
of
the
crescent
moon
revealed
suddenly
behind
clouds
the
blond
Death
Eater
was
aiming
curse
after
curse
at
the
gamekeeper
but
Hagrids
immense
strength
and
the
toughened
skin
he
had
inherited
from
his
giantess
mother
seemed
to
be
protecting
him
snape
and
Malfoy
however
were
still
running
they
would
soon
be
beyond
the
gates
able
to
Disapparate
harry
tore
past
Hagrid
and
his
opponent
took
aim
at
snape's
back
and
yelled
Stupefy
he
missed
the
jet
of
red
light
soared
past
snape's
head
Snape
shouted
Run
Draco
and
turned
twenty
yards
apart
he
and
Harry
looked
at
each
other
before
raising
their
wands
simultaneously
cruc
but
Snape
parried
the
curse
knocking
Harry
backward
off
his
feet
before
he
could
complete
it
Harry
rolled
over
and
scrambled
back
up
again
as
the
huge
Death
Eater
behind
him
yelled
Incendio
harry
heard
an
explosive
bang
and
a
dancing
orange
light
spilled
over
all
of
them
hagrid's
house
was
on
fire
fang's
in
there
yer
evil
hagrid
bellowed
cruc
yelled
Harry
for
the
second
time
aiming
for
the
figure
ahead
illuminated
in
the
dancing
firelight
but
Snape
blocked
the
spell
again
harry
could
see
him
sneering
no
Unforgivable
Curses
from
you
Potter
he
shouted
over
the
rushing
of
the
flames
hagrid's
yells
and
the
wild
yelping
of
the
trapped
Fang
you
haven't
got
the
nerve
or
the
ability
incarc-Harry
roared
but
Snape
deflected
the
spell
with
an
almost
lazy
flick
of
his
arm
fight
back
harry
screamed
at
him
fight
back
you
cowardly
coward
did
you
call
me
Potter
shouted
Snape
your
father
would
never
attack
me
unless
it
was
four
on
one
what
would
you
call
him
I
wonder
stupe
blocked
again
and
again
and
again
until
you
learn
to
keep
your
mouth
shut
and
your
mind
closed
Potter
sneered
Snape
deflecting
the
curse
once
more
now
come
he
shouted
at
the
huge
Death
Eater
behind
Harry
it
is
time
to
be
gone
before
the
Ministry
turns
up
impedi
but
before
he
could
finish
this
jinx
excruciating
pain
hit
Harry
he
keeled
over
in
the
grass
someone
was
screaming
he
would
surely
die
of
this
agony
Snape
was
going
to
torture
him
to
death
or
madness
no
roared
snape's
voice
and
the
pain
stopped
as
suddenly
as
it
had
started
Harry
lay
curled
on
the
dark
grass
clutching
his
wand
and
panting
somewhere
overhead
Snape
was
shouting
Have
you
forgotten
our
orders
potter
belongs
to
the
Dark
Lord
we
are
to
leave
him
go
go
and
Harry
felt
the
ground
shudder
under
his
face
as
the
brother
and
sister
and
the
enormous
Death
Eater
obeyed
running
toward
the
gates
harry
uttered
an
inarticulate
yell
of
rage
In
that
instant
he
cared
not
whether
he
lived
or
died
pushing
himself
to
his
feet
again
he
staggered
blindly
toward
Snape
the
man
he
now
hated
as
much
as
he
hated
Voldemort
himself
sectum
snape
flicked
his
wand
and
the
curse
was
repelled
yet
again
but
Harry
was
mere
feet
away
now
and
he
could
see
snape's
face
clearly
at
last
He
was
no
longer
sneering
or
jeering
the
blazing
flames
showed
a
face
full
of
rage
mustering
all
his
powers
of
concentration
Harry
thought
Levi
no
Potter
screamed
Snape
there
was
a
loud
bang
and
Harry
was
soaring
backward
hitting
the
ground
hard
again
un
this
time
his
wand
flew
out
of
his
hand
he
could
hear
Hagrid
yelling
and
Fang
howling
as
Snape
closed
in
and
looked
down
on
him
where
he
lay
wandless
and
defenseless
as
Dumbledore
hadl
been
snape's
pale
face
illuminated
by
the
flaming
cabin
was
suffused
with
hatred
just
as
it
had
been
before
he
had
cursed
Dumbledore
you
dare
use
my
own
spells
against
me
Potter
it
was
I
who
invented
them
I
the
Half-Blood
Prince
and
you'd
turn
my
inventions
on
me
like
your
filthy
father
would
you
i
don't
think
so
no
harry
had
dived
for
his
wand
Snape
shot
a
hex
at
it
and
it
flew
feet
away
into
the
darkness
and
out
of
sight
kill
me
then
panted
Harry
who
felt
no
fear
at
all
but
only
rage
and
contempt
kill
me
like
you
killed
him
you
coward
don't
screamed
Snape
and
his
face
was
suddenly
demented
inhuman
as
though
he
was
in
as
much
pain
as
the
yelping
howling
dog
stuck
in
the
burning
house
behind
them
call
me
coward
and
he
slashed
at
the
air
Harry
felt
a
white-hot
whiplike
something
hit
him
across
the
face
and
was
slammed
backward
into
the
ground
spots
of
light
burst
in
front
of
his
eyes
and
for
a
moment
all
the
breath
seemed
to
have
gone
from
his
body
then
he
heard
a
rush
of
wings
above
him
and
something
enormous
obscured
the
stars
buckbeak
had
flown
at
Snape
who
staggered
backward
as
the
razor-sharp
claws
slashed
at
him
as
Harry
raised
himself
into
a
sitting
position
his
head
still
swimming
from
its
last
contact
with
the
ground
he
saw
Snape
running
as
hard
as
he
could
the
enormous
beast
flapping
behind
him
and
screeching
as
Harry
had
never
heard
him
screech
harry
struggled
to
his
feet
looking
around
groggily
for
his
wand
hoping
to
give
chase
again
but
even
as
his
fingers
fumbled
in
the
grass
discarding
twigs
he
knew
it
would
be
too
late
and
sure
enough
by
the
time
he
had
located
his
wand
he
turned
only
to
see
the
hippogriff
circling
the
gates
snape
had
managed
to
Disapparate
just
beyond
the
school's
boundaries
hagrid
muttered
Harry
still
dazed
looking
around
hagrid
he
stumbled
toward
the
burning
house
as
an
enormous
figure
emerged
from
out
of
the
flames
carrying
Fang
on
his
back
with
a
cry
of
thankfulness
Harry
sank
to
his
knees
he
was
shaking
in
every
limb
his
body
ached
all
over
and
his
breath
came
in
painful
stabs
yeh
all
righ
Harry
yeh
all
righ
speak
ter
me
Harry
hagrids
huge
hairy
face
was
swimming
above
Harry
blocking
out
the
stars
harry
could
smell
burnt
wood
and
dog
hair
he
put
out
a
hand
and
felt
fang's
reassuringly
warm
and
alive
body
quivering
beside
him
i'm
all
right
panted
Harry
are
you
course
I
am
take
more'n
that
ter
finish
me
hagrid
put
his
hands
under
harry's
arms
and
raised
him
up
with
such
force
that
harry's
feet
momentarily
left
the
ground
before
Hagrid
set
him
upright
again
he
could
see
blood
trickling
down
hagrid's
cheek
from
a
deep
cut
under
one
eye
which
was
swelling
rapidly
we
should
put
out
your
house
said
Harry
the
charm's
Aguamenti
knew
it
was
summat
like
that
mumbled
Hagrid
and
he
raised
a
smoldering
pink
flowery
umbrella
and
said
Aguamenti
a
jet
of
water
flew
out
of
the
umbrella
tip
harry
raised
his
wand
arm
which
felt
like
lead
and
murmured
Aguamenti
too
Together
he
and
Hagrid
poured
water
on
the
house
until
the
last
flame
was
extinguished
s'not
too
bad
said
Hagrid
hopefully
a
few
minutes
later
looking
at
the
smoking
wreck
nothin
Dumbledore
won
be
able
to
put
righ
harry
felt
a
searing
pain
in
his
stomach
at
the
sound
of
the
name
in
the
silence
and
the
stillness
horror
rose
inside
him
hagrid
i
was
bindin
up
a
couple
o
bowtruckle
legs
when
I
heard
em
coming
said
Hagrid
sadly
still
staring
at
his
wrecked
cabin
they'll
bin
burnt
ter
twigs
poor
little
things
hagrid
but
what
happened
Harry
i
jus
saw
them
Death
Eaters

down
from
the
castle
but
what

ruddy
hell

Snape
doin
with

where's
he
gone

he

he
harry
cleared
his
throat
it
was
dry
from
panic
and
the
smoke
hagrid

said
Hagrid
loudly
staring
down
at
Harry
snape
killed
what're

on
abou
Harry
dumbledore
said
Harry
snape
killed
dumbledore
hagrid
simply
looked
at
him
the
little
of
his
face
that
could
be
seen
completely
blank
uncomprehending
dumbledore
wha
Harry
he's
dead
snape
killed

don
say
that
said
Hagrid
roughly

Harry
wha's
made
yeh
say
tha
i
saw
it
happen
yeh
couldn
have
i
saw
it
Hagrid
hagrid
shook
his
head
his
expression
was
disbelieving
but
sympathetic
and
Harry
knew
that
Hagrid
thought
he
had
sustained
a
blow
to
the
head
that
he
was
confused
perhaps
by
the
aftereffects
of
a
jinx
what
musta
happened
was
Dumbledore
musta
told
Snape
ter
go
with
them
Death
Eaters
Hagrid
said
confidently
i
suppose
he's
gotta
keep
his
cover
look
let's
get
yeh
back
up
ter
the
school
come
on
Harry
harry
did
not
attempt
to
argue
or
explain
he
was
still
shaking
uncontrollably
hagrid
would
find
out
soon
enough
too
soon
as
they
directed
their
steps
back
toward
the
castle
Harry
saw
that
many
of
its
windows
were
lit
now
he
could
imagine
clearly
the
scenes
inside
as
people
moved
from
room
to
room
telling
each
other
that
Death
Eaters
had
got
in
that
the
Mark
was
shining
over
Hogwarts
that
somebody
must
have
been
killed
the
oak
front
doors
stood
open
ahead
of
them
light
flooding
out
onto
the
drive
and
the
lawn
slowly
uncertainly
dressing-gowned
people
were
creeping
down
the
steps
looking
around
nervously
for
some
sign
of
the
Death
Eaters
who
had
fled
into
the
night
harry's
eyes
however
were
fixed
upon
the
ground
at
the
foot
of
the
tallest
tower
he
imagined
that
he
could
see
a
black
huddled
mass
lying
in
the
grass
there
though
he
was
really
too
far
away
to
see
anything
of
the
sort
even
as
he
stared
wordlessly
at
the
place
where
he
thought
dumbledore's
body
must
lie
however
he
saw
people
beginning
to
move
toward
it
what're
they
all
lookin
at
said
Hagrid
as
he
and
Harry
approached
the
castle
front
Fang
keeping
as
close
as
he
could
to
their
ankles
wha's
that
lyin
on
the
grass
hagrid
added
sharply
heading
now
toward
the
foot
of
the
Astronomy
Tower
where
a
small
crowd
was
congregating
see
it
Harry
right
at
the
foot
of
the
tower
under
where
the
Mark
blimey
yeh
don
think
someone
got
thrown
hagrid
fell
silent
the
thought
apparently
too
horrible
to
express
aloud
harry
walked
alongside
him
feeling
the
aches
and
pains
in
his
face
and
his
legs
where
the
various
hexes
of
the
last
half
hour
had
hit
him
though
in
an
oddly
detached
way
as
though
somebody
near
him
was
suffering
them
what
was
real
and
inescapable
was
the
awful
pressing
feeling
in
his
chest
he
and
Hagrid
moved
dreamlike
through
the
murmuring
crowd
to
the
very
front
where
the
dumbstruck
students
and
teachers
had
left
a
gap
harry
heard
hagrid's
moan
of
pain
and
shock
but
he
did
not
stop
he
walked
slowly
forward
until
he
reached
the
place
where
Dumbledore
lay
and
crouched
down
beside
him
he
had
known
there
was
no
hope
from
the
moment
that
the
full
Body-Bind
Curse
Dumbledore
had
placed
upon
him
lifted
known
that
it
could
have
happened
only
because
its
caster
was
dead
but
there
was
still
no
preparation
for
seeing
him
here
spread-eagled
broken
the
greatest
wizard
Harry
had
ever
or
would
ever
meet
dumbledore's
eyes
were
closed
but
for
the
strange
angle
of
his
arms
and
legs
he
might
have
been
sleeping
harry
reached
out
straightened
the
half-moon
spectacles
upon
the
crooked
nose
and
wiped
a
trickle
of
blood
from
the
mouth
with
his
own
sleeve
then
he
gazed
down
at
the
wise
old
face
and
tried
to
absorb
the
enormous
and
incomprehensible
truth
that
never
again
would
Dumbledore
speak
to
him
never
again
could
he
help
the
crowd
murmured
behind
Harry
after
what
seemed
like
a
long
time
he
became
aware
that
he
was
kneeling
upon
something
hard
and
looked
down
the
locket
they
had
managed
to
steal
so
many
hours
before
had
fallen
out
of
dumbledore's
pocket
it
had
opened
perhaps
due
to
the
force
with
which
it
hit
the
ground
and
although
he
could
not
feel
more
shock
or
horror
or
sadness
than
he
felt
already
Harry
knew
as
he
picked
it
up
that
there
was
something
wrong
he
turned
the
locket
over
in
his
hands
this
was
neither
as
large
as
the
locket
he
remembered
seeing
in
the
Pensieve
nor
were
there
any
markings
upon
it
no
sign
of
the
ornate
S
that
was
supposed
to
be
Slytherins
mark
moreover
there
was
nothing
inside
but
for
a
scrap
of
folded
parchment
wedged
tightly
into
the
place
where
a
portrait
should
have
been
automatically
without
really
thinking
about
what
he
was
doing
Harry
pulled
out
the
fragment
of
parchment
opened
it
and
read
by
the
light
of
the
many
wands
that
had
now
been
lit
behind
him
to
the
Dark
Lord
i
now
I
will
be
dead
long
before
you
read
this
but
I
want
you
to
know
that
it
was
I
who
dicovered
your
secret
i
have
stolen
the
real
Horcrux
and
intend
to
destroy
it
as
soon
as
I
can
i
face
death
in
the
hope
that
when
you
meet
your
match
you
will
be
mortal
once
more
a.b
harry
neither
knew
nor
cared
what
the
message
meant
only
one
thing
mattered
This
was
not
a
Horcrux
dumbledore
had
weakened
himself
by
drinking
that
terrible
potion
for
nothing
harry
crumpled
the
parchment
in
his
hand
and
his
eyes
burned
with
tears
as
behind
him
Fang
began
to
howl
chapter
The
Pheonix
Lament
c
mere
Harry
no
yeh
can
stay
here
Harry
come
on
now
no
he
did
not
want
to
leave
Dumbledores
side
he
did
not
want
to
move
anywhere
hagrid's
hand
on
his
shoulder
was
trembling
then
another
voice
said
Harry
come
on
a
much
smaller
and
warmer
hand
had
enclosed
his
and
was
pulling
him
upward
he
obeyed
its
pressure
without
really
thinking
about
it
only
as
he
walked
blindly
back
through
the
crowd
did
he
realize
from
a
trace
of
flowery
scent
on
the
air
that
it
was
Ginny
who
was
leading
him
back
into
the
castle
incomprehensible
voices
battered
him
sobs
and
shouts
and
wails
stabbed
the
night
but
Harry
and
Ginny
walked
on
back
up
the
steps
into
the
entrance
hall
faces
swam
on
the
edges
of
harry's
vision
people
were
peering
at
him
whispering
wondering
and
Gryffindor
rubies
glistened
on
the
floor
like
drops
of
blood
as
they
made
their
way
toward
the
marble
staircase
we're
going
to
the
hospital
wing
said
Ginny
i'm
not
hurt
said
Harry
it's
McGonagalls
orders
said
Ginny
everyone's
up
there
Ron
and
Hermione
and
Lupin
and
everyone
fear
stirred
in
harry's
chest
again
He
had
forgotten
the
inert
figures
he
had
left
behind
ginny
who
else
is
dead
don't
worry
none
of
us
but
the
Dark
Mark
Malfoy
said
he
stepped
over
a
body
he
stepped
over
Bill
but
its
all
right
he's
alive
there
was
something
in
her
voice
however
that
Harry
knew
boded
ill
are
you
sure
of
course
i'm
sure
he's
a
a
bit
of
a
mess
that's
all
greyback
attacked
him
madam
Pomfrey
says
he
won't
won't
look
the
same
anymore
ginny's
voice
trembled
a
little
we
don't
really
know
what
the
aftereffects
will
be
I
mean
Greyback
being
a
werewolf
but
not
transformed
at
the
time
but
the
others
there
were
other
bodies
on
the
ground
neville
and
Professor
Flitwick
are
both
hurt
but
Madam
Pomfrey
says
they'll
be
all
right
and
a
Death
eater's
dead
he
got
hit
by
a
Killing
Curse
that
huge
blond
one
was
firing
off
everywhere
Harry
if
we
hadn't
had
your
Felix
potion
I
think
we'd
all
have
been
killed
but
everything
seemed
to
just
miss
us
they
had
reached
the
hospital
wing
pushing
open
the
doors
Harry
saw
Neville
lying
apparently
asleep
in
a
bed
near
the
door
ron
Hermione
Luna
Tonks
and
Lupin
were
gathered
around
another
bed
near
the
far
end
of
the
ward
at
the
sound
of
the
doors
opening
they
all
looked
up
hermione
ran
to
Harry
and
hugged
him
Lupin
moved
forward
too
looking
anxious
are
you
all
right
Harry
i'm
fine
how's
Bill
nobody
answered
harry
looked
over
hermione's
shoulder
and
saw
an
unrecognizable
face
lying
on
bill's
pillow
so
badly
slashed
and
ripped
that
he
looked
grotesque
madam
Pomfrey
was
dabbing
at
his
wounds
with
some
harsh-smelling
green
ointment
harry
remembered
how
Snape
had
mended
malfoy's
Sectumsempra
wounds
so
easily
with
his
wand
can't
you
fix
them
with
a
charm
or
something
he
asked
the
matron
no
charm
will
work
on
these
said
Madam
Pomfrey
i've
tried
everything
I
know
but
there
is
no
cure
for
werewolf
bites
but
he
wasn't
bitten
at
the
full
moon
said
Ron
who
was
gazing
down
into
his
brother's
face
as
though
he
could
somehow
force
him
to
mend
just
by
staring
greyback
hadn't
transformed
so
surely
Bill
won't
be
a
a
real
he
looked
uncertainly
at
Lupin
no
I
don't
think
that
Bill
will
be
a
true
werewolf
said
Lupin
but
that
does
not
mean
that
there
won't
be
some
contamination
those
are
cursed
wounds
they
are
unlikely
ever
to
heal
fully
and
and
Bill
might
have
some
wolfish
characteristics
from
now
on
dumbledore
might
know
something
that'd
work
though
Ron
said
where
is
he
bill
fought
those
maniacs
on
dumbledore's
orders
Dumbledore
owes
him
he
can't
leave
him
in
this
state
ron
Dumbledores
dead
said
Ginny
no
lupin
looked
wildly
from
Ginny
to
Harry
as
though
hoping
the
latter
might
contradict
her
but
when
Harry
did
nor
Lupin
collapsed
into
a
chair
beside
bill's
bed
his
hands
over
his
face
harry
had
never
seen
Lupin
lose
control
before
he
felt
as
though
he
was
intruding
upon
something
private
indecent
he
turned
away
and
caught
ron's
eye
instead
exchanging
in
silence
a
look
that
confirmed
what
Ginny
had
said
how
did
he
die
whispered
Tonks
how
did
it
happen
snape
killed
him
said
Harry
i
was
there
I
saw
it
we
arrived
back
on
the
Astronomy
Tower
because
that's
where
the
Mark
was
dumbledore
was
ill
he
was
weak
but
I
think
he
realized
it
was
a
trap
when
we
heard
footsteps
running
up
the
stairs
he
immobilized
me
I
couldn't
do
anything
I
was
under
the
Invisibility
Cloak
and
then
Malfoy
came
through
the
door
and
disarmed
him
hermione
clapped
her
hands
to
her
mouth
and
Ron
groaned
luna's
mouth
trembled
more
Death
Eaters
arrived
and
then
Snape
and
Snape
did
it
the
Avada
Kedavra
harry
couldn't
go
on
madam
Pomfrey
burst
into
tears
nobody
paid
her
any
attention
except
Ginny
who
whispered
Shh
listen
gulping
Madam
Pomfrey
pressed
her
fingers
to
her
mouth
her
eyes
wide
somewhere
out
in
the
darkness
a
phoenix
was
singing
in
a
way
Harry
had
never
heard
before
a
stricken
lament
of
terrible
beauty
and
Harry
felt
as
he
had
felt
about
phoenix
song
before
that
the
music
was
inside
him
not
without
It
was
his
own
grief
turned
magically
to
song
that
echoed
across
the
grounds
and
through
the
castle
windows
how
long
they
all
stood
there
listening
he
did
not
know
nor
why
it
seemed
to
ease
their
pain
a
little
to
listen
to
the
sound
of
their
mourning
but
it
felt
like
a
long
time
later
that
the
hospital
door
opened
again
and
Professor
McGonagall
entered
the
ward
like
all
the
rest
she
bore
marks
of
the
recent
battle
There
were
grazes
on
her
face
and
her
robes
were
ripped
molly
and
Arthur
are
on
their
way
she
said
and
the
spell
of
the
music
was
broken
Everyone
roused
themselves
as
though
coming
out
of
trances
turning
again
to
look
at
Bill
or
else
to
rub
their
own
eyest
shake
their
heads
harry
what
happened
according
to
Hagrid
you
were
with
Professor
Dumbledore
when
he
when
it
happened
he
says
Professor
Snape
was
involved
in
some
Snape
killed
Dumbledore
said
Harry
she
stared
at
him
for
a
moment
then
swayed
alarmingly
Madam
Pomfrey
who
seemed
to
have
pulled
herself
together
ran
forward
conjuring
a
chair
from
thin
air
which
she
pushed
under
McGonagall
snape
repeated
McGonagall
faintly
falling
into
the
chair
we
all
wondered
but
he
trusted
always
snape
i
can't
believe
it
snape
was
a
highly
accomplished
Occlumens
said
Lupin
his
voice
uncharacteristically
harsh
we
always
knew
that
but
Dumbledore
swore
he
was
on
our
side
whispered
Tonks
i
always
thought
Dumbledore
must
know
something
about
Snape
that
we
didn't
he
always
hinted
that
he
had
an
ironclad
reason
for
trusting
Snape
muttered
Professor
McGonagall
now
dabbing
at
the
corners
of
her
leaking
eyes
with
a
tartan-edged
handkerchief
i
mean
with
Snapes
history
of
course
people
were
bound
to
wonder
but
Dumbledore
told
me
explicitly
that
snape's
repentance
was
absolutely
genuine-wouldn't
hear
a
word
against
him
i'd
love
to
know
what
Snape
told
him
to
convince
him
said
Tonks
i
know
said
Harry
and
they
all
turned
to
look
at
him
snape
passed
Voldemort
the
information
that
made
Voldemort
hunt
down
my
mum
and
dad
then
Snape
told
Dumbledore
he
hadn't
realized
what
he
was
doing
he
was
really
sorry
he'd
done
it
sorry
that
they
were
dead
they
all
stared
at
him
and
Dumbledore
believed
that
said
Lupin
incredulously
dumbledore
believed
Snape
was
sorry
James
was
dead
snape
hated
James
and
he
didn't
think
my
mother
was
worth
a
damn
either
said
Harry
because
she
was
muggle-born
mudblood
he
called
her
nobody
asked
how
Harry
knew
this
all
of
them
seemed
to
be
lost
in
horrified
shock
trying
to
digest
the
monstrous
truth
of
what
had
happened
this
is
all
my
fault
said
Professor
McGonagall
suddenly
she
looked
disoriented
twisting
her
wet
handkerchief
in
her
hands
my
fault
i
sent
filius
to
fetch
Snape
tonight
I
actually
sent
for
him
to
come
and
help
us
if
I
hadn't
alerted
Snape
to
what
was
going
on
he
might
never
have
joined
forces
with
the
Death
Eaters
i
don't
think
he
knew
they
were
there
before
Filius
told
him
I
don't
think
he
knew
they
were
coming
it
isn't
your
fault
Minerva
said
Lupin
firmly
we
all
wanted
more
help
we
were
glad
to
think
Snape
was
on
his
way
so
when
he
arrived
at
the
fight
he
joined
in
on
the
Death
Eaters
side
asked
Harry
who
wanted
every
detail
of
snape's
duplicity
and
infamy
feverishly
collecting
more
reasons
to
hate
him
to
swear
vengeance
i
don't
know
exactly
how
it
happened
said
Professor
McGonagall
distractedly
it's
all
so
confusing
dumbledore
had
told
us
that
he
would
be
leaving
the
school
for
a
few
hours
and
that
we
were
to
patrol
the
corridors
just
in
case
remus
Bill
and
Nymphadora
were
to
join
us
and
so
we
patrolled
all
seemed
quiet
every
secret
passageway
out
of
the
school
was
covered
we
knew
nobody
could
fly
in
there
were
powerful
enchantments
on
every
entrance
into
the
castle
i
still
don't
know
how
the
Death
Eaters
can
possibly
have
entered
i
do
said
Harry
and
he
explained
briefly
about
the
pair
of
Vanishing
Cabinets
and
the
magical
pathway
they
formed
so
they
got
in
through
the
Room
of
Requirement
almost
against
his
will
he
glanced
from
Ron
to
Hermione
both
of
whom
looked
devastated
i
messed
up
Harry
said
Ron
bleakly
we
did
like
you
told
us
We
checked
the
marauder's
Map
and
we
couldn't
see
Malfoy
on
it
so
we
thought
he
must
be
in
the
Room
of
Requirement
so
me
Ginny
and
Neville
went
to
keep
watch
on
it
but
Malfoy
got
past
us
he
came
out
of
the
room
about
an
hour
after
we
started
keeping
watch
said
Ginny
he
was
on
his
own
clutching
that
awful
shriveled
arm
his
Hand
of
Glory
said
Ron
gives
light
only
to
the
holder
remember
anyway
Ginny
went
on
he
must
have
been
checking
whether
the
coast
was
clear
to
let
the
Death
Eaters
out
because
the
moment
he
saw
us
he
threw
something
into
the
air
and
it
all
went
pitch-black
Peruvian
Instant
Darkness
Powder
said
Ron
bitterly
fred
and
george's
i'm
going
to
be
having
a
word
with
them
about
who
they
let
buy
their
products
we
tried
everything
Lumos
Incendio
said
Ginny
nothing
would
penetrate
the
darkness
all
we
could
do
was
grope
our
way
out
of
the
corridor
again
and
meanwhile
we
could
hear
people
rushing
past
us
obviously
Malfoy
could
see
because
of
that
hand
thing
and
was
guiding
them
but
we
didn't
dare
use
any
curses
or
anything
in
case
we
hit
each
other
and
by
the
time
we'd
reached
a
corridor
that
was
light
they'd
gone
luckily
said
Lupin
hoarsely
Ron
Ginny
and
Neville
ran
into
us
almost
immediately
and
told
us
what
had
happened
we
found
the
Death
Eaters
minutes
later
heading
in
the
direction
of
the
Astronomy
Tower
malfoy
obviously
hadn't
expected
more
people
to
be
on
the
watch
he
seemed
to
have
exhausted
his
supply
of
Darkness
Powder
at
any
rate
a
fight
broke
out
they
scattered
and
we
gave
chase
one
of
them
Gibbon
broke
away
and
headed
up
the
tower
stairs
to
set
off
the
Mark
asked
Harry
he
must
have
done
yes
they
must
have
arranged
that
before
they
left
the
Room
of
Requirement
said
Lupin
but
I
don't
think
Gibbon
liked
the
idea
of
waiting
up
there
alone
for
Dumbledore
because
he
came
running
back
downstairs
to
rejoin
the
fight
and
was
hit
by
a
Killing
Curse
that
just
missed
me
so
if
Ron
was
watching
the
Room
of
Requirement
with
Ginny
and
Neville
said
Harry
turning
to
Hermione
were
you
outside
snape's
office
yes
whispered
Hermione
her
eyes
sparkling
with
tears
with
Luna
we
hung
around
for
ages
outside
it
and
nothing
happened
we
didn't
know
what
was
going
on
upstairs
Ron
had
taken
the
map-It
was
nearly
midnight
when
Professor
Flitwick
came
sprinting
down
into
the
dungeons
he
was
shouting
about
Death
Eaters
in
the
castle
I
don't
think
he
really
registered
that
Luna
and
I
were
there
at
all
he
just
burst
his
way
into
snape's
office
and
we
heard
him
saying
that
Snape
had
to
go
back
with
him
and
help
and
then
we
heard
a
loud
thump
and
Snape
came
hurtling
out
of
his
room
and
he
saw
us
and
and
What
harry
urged
her
i
was
so
stupid
Harry
said
Hermione
in
a
high-pitched
whisper
he
said
Professor
Flitwick
had
collapsed
and
that
we
should
go
and
take
care
of
him
while
he
while
he
went
to
help
fight
the
Death
Eaters
She
covered
her
face
in
shame
and
continued
to
talk
into
her
fingers
so
that
her
voice
was
muffled
we
went
into
his
office
to
see
if
we
could
help
Professor
Flitwick
and
found
him
unconscious
on
the
floor
and
oh
it's
so
obvious
now
Snape
must
have
Stupefied
Flitwick
but
we
didn't
realize
Harry
we
didn't
realize
we
just
let
Snape
go
it's
not
your
fault
said
Lupin
firmly
hermione
had
you
not
obeyed
Snape
and
got
out
of
the
way
he
probably
would
have
killed
you
and
Luna
so
then
he
came
upstairs
said
Harry
who
was
watching
Snape
running
up
the
marble
staircase
in
his
mind's
eye
his
black
robes
billowing
behind
him
as
ever
pulling
his
wand
from
under
his
cloak
as
he
ascended
and
he
found
the
place
where
you
were
all
fighting
we
were
in
trouble
we
were
losing
said
Tonks
in
a
low
voice
gibbon
was
down
but
the
rest
of
the
Death
Eaters
seemed
ready
to
fight
to
the
death
neville
had
been
hurt
Bill
had
been
savaged
by
Greyback
it
was
all
dark
curses
flying
everywhere
the
Malfoy
boy
had
vanished
he
must
have
slipped
past
up
the
stairs
then
more
of
them
ran
after
him
but
one
of
them
blocked
the
stair
behind
them
with
some
kind
of
curse
neville
ran
at
it
and
got
thrown
up
into
the
air
none
of
us
could
break
through
said
Ron
and
that
massive
Death
Eater
was
still
firing
off
jinxes
all
over
the
place
they
were
bouncing
off
the
walls
and
barely
missing
us
and
then
Snape
was
there
said
Tonks
and
then
he
wasn't
i
saw
him
running
toward
us
but
that
huge
Death
Eaters
jinx
just
missed
me
right
afterward
and
I
ducked
and
lost
track
of
things
said
Ginny
i
saw
him
run
straight
through
the
cursed
barrier
as
though
it
wasn't
there
said
Lupin
i
tried
to
follow
him
but
was
thrown
back
just
like
Neville
he
must
have
known
a
spell
we
didn't
whispered
McGonagall
after
all
he
was
the
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
teacher
i
just
assumed
that
he
was
in
a
hurry
to
chase
after
the
Death
Eaters
who'd
escaped
up
to
the
tower
he
was
said
Harry
savagely
but
to
help
them
not
to
stop
them
and
i'll
bet
you
had
to
have
a
Dark
Mark
to
get
through
that
barrier
so
what
happened
when
he
came
back
down
well
the
big
Death
Eater
had
just
fired
off
a
hex
that
caused
half
the
ceiling
to
fall
in
and
also
broke
the
curse
blocking
the
stairs
said
Lupin
we
all
ran
forward
those
of
us
who
were
still
standing
anyway
and
then
snape
and
the
boy
emerged
out
of
the
dust
obviously
none
of
us
attacked
them
we
just
let
them
pass
said
Tonks
in
a
hollow
voice
we
thought
they
were
being
chased
by
the
Death
Eaters
and
next
thing
the
other
Death
Eaters
and
Greyback
were
back
and
we
were
fighting
again
I
thought
I
heard
Snape
shout
something
but
I
don't
know
what
he
shouted
it's
over
said
Harry
he'd
done
what
he'd
meant
to
do
they
all
fell
silent
fawkes's
lament
was
still
echoing
over
the
dark
grounds
outside
as
the
music
reverberated
upon
the
air
unbidden
unwelcome
thoughts
slunk
into
harry's
mind
had
they
taken
dumbledore's
body
from
the
foot
of
the
tower
yet
what
would
happen
to
it
next
where
would
it
rest
he
clenched
his
fists
tighdy
in
his
pockets
he
could
feel
the
small
cold
lump
of
the
fake
Horcrux
against
the
knuckles
of
his
right
hand
the
doors
of
the
hospital
wing
burst
open
making
them
all
jump
mr.
and
Mrs
weasley
were
striding
up
the
ward
Fleur
just
behind
them
her
beautiful
face
terrified
molly
Arthur
said
Professor
McGonagall
jumping
up
and
hurrying
to
greet
them
i
am
so
sorry
bill
whispered
Mrs
weasley
darting
past
Professor
McGonagall
as
she
caught
sight
of
bill's
mangled
face
oh
Bill
lupin
and
Tonks
had
got
up
hastily
and
retreated
so
that
mr.
and
Mrs
weasley
could
get
nearer
to
the
bed
mrs
weasley
bent
over
her
son
and
pressed
her
lips
to
his
bloody
forehead
you
said
Greyback
attacked
him
mr.
Weasley
asked
Professor
McGonagall
distractedly
but
he
hadn't
transformed
so
what
does
that
mean
what
will
happen
to
Bill
we
don't
yet
know
said
Professor
McGonagall
looking
helplessly
at
Lupin
there
will
probably
be
some
contamination
Arthur
said
Lupin
it
is
an
odd
case
possibly
unique
we
don't
know
what
his
behavior
might
be
like
when
he
awakens
mrs
weasley
took
the
nasty-smelling
ointment
from
Madam
Pomfrey
and
began
dabbing
at
bill's
wounds
and
Dumbledore
said
mr.
Weasley
minerva
is
it
true
is
he
really
as
Professor
McGonagall
nodded
Harry
felt
Ginny
move
beside
him
and
looked
at
her
her
slightly
narrowed
eyes
were
fixed
upon
Fleur
who
was
gazing
down
at
Bill
with
a
frozen
expression
on
her
face
dumbledore
gone
whispered
mr.
Weasley
but
Mrs
weasley
had
eyes
only
for
her
eldest
son
she
began
to
sob
tears
falling
onto
bill's
mutilated
face
of
course
it
doesn't
matter
how
he
looks
it's
not
r-really
important
but
he
was
a
very
handsome
little
b-boy
always
very
handsome
and
he
was
g-going
to
be
married
and
what
do
you
mean
by
zat
said
Fleur
suddenly
and
loudly
what
do
you
mean
he
was
going
to
be
married
mrs
weasley
raised
her
tear-stained
face
looking
startled
well
only
that
you
theenk
Bill
will
not
wish
to
marry
me
anymore
demanded
Fleur
you
theenk
because
of
these
bites
he
will
not
love
me
no
that's
not
what
I
because
e
will
said
Fleur
drawing
herself
up
to
her
full
height
and
throwing
back
her
long
mane
of
silver
hair
it
would
take
more
zan
a
werewolf
to
stop
Bill
loving
me
well
yes
i'm
sure
said
Mrs
weasley
but
I
thought
perhaps
given
how
how
he
you
thought
I
would
not
weesh
to
marry
him
or
per'aps
you
hoped
said
Fleur
her
nostrils
flaring
what
do
I
care
how
he
looks
i
am
good-looking
enough
for
both
of
us
I
theenk
all
these
scars
show
is
zat
my
husband
is
brave
and
I
shall
do
zat
she
added
fiercely
pushing
Mrs
weasley
aside
and
snatching
the
ointment
from
her
mrs
weasley
fell
back
against
her
husband
and
watched
Fleur
mopping
up
bill's
wounds
with
a
most
curious
expression
upon
her
face
nobody
said
anything
Harry
did
not
dare
move
like
everybody
else
he
was
waiting
for
the
explosion
our
Great-Auntie
Muriel
said
Mrs
weasley
after
a
long
pause
has
a
very
beautiful
tiara
goblin-made
which
I
am
sure
I
could
persuade
her
to
lend
you
for
the
wedding
she
is
very
fond
of
Bill
you
know
and
it
would
look
lovely
with
your
hair
thank
you
said
Fleur
stiffly
i
am
sure
zat
will
be
lovely
and
then
Harry
did
not
quite
see
how
it
happened
both
women
were
crying
and
hugging
each
other
completely
bewildered
wondering
whether
the
world
had
gone
mad
he
turned
around
Ron
looked
as
stunned
as
he
felt
and
Ginny
and
Hermione
were
exchanging
startled
looks
you
see
said
a
strained
voice
tonks
was
glaring
at
Lupin
she
still
wants
to
marry
him
even
though
he's
been
bitten
she
doesn't
care
it's
different
said
Lupin
barely
moving
his
lips
and
looking
suddenly
tense
bill
will
not
be
a
full
werewolf
the
cases
are
completely
but
I
don't
care
either
I
don't
care
said
Tonks
seizing
the
front
of
lupin's
robes
and
shaking
them
i've
told
you
a
million
times
and
the
meaning
of
tonks's
Patronus
and
her
mouse-colored
hair
and
the
reason
she
had
come
running
to
find
Dumbledore
when
she
had
heard
a
rumor
someone
had
been
attacked
by
Greyback
all
suddenly
became
clear
to
Harry
it
had
not
been
Sinus
that
Tonks
had
fallen
in
love
with
after
all
and
i've
told
you
a
million
times
said
Lupin
refusing
to
meet
her
eyes
staring
at
the
floor
that
I
am
too
old
for
you
too
poor
too
dangerous
i've
said
all
along
you're
taking
a
ridiculous
line
on
this
Remus
said
Mrs
weasley
over
fleur's
shoulder
as
she
patted
her
on
the
back
i
am
not
being
ridiculous
said
Lupin
steadily
tonks
deserves
somebody
young
and
whole
but
she
wants
you
said
mr.
Weasley
with
a
small
smile
and
after
all
Remus
young
and
whole
men
do
not
necessarily
remain
so
he
gestured
sadly
at
his
son
lying
between
them
this
is
not
the
moment
to
discuss
it
said
Lupin
avoiding
everybody's
eyes
as
he
looked
around
distractedly
dumbledore
is
dead
dumbledore
would
have
been
happier
than
anybody
to
think
that
there
was
a
little
more
love
in
the
world
said
Professor
McGonagall
curtly
just
as
the
hospital
doors
opened
again
and
Hagrid
walked
in
the
little
of
his
face
that
was
not
obscured
by
hair
or
beard
was
soaking
and
swollen
he
was
shaking
with
tears
a
vast
spotted
handkerchief
in
his
hand
i've
i've
done
it
Professor
he
choked
m-moved
him
professor
sprout's
got
the
kids
back
in
bed
professor
flitwick's
lyin
down
but
he
says
he'll
be
all
righ
in
a
jiffy
an
Professor
Slughorn
says
the
ministry's
bin
informed
thank
you
Hagrid
said
Professor
McGonagall
standing
up
at
once
and
turning
to
look
at
the
group
around
bill's
bed
i
shall
have
to
see
the
Ministry
when
they
get
here
hagrid
please
tell
the
Heads
of
Houses
Slughorn
can
represent
Slytherin
that
I
want
to
see
them
in
my
office
forthwith
i
would
like
you
to
join
us
too
as
Hagrid
nodded
turned
and
shuffled
out
of
the
room
again
she
looked
down
at
Harry
before
I
meet
them
I
would
like
a
quick
word
with
you
Harry
if
you'll
come
with
me
harry
stood
up
murmured
See
you
in
a
bit
to
Ron
Hermione
and
Ginny
and
followed
Professor
McGonagall
back
down
the
ward
the
corridors
outside
were
deserted
and
the
only
sound
was
the
distant
phoenix
song
it
was
several
minutes
before
Harry
became
aware
that
they
were
not
heading
for
Professor
mcgonagall's
office
but
for
dumbledore's
and
another
few
seconds
before
he
realized
that
of
course
she
had
been
deputy
headmistress
apparently
she
was
now
headmistress
so
the
room
behind
the
gargoyle
was
now
hers
in
silence
they
ascended
the
moving
spiral
staircase
and
entered
the
circular
office
he
did
not
know
what
he
had
expected
that
the
room
would
be
draped
in
black
perhaps
or
even
that
dumbledore's
body
might
be
lying
there
in
fact
it
looked
almost
exactly
as
it
had
done
when
he
and
Dumbledore
had
left
it
mere
hours
previously
the
silver
instruments
whirring
and
puffing
on
their
spindle
legged
tables
gryffindor's
sword
in
its
glass
case
gleaming
in
the
moonlight
the
Sorting
Hat
on
a
shelf
behind
the
desk
the
fawkes's
perch
stood
empty
he
was
still
crying
his
lament
to
the
grounds
and
a
new
portrait
had
joined
the
ranks
of
the
dead
headmasters
and
headmistresses
of
Hogwarts
Dumbledore
was
slumbering
in
a
golden
frame
over
the
desk
his
half-moon
spectacle
perched
upon
his
crooked
nose
looking
peaceful
and
untroubled
after
glancing
once
at
this
portrait
Professor
McGonagall
made
an
odd
movement
as
though
steeling
herself
then
rounded
the
desk
to
look
at
Harry
her
face
taut
and
lined
harry
she
said
I
would
like
to
know
what
you
and
Professor
Dumbledore
were
doing
this
evening
when
you
left
the
school
i
can't
tell
you
that
Professor
said
Harry
he
had
expected
the
question
and
had
his
answer
ready
it
had
been
here
in
this
very
room
that
Dumbledore
had
told
him
that
he
was
to
confide
the
contents
of
their
lessons
to
nobody
but
Ron
and
Hermione
harry
it
might
be
important
said
Professor
McGonagall
it
is
said
Harry
very
but
he
didn't
want
me
to
tell
anyone
professor
McGonagall
glared
at
him
potter
Harry
registered
the
renewed
use
of
his
surname
in
the
light
of
Professor
dumbledore's
death
I
think
you
must
see
that
the
situation
has
changed
somewhat
i
don't
think
so
said
Harry
shrugging
professor
Dumbledore
never
told
me
to
stop
following
his
orders
if
he
died
but
there's
one
thing
you
should
know
before
the
Ministry
gets
here
though
madam
rosmerta's
under
the
Imperius
Curse
she
was
helping
Malfoy
and
the
Death
Eaters
that's
how
the
necklace
and
the
poisoned
mead
rosmerta
said
Professor
McGonagall
incredulously
but
before
she
could
go
on
there
was
a
knock
on
the
door
behind
them
and
Professors
Sprout
Flitwick
and
Slughorn
traipsed
into
the
room
followed
by
Hagrid
who
was
still
weeping
copiously
his
huge
frame
trembling
with
grief
snape
ejaculated
Slughorn
who
looked
the
most
shaken
pale
and
sweating
snape
i
taught
him
i
thought
I
knew
him
but
before
any
of
them
could
respond
to
this
a
sharp
voice
spoke
from
high
on
the
wall
A
sallow-faced
wizard
with
a
short
black
fringe
had
just
walked
back
into
his
empty
canvas
minerva
the
Minister
will
be
here
within
seconds
he
has
just
Disapparated
from
the
Ministry
thank
you
Everard
said
Professor
McGonagall
and
she
turned
quickly
to
her
teachers
i
want
to
talk
about
what
happens
to
Hogwarts
before
he
gets
here
she
said
quickly
personally
I
am
not
convinced
that
the
school
should
reopen
next
year
the
death
of
the
headmaster
at
the
hands
of
one
of
our
colleagues
is
a
terrible
stain
upon
hogwarts's
history
it
is
horrible
i
am
sure
Dumbledore
would
have
wanted
the
school
to
remain
open
said
Professor
Sprout
i
feel
that
if
a
single
pupil
wants
to
come
then
the
school
ought
to
remain
open
for
that
pupil
but
will
we
have
a
single
pupil
after
this
said
Slughorn
now
dabbing
his
sweating
brow
with
a
silken
handkerchief
parents
will
want
to
keep
their
children
at
home
and
I
can't
say
I
blame
them
personally
I
don't
think
we're
in
more
danger
at
Hogwarts
than
we
are
anywhere
else
but
you
can't
expect
mothers
to
think
like
that
they'll
want
to
keep
their
families
together
it's
only
natural
i
agree
said
Professor
McGonagall
and
in
any
case
it
is
not
true
to
say
that
Dumbledore
never
envisaged
a
situation
in
which
Hogwarts
might
close
when
the
Chamber
of
Secrets
reopened
he
considered
the
closure
of
the
school
and
I
must
say
that
Professor
dumbledore's
murder
is
more
disturbing
to
me
than
the
idea
of
slytherin's
monster
living
undetected
in
the
bowels
of
the
castle
we
must
consult
the
governors
said
Professor
Flitwick
in
his
squeaky
little
voice
he
had
a
large
bruise
on
his
forehead
but
seemed
otherwise
unscathed
by
his
collapse
in
snape's
office
we
must
follow
the
established
procedures
a
decision
should
not
be
made
hastily
hagrid
you
haven't
said
anything
said
Professor
McGonagall
what
are
your
views
ought
Hogwarts
to
remain
open
hagrid
who
had
been
weeping
silently
into
his
large
spotted
handkerchief
throughout
this
conversation
now
raised
puffy
red
eyes
and
croaked
I
dunno
Professor
that's
fer
the
Heads
of
House
an
the
headmistress
ter
decide
professor
Dumbledore
always
valued
your
views
said
Professor
McGonagall
kindly
and
so
do
I
well
i'm
stayin
said
Hagrid
fat
tears
still
leaking
out
of
the
corners
of
his
eyes
and
trickling
down
into
his
tangled
beard
it's
me
home
it's
bin
me
home
since
I
was
thirteen
an
if
there's
kids
who
wan
me
ter
teach
em
i'll
do
it
but
i
dunno
hogwarts
without
Dumbledore
he
gulped
and
disappeared
behind
his
handkerchief
once
more
and
there
was
silence
very
well
said
Professor
McGonagall
glancing
out
of
the
window
at
the
grounds
checking
to
see
whether
the
Minister
was
yet
approaching
then
I
must
agree
with
Filius
that
the
right
thing
to
do
is
to
consult
the
governors
who
will
make
the
final
decision
now
as
to
getting
students
home
there
is
an
argument
for
doing
it
sooner
rather
than
later
we
could
arrange
for
the
Hogwarts
Express
to
come
tomorrow
if
necessary
what
about
dumbledore's
funeral
said
Harry
speaking
at
last
well
said
Professor
McGonagall
losing
a
little
of
her
briskness
as
her
voice
shook
i
I
know
that
it
was
dumbledore's
wish
to
be
laid
to
rest
here
at
Hogwarts
then
that's
what'll
happen
isn't
it
said
Harry
fiercely
if
the
Ministry
thinks
it
appropriate
said
Professor
McGonagall
no
other
headmaster
or
headmistress
has
ever
been
no
other
headmaster
or
headmistress
ever
gave
more
to
this
school
growled
Hagrid
hogwarts
should
be
dumbledore's
final
resting
place
said
Professor
Flitwick
absolutely
said
Professor
Sprout
and
in
that
case
said
Harry
you
shouldn't
send
the
students
home
until
the
jfuneral's
over
they'll
want
to
say
the
last
word
caught
in
his
throat
but
Professor
Sprout
completed
the
sentence
for
him
good-bye
well
said
squeaked
Professor
Flitwick
well
said
indeed
our
students
should
pay
tribute
it
is
fitting
we
can
arrange
transport
home
afterward
seconded
barked
Professor
Sprout
i
suppose
yes
said
Slughorn
in
a
rather
agitated
voice
while
Hagrid
let
out
a
strangled
sob
of
assent
he's
coming
said
Professor
McGonagall
suddenly
gazing
down
into
the
grounds
the
Minister
and
by
the
looks
of
it
he's
brought
a
delegation
can
I
leave
Professor
said
Harry
at
once
he
had
no
desire
at
all
to
see
or
be
interrogated
by
Rufus
Scrimgeour
tonight
you
may
said
Professor
McGonagall
and
quickly
she
strode
toward
the
door
and
held
it
open
for
him
he
sped
down
the
spiral
staircase
and
off
along
the
deserted
corridor
he-had
left
his
Invisibility
Cloak
at
the
top
of
the
Astronomy
Tower
but
it
did
not
matter
there
was
nobody
in
the
corridors
to
see
him
pass
not
even
Filch
Mrs
norris
or
Peeves
he
did
not
meet
another
soul
until
he
turned
into
the
passage
leading
to
the
Gryffindor
common
room
is
it
true
whispered
the
Fat
Lady
as
he
approached
her
it
is
really
true
dumbledore
dead
yes
said
Harry
she
let
out
a
wail
and
without
waiting
for
the
password
swung
forward
to
admit
him
as
Harry
had
suspected
it
would
be
the
common
room
was
jam-packed
the
room
fell
silent
as
he
climbed
through
the
portrait
hole
he
saw
Dean
and
Seamus
sitting
in
a
group
nearby
This
meant
that
the
dormitory
must
be
empty
or
nearly
so
without
speaking
to
anybody
without
making
eye
contact
at
all
Harry
walked
straight
across
the
room
and
through
the
door
to
the
boys
dormitories
as
he
had
hoped
Ron
was
waiting
for
him
still
fully
dressed
sitting
on
his
bed
harry
sat
down
on
his
own
four-poster
and
for
a
moment
they
simply
stared
at
each
other
they're
talking
about
closing
the
school
said
Harry
lupin
said
they
would
said
Ron
there
was
a
pause
so
said
Ron
in
a
very
low
voice
as
though
he
thought
the
furniture
might
be
listening
in
did
you
find
one
did
you
get
it
a
a
Horcrux
harry
shook
his
head
all
that
had
taken
place
around
that
black
lake
seemed
like
an
old
nightmare
now
had
it
really
happened
and
only
hours
ago
you
didn't
get
it
said
Ron
looking
crestfallen
it
wasn't
there
no
said
Harry
someone
had
already
taken
it
and
left
a
fake
in
its
place
already
taken
wordlessly
Harry
pulled
the
fake
locket
from
his
pocket
opened
it
and
passed
it
to
Ron
the
full
story
could
wait
it
did
not
matter
tonight
nothing
mattered
except
the
end
the
end
of
their
pointless
adventure
the
end
of
dumbledore's
life

whispered
Ron
but
who
was
that
dunno
said
Harry
lying
back
on
his
bed
fully
clothed
and
staring
blankly
upwards
he
felt
no
curiosity
at
all
about
R
a.b.
He
doubted
that
he
would
ever
feel
curious
again
as
he
lay
there
he
became
aware
suddenly
that
the
grounds
were
silent
fawkes
had
stopped
singing
and
he
knew
without
knowing
how
he
knew
it
that
ilie
phoenix
had
gone
had
left
Hogwarts
for
good
just
as
Dumbledore
had
left
the
school
had
left
the
world
had
left

chapter
The
White
Tomb
all
lessons
were
suspended
all
examinations
postponed
some
students
were
hurried
away
from
Hogwarts
by
their
parents
over
the
next
couple
of
days
the
Patil
twins
were
gone
before
breakfast
on
the
morning
following
dumbledore's
death
and
Zacharias
Smith
was
escorted
from
the
castle
by
his
haughty-looking
father
seamus
Finnigan
on
the
other
hand
refused
point-blank
to
accompany
his
mother
home
they
had
a
shouting
match
in
the
Entrance
Hall
which
was
resolved
when
she
agreed
that
he
could
remain
behind
for
the
funeral
she
had
difficulty
in
finding
a
bed
in
Hogsmeade
Seamus
told
Harry
and
Ron
for
wizards
and
witches
were
pouring
into
the
village
preparing
to
pay
their
last
respects
to
Durnbledore
some
excitement
was
caused
among
the
younger
students
who
had
never
seen
it
before
when
a
powder-blue
carriage
the
size
of
a
house
pulled
by
a
dozen
giant
winged
palo-minos
came
soaring
out
of
the
sky
in
the
late
afternoon
before
the
funeral
and
landed
on
the
edge
of
the
Forest
harry
watched
from
a
window
as
a
gigantic
and
handsome
olive-skinned
black-haired
woman
descended
the
carriage
steps
and
threw
herself
into
the
waiting
hagrid's
arms
meanwhile
a
delegation
of
Ministry
officials
including
the
Minister
for
Magic
himself
was
being
accommodated
within
the
castle
harry
was
diligently
avoiding
contact
with
any
of
them
he
was
sure
that
sooner
or
later
he
would
be
asked
again
to
account
for
dumbledore's
last
excursion
from
Hogwarts
harry
Ron
Hermione
and
Ginny
were
spending
all
of
their
time
together
the
beautiful
weather
seemed
to
mock
them
Harry
could
imagine
how
it
would
have
been
if
Durnbledore
had
not
died
and
they
had
had
this
time
together
at
the
very
end
of
the
year
ginny's
examinations
finished
the
pressure
of
homework
lifted
and
hour
by
hour
he
put
off
saying
the
thing
that
he
knew
he
must
say
doing
what
he
knew
it
was
right
to
do
because
it
was
too
hard
to
forgo
his
best
source
of
comfort
they
visited
the
hospital
wing
twice
a
day
Neville
had
been
discharged
but
Bill
remained
under
Madam
pomfrey's
care
his
scars
were
as
bad
as
ever
in
truth
he
now
bore
a
distinct
resemblance
to
Mad-Eye
Moody
though
thankfully
with
both
eyes
and
legs
but
in
personality
he
seemed
jusi
the
same
as
ever
all
that
appeared
to
have
changed
was
that
he
now
had
a
great
liking
for
very
rare
steaks
so
eet
ees
lucky
e
is
marrying
me
said
Fleur
happily
plumping
up
bill's
pillows
because
ze
British
overcook
their
meat
I
ave
always
said
this
i
suppose
i'm
just
going
to
have
to
accept
that
he
really
is
going
to
marry
her
sighed
Ginny
later
that
evening
as
she
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
sat
beside
the
open
window
of
the
Gryffindor
common
room
looking
out
over
the
twilit
grounds
she's
not
that
bad
said
Harry
ugly
though
he
added
hastily
as
Ginny
raised
her
eyebrows
and
she
let
out
a
reluctant
giggle
well
I
suppose
if
Mum
can
stand
it
can
anyone
else
we
know
died
ron
asked
Hermione
who
was
perusing
the
Evening
Prophet
hermione
winced
at
the
forced
toughness
in
his
voice
no
she
said
reprovingly
folding
up
ihe
newspaper
they're
still
looking
for
Snape
but
no
sign
of
course
there
isn't
said
Harry
who
became
angry
every
lime
this
subject
cropped
up
they
won't
find
Snape
till
they
find
Voldemort
and
seeing
as
they've
never
managed
to
do
that
in
all
this
time
i'm
going
to
go
to
bed
yawned
Ginny
i
haven't
been
sleeping
thai
well
since
well
i
could
do
with
some
sleep
she
kissed
Harry
Ron
looked
away
pointedly
waved
al
the
other
two
and
departed
for
the
girls
dormitories
the
moment
the
door
had
closed
behind
her
Hermione
leaned
forwards
towards
Harry
with
a
most
hermione-ish
look
on
her
face
harry
I
found
something
ou
this
morning
in
the
library
a.b
said
Harry
silling
up
straight
he
did
not
feel
the
way
he
had
so
often
felt
before
excited
curious
burning
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
a
mystery
he
simply
knew
that
the
task
of
discovering
the
truth
about
the
real
Horcrux
had
to
be
completed
before
he
could
move
a
little
further
along
the
dark
and
winding
path
stretching
ahead
of
him
the
path
that
he
and
Dumbledore
had
set
out
upon
together
and
which
he
now
knew
he
would
have
to
journey
alone
there
might
still
be
as
many
as
four
Horcruxes
out
there
somewhere
and
each
would
need
to
be
found
and
elim-inated
before
there
was
even
a
possibility
that
Voldemort
could
be
killed
he
kept
reciting
their
names
to
himself
as
though
by
listing
them
he
could
bring
them
within
reach
the
locket
the
cup
the
snake
something
of
gryffindor's
or
ravenclaw's
the
locket
the
cup
the
snake
something
of
gryffindor's
or
ravenclaw's
this
mantra
seemed
to
pulse
through
harry's
mind
as
he
fell
asleep
at
night
and
his
dreams
were
thick
with
cups
lockets
and
mysterious
objects
that
he
could
not
quite
reach
though
Dumbledore
helpfully
offered
Harry
a
rope
ladder
that
turned
to
snakes
the
moment
he
began
to
climb
he
had
shown
Hermione
the
note
inside
the
locket
the
morning
after
dumbledore's
death
and
although
she
had
not
immediately
recognised
the
initials
as
belonging
to
some
obscure
wizard
about
whom
she
had
been
reading
she
had
since
been
rushing
off
to
the
library
a
little
more
often
than
was
strictly
necessary
for
somebody
who
had
no
homework
to
do
no
she
said
sadly
i've
been
trying
Harry
but
I
haven't
found
anything
there
are
a
couple
of
reasonably
well-known
wizards
with
those
initials
Rosalind
Antigone
Bungs
rupert
Axebanger
Brookstanton
but
they
don't
seem
to
fit
at
all
judging
by
that
note
the
person
who
stole
the
Horcrux
knew
Voldemort
and
I
can't
find
a
shred
of
evidence
that
Bungs
or
Axebanger
ever
had
anything
to
do
with
him
no
actually
it's
about
well
Snape
she
looked
nervous
even
saying
the
name
again
what
about
him
asked
Harry
heavily
slumping
back
in
his
chair
well
it's
just
that
I
was
sort
of
right
about
the
Half-Blood
Prince
business
she
said
tentatively
d'you
have
to
rub
it
in
Hermione
how
tTyou
think
feel
about
that
now
no
no
Harry
I
didn't
mean
that
she
said
hastily
look-ing
around
to
check
that
they
were
not
being
overheard
it's
just
that
was
right
about
Eileen
Prince
once
owning
the
book
you
see
she
was
snape's
mother
t
thought
she
wasn't
much
of
a
looker
said
Ron
hermione
ignored
him
was
going
through
ihe
rest
of
the
old
Prophets
and
there
was
a
tiny
announcement
about
Eileen
Prince
marrying
a
man
called
Tobias
Snape
and
then
later
an
announcement
saying
that
she'd
given
birth
to
a
murderer
spat
Harry
well
yes
said
Hermione
so
was
sort
of
right
snape
must
have
been
proud
of
being
half
a
Prince
you
see
tobias
Snape
was
a
Muggie
from
what
it
said
in
the
Prophet
yeah
that
fits
said
Harry
he'd
play
up
the
pure-blood
side
so
he
could
get
in
with
Lucius
Malfoy
and
the
rest
of
them
he's
just
like
Voldemort
pure-blood
mother
Muggie
father
ashamed
of
his
parentage
trying
to
make
himself
feared
using
the
Dark
Arts
gave
himself
an
impressive
new
name
Lard
Voldemort
the
Half-Blood
Prince
how
could
Dumbledore
have
missed
he
broke
off
looking
out
of
the
window
he
could
not
stop
himself
dwelling
upon
dumbledore's
inexcusable
trust
in
Snape
but
as
Hermione
had
just
inadvertently
reminded
him
he
Harry
had
been
taken
in
just
the
same
in
spite
of
the
increasing
nastiness
of
those
scribbled
spells
he
had
refused
to
believe
ill
of
the
boy
who
had
been
so
clever
who
had
helped
him
so
much
helped
him
it
was
an
almost
unendurable
thought
now
i
still
don't
get
why
he
didn't
turn
you
in
for
using
that
book
said
Ron
he
must've
known
where
you
were
getting
it
ali
from
he
knew
said
Harry
bitterly
he
knew
when
I
used
Secfumsempra
he
didn't
really
need
Legilimency
he
might
even
have
known
before
then
with
Slughom
talking
about
how
brilliant
I
was
at
Potions
shouldn't
have
left
his
old
book
in
the
bottom
of
that
cupboard
should
he
but
why
didn't
he
turn
you
in
i
don't
ihink
he
wanted
to
associate
himself
with
that
book
said
Hermione
i
don't
think
Dumbledore
would
have
liked
it
very
much
if
he'd
known
and
even
if
Snape
pre-tended
it
hadn't
been
his
Slughom
would
have
recognised
his
writing
at
once
anyway
the
book
was
left
in
snape's
old
classroom
and
i'll
bet
Dumbledore
knew
his
mother
was
called
Prince
t
should've
shown
the
book
to
Dumbledore
said
Harry
all
that
lime
he
was
showing
me
how
Voldemort
was
evil
even
when
he
was
at
school
and
had
proof
Snape
was
too
evil
is
a
strong
word
said
Hermione
quietly
you
were
the
one
who
kept
telling
me
the
book
was
dangerous
i'm
trying
to
say
Harry
that
you're
pulling
too
much
blame
on
yourself
thought
the
Prince
seemed
to
have
a
nasty
sense
of
humour
but
I
would
never
have
guessed
he
was
a
potential
killer
none
of
us
could've
guessed
Snape
would
you
know
said
Ron
silence
fell
between
them
each
of
them
lost
in
their
own
thoughts
but
Harry
was
sure
that
they
like
him
were
think-ing
about
the
following
morning
when
dumbledore's
body
would
be
laid
to
rest
harry
had
never
attended
a
funeral
before
there
had
been
no
body
to
bury
when
Sirius
had
died
he
did
not
know
what
to
expect
and
was
a
little
worried
about
what
he
might
see
about
how
he
would
feel
he
won-dered
whether
dumbledore's
death
would
be
more
real
to
him
once
the
funeral
was
over
though
he
had
moments
when
the
horrible
fact
of
it
threatened
to
overwhelm
him
there
were
blank
stretches
of
numbness
where
despite
the
fact
that
nobody
was
talking
about
anything
else
in
the
whole
castle
he
still
found
it
difficult
believe
that
Dumbledore
had
really
gone
admittedly
he
had
not
as
he
had
with
Sirius
looked
desperately
for
some
kind
of
loophole
some
way
that
Dumbledore
would
come
back
he
felt
in
his
pocket
for
the
cold
chain
of
the
fake
Horcrux
which
he
now
carried
with
him
everywhere
not
as
a
talisman
but
as
a
reminder
of
what
it
had
cost
and
what
remained
still
to
do
harry
rose
early
to
pack
the
next
day
the
Hogwarts
Express
would
be
leaving
an
hour
after
the
funeral
down-stairs
he
found
the
mood
in
the
Great
Hall
subdued
every-body
was
wearing
their
dress
robes
and
no
one
seemed
very
hungry
professor
McGonagall
had
left
the
thronelike
chair
in
the
middle
of
the
staff
table
empty
hagrid's
chair
was
des-erted
too
Harry
thought
thai
perhaps
he
had
not
been
able
to
face
breakfast
but
snape's
place
had
been
unceremoniously
filled
by
Rufus
Scrimgeour
harry
avoided
his
yellowish
eyes
as
they
scanned
the
Hall
Harry
had
the
uncomfortable
feeling
that
Scrimgeour
was
looking
for
him
among
scrimgeour's
entourage
Harry
spotted
the
red
hair
and
horn-rimmed
glasses
of
Percy
Weasley
ron
gave
no
sign
that
he
was
aware
of
Percy
apart
from
stabbing
pieces
of
kipper
with
unwonted
venom
over
at
the
Slytherin
table
Crabbe
and
Goyle
were
mutter
ing
together
hulking
boys
though
they
were
they
looked
oddly
lonely
without
the
tall
pale
figure
of
Malfoy
between
them
bossing
them
around
harry
had
not
spared
Malfoy
much
thought
his
animosity
was
all
for
Snape
but
he
had
not
forgotten
the
fear
in
malfoy's
voice
on
that
Tower
top
nor
the
fact
that
he
had
lowered
his
wand
before
the
other
Death
eaters
arrived
harry
did
not
believe
that
Malfoy
would
have
killed
Dumbledore
he
despised
Malfoy
still
for
his
infatu
ation
with
the
Dark
Arts
but
now
the
tiniest
drop
of
pity
mingled
with
his
dislike
where
Harry
wondered
was
Malfoy
now
and
what
was
Voldemort
making
him
do
under
threat
of
killing
him
and
his
parents
harry's
thoughts
were
interrupted
by
a
nudge
in
the
ribs
from
Ginny
professor
McGonagall
had
risen
to
her
feet
and
the
mournful
hum
in
the
Hall
died
away
at
once
it
is
nearly
time
she
said
please
follow
your
Heads
of
House
out
into
the
grounds
gryffindors
after
me
they
filed
out
from
behind
their
benches
in
near
silence
harry
glimpsed
Slughorn
at
the
head
of
the
Slytherin
column
wearing
magnificent
long
emerald-green
robes
embroidered
with
silver
he
had
never
seen
Professor
Sprout
Head
of
the
Hufflepuffs
looking
so
clean
there
was
not
a
single
patch
on
her
hat
and
when
they
reached
the
Entrance
Hall
they
found
Madam
Pince
standing
beside
Filch
she
in
a
thick
black
veil
that
fell
to
her
knees
he
in
an
ancient
black
suit
and
tie
reek-ing
of
mothbails
they
were
heading
as
Harry
saw
when
he
stepped
out
on
to
the
stone
steps
from
the
front
doors
towards
the
lake
the
warmth
of
the
sun
caressed
his
face
as
they
followed
Professor
McGonagall
in
silence
to
the
place
where
hundreds
of
chairs
had
been
set
out
in
rows
an
aisle
ran
down
the
centre
of
them
there
was
a
marble
table
standing
at
the
front
all
chairs
facing
it
it
was
the
most
beautiful
summer's
day
an
extraordinary
assortment
of
people
had
already
settled
into
half
of
the
chairs
shabby
and
smart
old
and
young
most
Harry
did
not
recognise
but
there
were
a
few
that
he
did
including

sup-ported
by

and
followed
by
Fred
and
George
who
were

there

the

pushed

on

the

were
there

visible
in
the
bright
sunlight
discernible
only
when
they
moved
shimmering
insubstantially
in
the
gleaming
air
harry
Ron
Hermione
and
Ginny
filed
into
seats
at
the
end
of
a
row
beside
the
lake
people
were
whispering
to
each
other
it
sounded
like
a
breeze
in
the
grass
but
the
birdsong
was
louder
by
far
the
crowd
continued
to
swell
with
a
great
rush
of
affection
for
both
of
them
Harry
saw
Neville
being
helped
into
a
seat
by
Luna
they
alone
of
all
the
da
had
responded
to
hermione's
summons
the
night
that
Dumbledore
had
died
and
Harry
knew
why
they
were
the
ones
who
had
missed
the
da
most
probably
the
ones
who
had
checked
their
coins
regularly
in
the
hope
that
there
would
be
another
meeting
cornelius
Fudge
walked
past
them
towards
the
front
rows
his
expression
miserable
twirling
his
green
bowler
hat
as
usual
Harry
next
recognised
Rita
Skeeter
who
he
was
infuri-ated
to
see
had
a
notebook
clutched
in
her
red-takmed
hand
and
then
with
a
worse
jolt
of
fury
Dolores
Umbridge
an
unconvincing
expression
of
grief
upon
her
toadlike
face
a
black
velvet
bow
set
atop
her
iron-coloured
curls
at
the
sight
of
the
centaur
Firenze
who
was
standing
like
a
sentinel
near
the
water's
edge
she
gave
a
start
and
scurried
hastily
into
a
seat
a
good
distance
away
the
staff
were
seated
at
last
harry
could
see
Scrimgeour
looking
grave
and
dignified
in
the
front
row
with
Professor
McGonagall
he
wondered
whether
Scrimgeour
or
any
of
these
important
people
were
really
sorry
that
Dumbledore
wasand
he
forgot
his
dislike
of
the
Ministry
in
looking
around
for
the
source
of
it
he
was
not
the
only
one
many
heads
were
turning
searching
a
little
alarmed
in
there
whispered
Ginny
in
harry's
ear
and
he
saw
them
in
the
clear
green
sunlit
water
inches
below
the
surface
reminding
him
horribly
of
the
Inferi
a
chorus
of
merpeople
singing
in
a
strange
language
he
did
not
understand
their
pallid
faces
rippling
their
purplish
hair
flowing
all
around
them
the
music
made
the
hair
on
harry's
neck
stand
up
and
yet
it
was
not
unpleasant
it
spoke
very
clearly
of
loss
and
of
despair
as
he
looked
down
into
the
wild
faces
of
the
singers
he
had
the
feeling
that
they
at
least
were
sorry
for
dumbledore's
passing
then
Ginny
nudged
him
again
and
he
looked
round
hagrid
was
walking
slowly
up
the
aisle
between
the
chairs
he
was
crying
quite
silently
his
face
gleaming
with
tears
and
in
his
arms
wrapped
in
purple
velvet
spangled
with
golden
stars
was
what
Harry
knew
to
be
dumbledore's
body
a
sharp
pain
rose
in
harry's
throat
at
this
sight
for
a
moment
the
strange
music
and
the
knowledge
that
dumbledore's
body
was
so
close
seemed
to
take
all
warmth
from
the
day
ron
looked
white
and
shocked
tears
were
falling
thick
and
fast
into
both
Ginny
and
hermione's
laps
they
could
not
see
clearly
what
was
happening
at
the
front
hagrid
seemed
to
have
placed
the
body
carefully
upon
the
table
now
he
retreated
down
the
aisle
blowing
his
nose
with
loud
trumpeting
noises
that
drew
scandalised
looks
from
some
including
Harry
saw
Dolores
Umbridge
but
Harry
knew
that
Dumbledore
would
not
have
cared
he
tried
to
make
a
friendly
gesture
to
Hagrid
as
he
passed
but
hagrid's
eyes
were
so
swollen
it
was
a
wonder
he
could
see
where
he
was
going
harry
glanced
at
the
back
row
to
which
Hagrid
was
heading
and
realised
what
was
guiding
him
for
there
dressed
in
a
jacket
and
trousers
each
the
size
of
a
small
mar-quee
was
the
giant
Grawp
his
great
ugly
boulder-like
head
bowed
docile
almost
human
hagrid
sat
down
next
to
his
half-brother
and
Grawp
palled
Hagrid
hard
on
the
head
so
that
his
chair
legs
sank
into
the
ground
harry
had
a
wonder-ful
momentary
urge
to
laugh
but
then
the
music
stopped
and
he
turned
to
face
the
front
again
a
little
tufty-haired
man
in
plain
black
robes
had
got
to
his
feet
and
stood
now
in
front
of
dumbledore's
body
harry
could
not
hear
what
he
was
saying
odd
words
floated
back
to
them
over
the
hundreds
of
beads
nobility
of
spirit
intel-lectual
contribution
greatness
of
heart
it
did
not
mean
very
much
it
had
little
to
do
with
Dumbledore
as
Harry
had
known
him
he
suddenly
remembered
dumbledore's
idea
of
a
few
words
nitwit
oddment
blubber
and
tweak
and
again
had
to
suppress
a
grin
what
was
the
matter
with
him
there
was
a
soft
splashing
noise
to
his
left
and
he
saw
that
the
merpeople
had
broken
the
surface
to
listen
too
he
remembered
Dumbledore
crouching
at
the
water's
edge
two
years
ago
very
close
to
where
Harry
now
sat
and
conversing
in
Mermish
with
the
Merchieftainess
harry
wondered
where
Dumbledore
had
learned
Mermish
there
was
so
much
he
had
never
asked
him
so
much
he
should
have
said
and
then
without
warning
it
swept
over
him
the
dreadful
truth
more
completely
and
undeniably
than
it
had
until
now
dumbledore
was
dead
gone
he
clutched
the
cold
locket
in
his
hand
so
tightly
that
it
hurt
but
he
could
not
prevent
hot
tears
spilling
from
his
eyes
he
looked
away
from
Ginny
and
the
others
and
stared
out
over
the
lake
towards
the
Forest
as
the
little
man
in
black
droned
on
there
was
movement
among
the
trees
the
centaurs
had
come
to
pay
their
respects
too
they
did
not
move
into
the
open
but
Harry
saw
them
standing
quite
still
half-hidden
in
shadow
watching
the
wiz-ards
their
bows
hanging
at
their
sides
and
Harry
remem-bered
his
first
nightmarish
trip
into
the
Forest
the
first
time
he
had
ever
encountered
the
thing
that
was
then
Voldemort
and
how
he
had
faced
him
and
how
he
and
Dumbledore
had
discussed
fighting
a
losing
battle
not
long
thereafter
it
was
important
Dumbledore
said
to
fight
and
fight
again
and
keep
fighting
for
only
then
could
evil
be
kept
at
bay
though
never
quite
eradicated
and
Harry
saw
very
clearly
as
be
sal
there
under
the
hot
sun
bow
people
who
cared
about
him
had
stood
in
front
of
him
one
by
one
his
mother
his
father
his
godfather
and
finally
Dumbledore
all
determined
to
protect
him
but
now
that
was
over
he
could
not
let
anybody
else
stand
between
him
and
Voldemort
he
must
abandon
for
ever
the
illusion
he
ought
to
have
lost
at
the
age
of
one
that
the
shelter
of
a
parent's
arms
meant
that
nothing
could
hurt
him
there
was
no
waking
from
his
nightmare
no
comforting
whisper
in
the
dark
that
he
was
safe
really
that
it
was
all
in
his
imagination
the
last
and
greatest
of
his
proteclors
had
died
and
he
was
more
alone
than
he
had
ever
been
before
the
little
man
in
black
had
stopped
speaking
at
last
and
resumed
his
seat
harry
waited
for
somebody
else
to
get
to
their
feet
he
expected
speeches
probably
from
the
Minister
but
nobody
moved
then
several
people
screamed
bright
white
flames
had
erupted
around
dumbledore's
body
and
the
table
upon
which
it
lay
higher
and
higher
they
rose
obscuring
the
body
white
smoke
spiralled
into
the
air
and
made
strange
shapes
Harry
thought
for
one
heart-stopping
moment
that
he
saw
a
phoenix
fly
joyfully
into
the
blue
but
next
second
the
fire
had
vanished
in
its
place
was
a
white
marble
tomb
encasing
dumbledore's
body
and
the
table
on
which
he
had
rested
there
were
a
few
more
cries
of
shock
as
a
shower
of
arrows
soared
through
the
air
but
they
fell
far
short
of
the
crowd
it
was
Harry
knew
the
centaurs
tribute
he
saw
them
turn
tail
and
disappear
back
into
the
cool
trees
likewise
the
mer-people
sank
slowly
back
into
the
green
water
and
were
lost
from
view
harry
looked
ai
Ginny
Ron
and
Hermione
ron's
face
was
screwed
up
as
though
the
sunlight
was
blinding
him
hermione's
face
was
glazed
with
tears
but
Ginny
was
no
longer
crying
she
met
harry's
gaze
with
the
same
hard
blazing
look
that
he
had
seen
when
she
had
hugged
him
after
winning
the
Quidditch
Cup
in
his
absence
and
he
knew
that
at
that
moment
they
understood
each
other
perfectly
and
that
when
he
told
her
what
he
was
going
to
do
now
she
would
not
say
Be
careful
or
don't
do
it
but
accept
his
decision
because
she
would
not
have
expected
anything
less
of
him
and
so
he
steeled
himself
to
say
what
he
had
known
he
must
say
ever
since
Dumbledore
had
died
ginny
listen
he
said
very
quietly
as
the
buzz
of
con-versation
grew
louder
around
them
and
people
began
to
get
to
their
feet
i
can't
be
involved
with
you
any
more
we've
got
to
stop
seeing
each
other
we
can't
be
together
she
said
with
an
oddly
twisted
smile
it's
for
some
stupid
noble
reason
isn't
it
it's
been
like
like
something
out
of
someone
else's
life
these
last
few
weeks
with
you
said
Harry
but
can't
we
can't
i've
got
things
to
do
alone
now
she
did
not
cry
she
simply
looked
at
him
voldemort
uses
people
his
enemies
are
close
to
he's
already
used
you
as
bait
once
and
that
was
just
because
you're
my
best
friend's
sister
think
how
much
danger
you'll
be
in
if
we
keep
this
up
he'll
know
he'll
find
out
he'll
try
and
get
to
me
through
you
what
if
I
don't
care
said
Ginny
fiercely
i
care
said
Harry
how
do
you
think
i'd
feel
if
this
was
your
funeral
and
it
was
my
fault
she
looked
away
from
him
over
the
lake
t
never
really
gave
up
on
you
she
said
not
really
i
always
hoped
hermione
told
me
to
get
on
with
life
maybe
go
out
with
some
other
people
relax
a
bit
around
you
because
I
never
used
to
be
able
to
talk
if
you
were
in
the
room
remember
and
she
thought
you
might
take
a
bit
more
notice
if
I
was
a
bit
more
myself
smart
girl
that
Hermione
said
Harry
trying
to
smile
i
just
wish
i'd
asked
you
sooner
we
coukTve
had
ages
months
years
maybe
but
you've
been
too
busy
saving
the
wizarding
world
said
Ginny
half-laughing
well
i
can't
say
i'm
surprised
i
knew
this
would
happen
in
the
end
i
knew
you
wouldn't
be
happy
unless
you
were
hunting
Voldemort
maybe
that's
why
I
like
you
so
much
harry
could
not
bear
to
hear
these
things
nor
did
he
think
his
resolution
would
hold
if
he
remained
sitting
beside
her
ron
he
saw
was
now
holding
Hermione
and
stroking
her
hair
while
she
sobbed
into
his
shoulder
tears
dripping
from
the
end
of
his
own
long
nose
with
a
miserable
gesture
Harry
got
up
turned
his
back
on
Ginny
and
on
dumbledore's
tomb
and
walked
away
around
the
lake
moving
felt
much
more
bearable
than
sitting
still
just
as
setting
out
as
soon
as
possible
to
track
down
the
Horcruxes
and
kill
Voldemort
would
feel
better
than
waiting
to
do
it
harry
he
turned
rufus
Scrimgeour
was
limping
rapidly
towards
him
around
the
bank
leaning
on
his
walking
stick
i've
been
hoping
to
have
a
word
do
you
mind
if
I
walk
a
little
way
with
you
no
said
Harry
indifferently
and
set
off
again
harry
this
was
a
dreadful
tragedy
said
Scrimgeour
quietly
I
cannot
tell
you
how
appalled
I
was
to
hear
of
it
dumbledore
was
a
very
great
wizard
we
had
our
disagree-ments
as
you
know
but
no
one
knows
better
than
what
do
you
want
asked
Harry
flatly
scrimgeour
looked
annoyed
but
as
before
hastily
modified
his
expression
to
one
of
sorrowful
understanding
you
are
of
course
devastated
he
said
i
know
that
you
were
very
close
to
Dumbledore
i
think
you
may
have
been
his
favourite
ever
pupil
the
bond
between
the
two
of
you
what
do
you
want
harry
repeated
coming
to
a
halt
scrimgeour
stopped
too
leaned
on
his
stick
and
stared
at
Harry
his
expression
shrewd
now
the
word
is
that
you
were
with
him
when
he
left
the
school
the
night
that
he
died
whose
word
said
Harry
somebody
Stupefied
a
Death
Eater
on
top
of
the
Tower
after
Dumbledore
died
there
were
also
two
broomsticks
up
there
the
Ministry
can
add
two
and
two
Harry
glad
to
hear
it
said
Harry
well
where
I
went
with
Dumbledore
and
what
we
did
is
my
business
he
didn't
want
people
to
know
such
loyalty
is
admirable
of
course
said
Scrimgeour
who
seemed
to
be
restraining
his
irritation
with
difficulty
bul
Dumbledore
is
gone
Harry
he's
gone
he
will
only
be
gone
from
the
school
when
none
here
are
loyal
to
him
said
Harry
smiling
in
spite
of
himself
my
dear
boy
even
Dumbledore
cannot
return
from
the
i
am
not
saying
he
can
you
wouldn't
understand
but
i've
got
nothing
to
tell
you
scrimgeour
hesitated
then
said
in
what
was
evidently
supposed
to
be
a
tone
of
delicacy
The
Ministry
can
offer
you
all
sorts
of
protection
you
know
Harry
i
would
be
delighted
to
place
a
couple
of
my
Aurors
at
your
service
harry
laughed
voldemort
wants
to
kill
me
himself
and
Aurors
won't
stop
him
so
thanks
for
the
offer
but
no
thanks
so
said
Scrimgeour
his
voice
cold
now
the
request
made
of
you
at
Christmas
what
request
oh
yeah
the
one
where
I
tell
the
world
what
a
great
job
you're
doing
in
exchange
for
for
raising
everyone's
morale
snapped
Scrimgeour
harry
considered
him
for
a
moment
released
Stan
Shunpike
yet
scrimgeour
turned
a
nasty
purple
colour
highly
remin-iscent
of
Uncle
Vernon
see
you
are
dumbledore's
man
through
and
through
said
Harry
that's
right
scrimgeour
glared
at
him
for
another
moment
then
turned
and
limped
away
without
another
word
harry
could
see
Percy
and
the
rest
of
the
Ministry
delegation
waiting
for
him
casting
nervous
glances
at
the
sobbing
Hagrid
and
Grawp
who
were
still
in
their
seats
ron
and
Hermione
were
hurry-ing
towards
Harry
passing
Scrimgeour
going
in
the
opposite
direction
Harry
turned
and
walked
slowly
on
waiting
for
them
to
catch
up
which
they
finally
did
in
the
shade
of
a
beech
tree
under
which
they
had
sat
in
happier
times
what
did
Scrimgeour
want
hermione
whispered
same
as
he
wanted
at
Christmas
shrugged
Harry
wanted
me
to
give
him
inside
information
on
Dumbledore
and
be
the
ministry's
new
poster
boy
ron
seemed
to
struggle
with
himself
for
a
moment
then
he
said
loudly
to
Hermione
Look
let
me
go
back
and
hit
Percy
no
she
said
firmly
grabbing
his
arm
it'll
make
me
feel
better
harry
laughed
even
Hermione
grinned
a
little
though
her
smile
faded
as
she
looked
up
at
the
castle
i
can't
bear
the
idea
that
we
might
never
come
back
she
said
softly
how
can
Hogwarts
close
maybe
it
won't
said
Ron
we're
not
in
any
more
danger
here
than
we
are
at
home
are
we
everywhere's
the
same
now
i'd
even
say
Hogwarts
is
safer
there
are
more
wizards
inside
to
defend
the
place
what
d'you
reckon
Harry
i'm
not
coming
back
even
if
it
does
reopen
said
Harry
ron
gaped
at
him
but
Hermione
said
sadly
I
knew
you
were
going
to
say
that
but
then
what
will
you
do
i'm
going
back
to
the
Dursleys
once
more
because
Dumbledore
wanted
me
to
said
Harry
but
it'll
be
a
short
visit
and
then
i'll
be
gone
for
good
but
where
will
you
go
if
you
don't
come
back
to
school
i
thought
I
might
go
back
to
godric's
Hollow
Harry
mut-tered
he
had
had
the
idea
in
his
head
ever
since
the
night
of
dumbledore's
death
for
me
it
started
there
all
of
it
i've
just
got
a
feeling
I
need
to
go
there
and
I
can
visit
my
parents
graves
i'd
like
that
and
then
what
said
Ron
then
i've
got
to
track
down
the
rest
of
the
Horcruxes
haven't
I
said
Harry
his
eyes
upon
dumbledore's
white
tomb
reflected
in
the
water
on
the
other
side
of
the
lake
that's
what
he
wanted
me
to
do
that's
why
he
told
me
all
about
them
if
Dumbledore
was
right
and
i'm
sure
he
was
there
are
still
four
of
them
out
there
i've
got
to
find
them
and
destroy
them
and
then
i've
got
to
go
after
the
seventh
bit
of
voldemort's
soul
the
bit
that's
still
in
his
body
and
i'm
the
one
who's
going
to
kill
him
and
if
I
meet
Severus
Snape
along
the
way
he
added
so
much
trie
better
tor
me
so
mucn
the
worse
for
him
there
was
a
long
silence
the
crowd
had
almost
dispersed
now
the
stragglers
giving
the
monumental
figure
of
Grawp
a
wide
berth
as
he
cuddled
Hagrid
whose
howls
of
grief
were
still
echoing
across
the
water
we'll
be
there
Harry
said
Ron
what
at
your
aunt
and
uncle's
house
said
Ron
and
then
we'll
go
with
you
wherever
you're
going
no
said
Harry
quickly
he
had
not
counted
on
this
he
had
meant
them
to
understand
that
he
was
undertaking
this
most
dangerous
journey
alone
you
said
to
us
once
before
said
Hermione
quietly
that
there
was
time
to
turn
back
if
we
wanted
to
we've
had
time
haven't
we
we're
with
you
whatever
happens
said
Ron
but
mate
you're
going
to
have
to
come
round
my
mum
and
dad's
house
before
we
do
anything
else
even
godric's
Hollow
why
bill
and
fleur's
wedding
remember
harry
looked
at
him
startled
the
idea
that
anything
as
normal
as
a
wedding
could
still
exist
seemed
incredible
and
yet
wonderful
yeah
we
shouldn't
miss
that
he
said
finally
his
hand
closed
automatically
around
the
fake
Horcrux
but
in
spite
of
everything
in
spite
of
the
dark
and
twisting
path
he
saw
stretching
ahead
for
himself
in
spite
of
the
final
meet-ing
with
Voldemort
he
knew
must
come
whether
in
a
month
in
a
year
or
in
ten
he
felt
his
heart
lift
at
the
thought
that
there
was
still
one
last
golden
day
of
peace
left
to
enjoy
with
Ron
and
Hermione
the
End
