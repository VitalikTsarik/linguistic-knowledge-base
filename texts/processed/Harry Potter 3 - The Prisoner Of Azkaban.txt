chapter
one
owl
post
harry
Potter
was
a
highly
unusual
boy
in
many
ways
for
one
thing
he
hated
the
summer
holidays
more
than
any
other
time
of
year
for
another
he
really
wanted
to
do
his
homework
but
was
forced
to
do
it
in
secret
in
the
dead
of
night
and
he
also
happened
to
be
a
wizard
it
was
nearly
midnight
and
he
was
lying
on
his
stomach
in
bed
the
blankets
drawn
right
over
his
head
like
a
tent
a
flashlight
in
one
hand
and
a
large
leatherbound
book
A
History
of
Magic
by
Bathilda
Bagshot
propped
open
against
the
pillow
harry
moved
the
tip
of
his
eaglefeather
quill
down
the
page
frowning
as
he
looked
for
something
that
would
help
him
write
his
essay
Witch
Burning
in
the
Fourteenth
Century
Was
Completely
Pointless
discuss
the
quill
paused
at
the
top
of
a
likelylooking
paragraph
harry
Pushed
his
round
glasses
up
the
bridge
of
his
nose
moved
his
flashlight
closer
to
the
book
and
read
nonmagic
people
more
commonly
known
as
Muggles
were
particularly
afraid
of
magic
in
medieval
times
but
not
very
good
at
recognizing
it
on
the
rare
occasion
that
they
did
catch
a
real
witch
or
wizard
burning
had
no
effect
whatsoever
the
witch
or
wizard
would
perform
a
basic
Flame
Freezing
Charm
and
then
pretend
to
shriek
with
pain
while
enjoying
a
gentle
tickling
sensation
indeed
Wendelin
the
Weird
enjoyed
being
burned
so
much
that
she
allowed
herself
to
be
caught
no
less
than
fortyseven
times
in
various
disguises
harry
put
his
quill
between
his
teeth
and
reached
underneath
his
pillow
for
his
ink
bottle
and
a
roll
of
parchment
slowly
and
very
carefully
he
unscrewed
the
ink
bottle
dipped
his
quill
into
it
and
began
to
write
pausing
every
now
and
then
to
listen
because
if
any
of
the
Dursleys
heard
the
scratching
of
his
quill
on
their
way
to
the
bathroom
he'd
probably
find
himself
locked
in
the
cupboard
under
the
stairs
for
the
rest
of
the
summer
the
Dursley
family
of
number
four
Privet
Drive
was
the
reason
that
Harry
never
enjoyed
his
summer
holidays
uncle
Vernon
Aunt
Petunia
and
their
son
Dudley
were
harry's
only
living
relatives
they
were
Muggles
and
they
had
a
very
medieval
attitude
toward
magic
harry's
dead
parents
who
had
been
a
witch
and
wizard
themselves
were
never
mentioned
under
the
Dursleys
roof
For
years
Aunt
Petunia
and
Uncle
Vernon
had
hoped
that
if
they
kept
Harry
as
downtrodden
as
possible
they
would
be
able
to
squash
the
magic
out
of
him
to
their
fury
they
had
been
unsuccessful
these
days
they
lived
in
terror
of
anyone
finding
out
that
Harry
had
spent
most
of
the
last
two
years
at
Hogwarts
School
of
Witchcraft
and
Wizardry
the
most
they
could
do
however
was
to
lock
away
harry's
spellbooks
wand
cauldron
and
broomstick
at
the
start
of
the
summer
break
and
forbid
him
to
talk
to
the
neighbors
this
separation
from
his
spellbooks
had
been
a
real
problem
for
Harry
because
his
teachers
at
Hogwarts
had
given
him
a
lot
of
holiday
work
one
of
the
essays
a
particularly
nasty
one
about
shrinking
potions
was
for
harry's
least
favorite
teacher
Professor
Snape
who
would
be
delighted
to
have
an
excuse
to
give
Harry
detention
for
a
month
harry
had
therefore
seized
his
chance
in
the
first
week
of
the
holidays
while
Uncle
Vernon
Aunt
Petunia
and
Dudley
had
gone
out
into
the
front
garden
to
admire
Uncle
vernon's
new
company
car
in
very
loud
voices
so
that
the
rest
of
the
street
would
notice
it
too
Harry
had
crept
downstairs
picked
the
lock
on
the
cupboard
under
the
stairs
grabbed
some
of
his
books
and
hidden
them
in
his
bedroom
as
long
as
he
didn't
leave
spots
of
ink
on
the
sheets
the
Dursleys
need
never
know
that
he
was
studying
magic
by
night
harry
was
particularly
keen
to
avoid
trouble
with
his
aunt
and
uncle
at
the
moment
as
they
were
already
in
an
especially
bad
mood
with
him
all
because
he'd
received
a
telephone
call
from
a
fellow
wizard
one
week
into
the
school
vacation
ron
Weasley
who
was
one
of
harry's
best
friends
at
Hogwarts
came
from
a
whole
family
of
wizards
this
meant
that
he
knew
a
lot
of
things
Harry
didn't
but
had
never
used
a
telephone
before
most
unluckily
it
had
been
Uncle
Vernon
who
had
answered
the
call
vernon
Dursley
speaking
harry
who
happened
to
be
in
the
room
at
the
time
froze
as
he
heard
ron's
voice
answer
hello
hello
can
you
hear
me
i
want
to
talk
to
harry
potter
ron
was
yelling
so
loudly
that
Uncle
Vernon
jumped
and
held
the
receiver
a
foot
away
from
his
ear
staring
at
it
with
an
expression
of
mingled
fury
and
alarm
who
is
this
he
roared
in
the
direction
of
the
mouthpiece
who
are
you
ron
weasley
ron
bellowed
back
as
though
he
and
Uncle
Vernon
were
speaking
from
opposite
ends
of
a
football
field
i'm
A
friend
of
harry's
from
school
uncle
vernon's
small
eyes
swiveled
around
to
Harry
who
was
rooted
to
the
spot
there
is
no
harry
potter
here
he
roared
now
holding
the
receiver
at
arm's
length
as
though
frightened
it
might
explode
i
don't
know
what
school
youre
talking
about
never
contact
me
again
don't
you
come
near
my
family
and
he
threw
the
receiver
back
onto
the
telephone
as
if
dropping
a
poisonous
spider
the
fight
that
had
followed
had
been
one
of
the
worst
ever
how
dare
you
give
this
number
to
people
like
people
like
you
uncle
Vernon
had
roared
spraying
Harry
with
spit
ron
obviously
realized
that
he'd
gotten
Harry
into
trouble
because
he
hadn't
called
again
harry's
other
best
friend
from
Hogwarts
Hermione
Granger
hadn't
been
in
touch
either
harry
suspected
that
Ron
had
warned
Hermione
not
to
call
which
was
a
pity
because
Hermione
the
cleverest
witch
in
harry's
year
had
Muggle
parents
knew
perfectly
well
how
to
use
a
telephone
and
would
probably
have
had
enough
sense
not
to
say
that
she
went
to
Hogwarts
so
Harry
had
had
no
word
from
any
of
his
wizarding
friends
for
five
long
weeks
and
this
summer
was
turning
out
to
be
almost
as
bad
as
the
last
one
there
was
just
one
very
small
improvement
after
swearing
that
he
wouldn't
use
her
to
send
letters
to
any
of
his
friends
Harry
had
been
allowed
to
let
his
owl
Hedwig
out
at
night
uncle
Vernon
had
given
in
because
of
the
racket
Hedwig
made
if
she
was
locked
in
her
cage
all
the
time
harry
finished
writing
about
Wendelin
the
Weird
and
paused
to
listen
again
the
silence
in
the
dark
house
was
broken
only
by
the
distant
grunting
snores
of
his
enormous
cousin
Dudley
it
must
be
very
late
harry
thought
his
eyes
were
itching
with
tiredness
perhaps
he'd
finish
this
essay
tomorrow
night
he
replaced
the
top
of
the
ink
bottle
pulled
an
old
pillowcase
from
under
his
bed
put
the
flashlight
A
History
of
Magic
his
essay
quill
and
ink
inside
it
got
out
of
bed
and
hid
the
lot
under
a
loose
floorboard
under
his
bed
then
he
stood
up
stretched
and
checked
the
time
on
the
luminous
alarm
clock
on
his
bedside
table
it
was
one
o'clock
in
the
morning
harry's
stomach
gave
a
funny
jolt
he
had
been
thirteen
years
old
without
realizing
it
for
a
whole
hour
yet
another
unusual
thing
about
Harry
was
how
little
he
looked
forward
to
his
birthdays
he
had
never
received
a
birthday
card
in
his
life
the
Dursleys
had
completely
ignored
his
last
two
birthdays
and
he
had
no
reason
to
suppose
they
would
remember
this
one
harry
walked
across
the
dark
room
past
hedwig's
large
empty
cage
to
the
open
window
he
leaned
on
the
sill
the
cool
night
air
pleasant
on
his
face
after
a
long
time
under
the
blankets
hedwig
had
been
absent
for
two
nights
now
harry
wasn't
worried
about
her
she'd
been
gone
this
long
before
but
he
hoped
she'd
be
back
soon
she
was
the
only
living
creature
in
this
house
who
didn't
flinch
at
the
sight
of
him
harry
though
still
rather
small
and
skinny
for
his
age
had
grown
a
few
inches
over
the
last
year
his
jetblack
hair
however
was
just
as
it
always
had
been
stubbornly
untidy
whatever
he
did
to
it
the
eyes
behind
his
glasses
were
bright
green
and
on
his
forehead
clearly
visible
through
his
hair
was
a
thin
scar
shaped
like
a
bolt
of
lightning
of
all
the
unusual
things
about
Harry
this
scar
was
the
most
extraordinary
of
all
it
was
not
as
the
Dursleys
had
pretended
for
ten
years
a
souvenir
of
the
car
crash
that
had
killed
harry's
parents
because
Lily
and
James
Potter
had
not
died
in
a
car
crash
they
had
been
murdered
murdered
by
the
most
feared
Dark
wizard
for
a
hundred
years
lord
Voldemort
harry
had
escaped
from
the
same
attack
with
nothing
more
than
a
scar
on
his
forehead
where
voldemort's
curse
instead
of
killing
him
had
rebounded
upon
its
originator
barely
alive
Voldemort
had
fled
but
Harry
had
come
facetoface
with
him
at
Hogwarts
remembering
their
last
meeting
as
he
stood
at
the
dark
window
Harry
had
to
admit
he
was
lucky
even
to
have
reached
his
thirteenth
birthday
he
scanned
the
starry
sky
for
a
sign
of
Hedwig
perhaps
soaring
back
to
him
with
a
dead
mouse
dangling
from
her
beak
expecting
praise
gazing
absently
over
the
rooftops
it
was
a
few
seconds
before
Harry
realized
what
he
was
seeing
silhouetted
against
the
golden
moon
and
growing
larger
every
moment
was
a
large
strangely
lopsided
creature
and
it
was
flapping
in
harry's
direction
he
stood
quite
still
watching
it
sink
lower
and
lower
for
a
split
second
he
hesitated
his
hand
on
the
window
latch
wondering
whether
to
slam
it
shut
but
then
the
bizarre
creature
soared
over
one
of
the
street
lamps
of
Privet
Drive
and
Harry
realizing
what
it
was
leapt
aside
through
the
window
soared
three
owls
two
of
them
holding
up
the
third
which
appeared
to
be
unconscious
they
landed
with
a
soft
flump
on
harry's
bed
and
the
middle
owl
which
was
large
and
gray
keeled
right
over
and
lay
motionless
there
was
a
large
package
tied
to
its
legs
harry
recognized
the
unconscious
owl
at
once
his
name
was
Errol
and
he
belonged
to
the
Weasley
family
harry
dashed
to
the
bed
untied
the
cords
around
errol's
legs
took
off
the
parcel
and
then
carried
Errol
to
hedwig's
cage
errol
opened
one
bleary
eye
gave
a
feeble
hoot
of
thanks
and
began
to
gulp
some
water
harry
turned
back
to
the
remaining
owls
one
of
them
the
large
snowy
female
was
his
own
Hedwig
she
too
was
carrying
a
parcel
and
looked
extremely
pleased
with
herself
she
gave
Harry
an
affectionate
nip
with
her
beak
as
he
removed
her
burden
then
flew
across
the
room
to
join
Errol
harry
didn't
recognize
the
third
owl
a
handsome
tawny
one
but
he
knew
at
once
where
it
had
come
from
because
in
addition
to
a
third
package
it
was
carrying
a
letter
bearing
the
Hogwarts
crest
when
Harry
relieved
this
owl
of
its
burden
it
ruffled
its
feathers
importantly
stretched
its
wings
and
took
off
through
the
window
into
the
night
harry
sat
down
on
his
bed
and
grabbed
errol's
package
ripped
off
the
brown
paper
and
discovered
a
present
wrapped
in
gold
and
his
first
ever
birthday
card
fingers
trembling
slightly
he
opened
the
envelope
two
pieces
of
paper
fell
out
a
letter
and
a
newspaper
clipping
the
clipping
had
clearly
come
out
of
the
wizarding
newspaper
the
Daily
Prophet
because
the
people
in
the
blackandwhite
picture
were
moving
harry
picked
up
the
clipping
smoothed
it
out
and
read

which
five
of
the

attend
harry
scanned
the
moving
photograph
and
a
grin
spread
across
his
face
as
he
saw
all
nine
of
the
Weasleys
waving
furiously
at
him
standing
in
front
of
a
large
pyramid

all
though
the

didn't
show
it
with

hair
right
in
the
middle
of
the
picture
was
Ron
tall
and
gangling
with
his
pet
rat
Scabbers
on
his
shoulder
and
his
arm
around
his
little
sister
Ginny
harry
couldn't
think
of
anyone
who
deserved
to
win
a
large
pile
of
gold
more
than
the
Weasleys
who
were
very
nice
and
extremely
poor
he
picked
up
ron's
letter
and
unfolded
it
dear
Harry

most
of
it's
gone
on
this
trip
but
they're
going
to
buy
me
a
new
wand
for
next
year
harry
remembered
only
too
well
the
occasion
when
ron's
old
wand
had
snapped
it
had
happened
when
the
car
the
two
of
them
had
been
flying
to
Hogwarts
had
crashed
into
a
tree
on
the
school
grounds
we'll
be
back
about
a
week
before

starts
and
we'll
be
going
up
to
London
to
get
my
wand
and
our
new
books
any
chance
of
meeting
you
there
don't
let
the
Muggles
get
you
down

and
come
to
London
ron
P

percy's
Head
Boy
he
got
the
letter
last
week
harry
glanced
back
at
the
photograph
percy
who
was
in
his
seventh
and
final
year
at
Hogwarts
was
looking
particularly
smug
he
had
pinned
his
Head
Boy
badge
to
the
fez
perched
jauntily
on
top
of
his
neat
hair
his
hornrimmed
glasses
flashing
in
the
Egyptian
sun
harry
now
turned
to
his
present
and
unwrapped
it
inside
was
what
looked
like
a
miniature
glass
spinning
top
there
was
another
note
from
Ron
beneath
it
harry
this
is
a
Pocket
Sneakoscope
if
there's
someone
untrustworthy
around
it's
supposed
to
light
up
and
spin
bill
says
it's
rubbish
sold
for
wizard
tourists
and
isn't
reliable
because
it
kept
lighting
up
at
dinner
last
night
but
he
didn't
realize
Fred
and
George
had
put
beetles
in
his
soup
bye
Ron
Harry
put
the
Pocket
Sneakoscope
on
his
bedside
table
where
it
stood
quite
still
balanced
on
its
point
reflecting
the
luminous
hands
of
his
clock
he
looked
at
it
happily
for
a
few
seconds
then
picked
up
the
parcel
Hedwig
had
brought
inside
this
too
there
was
a
wrapped
present
a
card
and
a
letter
this
time
from
Hermione
dear
Harry
ron
wrote
to
me
and
told
me
about
his
phone
call
to
your
Uncle
Vernon
i
do
hope
you're
all
right
i'm
on
holiday
in
France
at
the
moment
and
I
didn't
know
how
I
was
going
to
send
this
to
you
what
if
they'd
opened
it
at
customs
but
then
Hedwig
turned

good

the
wizarding
world
Did
you
see
that
picture
of
Ron
and
his
family
a
week
ago
i
bet
he's
learning
loads
i'm
really
jealous

ancient
Egyptian
wizards

fascinating

some
interesting
local
history
of
witchcraft

rewritten

whole
History
of
Magic
essay
to
include
some
of
the
things

hope

not
too

two
rolls
of
parchment

than

s.
Ron
says
percy's
Head
Boy
i'll
bet
percy's
really
pleased
Ron
doesn't
seem
too
happy
about
it
Harry
laughed
as
he
put
herrmone's
letter
aside
and
picked
up
her
present
it
was
very
heavy
knowing
Hermione
he
was
sure
it
would
be
a
large
book
full
of
very
difficult
spells
but
it
wasn't
his
heart
gave
a
huge
bound
as
he
ripped
back
the
paper
and
saw
a
sleek
black
leather
case
with
silver
words
stamped
across
it
reading
Broomstick
Servicing
Kit
wow
Hermione
harry
whispered
unzipping
the
case
to
look
inside
there
was
a
large
jar
of
fleetwood's
HighFinish
Handle
Polish
a
pair
of
gleaming
silver
TallTwig
Clippers
a
tiny
brass
compass
to
clip
on
your
broom
for
long
journeys
and
a
Handbook
of
DoItYourself
Broomcare
apart
from
his
friends
the
thing
that
Harry
missed
most
about
Hogwarts
was
Quidditch
the
most
popular
sport
in
the
magical
world
highly
dangerous
very
exciting
and
played
on
broomsticks
harry
happened
to
be
a
very
good
Quidditch
player
he
had
been
the
youngest
person
in
a
century
to
be
picked
for
one
of
the
Hogwarts
House
teams
one
of
harry's
most
prized
possessions
was
his
Nimbus
Two
Thousand
racing
broom
harry
put
the
leather
case
aside
and
picked
up
his
last
parcel
he
recognized
the
untidy
scrawl
on
the
brown
paper
at
once
this
was
from
Hagrid
the
Hogwarts
gamekeeper
he
tore
off
the
top
layer
of
paper
and
glimpsed
something
green
and
leathery
but
before
he
could
unwrap
it
properly
the
parcel
gave
a
strange
quiver
and
whatever
was
inside
it
snapped
loudly
as
though
it
had
jaws
harry
froze
he
knew
that
Hagrid
would
never
send
him
anything
dangerous
on
purpose
but
then
Hagrid
didn't
have
a
normal
person's
view
of
what
was
dangerous
hagrid
had
been
known
to
befriend
giant
spiders
buy
vicious
threeheaded
dogs
from
men
in
pubs
and
sneak
illegal
dragon
eggs
into
his
cabin
harry
poked
the
parcel
nervously
it
snapped
loudly
again
harry
reached
for
the
lamp
on
his
bedside
table
gripped
it
firmly
in
one
hand
and
raised
it
over
his
head
ready
to
strike
then
he
seized
the
rest
of
the
wrapping
paper
in
his
other
hand
and
pulled
and
out
fell
a
book
harry
just
had
time
to
register
its
handsome
green
cover
emblazoned
with
the
golden
title
The
Monster
Book
of
Monsters
before
it
flipped
onto
its
edge
and
scuttled
sideways
along
the
bed
like
some
weird
crab
uhoh
Harry
muttered
the
book
toppled
off
the
bed
with
a
loud
clunk
and
shuffled
rapidly
across
the
room
harry
followed
it
stealthily
the
book
was
hiding
in
the
dark
space
under
his
desk
praying
that
the
Dursleys
were
still
fast
asleep
Harry
got
down
on
his
hands
and
knees
and
reached
toward
it
ouch
the
book
snapped
shut
on
his
hand
and
then
flapped
past
him
still
scuttling
on
its
covers
harry
scrambled
around
threw
himself
forward
and
managed
to
flatten
it
uncle
Vernon
gave
a
loud
sleepy
grunt
in
the
room
next
door
hedwig
and
Errol
watched
interestedly
as
Harry
clamped
the
struggling
book
tightly
in
his
arms
hurried
to
his
chest
of
drawers
and
pulled
out
a
belt
which
he
buckled
tightly
around
it
the
Monster
Book
shuddered
angrily
but
could
no
longer
flap
and
snap
so
Harry
threw
it
down
on
the
bed
and
reached
for
hagrid's
card
dear
Harry
happy
Birthday
think
you
might
find
this
useful
for
next
year
won't
say
no
more
here
tell
you
when
I
see
you
hope
the
Muggles
are
treating
you
right
all
the
best
hagrid
it
struck
Harry
as
ominous
that
Hagrid
thought
a
biting
book
would
come
in
useful
but
he
put
hagrid's
card
up
next
to
ron's
and
hermione's
grinning
more
broadly
than
ever
now
there
was
only
the
letter
from
Hogwarts
left
noticing
that
it
was
rather
thicker
than
usual
Harry
slit
open
the
envelope
pulled
out
the
first
page
of
parchment
within
and
read
dear
mr.
Potter
please
note
that
the
new
school
year

begin
on
September

sincerely
professor
M
mcGonagall
Deputy
Headmistress
harry
pulled
out
the
Hogsmeade
permission
form
and
looked
at
it
no
longer
grinning
it
would
be
wonderful
to
visit
Hogsmeade
on
weekends
he
knew
it
was
an
entirely
wizarding
village
and
he
had
never
set
foot
there
but
how
on
earth
was
he
going
to
persuade
Uncle
Vernon
or
Aunt
Petunia
to
sign
the
form
he
looked
over
at
the
alarm
clock
it
was
now
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
deciding
that
he'd
worry
about
the
Hogsmeade
form
when
he
woke
up
Harry
got
back
into
bed
and
reached
up
to
cross
off
another
day
on
the
chart
he'd
made
for
himself
counting
down
the
days
left
until
his
return
to
Hogwarts
then
he
took
off
his
glasses
and
lay
down
eyes
open
facing
his
three
birthday
cards
extremely
unusual
though
he
was
at
that
moment
Harry
Potter
felt
just
like
everyone
else
glad
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
that
it
was
his
birthday
chapter
two
aunt
marge's
big
mistake
harry
went
down
to
breakfast
the
next
morning
to
find
the
three
Dursleys
already
sitting
around
the
kitchen
table
they
were
watching
a
brandnew
television
a
welcomehomeforthesummer
present
for
Dudley
who
had
been
complaining
loudly
about
the
long
walk
between
the
fridge
and
the
television
in
the
living
room
dudley
had
spent
most
of
the
summer
in
the
kitchen
his
piggy
little
eyes
fixed
on
the
screen
and
his
five
chins
wobbling
as
he
ate
continually
harry
sat
down
between
Dudley
and
Uncle
Vernon
a
large
beefy
man
with
very
little
neck
and
a
lot
of
mustache
far
from
wishing
Harry
a
happy
birthday
none
of
the
Dursleys
made
any
sign
that
they
had
noticed
Harry
enter
the
room
but
Harry
was
far
too
used
to
this
to
care
he
helped
himself
to
a
piece
of
toast
and
then
looked
up
at
the
reporter
on
the
television
who
was
halfway
through
a
report
on
an
escaped
convict
the
public
is
warned
that
Black
is
armed
and
extremely
dangerous
a
special
hot
line
has
been
set
up
and
any
sighting
of
Black
should
be
reported
immediately
no
need
to
tell
us
he's
no
good
snorted
Uncle
Vernon
staring
over
the
top
of
his
newspaper
at
the
prisoner
look
at
the
state
of
him
the
filthy
layabout
look
at
his
hair
he
shot
a
nasty
look
sideways
at
Harry
whose
untidy
hair
had
always
been
a
source
of
great
annoyance
to
Uncle
Vernon
compared
to
the
man
on
the
television
however
whose
gaunt
face
was
surrounded
by
a
matted
elbowlength
tangle
Harry
felt
very
well
groomed
indeed
the
reporter
had
reappeared
the
Ministry
of
Agriculture
and
Fisheries
will
announce
today
hang
on
barked
Uncle
Vernon
staring
furiously
at
the
reporter
you
didn't
tell
us
where
that
maniac's
escaped
from
What
use
is
that
lunatic
could
be
coming
up
the
street
right
now
aunt
Petunia
who
was
bony
and
horsefaced
whipped
around
and
peered
intently
out
of
the
kitchen
window
harry
knew
Aunt
Petunia
would
simply
love
to
be
the
one
to
call
the
hot
line
number
she
was
the
nosiest
woman
in
the
world
and
spent
most
of
her
life
spying
on
the
boring
lawabiding
neighbors
when
will
they
learn
said
Uncle
Vernon
pounding
the
table
with
his
large
purple
fist
that
hanging's
the
only
way
to
deal
with
these
people
very
true
said
Aunt
Petunia
who
was
still
squinting
into
next
door's
runner
beans
uncle
Vernon
drained
his
teacup
glanced
at
his
watch
and
added
i'd
better
be
off
in
a
minute
Petunia
marge's
train
gets
in
at
ten
harry
whose
thoughts
had
been
upstairs
with
the
Broomstick
Servicing
Kit
was
brought
back
to
earth
with
an
unpleasant
bump
aunt
Marge
he
blurted
out
sh
she's
not
coming
here
is
she
aunt
Marge
was
Uncle
vernon's
sister
even
though
she
was
not
a
blood
relative
of
harry's
whose
mother
had
been
Aunt
petunia's
sister
he
had
been
forced
to
call
her
Aunt
all
his
life
aunt
Marge
lived
in
the
country
in
a
house
with
a
large
garden
where
she
bred
bulldogs
she
didn't
often
stay
at
Privet
Drive
because
she
couldn't
bear
to
leave
her
precious
dogs
but
each
of
her
visits
stood
out
horribly
vividly
in
harry's
mind
at
dudley's
fifth
birthday
party
Aunt
Margo
had
whacked
Harry
around
the
shins
with
her
walking
stick
to
stop
him
from
beating
Dudley
at
musical
statues
a
few
years
later
she
had
turned
up
at
Christmas
with
a
computerized
robot
for
Dudley
and
a
box
of
dog
biscuits
for
Harry
on
her
last
visit
the
year
before
Harry
started
at
Hogwarts
Harry
had
accidentally
trodden
on
the
tail
of
her
favorite
dog
ripper
had
chased
Harry
out
into
the
garden
and
up
a
tree
and
Aunt
Marge
had
refused
to
call
him
off
until
past
midnight
the
memory
of
this
incident
still
brought
tears
of
laughter
to
dudley's
eyes
marge'll
be
here
for
a
week
Uncle
Vernon
snarled
and
while
we're
on
the
subject
he
pointed
a
fat
finger
threateningly
at
Harry
we
need
to
get
a
few
things
straight
before
I
go
and
collect
her
dudley
smirked
and
withdrew
his
gaze
from
the
television
watching
Harry
being
bullied
by
Uncle
Vernon
was
dudley's
favorite
form
of
entertainment
firstly
growled
Uncle
Vernon
you'll
keep
a
civil
tongue
in
your
head
when
you're
talking
to
Marge
all
right
said
Harry
bitterly
if
she
does
when
she's
talking
to
me
secondly
said
Uncle
Vernon
acting
as
though
he
had
not
heard
harry's
reply
as
Marge
doesn't
know
anything
about
your
abnormality
I
don't
want
any
any
funny
stuff
while
she's
here
you
behave
yourself
got
me
i
will
if
she
does
said
Harry
through
gritted
teeth
and
thirdly
said
Uncle
Vernon
his
mean
little
eyes
now
slits
in
his
great
purple
face
we've
told
Marge
you
attend
st.
brutus's
Secure
Center
for
Incurably
Criminal
Boys
what
harry
yelled
and
you'll
be
sticking
to
that
story
boy
or
there'll
be
trouble
spat
Uncle
Vernon
harry
sat
there
whitefaced
and
furious
staring
at
Uncle
Vernon
hardly
able
to
believe
it
aunt
Marge
coming
for
a
weeklong
visit
it
was
the
worst
birthday
present
the
Dursleys
had
ever
given
him
including
that
pair
of
Uncle
vernon's
old
socks
well
Petunia
said
Uncle
Vernon
getting
heavily
to
his
feet
i'll
be
off
to
the
station
then
want
to
come
along
for
the
ride
Dudders
no
said
Dudley
whose
attention
had
returned
to
the
television
now
that
Uncle
Vernon
had
finished
threatening
Harry
duddy's
got
to
make
himself
smart
for
his
auntie
said
Aunt
Petunia
smoothing
dudley's
thick
blond
hair
mummy's
bought
him
a
lovely
new
bow
tie
uncle
Vernon
clapped
Dudley
on
his
porky
shoulder
see
you
in
a
bit
then
he
said
and
he
left
the
kitchen
harry
who
had
been
sitting
in
a
kind
of
horrified
trance
had
a
sudden
idea
abandoning
his
toast
he
got
quickly
to
his
feet
and
followed
Uncle
Vernon
to
the
front
door
uncle
Vernon
was
pulling
on
his
car
coat
i'm
not
taking
you
he
snarled
as
he
turned
to
see
Harry
watching
him
like
I
wanted
to
come
said
Harry
coldly
i
want
to
ask
you
something
uncle
Vernon
eyed
him
suspiciously
third
years
at
Hog
at
my
school
are
allowed
to
visit
the
village
sometimes
said
Harry
so
snapped
Uncle
Vernon
taking
his
car
keys
from
a
hook
next
to
the
door
i
need
you
to
sign
the
permission
form
said
Harry
in
a
rush
and
why
should
I
do
that
sneered
Uncle
Vernon
well
said
Harry
choosing
his
words
carefully
it'll
be
hard
work
pretending
to
Aunt
Marge
I
go
to
that
st.
Whatsits
st.
brutus's
Secure
Center
for
Incurably
Criminal
Boys
bellowed
Uncle
Vernon
and
Harry
was
pleased
to
hear
a
definite
note
of
panic
in
Uncle
vernon's
voice
exactly
said
Harry
looking
calmly
up
into
Uncle
vernon's
large
purple
face
it's
a
lot
to
remember
i'll
have
to
make
it
sound
convincing
won't
I
what
if
I
accidentally
let
something
slip
you'll
get
the
stuffing
knocked
out
of
you
won't
you
roared
Uncle
Vernon
advancing
on
Harry
with
his
fist
raised
but
Harry
stood
his
ground
knocking
the
stuffing
out
of
me
won't
make
Aunt
Marge
forget
what
I
could
tell
her
he
said
grimly
uncle
Vernon
stopped
his
fist
still
raised
his
face
an
ugly
puce
but
if
you
sign
my
permission
form
Harry
went
on
quickly
I
swear
i'll
remember
where
i'm
supposed
to
go
to
school
and
i'll
act
like
a
Mug
like
i'm
normal
and
everything
harry
could
tell
that
Uncle
Vernon
was
thinking
it
over
even
if
his
teeth
were
bared
and
a
vein
was
throbbing
in
his
temple
right
he
snapped
finally
i
shall
monitor
your
behavior
carefully
during
marge's
visit
if
at
the
end
of
it
you've
toed
the
line
and
kept
to
the
story
i'll
sign
your
ruddy
form
he
wheeled
around
pulled
open
the
front
door
and
slammed
it
so
hard
that
one
of
the
little
panes
of
glass
at
the
top
fell
out
harry
didn't
return
to
the
kitchen
he
went
back
upstairs
to
his
bedroom
if
he
was
going
to
act
like
a
real
Muggle
he'd
better
start
now
slowly
and
sadly
he
gathered
up
all
his
presents
and
his
birthday
cards
and
hid
them
under
the
loose
floorboard
with
his
homework
then
he
went
to
hedwig's
cage
errol
seemed
to
have
recovered
he
and
Hedwig
were
both
asleep
heads
under
their
wings
harry
sighed
then
poked
them
both
awake
hedwig
he
said
gloomily
you're
going
to
have
to
clear
off
for
a
week
go
with
Errol
ron'll
look
after
you
i'll
write
him
a
note
explaining
and
don't
look
at
me
like
that
hedwig's
large
amber
eyes
were
reproachful
it's
not
my
fault
it's
the
only
way
i'll
be
allowed
to
visit
Hogsmeade
with
Ron
and
Hermione
ten
minutes
later
Errol
and
Hedwig
who
had
a
note
to
Ron
bound
to
her
leg
soared
out
of
the
window
and
out
of
sight
harry
now
feeling
thoroughly
miserable
put
the
empty
cage
away
inside
the
wardrobe
but
Harry
didn't
have
long
to
brood
in
next
to
no
time
Aunt
Petunia
was
shrieking
up
the
stairs
for
Harry
to
come
down
and
get
ready
to
welcome
their
guest
do
something
about
your
hair
aunt
Petunia
snapped
as
he
reached
the
hall
harry
couldn't
see
the
point
of
trying
to
make
his
hair
lie
flat
aunt
Marge
loved
criticizing
him
so
the
untidier
he
looked
the
happier
she
would
be
all
too
soon
there
was
a
crunch
of
gravel
outside
as
Uncle
vernon's
car
pulled
back
into
the
driveway
then
the
clunk
of
the
car
doors
and
footsteps
on
the
garden
path
get
the
door
aunt
Petunia
hissed
at
Harry
a
feeling
of
great
gloom
in
his
stomach
Harry
pulled
the
door
open
on
the
threshold
stood
Aunt
Marge
she
was
very
like
Uncle
Vernon
large
beefy
and
purple
faced
she
even
had
a
mustache
though
not
as
bushy
as
his
in
one
hand
she
held
an
enormous
suitcase
and
tucked
under
the
other
was
an
old
and
eviltempered
bulldog
where's
my
Dudders
roared
Aunt
Marge
where's
my
neffypoo
dudley
came
waddling
down
the
hall
his
blond
hair
plastered
flat
to
his
fat
head
a
bow
tie
just
visible
under
his
many
chins
aunt
Marge
thrust
the
suitcase
into
harry's
stomach
knocking
the
wind
out
of
him
seized
Dudley
in
a
tight
onearmed
hug
and
planted
a
large
kiss
on
his
cheek
harry
knew
perfectly
well
that
Dudley
only
put
up
with
Aunt
marge's
hugs
because
he
was
well
paid
for
it
and
sure
enough
when
they
broke
apart
dudley
had
a
crisp
twentypound
note
clutched
in
his
fat
fist
petunia
shouted
Aunt
Marge
striding
past
Harry
as
though
he
was
a
hat
stand
aunt
Marge
and
Aunt
Petunia
kissed
or
rather
Aunt
Marge
bumped
her
large
jaw
against
Aunt
petunia's
bony
cheekbone
uncle
Vernon
now
came
in
smiling
jovially
as
he
shut
the
door
tea
Marge
he
said
and
what
will
Ripper
take
ripper
can
have
some
tea
out
of
my
saucer
said
Aunt
Marge
as
they
all
proceeded
into
the
kitchen
leaving
Harry
alone
in
the
hall
with
the
suitcase
but
Harry
wasn't
complaining
any
excuse
not
to
be
with
Aunt
Marge
was
fine
by
him
so
he
began
to
heave
the
case
upstairs
into
the
spare
bedroom
taking
as
long
as
he
could
by
the
time
he
got
back
to
the
kitchen
Aunt
Marge
had
been
supplied
with
tea
and
fruitcake
and
Ripper
was
lapping
noisily
in
the
corner
harry
saw
Aunt
Petunia
wince
slightly
as
specks
of
tea
and
drool
flecked
her
clean
floor
aunt
Petunia
hated
animals
who's
looking
after
the
other
dogs
Marge
uncle
Vernon
asked
oh
i've
got
Colonel
Fubster
managing
them
boomed
Aunt
Marge
he's
retired
now
good
for
him
to
have
something
to
do
but
I
couldn't
leave
poor
old
Ripper
he
pines
if
he's
away
from
me
ripper
began
to
growl
again
as
Harry
sat
down
this
directed
Aunt
marge's
attention
to
Harry
for
the
first
time
so
she
barked
still
here
are
you
yes
said
Harry
don't
you
say
yes
in
that
ungrateful
tone
Aunt
Marge
growled
it's
damn
good
of
Vernon
and
Petunia
to
keep
you
wouldn't
have
done
it
myself
you'd
have
gone
straight
to
an
orphanage
if
you'd
been
dumped
on
my
doorstep
harry
was
bursting
to
say
that
he'd
rather
live
in
an
orphanage
than
with
the
Dursleys
but
the
thought
of
the
Hogsmeade
form
stopped
him
he
forced
his
face
into
a
painful
smile
don't
you
smirk
at
me
boomed
Aunt
Marge
i
can
see
you
haven't
improved
since
I
last
saw
you
i
hoped
school
would
knock
some
manners
into
you
she
took
a
large
gulp
of
tea
wiped
her
mustache
and
said
where
is
it
that
you
send
him
again
Vernon
st.
brutus's
said
Uncle
Vernon
promptly
it's
a
firstrate
institution
for
hopeless
cases
i
see
said
Aunt
Marge
do
they
use
the
cane
at
st.
brutus's
boy
she
barked
across
the
table
er
uncle
Vernon
nodded
curtly
behind
Aunt
marge's
back
yes
said
Harry
then
feeling
he
might
as
well
do
the
thing
properly
he
added
all
the
time
excellent
said
Aunt
Marge
i
won't
have
this
nambypamby
wishywashy
nonsense
about
not
hitting
people
who
deserve
it
a
good
thrashing
is
what's
needed
in
ninetynine
cases
out
of
a
hundred
have
you
been
beaten
often
oh
yeah
said
Harry
loads
of
times
aunt
Marge
narrowed
her
eyes
i
still
don't
like
your
tone
boy
she
said
if
you
can
speak
of
your
beatings
in
that
casual
way
they
clearly
aren't
hitting
you
hard
enough
petunia
i'd
write
if
I
were
you
make
it
clear
that
you
approve
the
use
of
extreme
force
in
this
boy's
case
perhaps
Uncle
Vernon
was
worried
that
Harry
might
forget
their
bargain
in
any
case
he
changed
the
subject
abruptly
heard
the
news
this
morning
Marge
what
about
that
escaped
prisoner
eh
as
Aunt
Marge
started
to
make
herself
at
home
Harry
caught
himself
thinking
almost
longingly
of
life
at
number
four
without
her
uncle
Vernon
and
Aunt
Petunia
usually
encouraged
Harry
to
stay
out
of
their
way
which
Harry
was
only
too
happy
to
do
aunt
Marge
on
the
other
hand
wanted
Harry
under
her
eye
at
all
times
so
that
she
could
boom
out
suggestions
for
his
improvement
she
delighted
in
comparing
Harry
with
Dudley
and
took
huge
pleasure
in
buying
Dudley
expensive
presents
while
glaring
at
Harry
as
though
daring
him
to
ask
why
he
hadn't
got
a
present
too
she
also
kept
throwing
out
dark
hints
about
what
made
Harry
such
an
unsatisfactory
person
you
mustn't
blame
yourself
for
the
way
the
boy's
turned
out
Vernon
she
said
over
lunch
on
the
third
day
if
there's
something
rotten
on
the
inside
there's
nothing
anyone
can
do
about
it
harry
tried
to
concentrate
on
his
food
but
his
hands
shook
and
his
face
was
starting
to
burn
with
anger
remember
the
form
he
told
himself
Think
about
Hogsmeade
don't
say
anything
don't
rise
Aunt
Marge
reached
for
her
glass
of
wine
it's
one
of
the
basic
rules
of
breeding
she
said
you
see
it
all
the
time
with
dogs
if
there's
something
wrong
with
the
bitch
there'll
be
something
wrong
with
the
pup
at
that
moment
the
wineglass
Aunt
Marge
was
holding
exploded
in
her
hand
shards
of
glass
flew
in
every
direction
and
Aunt
Marge
sputtered
and
blinked
her
great
ruddy
face
dripping
marge
squealed
Aunt
Petunia
marge
are
you
all
right
not
to
worry
grunted
Aunt
Marge
mopping
her
face
with
her
napkin
must
have
squeezed
it
too
hard
did
the
same
thing
at
Colonel
fubster's
the
other
day
no
need
to
fuss
Petunia
I
have
a
very
firm
grip
but
Aunt
Petunia
and
Uncle
Vernon
were
both
looking
at
Harry
suspiciously
so
he
decided
he'd
better
skip
dessert
and
escape
from
the
table
as
soon
as
he
could
outside
in
the
hall
he
leaned
against
the
wall
breathing
deeply
It
had
been
a
long
time
since
he'd
lost
control
and
made
something
explode
he
couldn't
afford
to
let
it
happen
again
the
Hogsmeade
form
wasn't
the
only
thing
at
stake
if
he
carried
on
like
that
he'd
be
in
trouble
with
the
Ministry
of
Magic
harry
was
still
an
underage
wizard
and
he
was
forbidden
by
wizard
law
to
do
magic
outside
school
his
record
wasn't
exactly
clean
either
only
last
summer
he'd
gotten
an
official
warning
that
had
stated
quite
clearly
that
if
the
Ministry
got
wind
of
any
more
magic
in
Privet
Drive
harry
would
face
expulsion
from
Hogwarts
he
heard
the
Dursleys
leaving
the
table
and
hurried
upstairs
out
of
the
way
harry
got
through
the
next
three
days
by
forcing
himself
to
think
about
his
Handbook
of
DoItYourself
Broomcare
whenever
Aunt
Marge
started
on
him
this
worked
quite
well
though
it
seemed
to
give
him
a
glazed
look
because
Aunt
Marge
started
voicing
the
opinion
that
he
was
mentally
subnormal
at
last
at
long
last
the
final
evening
of
marge's
stay
arrived
aunt
Petunia
cooked
a
fancy
dinner
and
Uncle
Vernon
uncorked
several
bottles
of
wine
they
got
all
the
way
through
the
soup
and
the
salmon
without
a
single
mention
of
harry's
faults
during
the
lemon
meringue
pie
Uncle
vernon
bored
them
A
with
a
long
talk
about
Grunnings
his
drillmaking
company
then
Aunt
Petunia
made
coffee
and
Uncle
Vernon
brought
out
a
bottle
of
brandy
can
I
tempt
you
Marge
aunt
Marge
had
already
had
quite
a
lot
of
wine
her
huge
face
was
very
red
just
a
small
one
then
she
chuckled
a
bit
more
than
that
and
a
bit
more
that's
the
ticket
dudley
was
eating
his
fourth
slice
of
pie
aunt
Petunia
was
sipping
coffee
with
her
little
finger
sticking
out
harry
really
wanted
to
disappear
into
his
bedroom
but
he
met
Uncle
vernon's
angry
little
eyes
and
knew
he
would
have
to
sit
it
out
aah
said
Aunt
Marge
smacking
her
lips
and
putting
the
empty
brandy
glass
back
down
excellent
nosh
Petunia
it's
normally
just
a
fryup
for
me
of
an
evening
with
twelve
dogs
to
look
after
she
burped
richly
and
patted
her
great
tweed
stomach
pardon
me
but
I
do
like
to
see
a
healthysized
boy
she
went
on
winking
at
Dudley
you'll
be
a
propersized
man
Dudders
like
your
father
yes
i'll
have
a
spot
more
brandy
Vernon
now
this
one
here
she
jerked
her
head
at
Harry
who
felt
his
stomach
clench
the
Handbook
he
thought
quickly
this
one's
got
a
mean
runty
look
about
him
you
get
that
with
dogs
i
had
Colonel
Fubster
drown
one
last
year
ratty
little
thing
it
was
Weak
underbred
harry
was
trying
to
remember
page
twelve
of
his
book
A
Charm
to
Cure
Reluctant
Reversers
it
all
comes
down
to
blood
as
I
was
saying
the
other
day
bad
blood
will
out
now
i'm
saying
nothing
against
your
family
petunia
she
patted
Aunt
petunia's
bony
hand
with
her
shovellike
one
but
your
sister
was
a
bad
egg
they
turn
up
in
the
best
families
then
she
ran
off
with
a
wastrel
and
here's
the
result
right
in
front
of
us
harry
was
staring
at
his
plate
a
funny
ringing
in
his
ears
grasp
your
broom
firmly
by
the
tail
he
thought
but
he
couldn't
remember
what
came
next
aunt
marge's
voice
seemed
to
be
boring
into
him
like
one
of
Uncle
vernon's
drills
this
Potter
said
Aunt
Marge
loudly
seizing
the
brandy
bottle
and
splashing
more
into
her
glass
and
over
the
tablecloth
you
never
told
me
what
he
did
uncle
Vernon
and
Aunt
Petunia
were
looking
extremely
tense
dudley
had
even
looked
up
from
his
pie
to
gape
at
his
parents
he
didn't
work
said
Uncle
Vernon
with
half
a
glance
at
Harry
unemployed
as
I
expected
said
Aunt
Marge
taking
a
huge
swig
of
brandy
and
wiping
her
chin
on
her
sleeve
a
noaccount
goodfornothing
lazy
scrounger
who
he
was
not
said
Harry
suddenly
the
table
went
very
quiet
harry
was
shaking
all
over
he
had
never
felt
so
angry
in
his
life
more
brandy
yelled
Uncle
Vernon
who
had
gone
very
white
he
emptied
the
bottle
into
Aunt
marge's
glass
you
boy
he
snarled
at
Harry
go
to
bed
go
on
no
Vernon
hiccuped
Aunt
Marge
holding
up
a
hand
her
tiny
bloodshot
eyes
fixed
on
harry's
go
on
boy
go
on
proud
of
your
parents
are
you
they
go
and
get
themselves
killed
in
a
car
crash
drunk
I
expect
they
didn't
die
in
a
car
crash
said
Harry
who
found
himself
on
his
feet
they
died
in
a
car
crash
you
nasty
little
liar
and
left
you
to
be
a
burden
on
their
decent
hardworking
relatives
screamed
Aunt
Marge
swelling
with
fury
you
are
an
insolent
ungrateful
little
but
Aunt
Marge
suddenly
stopped
speaking
for
a
moment
it
looked
as
though
words
had
failed
her
she
seemed
to
be
swelling
with
inexpressible
anger
but
the
swelling
didn't
stop
her
great
red
face
started
to
expand
her
tiny
eyes
bulged
and
her
mouth
stretched
too
tightly
for
speech
next
second
several
buttons
had
just
burst
from
her
tweed
jacket
and
pinged
off
the
walls
she
was
inflating
like
a
monstrous
balloon
her
stomach
bursting
free
of
her
tweed
waistband
each
of
her
fingers
blowing
up
like
a
salami
marge
yelled
Uncle
Vernon
and
Aunt
Petunia
together
as
Aunt
marge's
whole
body
began
to
rise
off
her
chair
toward
the
ceiling
she
was
entirely
round
now
like
a
vast
life
buoy
with
piggy
eyes
and
her
hands
and
feet
stuck
out
weirdly
as
she
drifted
up
into
the
air
making
apoplectic
popping
noises
ripper
came
skidding
into
the
room
barking
madly
nooooooo
uncle
Vernon
seized
one
of
marge's
feet
and
tried
to
pull
her
down
again
but
was
almost
lifted
from
the
floor
himself
a
second
later
ripper
leapt
forward
and
sank
his
teeth
into
Uncle
vernon's
leg
harry
tore
from
the
dining
room
before
anyone
could
stop
him
heading
for
the
cupboard
under
the
stairs
the
cupboard
door
burst
magically
open
as
he
reached
it
in
seconds
he
had
heaved
his
trunk
to
the
front
door
he
sprinted
upstairs
and
threw
himself
under
the
bed
wrenching
up
the
loose
floorboard
and
grabbed
the
pillowcase
full
of
his
books
and
birthday
presents
he
wriggled
out
seized
hedwig's
empty
cage
and
dashed
back
downstairs
to
his
trunk
just
as
Uncle
Vernon
burst
out
of
the
dining
room
his
trouser
leg
in
bloody
tatters
come
back
in
here
he
bellowed
come
back
and
put
her
right
but
a
reckless
rage
had
come
over
Harry
he
kicked
his
trunk
open
pulled
out
his
wand
and
pointed
it
at
Uncle
Vernon
she
deserved
it
Harry
said
breathing
very
fast
she
deserved
what
she
got
you
keep
away
from
me
he
fumbled
behind
him
for
the
latch
on
the
door
i'm
going
Harry
said
i've
had
enough
and
in
the
next
moment
he
was
out
in
the
dark
quiet
street
heaving
his
heavy
trunk
behind
him
hedwig's
cage
under
his
arm
chapter
three
the
knight
bus
harry
was
several
streets
away
before
he
collapsed
onto
a
low
wall
in
Magnolia
Crescent
panting
from
the
effort
of
dragging
his
trunk
he
sat
quite
still
anger
still
surging
through
him
listening
to
the
frantic
thumping
of
his
heart
but
after
ten
minutes
alone
in
the
dark
street
a
new
emotion
overtook
him
panic
whichever
way
he
looked
at
it
he
had
never
been
in
a
worse
fix
he
was
stranded
quite
alone
in
the
dark
Muggle
world
with
absolutely
nowhere
to
go
and
the
worst
of
it
was
he
had
just
done
serious
magic
which
meant
that
he
was
almost
certainly
expelled
from
Hogwarts
he
had
broken
the
Decree
for
the
Restriction
of
Underage
Wizardry
so
badly
he
was
surprised
Ministry
of
Magic
representatives
weren't
swooping
down
on
him
where
he
sat
harry
shivered
and
looked
up
and
down
Magnolia
Crescent
what
was
going
to
happen
to
him
would
he
be
arrested
or
would
he
simply
be
outlawed
from
the
wizarding
world
he
thought
of
Ron
and
Hermione
and
his
heart
sank
even
lower
harry
was
sure
that
criminal
or
not
Ron
and
Hermione
would
want
to
help
him
now
but
they
were
both
abroad
and
with
Hedwig
gone
he
had
no
means
of
contacting
them
he
didn't
have
any
Muggle
money
either
there
was
a
little
wizard
gold
in
the
money
bag
at
the
bottom
of
his
trunk
but
the
rest
of
the
fortune
his
parents
had
left
him
was
stored
in
a
vault
at
Gringotts
Wizarding
Bank
in
London
he'd
never
be
able
to
drag
his
trunk
all
the
way
to
London
unless
he
looked
down
at
his
wand
which
he
was
still
clutching
in
his
hand
if
he
was
already
expelled
his
heart
was
now
thumping
painfully
fast
a
bit
more
magic
couldn't
hurt
he
had
the
Invisibility
Cloak
he
had
inherited
from
his
father
what
if
he
bewitched
the
trunk
to
make
it
featherlight
tied
it
to
his
broomstick
covered
himself
in
the
cloak
and
flew
to
London
then
he
could
get
the
rest
of
his
money
out
of
his
vault
and
begin
his
life
as
an
outcast
it
was
a
horrible
prospect
but
he
couldn't
sit
on
this
wall
forever
or
he'd
find
himself
trying
to
explain
to
Muggle
police
why
he
was
out
in
the
dead
of
night
with
a
trunkful
of
spellbooks
and
a
broomstick
harry
opened
his
trunk
again
and
pushed
the
contents
aside
looking
for
the
Invisibility
Cloak
but
before
he
had
found
it
he
straightened
up
suddenly
looking
around
him
once
more
a
funny
prickling
on
the
back
of
his
neck
had
made
Harry
feel
he
was
being
watched
but
the
street
appeared
to
be
deserted
and
no
lights
shone
from
any
of
the
large
square
houses
he
bent
over
his
trunk
again
but
almost
immediately
stood
up
once
more
his
hand
clenched
on
his
wand
he
had
sensed
rather
than
heard
it
someone
or
something
was
standing
in
the
narrow
gap
between
the
garage
and
the
fence
behind
him
harry
squinted
at
the
black
alleyway
if
only
it
would
move
then
he'd
know
whether
it
was
just
a
stray
cat
or
something
else
lumos
Harry
muttered
and
a
light
appeared
at
the
end
of
his
wand
almost
dazzling
him
he
held
it
high
over
his
head
and
the
pebbledashed
walls
of
number
two
suddenly
sparkled
the
garage
door
gleamed
and
between
them
Harry
saw
quite
distinctly
the
hulking
outline
of
something
very
big
with
wide
gleaming
eyes
harry
stepped
backward
his
legs
hit
his
trunk
and
he
tripped
his
wand
flew
out
of
his
hand
as
he
flung
out
an
arm
to
break
his
fall
and
he
landed
hard
in
the
gutter
There
was
a
deafening
bang
and
Harry
threw
up
his
hands
to
shield
his
eyes
against
a
sudden
blinding
light
With
a
yell
he
rolled
back
onto
the
pavement
just
in
time
a
second
later
a
gigantic
pair
of
wheels
and
headlights
screeched
to
a
halt
exactly
where
Harry
had
just
been
lying
they
belonged
as
Harry
saw
when
he
raised
his
head
to
a
tripledecker
violently
purple
bus
which
had
appeared
out
of
thin
air
gold
lettering
over
the
windshield
spelled
The
Knight
Bus
for
a
Split
second
Harry
wondered
if
he
had
been
knocked
silly
by
his
fall
then
a
conductor
in
a
purple
uniform
leapt
out
of
the
bus
and
began
to
speak
loudly
to
the
night
welcome
to
the
Knight
Bus
emergency
transport
for
the
stranded
witch
or
wizard
just
stick
out
your
wand
hand
step
on
board
and
we
can
take
you
anywhere
you
want
to
go
my
name
is
Stan
Shunpike
and
I
will
be
your
conductor
this
eve
the
conductor
stopped
abruptly
he
had
just
caught
sight
of
Harry
who
was
still
sitting
on
the
ground
harry
snatched
up
his
wand
again
and
scrambled
to
his
feet
close
up
he
saw
that
Stan
Shunpike
was
only
a
few
years
older
than
he
was
eighteen
or
nineteen
at
most
with
large
protruding
ears
and
quite
a
few
pimples
what
were
you
doin
down
there
said
Stan
dropping
his
professional
manner
fell
over
said
Harry
choo
fall
over
for
sniggered
Stan
i
didn't
do
it
on
purpose
said
Harry
annoyed
one
of
the
knees
in
his
jeans
was
torn
and
the
hand
he
had
thrown
out
to
break
his
fall
was
bleeding
he
suddenly
remembered
why
he
had
fallen
over
and
turned
around
quickly
to
stare
at
the
alleyway
between
the
garage
and
fence
the
Knight
bus's
headlamps
were
flooding
it
with
light
and
it
was
empty
choo
lookin
at
said
Stan
there
was
a
big
black
thing
said
Harry
pointing
uncertainly
into
the
gap
like
a
dog
but
massive
he
looked
around
at
Stan
whose
mouth
was
slightly
open
with
a
feeling
of
unease
Harry
saw
stan's
eyes
move
to
the
scar
on
harry's
forehead
woss
that
on
your
ead
said
Stan
abruptly
nothing
said
Harry
quickly
flattening
his
hair
over
his
scar
if
the
Ministry
of
Magic
was
looking
for
him
he
didn't
want
to
make
it
too
easy
for
them
woss
your
name
stan
persisted
neville
Longbottom
said
Harry
saying
the
first
name
that
came
into
his
head
so
so
this
bus
he
went
on
quickly
hoping
to
distract
Stan
did
you
say
it
goes
anywhere
yep
said
Stan
proudly
anywhere

like
long's
it's
on
land

he
said
looking
suspicious
again
You

Harry
quickly

harry
rummaged
once
more
in
his
trunk
extracted
his
money
bag
and
shoved
some
gold
into
stan's
hand
he
and
Stan
then
lifted
his
trunk
with
hedwig's
cage
balanced
on
top
up
the
steps
of
the
bus
there
were
no
seats
instead
half
a
dozen
brass
bedsteads
stood
beside
the
curtained
windows
candles
were
burning
in
brackets
beside
each
bed
illuminating
the
woodpaneled
walls
a
tiny
wizard
in
a
nightcap
at
the
rear
of
the
bus
muttered
Not

thanks
i'm
pickling
some
slugs
and
rolled
over
in
his
sleep
you
ave
this
one
Stan
whispered
shoving
harry's
trunk
under
the
bed
right
behind
the
driver
who
was
sitting
in
an
armchair
in
front
of
the
steering
wheel
this
is
our
driver
Ernie
Prang
this
is
Neville
Longbottom
Ern
ernie
Prang
an
elderly
wizard
wearing
very
thick
glasses
nodded
to
Harry
who
nervously
flattened
his
bangs
again
and
sat
down
on
his
bed
take
er
away
Ern
said
Stan
sitting
down
in
the
armchair
next
to
ernie's
there
was
another
tremendous
bang
and
the
next
moment
Harry
found
himself
flat
on
his
bed
thrown
backward
by
the
speed
of
the
Knight
Bus
pulling
himself
up
Harry
stared
out
of
the
dark
window
and
saw
that
they
were
now
bowling
along
a
completely
different
street
stan
was
watching
harry's
stunned
face
with
great
enjoyment
this
is
where
we
was
before
you
flagged
us
down
he
said
where
are
we
Ern
somewhere
in
Wales
ar
said
Ernie
how

Harry

Stan
contemptuously

up
Madam
Marsh
Stan
said
Ern
we'll
be
in
Abergavenny
in
a
minute
stan
passed
harry's
bed
and
disappeared
up
a
narrow
wooden
staircase
harry
was
still
looking
out
of
the
window
feeling
increasingly
nervous
ernie
didn't
seem
to
have
mastered
the
use
of
a
steering
wheel
the
Knight
Bus
kept
mounting
the
pavement
but
it
didn't
hit
anything
lines
of
lampposts
mailboxes
and
trash
cans
jumped
out
of
its
way
as
it
approached
and
back
into
position
once
it
had
passed
stan
came
back
downstairs
followed
by
a
faintly
green
witch
wrapped
in
a
traveling
cloak
ere
you
go
Madam
Marsh
said
Stan
happily
as
Ern
stamped
on
the
brake
and
the
beds
slid
a
foot
or
so
toward
the
front
of
the
bus
madam
Marsh
clamped
a
handkerchief
to
her
mouth
and
tottered
down
the
steps
stan
threw
her
bag
out
after
her
and
rammed
the
doors
shut
there
was
another
loud
bang
and
they
were
thundering
down
a
narrow
country
lane
trees
leaping
out
of
the
way
harry
wouldn't
have
been
able
to
sleep
even
if
he
had
been
traveling
on
a
bus
that
didn't
keep
banging
loudly
and
jumping
a
hundred
miles
at
a
time
his
stomach
churned
as
he
fell
back
to
wondering
what
was
going
to
happen
to
him
and
whether
the
Dursleys
had
managed
to
get
Aunt
Marge
off
the
ceiling
yet
stan
had
unfurled
a
copy
of
the
Daily
Prophet
and
was
now
reading
with
his
tongue
between
his
teeth
a
large
photograph
of
a
sunkenfaced
man
with
long
matted
hair
blinked
slowly
at
Harry
from
the
front
page
he
looked
strangely
familiar
that
man
harry
said
forgetting
his
troubles
for
a
moment
he
was
on
the
Muggle
news
stanley
turned
to
the
front
page
and
chuckled
sirius
Black
he
said
nodding
course
e
was
on
the
Muggle
news
neville
where
you
been
he
gave
a
superior
sort
of
chuckle
at
the
blank
look
on
harry's
face
removed
the
front
page
and
handed
it
to
Harry
you
oughta
read
the
papers
more
Neville
harry
held
the
paper
up
to
the
candlelight
and
read
black
still
at
large
Sirius
Black
possibly
the
most
infamous
prisoner
ever
to
be
held
in
Azkaban
fortress
is
still
eluding
capture
the
Ministry
of
Magic
confirmed
today
we
are
doing
all
we
can
to
recapture
Black
said
the
Minister
of
Magic
Cornelius
Fudge
this
morning
and
we
beg
the
magical
community
to
remain
calm
fudge
has
been
criticized
by
some
members
of
the
International
federation
of
Warlocks
for
informing
the
Muggle
Prime
Minister
of
the
crisis
well
really
I
had
to
don't
you
know
said
an
irritable
Fudge
black
is
mad
he's
a
danger
to
anyone
who
crosses
him
magic
or
Muggle
i
have
the
Prime
minister's
assurance
that
he
will
not
breathe
a
word
of
black's
true
identity
to
anyone
and
let's
face
itwho'd
believe
him
if
he
did
while
Muggles
have
been
told
that
Black
is
carrying
a
gun
a
kind
of
metal
wand
that
Muggles
use
to
kill
each
other
the
magical
community
lives
in
fear
of
a
massacre
like
that
of
twelve
years
ago
when
Black
murdered
thirteen
people
with
a
single
curse
harry
looked
into
the
shadowed
eyes
of
Sirius
Black
the
only
part
of
the
sunken
face
that
seemed
alive
harry
had
never
met
a
vampire
but
he
had
seen
pictures
of
them
in
his
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
classes
and
Black
with
his
waxy
white
skin
looked
just
like
one
scarylookin
fing
inee
said
Stan
who
had
been
watching
Harry
read
he
murdered
thirteen
people
said
Harry
handing

Stan

Ern
jerked
the
steering
wheel
so
hard
that

whole
farmhouse

collywobbles
stan
put
the
paper
away
reluctantly
and
Harry
leaned
against
the
window
of
the
Knight
Bus
feeling
worse
than
ever
he
couldn't
help
imagining
what
Stan
might
be
telling
his
passengers
in
a
few
nights
time
ear
about
that
Arry
Potter
blew
up
is
aunt
we
ad
im
ere
on
the
Knight
Bus
di'n't
we
Ern
e
was
tryin
I
to
run
for
it
he
Harry
had
broken
wizard
law
just
like
Sirius
Black
was
inflating
Aunt
Marge
bad
enough
to
land
him
in
Azkaban
harry
didn't
know
anything
about
the
wizard
prison
though
everyone
he'd
ever
heard
speak
of
it
did
so
in
the
same
fearful
tone
hagrid
the
Hogwarts
gamekeeper
had
spent
two
months
there
only
last
year
harry
wouldn't
soon
forget
the
look
of
terror
on
hagrid's
face
when
he
had
been
told
where
he
was
going
and
Hagrid
was
one
of
the
bravest
people
Harry
knew
the
Knight
Bus
rolled
through
the
darkness
scattering
bushes
and
wastebaskets
telephone
booths
and
trees
and
Harry
lay
restless
and
miserable
on
his
feather
bed
after
a
while
Stan
remembered
that
Harry
had
paid
for
hot
chocolate
but
poured
it
all
over
harry's
pillow
when
the
bus
moved
abruptly
from
Anglesea
to
Aberdeen
one
by
one
wizards
and
witches
in
dressing
gowns
and
slippers
descended
from
the
upper
floors
to
leave
the
bus
they
all
looked
very
pleased
to
go
finally
Harry
was
the
only
passenger
left
right
then
Neville
said
Stan
clapping
his
hands
where
abouts
in
London
diagon
Alley
said
Harry
righto
said
Stan
old
tight
then
bang
they
were
thundering
along
Charing
Cross
Road
harry
sat
up
and
watched
buildings
and
benches
squeezing
themselves
out
of
the
Knight
bus's
way
the
sky
was
getting
a
little
lighter
he
would
lie
low
for
a
couple
of
hours
go
to
Gringotts
the
moment
it
opened
then
set
off
where
he
didn't
know
ern
slammed
on
the
brakes
and
the
Knight
Bus
skidded
to
a
halt
in
front
of
a
small
and
shabby
looking
pub
the
Leaky
Cauldron
behind
which
lay
the
magical
entrance
to
Diagon
Alley
thanks
Harry
said
to
Ern
he
jumped
down
the
steps
and
helped
Stan
lower
his
trunk
and
hedwig's
cage
onto
the
pavement
well
said
Harry
bye
then
but
Stan
wasn't
paying
attention
still
standing
in
the
doorway
to
the
bus
he
was
goggling
at
the
shadowy
entrance
to
the
Leaky
Cauldron
there
you
are
Harry
said
a
voice
before
Harry
could
turn
he
felt
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
at
the
same
time
Stan
shouted
Blimey
ern
come
ere
come
ere
I
harry
looked
up
at
the
owner
of
the
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
felt
a
bucketful
of
ice
cascade
into
his
stomach
he
had
walked
right
into
Cornelius
Fudge
the
Minister
of
Magic
himself
stan
leapt
onto
the
pavement
beside
them
what
didja
call
Neville
Minister
he
said
excitedly
fudge
a
portly
little
man
in
a
long
pinstriped
cloak
looked
cold
and
exhausted
neville

repeated
frowning

gleefully

said
Fudge
testily
well
i'm
very
glad
the
Knight
Bus
picked
Harry
up
but
he
and
I
need
to
step
inside
the
Leaky
Cauldron
now
fudge
increased
the
pressure
on
harry's
shoulder
and
Harry
found
himself
being
steered
inside
the
pub
a
stooping
figure
bearing
a
lantern
appeared
through
the
door
behind
the
bar
it
was
Tom
the
wizened
toothless
landlord
you've
got
him
Minister
said
Tom
will
you
be
wanting
anything
beer
brandy
perhaps
a
pot
of
tea
said
Fudge
who
still
hadn't
let
go
of
Harry
there
was
a
loud
scraping
and
puffing
from
behind
them
and
Stan
and
Ern
appeared
carrying
harry's
trunk
and
hedwig's
cage
and
looking
around
excitedly
ow
come
you
di'n't
tell
us
oo
you
are
eh
Neville
said
Stan
beaming
at
Harry
while
ernie's
owlish
face
peered
interestedly
over
stan's
shoulder
and
a
private
parlor
please
Tom
said
Fudge
pointedly
Bye
Harry
said
miserably
to
Stan
and
Ern
as
Tom
beckoned
Fudge
toward
the
passage
that
led
from
the
bar
bye
Neville
called
Stan
fudge
marched
Harry
along
the
narrow
passage
after
tom's
lantern
and
then
into
a
small
parlor
tom
clicked
his
fingers
a
fire
burst
into
life
in
the
grate
and
he
bowed
himself
out
of
the
room
sit
down
Harry
said
Fudge
indicating
a
chair
by
the
fire
harry
sat
down
feeling
goose
bumps
rising
up
his
arms
despite
the
glow
of
the
fire
fudge
took
off
his
pinstriped
cloak
and
tossed
it
aside
then
hitched
up
the
trousers
of
his
bottlegreen
suit
and
sat
down
opposite
Harry
i
am
Cornelius
Fudge
Harry
the
Minister
of
Magic
harry
already
knew
this
of
course
he
had
seen
Fudge
once
before
but
as
he
had
been
wearing
his
father's
Invisibility
Cloak
at
the
time
fudge
wasn't
to
know
that
tom
the
innkeeper
reappeared
wearing
an
apron
over
his
nightshirt
and
bearing
a
tray
of
tea
and
crumpets
he
placed
the
tray
on
a
table
between
Fudge
and
Harry
and
left
the
parlor
closing
the
door
behind
him
well
Harry
said
Fudge
pouring
out
tea
you've
had
us
all
in
a
right
flap
I
don't
mind
telling
you
running
away
from
your
aunt
and
uncle's
house
like
that
i'd
started
to
think
but
you're
safe
and
that's
what
matters
fudge
buttered
himself
a
crumpet
and
pushed
the
plate
toward
Harry
eat
Harry
you
look
dead
on
your
feet
now
then
you
will
be
pleased
to
hear
that
we
have
dealt
with
the
unfortunate
blowingup
of
Miss
Marjorie
Dursley
two
members
of
the
Accidental
Magic
Reversal
Department
were
dispatched
to
Privet
Drive
a
few
hours
ago
miss
Dursley
has
been
punctured
and
her
memory
has
been
modified
she
has
no
recollection
of
the
incident
at
all
so
that's
that
and
no
harm
done
fudge
smiled
at
Harry
over
the
rim
of
his
teacup
rather
like
an
uncle
surveying
a
favorite
nephew
harry
who
couldn't
believe
his
ears
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
couldn't
think
of
anything
to
say
and
closed
it
again
ah
you're
worrying
about
the
reaction
of
your
aunt
and
uncle
said
Fudge
well
I
won't
deny
that
they
are
extremely
angry
Harry
but
they
are
prepared
to
take
you
back
next
summer
as
long
as
you
stay
at
Hogwarts
for
the
Christmas
and
Easter
holidays
harry
unstuck
his
throat
i
always
stay
at
Hogwarts
for
the
Christmas
and
Easter
holidays
he
said
and
I
don't
ever
want
to
go
back
to
Privet
Drive
now
now
i'm
sure
you'll
feel
differently
once
you've
calmed
down
said
Fudge
in
a
worried
tone
they
are
your
family
after
all
and
i'm
sure
you
are
fond
of
each
other
er
very
deep
down
it
didn't
occur
to
Harry
to
put
Fudge
right
he
was
still
waiting
to
hear
what
was
going
to
happen
to
him
now
so
all
that
remains
said
Fudge
now
buttering
himself
a
second
crumpet
is
to
decide
where
you're
going
to
spend
the
last
two
weeks
of
your
vacation
i
suggest
you
take
a
room
here
at
the
Leaky
Cauldron
and
Hang
on
blurted
Harry
what
about
my
punishment
fudge
blinked
punishment
i
broke
the
law
harry
said
the
Decree
for
the
Restriction
of
Underage
Wizardry
oh
my
dear
boy
we're
not
going
to
punish
you
for
a
little
thing
like
that
cried
Fudge
waving
his
crumpet
impatiently
it
was
an
accident
we
don't
send
people
to
Azkaban
just
for
blowing
up
their
aunts
but
this
didn't
tally
at
all
with
harry's
past
dealings
with
the
Ministry
of
Magic
last
year
I
got
an
official
warning
just
because
a
houseelf
smashed
a
pudding
in
my
uncle's
house
he
told
Fudge
frowning
the
Ministry
of
Magic
said
i'd
be
expelled
from
Hogwarts
if
there
was
any
more
magic
there
unless
harry's
eyes
were
deceiving
him
Fudge
was
suddenly
looking
awkward
circumstances
change
Harry
we
have
to
take
into
account
in
the
present
climate
surely
you
don't
want
to
be
expelled
of
course
I
don't
said
Harry
well
then
what's
A
the
fuss
about
laughed
Fudge
now
have
a
crumpet
Harry
while
I
go
and
see
if
tom's
got
a
room
for
you
fudge
strode
out
of
the
parlor
and
Harry
stared
after
him
there
was
something
extremely
odd
going
on
why
had
Fudge
been
waiting
for
him
at
the
Leaky
Cauldron
if
not
to
punish
him
for
what
he'd
done
and
now
Harry
came
to
think
of
it
surely
it
wasn't
usual
for
the
Minister
of
Magic
himself
to
get
involved
in
matters
of
underage
magic
fudge
came
back
accompanied
by
Tom
the
innkeeper
room
eleven's
free
Harry
said
Fudge
i
think
you'll
be
very
comfortable
just
one
thing
and
i'm
sure
you'll
understand
i
don't
want
you
wandering
off
into
Muggle
London
all
right
keep
to
Diagon
Alley
and
you're
to
be
back
here
before
dark
each
night
sure
you'll
understand
tom
will
be
keeping
an
eye
on
you
for
me
okay
said
Harry
slowly
but
why
don't
want
to
lose
you
again
do
we
said
Fudge
with
a
hearty
laugh
no
no
best
we
know
where
you
are
i
mean
fudge
cleared
his
throat
loudly
and
picked
up
his
pinstriped
cloak
well
i'll
be
off
plenty
to
do
you
know
have
you
had
any
luck
with
Black
yet
harry
asked
fudge's
finger
slipped
on
the
silver
fastenings
of
his
cloak
what's
that
oh
you've
heard
well
no
not
yet
but
it's
only
a
matter
of
time
the
Azkaban
guards
have
never
yet
failed
and
they
are
angrier
than
i've
ever
seen
them
fudge
shuddered
slightly
so
i'll
say
goodbye
he
held
out
his
hand
and
Harry
shaking
it
had
a
sudden
idea
er
Minister
can
I
ask
you
something
certainly
said
Fudge
with
a
smile
well
third
years
at
Hogwarts
are
allowed
to
visit
Hogsmeade
but
my
aunt
and
uncle
didn't
sign
the
permission
form
d'you
think
you
could
fudge
was
looking
uncomfortable
ah
he
said
no
no
i'm
very
sorry
Harry
but
as
i'm
not
your
parent
or
guardian
but
you
I
re
the
Minister
of
Magic
said
Harry
eagerly
if
you
gave
me
permission
no
i'm
sorry
Harry
but
rules
are
rules
said
Fudge
flatly
perhaps
you'll
be
able
to
visit
Hogsmeade
next
year
in
fact
I
think
it's
best
if
you
don't
yes
well
i'll
be
off
Enjoy
your
stay
harry
and
with
a
last
smile
and
shake
of
harry's
hand
Fudge
left
the
room
tom
now
moved
forward
beaming
at
Harry
if
you'll
follow
me
mr.
Potter
he
said
i've
already
taken
your
things
up
harry
followed
Tom
up
a
handsome
wooden
staircase
to
a
door
with
a
brass
number
eleven
on
it
which
Tom
unlocked
and
opened
for
him
inside
was
a
very
comfortablelooking
bed
some
highly
polished
oak
furniture
a
cheerfully
crackling
fire
and
perched
on
top
of
the
wardrobe
Hedwig
harry
gasped
the
snowy
owl
clicked
her
beak
and
fluttered
down
onto
harry's
arm
very
smart
owl
you've
got
there
chuckled
Tom
arrived
about
five
minutes
after
you
did
if
there's
anything
you
need
mr.
Potter
don't
hesitate
to
ask
he
gave
another
bow
and
left
harry
sat
on
his
bed
for
a
long
time
absentmindedly
stroking
Hedwig
the
sky
outside
the
window
was
changing
rapidly
from
deep
velvety
blue
to
cold
steely
gray
and
then
slowly
to
pink
shot
with
gold
harry
could
hardly
believe
that
he'd
left
Privet
Drive
only
a
few
hours
ago
that
he
wasn't
expelled
and
that
he
was
now
facing
two
completely
Dursleyfree
weeks
it's
been
a
very
weird
night
Hedwig
he
yawned
and
without
even
removing
his
glasses
he
slumped
back
onto
his
pillows
and
fell
asleep
chapter
four
the
leaky
cauldron
it
took
Harry
several
days
to
get
used
to
his
strange
new
freedom
never
before
had
he
been
able
to
get
up
whenever
he
wanted
or
eat
whatever
he
fancied
he
could
even
go
wherever
he
pleased
as
long
as
it
was
in
Diagon
Alley
and
as
this
long
cobbled
street
was
packed
with
the
most
fascinating
wizarding
shops
in
the
world
Harry
felt
no
desire
to
break
his
word
to
Fudge
and
stray
back
into
the
Muggle
world
harry
ate
breakfast
each
morning
in
the
Leaky
Cauldron
where
he
liked
watching
the
other
guests
funny
little
witches
from
the
country
up
for
a
day's
shopping
venerablelooking
wizards
arguing
over
the
latest
article
in
Transfiguration
Today
wildlooking
warlocks
raucous
dwarfs
and
once
what
looked
suspiciously
like
a
hag
who
ordered
a
plate
of
raw
liver
from
behind
a
thick
woollen
balaclava
after
breakfast
Harry
would
go
out
into
the
backyard
take
out
his
wand
tap
the
third
brick
from
the
left
above
the
trash
bit
and
stand
back
as
the
archway
into
Diagon
Alley
opened
in
the
wall
harry
spent
the
long
sunny
days
exploring
the
shops
and
eating
under
the
brightly
colored
umbrellas
outside
cafes
where
his
fellow
diners
were
showing
one
another
their
purchases

Black
personalty
I
won't
let
any
of
the
children
out
alone
until
he's
back
in
Azkaban
harry
didn't
have
to
do
his
homework
under
the
blankets
by
flashlight
anymore
now
he
could
sit
in
the
bright
sunshine
outside
Florean
fortescue's
Ice
Cream
Parlor
finishing
all
his
essays
with
occasional
help
from
Florean
Fortescue
himself
who
apart
from
knowing
a
great
deal
about
medieval
witch
burnings
gave
Harry
free
sundaes
every
half
an
hour
once
Harry
had
refilled
his
money
bag
with
gold
Galleons
silver
Sickles
and
bronze
Knuts
from
his
vault
at
Gringotts
he
had
to
exercise
a
lot
of
selfcontrol
not
to
spend
the
whole
lot
at
once
he
had
to
keep
reminding
himself
that
he
had
five
years
to
go
at
Hogwarts
and
how
it
would
feel
to
ask
the
Dursleys
for
money
for
spellbooks
to
stop
himself
from
buying
a
handsome
set
of
solid
gold
Gobstones
a
wizarding
game
rather
like
marbles
in
which
the
stones
squirt
a
nastysmelling
liquid
into
the
other
player's
face
when
they
lose
a
point
he
was
sorely
tempted
too
by
the
perfect
moving
model
of
the
galaxy
in
a
large
glass
ball
which
would
have
meant
he
never
had
to
take
another
Astronomy
lesson
but
the
thing
that
tested
harry's
resolution
most
appeared
in
his
favorite
shop
Quality
Quidditch
Supplies
a
week
after
he'd
arrived
at
the
Leaky
Cauldron
curious
to
know
what
the
crowd
in
the
shop
was
staring
at
Harry
edged
his
way
inside
and
squeezed
in
among
the
excited
witches
and
wizards
until
he
glimpsed
a
newly
erected
podium
on
which
was
mounted
the
most
magnificent
broom
he
had
ever
seen
in
his
life
just
come
out
prototype
a
squarejawed
wizard
was
telling
his
companion
it's
the
fastest
broom
in
the
world
isn't
it
Dad
squeaked
a
boy
younger
than
Harry
who
was
swinging

father's
arm

Just

the

told
the

and
they're

for
the
World

a
large
witch
in
front
of
Harry
moved
and
he
was
able
to
read
the
sign
next
to
the
broom

harry
didn't
like
to
think
how
much
gold
the
Firebolt
would
cost
he
had
never
wanted
anything
as
much
in
his
whole
life
but
he
had
never
lost
a
Quidditch
match
on
his
Nim
bus
Two
Thousand
and
what
was
the
point
in
emptying
his
Gringotts
vault
for
the
Firebolt
when
he
had
a
very
good
broom
already
harry
didn't
ask
for
the
price
but
he
returned
almost
every
day
after
that
just
to
look
at
the
Firebolt
there
were
however
things
that
Harry
needed
to
buy
he
went
to
the
Apothecary
to
replenish
his
store
of
potions
ingredients
and
as
his
school
robes
were
now
several
inches
too
short
in
the
arm
and
leg
he
visited
Madam
malkin's
Robes
for
All
Occasions
and
bought
new
ones
most
important
of
all
he
had
to
buy
his
new
schoolbooks
which
would
include
those
for
his
two
new
subjects
Care
of
Magical
Creatures
and
Divination
harry
got
a
surprise
as
he
looked
in
at
the
bookshop
window
instead
of
the
usual
display
of
gold
embossed
spellbooks
the
size
of
paving
slabs
there
was
a
large
iron
cage
behind
the
glass
that
held
about
a
hundred
copies
of
The
Monster
Book
of
Monsters
torn
pages
were
flying
everywhere
as
the
books
grappled
with
each
other
locked
together
in
furious
wrestling
matches
and
snapping
aggressively
harry
pulled
his
booklist
out
of
his
pocket
and
consulted
it
for
the
first
time
the
Monster
Book
of
Monsters
was
listed
as
the
required
book
for
Care
of
Magical
Creatures
now
Harry
understood
why
Hagrid
had
said
it
would
come
in
useful
he
felt
relieved
he
had
been
wondering
whether
Hagrid
wanted
help
with
some
terrifying
new
pet
as
Harry
entered
Flourish
and
Blotts
the
manager
came
hurrying
toward
him
hogwarts
he
said
abruptly
come
to
get
your
new
books
yes
said
Harry
I
need
get
out
of
the
way
said
the
manager
impatiently
brushing
Harry
aside
he
drew
on
a
pair
of
very
thick
gloves
picked
up
a
large
knobbly
walking
stick
and
proceeded
toward
the
door
of
the
Monster
Books
cage
hang
on
said
Harry
quickly
i've
already
got
one
of
those
have
you
a
look
of
enormous
relief
spread
over
the
manager's
face
thank
heavens
for
that
i've
been
bitten
five
times
already
this
morning
a
loud
ripping
noise
rent
the
air
two
of
the
Monster
Books
had
seized
a
third
and
were
pulling
it
apart
stop
it
stop
it
cried
the
manager
poking
the
walking
stick
through
the
bars
and
knocking
the
books
apart
i'm
never
stocking
them
again
never
it's
been
bedlam
i
thought
we'd
seen
the
worst
when
we
bought
two
hundred
copies
of
the
Invisible
Book
of
Invisibility
cost
a
fortune
and
we
never
found
them
well
is
there
anything
else
I
can
help
you
with

said
Harry
looking
down
his
booklist

ah
starting
Divination
are
you
said
the
manager
stripping
off
his
gloves
and
leading
Harry
into
the
back
of
the
shop
where
there
was
a
corner
devoted
to
fortunetelling
a
small
table
was
stacked
with
volumes
such
as
Predicting
the
Unpredictable
Insulate
Yourself
Against
Shocks
and
Broken
Balls
When
Fortunes
Turn
Foul
here
you
are
said
the
manager
who
had
climbed
a
set
of
steps
to
take
down
a
thick
black
bound
book
unfogging
the
Future
very
good
guide
to
all
your
basic
fortunetelling
methods
palmistry
crystal
balls
bird
entrails
but
Harry
wasn't
listening
his
eyes
had
fallen
on
another
book
which
was
among
a
display
on
a
small
table
Death
Omens
what
to
Do
When
You
Know
the
Worst
Is
Coming
oh
I
wouldn't
read
that
if
I
were
you
said
the
manager
lightly
looking
to
see
what
Harry
was
staring
at
you'll
start
seeing
death
omens
everywhere
it's
enough
to
frighten
anyone
to
death
but
Harry
continued
to
stare
at
the
front
cover
of
the
book
it
showed
a
black
dog
large
as
a
bear
with
gleaming
eyes
it
looked
oddly
familiar
the
manager
pressed
Unfogging
the
Future
into
harry's
hands
anything
else
he
said
yes
said
Harry
tearing
his
eyes
away
from
the
dog's
and
dazedly
consulting
his
booklist
er
I
need
Intermediate
Transfiguration
and
The
Standard
Book
of
Spells
Grade
Three
harry
emerged
from
Flourish
and
Blotts
ten
minutes
later
with
his
new
books
under
his
arms
and
made
his
way
back
to
the
Leaky
Cauldron
hardly
noticing
where
he
was
going
and
bumping
into
several
people
he
tramped
up
the
stairs
to
his
room
went
inside
and
tipped
his
books
onto
his
bed
somebody
had
been
in
to
tidy
the
windows
were
open
and
sun
was
pouring
inside
harry
could
hear
the
buses
rolling
by
in
the
unseen
Muggle
street
behind
him
and
the
sound
of
the
invisible
crowd
below
in
Diagon
Alley
he
caught
sight
of
himself
in
the
mirror
over
the
basin
it
can't
have
been
a
death
omen
he
told
his
reflection
defiantly
i
was
panicking
when
I
saw
that
thing
in
Magnolia
Crescent
it
was
probably
just
a
stray
dog
he
raised
his
hand
automatically
and
tried
to
make
his
hair
lie
flat
you're
fighting
a
losing
battle
there
dear
said
his
mirror
in
a
vvheezy
voice
as
the
days
slipped
by
Harry
started
looking
wherever
he
went
for
a
sign
of
Ron
or
Hermione
plenty
of
Hogwarts
students
were
arriving
in
Diagon
Alley
now
with
the
start
of
term
so
near
harry
met
Seamus
Finnigan
and
Dean
Thomas
his
fellow
Gryffindors
in
Quality
Quidditch
Supplies
where
they
too
were
ogling
the
Firebolt
he
also
ran
into
the
real
Neville
Longbottom
a
roundfaced
forgetful
boy
outside
Flourish
and
Blotts
harry
didn't
stop
to
chat
Neville
appeared
to
have
mislaid
his
booklist
and
was
being
told
off
by
his
very
formidablelooking
grandmother
harry
hoped
she
never
found
out
that
he'd
pretended
to
be
Neville
while
on
the
run
from
the
Ministry
of
Magic
harry
woke
on
the
last
day
of
the
holidays
thinking
that
he
would
at
least
meet
Ron
and
Hermione
tomorrow
on
the
Hogwarts
Express
he
got
up
dressed
went
for
a
last
look
at
the
Firebolt
and
was
just
wondering
where
he'd
have
lunch
when
someone
yelled
his
name
and
he
turned
harry
harry
they
were
there
both
of
them
sitting
outside
Florean
fortescue's
Ice
Cream
Parlor
Ron
looking
incredibly
freckly
Herone
very
brown
both
waving
frantically
at
him
finally
said
Ron
grinning
at
Harry
as
he
sat
down
we
went
to
the
Leaky
Cauldron
but
they
said
you'd
left
and
we
went
to
Flourish
and
Blotts
and
Madam
malkin's
and
i
got
all
my
school
stuff
last
week
Harry
explained
and
how
come
You
knew
i'm
staying
at
the
Leaky
Cauldron
dad
said
Ron
simply
mr.
Weasley
who
worked
at
the
Ministry
of
Magic
would
of
course
have
heard
the
whole
story
of
what
had
happened
to
Aunt
Marge
did
you
really
blow
up
your
aunt
Harry
said
Hermione
in
a
very
serious
voice
i
didn't
mean
to
said
Harry
while
Ron
roared
with
laughter
i
just
lost
control
it's
not
funny
Ron
said
Hermione
sharply
honestly
i'm
amazed
Harry
wasn't
expelled
so
am
I
admitted
Harry
forget
expelled
I
thought
I
was
going
to
be
arrested
he
looked
at
Ron
your
dad
doesn't
know
why
Fudge
let
me
off
does
he
probably
cause
it's
you
isn't
it
shrugged
Ron
still
chuckling
famous
Harry
Potter
and
all
that
i'd
hate
to
see
what
the
ministry'd
do
to
me
if
I
blew
up
an
aunt
mind
you
they'd
have
to
dig
me
up
first
because
Mum
would've
killed
me
anyway
you
can
ask
Dad
yourself
this
evening
we're
staying
at
the
Leaky
Cauldron
tonight
too
so
you
can
come
to
king's
Cross
with
us
tomorrow
hermione's
there
as
well
hermione
nodded
beaming
mum
and
Dad
dropped
me
off
this
morning
with
all
my
Hogwarts
things
excellent
said
Harry
happily
so
have
you
got
all
your
new
books
and
stuff
look
at
this
said
Ron
pulling
a
long
thin
box
out
of
a
bag
and
opening
it
brandnew
wand
fourteen
inches
willow
containing
one
unicorn
tailhair
and
we've
got
all
our
books
He
pointed
at
a
large
bag
under
his
chair
what
about
those
Monster
Books
eh
the
assistant
nearly
cried
when
we
said
we
wanted
two
what's
all
that
Hermione
harry
asked
pointing
at
not
one
but
three
bulging
bags
in
the
chair
next
to
her
well
i'm
taking
more
new
subjects
than
you
aren't
I
said
Hermione
those
are
my
books
for
Arithmancy
Care
of
Magical
Creatures
Divination
the
Study
of
Ancient
Runes
Muggle
Studies
what
are
you
doing
Muggle
Studies
for
said
Ron
rolling
his
eyes
at
Harry
you're
Muggle
born
your
mum
and
dad
are
Muggles
you
already
know
all
about
Muggles
but
it'll
be
fascinating
to
study
them
from
the
wizarding
point
of
view
said
Hermione
earnestly
are
you
planning
to
eat
or
sleep
at
all
this
year
Hermione
asked
Harry
while
Ron
sniggered
hermione
ignored
them
i've
still
got
ten
Galleons
she
said
checking
her
purse
it's
my
birthday
in
September
and
Mum
and
Dad
gave
me
some
money
to
get
myself
an
early
birthday
present
how
about
a
nice
book
said
Ron
innocently
no
I
don't
think
so
said
Hermione
composedly
i
really
want
an
owl
i
mean
harry's
got
Hedwig
and
you've
got
Errol
i
haven't
said
Ron
errol's
a
family
owl
all
i've
got
is
Scabbers
he
pulled
his
pet
rat
out
of
his
pocket
and
I
want
to
get
him
checked
over
he
added
placing
Scabbers
on
the
table
in
front
of
them
i
don't
think
Egypt
agreed
with
him
scabbers
was
looking
thinner
than
usual
and
there
was
a
definite
droop
to
his
whiskers
there's
a
magical
creature
shop
just
over
there
said
Harry
who
knew
Diagon
Alley
very
well
by
now
you
could
see
if
they've
got
anything
for
Scabbers
and
Hermione
can
get
her
owl
so
they
paid
for
their
ice
cream
and
crossed
the
street
to
the
Magical
Menagerie
there
wasn't
much
room
inside
every
inch
of
wall
was
hidden
by
cages
it
was
smelly
and
very
noisy
because
the
occupants
Of
these
cages
were
all
squeaking
squawking
jabbering
or
hissing
the
witch
behind
the
counter
was
already
advising
a
wizard
on
the
care
of
doubleended
newts
so
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
waited
examining
the
cages
a
pair
of
enormous
purple
toads
sat
gulping
wetly
and
feasting
on
dead
blowflies
a
gigantic
tortoise
with
a
jewelencrusted
shell
was
glittering
near
the
window
poisonous
orange
snails
were
oozing
slowly
up
the
side
of
their
glass
tank
and
a
fat
white
rabbit
kept
changing
into
a
silk
top
hat
and
back
again
with
a
loud
popping
noise
then
there
were
cats
of
every
color
a
noisy
cage
of
ravens
a
basket
of
funny
custardcolored
furballs
that
were
humming
loudly
and
on
the
counter
a
vast
cage
of
sleek
black
rats
that
were
playing
some
sort
of
skipping
game
using
their
long
bald
tails
the
doubleended
newt
wizard
left
and
Ron
approached
the
counter
it's
my
rat
he
told
the
witch
he
been
a
bit
offcolor
ever
since
I
brought
him
back
from
Egypt
bang
him
on
the
counter
said
the
witch
pulling
a
pair
of
heavy
black
spectacles
out
of
her
pocket
ron
lifted
Scabbers
out
of
his
inside
pocket
and
placed
him
next
to
the
cage
of
his
fellow
rats
who
stopped
their
skipping
tricks
and
scuffled
to
the
wire
for
a
better
took
like
nearly
everything
Ron
owned
Scabbers
the
rat
was
secondhand
he
had
once
belonged
to
ron's
brother
Percy
and
a
bit
battered
next
to
the
glossy
rats
in
the
cage
he
looked
especially
woebegone
hm
said
the
witch
picking
up
Scabbers
how
old
is
this
rat
dunno
said
Ron
quite
old
he
used
to
belong
to
my
brother
what
powers
does
he
have
said
the
witch
examining
Scabbers
closely
er
The
truth
was
that
Scabbers
had
never
shown
the
faintest
trace
of
interesting
powers
the
witchs
eyes
moved
from
scabbers's
tattered
left
ear
to
his
front
paw
which
had
a
toe
missing
and
tutted
loudly
he's
been
through
the
mill
this
one
she
said
he
was
like
that
when
Percy
gave
him
to
me
said
Ron
defensively
an
ordinary
common
or
garden
rat
like
this
can't
be
expected
to
live
longer
than
three
years
or
so
said
the
witch
now
if
you
were
looking
for
something
a
bit
more
hardwearing
you
might
like
one
of
these
she
indicated
the
black
rats
who
promptly
started
skipping
again
ron
muttered
Showoffs
well
if
you
don't
want
a
replacement
you
can
try
this
rat
tonic
said
the
witch
reaching
under
the
counter
and
bringing
out
a
small
red
bottle
okay
said
Ron
how
much
ouch
ron
buckled
as
something
huge
and
orange
came
soaring
from
the
top
of
the
highest
cage
landed
on
his
head
and
then
propelled
itself
spitting
madly
at
Scabbers
no
crookshanks
no
cried
the
witch
but
Scabbers
shot
from
between
her
hands
like
a
bar
of
soap
landed
splaylegged
on
the
floor
and
then
scampered
for
the
door
scabbers
ron
shouted
racing
out
of
the
shop
after
him
Harry
followed
it
took
them
nearly
ten
minutes
to
catch
Scabbers
who
had
taken
refuge
under
a
wastepaper
bin
outside
Quality
Quidditch
Supplies
ron
stuffed
the
trembling
rat
back
into
his
pocket
and
straightened
up
massaging
his
head
what
was
that
it
was
either
a
very
big
cat
or
quite
a
small
tiger
said
Harry
where's
Hermione
probably
getting
her
owl
They
made
their
way
back
up
the
crowded
street
to
the
Magical
Menagerie
as
they
reached
it
Hermione
came
out
but
she
wasn't
carrying
an
owl
her
arms
were
clamped
tightly
around
the
enormous
ginger
cat
you
bought
that
monster
said
Ron
his
mouth
hanging
open
he's
gorgeous
isn't
he
said
Hermione
glowing
that
was
a
matter
of
opinion
thought
Harry
the
cat's
ginger
fur
was
thick
and
fluffy
but
it
was
definitely
a
bit
bowlegged
and
its
face
looked
grumpy
and
oddly
squashed
as
though
it
had
run
headlong
into
a
brick
wall
now
that
Scabbers
was
out
of
sight
however
the
cat
was
purring
contentedly
in
hermione's
arms
herinione
that
thing
nearly
scalped
me
said
Ron
he
didn't
mean
to
did
you
Crookshanks
said
Hermione
and
what
about
Scabbers
said
Ron
pointing
at
the
lump
in
his
chest
pocket
he
needs
rest
and
relaxation
how's
he
going
to
get
it
with
that
thing
around
that
reminds
me
you
forgot
your
rat
tonic
said
Hermione
slapping
the
small
red
bottle
into
ron's
hand
and
stop
worrying
Crookshanks
will
be
sleeping
in
my
dormitory
and
Scabbers
in
yours
what's
the
problem
poor
Crookshanks
that
witch
said
he'd
been
in
there
for
ages
no
one
wanted
him
wonder
why
said
Ron
sarcastically
as
they
set
off
toward
the
Leaky
Cauldron
they
found
mr.
Weasley
sitting
in
the
bar
reading
the
Daily
prophet
harry
he
said
smiling
as
he
looked
up
how
are
you
fine
thanks
said
Harry
as
he
Ron
and
Hermione
joined
mr.
Weasley
with
A
their
shopping
mr.
Weasley
put
down
his
paper
and
Harry
saw
the
now
familiar
picture
of
Sirius
Black
staring
up
at
him
they
still
haven't
caught
him
then
he
asked
no
said
mr.
Weasley
looking
extremely
grave
they've
pulled
us
all
off
our
regular
jobs
at
the
Ministry
to
try
and
find
him
but
no
luck
so
far
would
we
get
a
reward
if
we
caught
him
asked
Ron
it'd
be
good
to
get
some
more
money
don't
be
ridiculous
Ron
said
mr.
Weasley
who
on
closer
inspection
looked
very
strained
black's
not
going
to
be
caught
by
a
thirteenyearold
wizard
it's
the
Azkaban
guards
who'll
get
him
back
you
mark
my
words
at
that
moment
Mrs
weasley
entered
the
bar
laden
with
shopping
bags
and
followed
by
the
twins
Fred
and
George
who
were
about
to
start
their
fifth
year
at
Hogwarts
the
newly
elected
Head
Boy
Percy
and
the
Weasleys
youngest
child
and
only
girl
Ginny
ginny
who
had
always
been
very
taken
with
Harry
seemed
even
more
heartily
embarrassed
than
usual
when
she
saw
him
perhaps
because
he
had
saved
her
life
during
their
previous
year
at
Hogwarts
she
went
very
red
and
muttered
hello
without
looking
at
him
percy
however
held
out
his
hand
solemnly
as
though
he
and
Harry
had
never
met
and
said
Harry
how
nice
to
see
you
hello
Percy
said
Harry
trying
not
to
laugh
i
hope
you're
well
said
Percy
pompously
shaking
hands
it
was
rather
like
being
introduced
to
the
mayor
very
well
thanks
harry
said
Fred
elbowing
Percy
out
of
the
way
and
bowing
deeply
simply
splendid
to
see
you
old
boy
marvelous
said
George
pushing
Fred
aside
and
seizing
harry's
hand
in
turn
absolutely
spiffing
percy
scowled
that's
enough
now
said
Mrs
weasley
mum
said
Fred
as
though
he'd
only
just
spotted
her
and
seizing
her
hand
too
how
really
corking
to
see
you
i
said
that's
enough
said
Mrs
weasley
depositing
her
shopping
in
an
empty
chair
hello
Harry
dear
i
suppose
you've
heard
our
exciting
news
she
pointed
to
the
brandnew
silver
badge
on
percy's
chest
second
Head
Boy
in
the
family
she
said
swelling
with
pride
and
last
Fred
muttered
under
his
breath
i
don't
doubt
that
said
Mrs
weasley
frowning
suddenly
i
notice
they
haven't
made
you
two
prefects
what
do
we
want
to
be
prefects
for
said
George
looking
revolted
at
the
very
idea
it'd
take
all
the
fun
out
of
life
ginny
giggled
yo
u
want
to
set
a
better
example
for
your
sister
snapped
Mrs
weasley
ginny's
got
other
brothers
to
set
her
an
example
Mother
said
Percy
loftily
i'm
going
up
to
change
for
dinner
he
disappeared
and
George
heaved
a
sigh
we
tried
to
shut
him
in
a
pyramid
he
told
Harry
but
Mum
spotted
us
dinner
that
night
was
a
very
enjoyable
affair
tom
the
innkeeper
put
three
tables
together
in
the
parlor
and
the
seven
Weasleys
Harry
and
Hermione
ate
their
way
through
five
delicious
courses
how're
we
getting
to
king's
Cross
tomorrow
Dad
asked
Fred
as
they
dug
into
a
sumptuous
chocolate
pudding
the
ministry's
providing
a
couple
of
cars
said
mr.
Weasley
everyone
looked
up
at
him
why
said
Percy
curiously
it's
because
of
you
Perce
said
George
seriously
and
there'll
be
little
flags
on
the
hoods
with
hb
on
them
for
Humongous
Bighead
said
Fred
everyone
except
Percy
and
Mrs
weasley
snorted
into
their
pudding
why
are
the
Ministry
providing
cars
Father
percy
asked
again
in
a
dignified
voice
well
as
we
haven't
got
one
anymore
said
mr.
Weasley
and
as
I
work
there
they're
doing
me
a
favor
his
voice
was
casual
but
Harry
couldn't
help
noticing
that
Mr
weasley's
ears
had
gone
red
just
like
ron's
did
when
he
was
under
Pressure
good
thing
too
said
Mrs
weasley
briskly
do
you
realize
how
much
luggage
you've
all
got
between
you
a
nice
sight
you'd
be
on
the
Muggle
Underground
you
are
all
packed
aren't
you
ron
hasn't
put
all
his
new
things
in
his
trunk
yet
said
Percy
in
a
longsuffering
voice
he's
dumped
them
on
my
bed
you'd
better
go
and
pack
properly
Ron
because
we
won't
have
much
time
in
the
morning
Mrs
weasley
called
down
the
table
ron
scowled
at
Percy
after
dinner
everyone
felt
very
full
and
sleepy
one
by
one
they
made
their
way
upstairs
to
their
rooms
to
check
their
things
for
the
next
day
ron
and
Percy
were
next
door
to
Harry
he
had
just
closed
and
locked
his
own
trunk
when
he
heard
angry
voices
through
the
wall
and
went
to
see
what
was
going
on
the
door
of
number
twelve
was
ajar
and
Percy
was
shouting
it
was
here
on
the
bedside
table
I
took
it
off
for
polishing
I
haven't
touched
it
all
right
ron
roared
back
what's
up
said
Harry
my
Head
Boy
badge
is
gone
said
Percy
rounding
on
Harry
so's
scabbers's
rat
tonic
said
Ron
throwing
things
out
of
his
trunk
to
look
i
think
I
might've
left
it
in
the
bar
you're
not
going
anywhere
till
you've
found
my
badge
yelled
Percy
i'll
get
scabbers's
stuff
i'm
packed
Harry
said
to
Ron
and
he
went
downstairs
harry
was
halfway
along
the
passage
to
the
bar
which
was
now
very
dark
when
he
heard
another
pair
of
angry
voices
coming
from
the
parlor
a
second
later
he
recognized
them
as
mr.
and
Mrs
weasleys
he
hesitated
not
wanting
them
to
know
he'd
heard
them
arguing
when
the
sound
of
his
own
name
made
him
stop
then
move
closer
to
the
parlor
door
makes
no
sense
not
to
tell
him
mr.
Weasley
was
saying
heatedly
harry's
got
a
right
to
know
i've
tried
to
tell
Fudge
but
he
insists
on
treating
Harry
like
a
child
he's
thirteen
years
old
and
arthur
the
truth
would
terrify
him
said
Mrs
weasley
shrilly
do
you
really
want
to
send
Harry
back
to
school
with
that
hanging
over
him
for
heaven's
sake
he's
happy
not
knowing
i
don't
want
to
make
him
miserable
I
want
to
put
him
on
his
guard
retorted
mr.
Weasley
you
know
what
Harry
and
Ron
are
like
wandering
off
by
themselves
they've
ended
up
in
the
Forbidden
Forest
twice
but
Harry
mustn't
do
that
this
year
when
I
think
what
could
have
happened
to
him
that
night
he
ran
away
from
home
if
the
Knight
Bus
hadn't
picked
him
up
i'm
prepared
to
bet
he
would
have
been
dead
before
the
Ministry
found
him
but
he's
not
dead
he's
fine
so
what's
the
point
Molly
they
say
Sirius
black's
mad
and
maybe
he
is
but
he
was
clever
enough
to
escape
from
Azkaban
and
that's
supposed
to
be
impossible
it's
been
three
weeks
and
no
one's
seen
hide
nor
hair
of
him
and
I
don't
care
what
Fudge
keeps
telling
the
Daily
Prophet
we're
no
nearer
catching
Black
than
inventing
selfspelling
wands
the
only
thing
we
know
for
sure
is
what
black's
after
But
Harry
will
be
perfectly
safe
at
Hogwarts
we
thought
Azkaban
was
perfectly
safe
if
Black
can
break
out
of
Azkaban
he
can
break
into
Hogwarts
but
no
one's
really
sure
that
black's
after
Harry
There
was
a
thud
on
wood
and
Harry
was
sure
mr.
Weasley
had
banged
his
fist
on
the
table
molly
how
many
times
do
I
have
to
tell
you
they
didn't
report
it
in
the
press
because
Fudge
wanted
it
kept
quiet
but
Fudge
went
out
to
Azkaban
the
night
Black
escaped
the
guards
told
Fudge
that
Blacks
been
talking
in
his
sleep
for
a
while
now
always
the
same
words
he's
at
Hogwarts
he's
at
Hogwarts
black
is
deranged
Molly
and
he
wants
Harry
dead
if
you
ask
me
he
thinks
murdering
Harry
will
bring
YouKnowWho
back
to
pow
er
black
lost
everything
the
night
Harry
stopped
You
KnowWho
and
he's
had
twelve
years
alone
in
Azkaban
to
brood
on
that
there
was
a
silence
harry
leaned
still
closer
to
the
door
desperate
to
hear
more
well
Arthur
you
must
do
what
you
think
is
right
but
you're
forgetting
Albus
Dumbledore
i
don't
think
anything
could
hurt
Harry
at
Hogwarts
while
dumbledore's
headmaster
i
suppose
he
knows
about
all
this
of
course
he
knows
we
had
to
ask
him
if
he
minds
the
Azkaban
guards
stationing
themselves
around
the
entrances
to
the
school
grounds
he
wasn't
happy
about
it
but
he
agreed
not
happy
why
shouldn't
he
be
happy
if
they're
there
to
catch
Black
dumbledore
isn't
fond
of
the
Azkaban
guards
said
mr.
Weasley
heavily
nor
am
if
it
comes
to
that
but
when
you're
dealing
with
a
wizard
like
Black
you
sometimes
have
to
join
forces
with
those
you'd
rather
avoid
if
they
save
Harry
then
I
will
never
say
another
word
against
them
said
mr.
Weasley
wearily
it's
late
Molly
we'd
better
go
up
harry
heard
chairs
move
as
quietly
as
he
could
he
hurried
down
the
passage
to
the
bar
and
out
of
sight
the
parlor
door
opened
and
a
few
seconds
later
footsteps
told
him
that
mr.
and
Mrs
weasley
were
climbing
the
stairs
the
bottle
of
rat
tonic
was
lying
under
the
table
they
had
sat
at
earlier
harry
waited
until
he
heard
mr.
and
Mrs
weasley's
bedroom
door
close
then
headed
back
upstairs
with
the
bottle
fred
and
George
were
crouching
in
the
shadows
on
the
landing
heaving
with
laughter
as
they
listened
to
Percy
dismantling
his
and
ron's
room
in
search
of
his
badge
we've
got
it
Fred
whispered
to
Harry
we've
been
improving
it
the
badge
now
read
Bighead
Boy
harry
forced
a
laugh
went
to
give
Ron
the
rat
tonic
then
shut
himself
in
his
room
and
lay
down
on
his
bed
so
Sirius
Black
was
after
him
this
explained
everything
fudge
had
been
lenient
with
him
because
he
was
so
relieved
to
find
him
alive
he'd
made
harry
promise
to
stay
in
Diagon
Alley
where
there
were
plenty
of
wizards
to
keep
an
eye
on
him
and
he
was
sending
two
Ministry
cars
to
take
them
all
to
the
station
tomorrow
so
that
the
Weasleys
could
look
after
Harry
until
he
was
on
the
train
harry
lay
listening
to
the
muffled
shouting
next
door
and
wondered
why
he
didn't
feel
more
scared
sirius
Black
had
murdered
thirteen
people
with
one
curse
mr.
and
Mrs
Weasley
obviously
thought
Harry
would
be
panicstricken
if
he
knew
the
truth
but
Harry
happened
to
agree
wholeheartedly
with
Mrs
weasley
that
the
safest
place
on
earth
was
wherever
Albus
Dumbledore
happened
to
be
didn't
people
always
say
that
Dumbledore
was
the
only
person
Lord
Voldemort
had
ever
been
afraid
of
surely
Black
as
voldemort's
righthand
man
would
be
just
as
frightened
of
him
and
then
there
were
these
Azkaban
guards
everyone
kept
talking
about
they
seemed
to
scare
most
people
senseless
and
if
they
were
stationed
all
around
the
school
black's
chances
of
getting
inside
seemed
very
remote
no
all
in
all
the
thing
that
bothered
Harry
most
was
the
fact
that
his
chances
of
visiting
Hogsmeade
now
looked
like
zero
nobody
would
want
Harry
to
leave
the
safety
of
the
castle
until
Black
was
caught
in
fact
harry
suspected
his
every
move
would
be
carefully
watched
until
the
danger
had
passed
he
scowled
at
the
dark
ceiling
did
they
think
he
couldn't
look
after
himself
he'd
escaped
Lord
Voldemort
three
times
he
wasn't
completely
useless
unbidden
the
image
of
the
beast
in
the
shadows
of
Magnolia
Crescent
crossed
his
mind
what
to
do
when
you
know
the
worst
is
coming
i'm
not
going
to
be
murdered
Harry
said
out
loud
that's
the
spirit
dear
said
his
mirror
sleepily
chapter
five
the
dementor
tom
woke
Harry
the
next
morning
with
his
usual
toothless
grin
and
a
cup
of
tea
harry
got
dressed
and
was
just
persuading
a
disgruntled
Hedwig
to
get
back
into
her
cage
when
Ron
banged
his
way
into
the
room
pulling
a
sweatshirt
over
his
head
and
looking
irritable
the
sooner
we
get
on
the
train
the
better
he
said
at
least
I
can
get
away
from
Percy
at
Hogwarts
now
he's
accusing
me
of
dripping
tea
on
his
photo
of
Penelope
Clearwater
you
know
Ron
grimaced
his
girlfriend
she's
hidden
her
face
under
the
frame
because
her
nose
has
gone
all
blotchy
i've
got
something
to
tell
you
Harry
began
but
they
were
interrupted
by
Fred
and
George
who
had
looked
in
to
congratulate
Ron
on
infuriating
Percy
again
they
headed
down
to
breakfast
where
mr.
Weasley
was
reading
the
front
page
of
the
Daily
Prophet
with
a
furrowed
brow
and
Mrs
weasley
was
telling
Hermione
and
Ginny
about
a
love
potion
she'd
made
as
a
young
girl
all
three
of
them
were
rather
giggly
what
were
you
saying
ron
asked
Harry
as
they
sat
down
later
Harry
muttered
as
Percy
stormed
in
harry
had
no
chance
to
speak
to
Ron
or
Hermione
in
the
chaos
of
leaving
they
were
too
busy
heaving
all
their
trunks
down
the
Leaky
cauldron's
narrow
staircase
and
piling
them
up
near
the
door
with
Hedwig
and
Hermes
percy's
screech
owl
perched
on
top
in
their
cages
a
small
wickerwork
basket
stood
beside
the
heap
of
trunks
spitting
loudly
it's
all
right
Crookshanks
Hermione
cooed
through
the
wickerwork
i'll
let
you
out
on
the
train
you
won't
snapped
Ron
what
about
poor
Scabbers
eh
he
pointed
at
his
chest
where
a
large
lump
indicated
that
Scabbers
was
curled
up
in
his
pocket
mr.
Weasley
who
had
been
outside
waiting
for
the
Ministry
cars
stuck
his
head
inside
they're
here
he
said
harry
come
on
mr.
Weasley
marched
Harry
across
the
short
stretch
of
pavement
toward
the
first
of
two
old
fashioned
dark
green
cars
each
of
which
was
driven
by
a
furtivelooking
wizard
wearing
a
suit
of
emerald
velvet
in
you
get
Harry
said
mr.
Weasley
glancing
up
and
down
the
crowded
street
harry
got
into
the
back
of
the
car
and
was
shortly
joined
by
Hermione
ron
and
to
ron's
disgust
Percy
the
journey
to
king's
Cross
was
very
uneventful
compared
with
harry's
trip
on
the
Knight
Bus
the
Ministry
of
Magic
cars
seemed
almost
ordinary
though
Harry
noticed
that
they
could
slide
through
gaps
that
Uncle
vernon's
new
company
car
certainly
couldn't
have
managed
they
reached
king's
Cross
with
twenty
minutes
to
spare
the
Ministry
drivers
found
them
trolleys
unloaded
their
trunks
touched
their
hats
in
salute
to
mr.
Weasley
and
drove
away
somehow
managing
to
jump
to
the
head
of
an
unmoving
line
at
the
traffic
lights
mr.
Weasley
kept
close
to
harry's
elbow
all
the
way
into
the
station
right
then
he
said
glancing
around
them
let's
do
this
in
pairs
as
there
are
so
many
of
us
i'll
go
through
first
with
Harry
mr.
Weasley
strolled
toward
the
barrier
between
platforms
nine
and
ten
pushing
harry's
trolley
and
apparently
very
interested
in
the
InterCity
that
had
just
arrived
at
platform
nine
with
a
meaningful
look
at
Harry
he
leaned
casually
against
the
barrier
harry
imitated
him
in
a
moment
they
had
fallen
sideways
through
the
solid
metal
onto
platform
nine
and
three
quarters
and
looked
up
to
see
the
Hogwarts
Express
a
scarlet
steam
engine
puffing
smoke
over
a
platform
packed
with
witches
and
wizards
seeing
their
children
onto
the
train
percy
and
Ginny
suddenly
appeared
behind
Harry
they
were
panting
and
had
apparently
taken
the
barrier
at
a
run
ah
there's
Penelope
said
Percy
smoothing
his
hair
and
going
Pink
again
ginny
caught
harry's
eye
and
they
both
turned
away
to
hide
their
laughter
as
Percy
strode
over
to
a
girl
with
long
curly
hair
walking
with
his
chest
thrown
out
so
that
she
couldn't
miss
his
shiny
badge
stood
back
to
let
him
on
they
leaned
out
of
the
window
and
waved
at
Mr
and
Mrs
weasley
until
the
train
turned
a
corner
and
blocked
them
from
view
i
need
to
talk
to
you
in
private
Harry
muttered
to
Ron
and
Hermione
as
the
train
picked
up
speed
go
away
Ginny
said
Ron
oh
that's
nice
said
Ginny
huffily
and
she
stalked
off
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
set
off
down
the
corridor
looking
for
an
empty
compartment
but
all
were
full
except
for
the
one
at
the
very
end
of
the
train
this
had
only
one
occupant
a
man
sitting
fast
asleep
next
to
the
window
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
checked
on
the
threshold
the
Hogwarts
Express
was
usually
reserved
for
students
and
they
had
never
seen
an
adult
there
before
except
for
the
witch
who
pushed
the
food
cart
the
stranger
was
wearing
an
extremely
shabby
set
of
wizard's
robes
that
had
been
darned
in
several
places
he
looked
ill
and
exhausted
though
quite
young
his
light
brown
hair
was
flecked
with
gray
who
d'you
reckon
he
is
ron
hissed
as
they
sat
down
and
slid
the
door
shut
taking
the
seats
farthest
away
from
the
window
professor
R
lupin
whispered
Hermione
at
once
how
d'you
know
that
it's
on
his
case
she
replied
pointing
at
the
luggage
rack
over
the
man's
head
where
there
was
a
small
battered
case
held
together
with
a
large
quantity
of
neatly
knotted
string
the
name
Professor
R
lupin
was
stamped
across
one
corner
in
peeling
letters
wonder
what
he
teaches
said
Ron
frowning
at
Professor
lupin's
pallid
profile
that's
obvious
whispered
Hermione
there's
only
one
vacancy
isn't
there
defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
had
already
had
two
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
teachers
both
of
whom
had
lasted
only
one
year
there
were
rumors
that
the
job
was
jinxed
well
I
hope
he's
up
to
it
said
Ron
doubtfully
he
looks
like
on
good
hex
would
finish
him
off
doesn't
he
anyway
he
turned
to
Harry
what
were
you
going
to
tell
us
harry
explained
all
about
mr.
and
Mrs
weasley's
argument
and
the
warning
mr.
Weasley
had
just
given
him
When
he'd
finished
Ron
looked
thunderstruck
and
Hermione
had
her
hands
over
her
mouth
she
finally
lowered
them
to
say
Sirius
Black
escaped
to
come
after
you
oh
harry
you'll
have
to
be
really
really
careful
don't
go
looking
for
trouble
Harry
i
don't
go
looking
for
trouble
said
Harry
nettled
trouble
usually
finds
me
how
thick
would
Harry
have
to
be
to
go
looking
for
a
nutter
who
wants
to
kill
him
said
Ron
shakily
they
were
taking
the
news
worse
than
Harry
had
expected
both
Ron
and
Hermione
seemed
to
be
much
more
frightened
of
Black
than
he
was
no
one
knows
how
he
got
out
of
Azkaban
said
Ron
uncomfortably
no
one's
ever
done
it
before
and
he
was
a
topsecurity
prisoner
too
but
they'll
catch
him
won't
they
said
Hermione
earnestly
i
Mean
they've
got
all
the
Muggles
looking
out
for
him
too
what's
that
noise
said
Ron
suddenly
a
faint
tinny
sort
of
whistle
was
coming
from
somewhere
the
looked
all
around
the
compartment
it's
coming
from
your
trunk
Harry
said
Ron
standing
up
and
reaching
into
the
luggage
rack
a
moment
later
he
had
pulled
the
Pocket
Sneakoscope
out
from
between
harry's
robes
it
was
spinning
very
fast
in
the
palm
of
ron's
hand
and
glowing
brilliantly
is
that
a
Sneakoscope
said
Hermione
interestedly
standing
up
for
a
better
look
yeah
mind
you
it's
a
very
cheap
one
Ron
said
it
went
haywire
just
as
I
was
tying
it
to
errol's
leg
to
send
it
to
Harry
were
you
doing
anything
untrustworthy
at
the
time
said
Hermione
shrewdly
no
well
i
wasn't
supposed
to
be
using
Errol
you
know
he's
not
really
up
to
long
journeys
but
how
else
was
I
supposed
to
get
harry's
present
to
him
stick
it
back
in
the
trunk
Harry
advised
as
the
Sneakoscope
whistled
piercingly
or
it'll
wake
him
up
he
nodded
toward
Professor
Lupin
ron
stuffed
the
Sneakoscope
into
a
particularly
horrible
pair
of
Uncle
vernon's
old
socks
which
deadened
the
sound
then
closed
the
lid
of
the
trunk
on
it
we
could
get
it
checked
in
Hogsmeade
said
Ron
sitting
back
down
they
sell
that
sort
of
thing
in
Dervish
and
Banges
magical
instruments
and
stuff
fred
and
George
told
me
do
you
know
much
about
Hogsmeade
asked
Hermione
keenly
i've
read
it's
the
only
entirely
nonMuggle
settlement
in
Britain
yeah
I
think
it
is
said
Ron
in
an
offhand
sort
of
way
but
that's
not
Why
I
want
to
go
i
just
want
to
get
inside
Honey
Dukes
what's
that
said
Hermione
it's
this
sweetshop
said
Ron
a
dreamy
look
coming
over
his
face
where
they've
got
everything
pepper
Imps
they
make
you
smoke
at
the
mouth
and
great
fat
Chocoballs
full
of
strawberry
mousse
and
clotted
cream
and
really
excellent
sugar
quills
which
you
can
suck
in
class
and
just
look
like
you're
thinking
what
to
write
next
but
hogsmeade's
a
very
interesting
place
isn't
it
hermione
pressed
on
eagerly
in
Sites
of
Historical
Sorcery
it
says
the
inn
was
the
headquarters
for
the
goblin
rebellion
and
the
Shrieking
Shades
supposed
to
be
the
most
severely
haunted
building
in
Britain
and
massive
sherbert
balls
that
make
you
levitate
a
few
inches
off
the
ground
while
you're
sucking
them
said
Ron
who
was
plainly
not
listening
to
a
word
Hermione
was
saying
hermione
looked
around
at
Harry
won't
it
be
nice
to
get
out
of
school
for
a
bit
and
explore
Hogsmeade
spect
it
will
said
Harry
heavily
you'll
have
to
tell
me
when
you've
found
out
what
d'you
mean
said
Ron
i
can't
go
the
Dursleys
didn't
sign
my
permission
form
and
Fudge
wouldn't
either
ron
looked
horrified
you're
not
allowed
to
come
but
no
way
McGonagall
or
someone
will
give
you
permission
musclely
Crabbe
was
taller
with
a
puddingbowl
haircut
and
a
very
thick
neck
Goyle
had
short
bristly
hair
and
long
gorillaish
arms
well
look
who
it
is
said
Malfoy
in
his
usual
lazy
drawl
pulling
open
the
compartment
door
potty
and
the
Weasel
crabbe
and
Goyle
chuckled
trollishly
i
heard
your
father
finally
got
his
hands
on
some
gold
this
summer
weasley
said
Malfoy
did
your
mother
die
of
shock
ron
stood
up
so
quickly
he
knocked
crookshanks's
basket
to
the
floor
professor
Lupin
gave
a
snort
who's
that
said
Malfoy
taking
an
automatic
step
backward
as
he
spotted
Lupin
new
teacher
said
Harry
who
got
to
his
feet
too
in
case
he
needed
to
hold
Ron
back
what
were
you
saying
Malfoy
malfoy's
pale
eyes
narrowed
he
wasn't
fool
enough
to
pick
a
fight
right
under
a
teacher's
nose
c'mon
he
muttered
resentfully
to
Crabbe
and
Goyle
and
they
disappeared
harry
and
Ron
sat
down
again
Ron
massaging
his
knuckles
i'm
not
going
to
take
any
crap
from
Malfoy
this
year
he
said
angrily
i
mean
it
if
he
makes
one
more
crack
about
my
family
i'm
going
to
get
hold
of
his
head
and
ron
made
a
violent
gesture
in
midair
ron
hissed
Hermione
pointing
at
Professor
Lupin
be
careful
but
Professor
Lupin
was
still
fast
asleep
the
rain
thickened
as
the
train
sped
yet
farther
north
the
windows
were
now
a
solid
shimmering
gray
which
graduily
darkened
until
lanterns
flickered
into
life
all
along
the
corridors
and
over
the
luggage
racks
the
train
rattled
the
rain
hammered
the
ind
roared
but
still
professor
Lupin
slept
we
must
be
nearly
there
said
Ron
leaning
forward
to
look
past
Professor
Lupin
at
the
now
completely
black
window
the
words
had
hardly
left
him
when
the
train
started
to
slow
down
great
said
Ron
getting
up
and
walking
carefully
past
Professor
Lupin
to
try
and
see
outside
i'm
starving
i
want
to
get
to
the
feast
we
can't
be
there
yet
said
Hermione
checking
her
watch
so
why're
we
stopping
the
train
was
getting
slower
and
slower
as
the
noise
of
the
pistons
fell
away
the
wind
and
rain
sounded
louder
than
ever
against
the
windows
harry
who
was
nearest
the
door
got
up
to
look
into
the
corridor
all
along
the
carriage
heads
were
sticking
curiously
out
of
their
compartments
the
train
came
to
a
stop
with
a
jolt
and
distant
thuds
and
bangs
told
them
that
luggage
had
fallen
out
of
the
racks
then
without
warning
all
the
lamps
went
out
and
they
were
plunged
into
total
darkness
what's
going
on
said
ron's
voice
from
behind
Harry
ouch
gasped
Hermione
ron
that
was
my
foot
harry
felt
his
way
back
to
his
seat
d'you
think
we've
broken
down
dunno
there
was
a
squeaking
sound
and
Harry
saw
the
dim
black
outline
of
Ron
wiping
a
patch
clean
on
the
window
and
peering
out
there's
something
moving
out
there
Ron
said
i
think
people
are
coming
aboard
the
compartment
door
suddenly
opened
and
someone
fell
painfully
over
harry's
legs
sorry
d'you
know
what's
going
on
ouch
sorry
hullo
Neville
said
Harry
feeling
around
in
the
dark
and
pulling
Neville
up
by
his
cloak
harry
is
that
you
what's
happening
no
idea
sit
down
there
was
a
loud
hissing
and
a
yelp
of
pain
Neville
had
tried
to
sit
on
Crookshanks
i'm
going
to
go
and
ask
the
driver
what's
going
on
came
hermione's
voice
harry
felt
her
pass
him
heard
the
door
slide
open
again
and
then
a
thud
and
two
loud
squeals
of
pain
who's
that
who's
that
ginny
hermione
what
are
you
doing
i
was
looking
for
Ron
Come
in
and
sit
down
not
here
said
Harry
hurriedly
i'm
here
ouch
said
Neville
quiet
said
a
hoarse
voice
suddenly
professor
Lupin
appeared
to
have
woken
up
at
last
harry
could
hear
movements
in
his
corner
none
of
them
spoke
there
was
a
soft
crackling
noise
and
a
shivering
light
filled
the
compartment
professor
Lupin
appeared
to
be
holding
a
handful
of
flames
they
illuminated
his
tired
gray
face
but
his
eyes
looked
alert
and
wary
stay
where
you
are
he
said
in
the
same
hoarse
voice
and
he
got
slowly
to
his
feet
with
his
handful
of
fire
held
out
in
front
of
him
but
the
door
slid
slowly
open
before
Lupin
could
reach
it
standing
in
the
doorway
illuminated
by
the
shivering
flames
in
lupin's
hand
was
a
cloaked
figure
that
towered
to
the
ceiling
its
face
was
completely
hidden
beneath
its
hood
harry's
eyes
darted
downward
and
what
he
saw
made
his
stomach
contract
there
was
a
hand
protruding
from
the
cloak
and
it
was
glistening
grayish
slimylooking
and
scabbed
like
something
dead
that
had
decayed
in
water
but
it
was
visible
only
for
a
split
second
as
though
the
creature
beneath
the
cloak
sensed
harry's
gaze
the
hand
was
suddenly
withdrawn
into
the
folds
of
its
black
cloak
and
then
the
thing
beneath
the
hood
whatever
it
was
drew
a
long
slow
rattling
breath
as
though
it
were
trying
to
suck
something
more
than
air
from
its
surroundings
an
intense
cold
swept
over
them
all
harry
felt
his
own
breath
catch
in
his
chest
the
cold
went
deeper
than
his
skin
it
was
inside
his
chest
it
was
inside
his
very
heart
harry's
eyes
rolled
up
into
his
head
he
couldn't
see
he
was
drowning
in
cold
there
was
a
rushing
in
his
ears
as
though
of
water
he
was
being
dragged
downward
the
roaring
growing
louder
and
then
from
far
away
he
heard
screaming
terrible
terrified
pleading
screams
he
wanted
to
help
whoever
it
was
he
tried
to
move
his
arms
but
couldn't
a
thick
white
fog
was
swirling
around
him
inside
him
Harry
harry
are
you
all
right
someone
was
slapping
his
face
w
what
harry
opened
his
eyes
there
were
lanterns
above
him
and
the
floor
was
shaking
the
Hogwarts
Express
was
moving
again
and
the
lights
had
come
back
on
he
seemed
to
have
slid
out
of
his
seat
onto
the
floor
ron
and
Hermione
were
kneeling
next
to
him
and
above
them
he
could
see
Neville
and
Professor
Lupin
watching
harry
felt
very
sick
when
he
put
up
his
hand
to
push
his
glasses
back
on
he
felt
cold
sweat
on
his
face
ron
and
Hermione
heaved
him
back
onto
his
seat
are
you
okay
ron
asked
nervously
yeah
said
Harry
looking
quickly
toward
the
door
the
hooded
creature
had
vanished
what
happened
where's
that
that
thing
who
screamed
no
one
screamed
said
Ron
more
nervously
still
harry
looked
around
the
bright
compartment
ginny
and
Neville
looked
back
at
him
both
very
pale
but
I
heard
screaming
a
loud
snap
made
them
all
jump
professor
Lupin
was
breaking
an
enormous
slab
of
chocolate
into
pieces
here
he
said
to
Harry
handing
him
a
particularly
large
piece
eat
it
it'll
help
harry
took
the
chocolate
but
didn't
eat
it
what
was
that
thing
he
asked
Lupin
a
dementor
said
Lupin
who
was
now
giving
chocolate
to
everyone
else
one
of
the
dementors
of
Azkaban
everyone
stared
at
him
professor
Lupin
crumpled
up
the
empty
chocolate
wrapper
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
eat
he
repeated
it'll
help
i
need
to
speak
to
the
driver
excuse
me
he
strolled
past
Harry
and
disappeared
into
the
corridor
are
you
sure
you're
okay
Harry
said
Hermione
watching
Harry
anxiously
i
don't
get
it
what
happened
said
Harry
wiping
more
sweat
off
his
face
well
that
thing
the
dementor
stood
there
and
looked
around
I
mean
I
think
it
did
I
couldn't
see
its
face
and
you
you
I
thought
you
were
having
a
fit
or
something
said
Ron
who
still
looked
scared
you
went
sort
of
rigid
and
fell
out
of
your
seat
and
started
twitching
And
Professor
Lupin
stepped
over
you
and
walked
toward
the
dementor
and
pulled
out
his
wand
said
Hermione
and
he
said
None
of
us
is
hiding
Sirius
Black
under
our
cloaks
go.
But
the
dementor
didn't
move
so
Lupin
muttered
something
and
a
silvery
thing
shot
out
of
his
wand
at
it
and
it
turned
around
and
sort
of
glided
away
it
was
horrible
said
Neville
in
a
higher
voice
than
usual
did
you
feel
how
cold
it
got
when
it
came
in
i
felt
weird
said
Ron
shifting
his
shoulders
uncomfortably
like
i'd
never
be
cheerful
again
ginny
who
was
huddled
in
her
corner
looking
nearly
as
bad
as
Harry
felt
gave
a
small
sob
Hermione
went
over
and
put
a
comforting
arm
around
her
but
didn't
any
of
you
fall
off
your
seats
said
Harry
awkwardly
no
said
Ron
looking
anxiously
at
Harry
again
ginny
was
shaking
like
mad
though
harry
didn't
understand
he
felt
weak
and
shivery
as
though
he
were
recovering
from
a
bad
bout
of
flu
he
also
felt
the
beginnings
of
shame
why
had
he
gone
to
pieces
like
that
when
no
one
else
had
professor
Lupin
had
come
back
he
paused
as
he
entered
looked
around
and
said
with
a
small
smile
I
haven't
poisoned
that
chocolate
you
know
harry
took
a
bite
and
to
his
great
surprise
felt
warmth
spread
suddenly
to
the
tips
of
his
fingers
and
toes
we'll
be
at
Hogwarts
in
ten
minutes
said
Professor
Lupin
are
you
all
right
Harry
harry
didn't
ask
how
Professor
Lupin
knew
his
name
fine
he
muttered
embarrassed
they
didn't
talk
much
during
the
remainder
of
the
journey
at
long
last
the
train
stopped
at
Hogsmeade
station
and
there
was
a
great
scramble
to
get
outside
owls
hooted
cats
meowed
and
neville's
pet
toad
croaked
loudly
from
under
his
hat
it
was
freezing
on
the
tiny
platform
rain
was
driving
down
in
icy
sheets
firs
years
this
way
called
a
familiar
voice
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
turned
and
saw
the
gigantic
outline
of
Hagrid
at
the
other
end
of
the
platform
beckoning
the
terrifiedlooking
new
students
forward
for
their
traditional
journey
across
the
lake
all
right
you
three
hagrid
yelled
over
the
heads
of
the
crowd
they
waved
at
him
but
had
no
chance
to
speak
to
him
because
the
mass
of
people
around
them
was
shunting
them
away
along
the
platform
harry
ron
and
Hermione
followed
the
rest
of
the
school
along
the
platform
and
out
onto
a
rough
mud
track
where
at
least
a
hundred
stagecoaches
awaited
the
remaining
students
each
pulled
Harry
could
only
assume
by
an
invisible
horse
because
when
they
climbed
inside
and
shut
the
door
the
coach
set
off
all
by
itself
bumping
and
swaying
in
procession
the
coach
smelled
faintly
of
mold
and
straw
harry
felt
better
since
the
chocolate
but
still
weak
ron
and
Hermione
kept
looking
at
him
sideways
as
though
frightened
he
might
collapse
again
as
the
carriage
trundled
toward
a
pair
of
magnificent
wrought
iron
gates
flanked
with
stone
columns
topped
with
winged
boars
harry
saw
two
more
towering
hooded
dementors
standing
guard
on
either
side
a
wave
of
cold
sickness
threatened
to
engulf
him
again
he
leaned
back
into
the
lumpy
seat
and
closed
his
eyes
until
they
had
passed
the
gates
the
carriage
picked
up
speed
on
the
long
sloping
drive
up
to
the
castle
Hermione
was
leaning
out
of
the
tiny
window
watching
the
many
turrets
and
towers
draw
nearer
at
last
the
carriage
swayed
to
a
halt
and
Hermione
and
Ron
got
out
as
Harry
stepped
down
a
drawling
delighted
voice
sounded
in
his
ear
you
fainted
Potter
is
Longbottorn
telling
the
truth
you
actualy
fainted
malfoy
elbowed
past
Hermione
to
block
harry's
way
up
the
stone
steps
to
the
castle
his
face
gleeful
and
his
pale
eyes
glinting
maliciously
shove
off
Malfoy
said
Ron
whose
jaw
was
clenched
did
you
faint
as
well
Weasley
said
Malfoy
loudly
did
the
scary
old
dementor
frighten
you
too
Weasley
is
there
a
problem
said
a
mild
voice
professor
Lupin
had
just
gotten
out
of
the
next
carriage
malfoy
gave
Professor
Lupin
an
insolent
stare
which
took
in
the
patches
on
his
robes
and
the
delapidated
suitcase
with
a
tiny
hint
of
sarcasm
in
his
voice
he
said
Oh
no
er
Professor
then
he
smirked
at
Crabbe
and
Goyle
and
led
them
up
the
steps
into
the
castle
hermione
prodded
Ron
in
the
back
to
make
him
hurry
and
the
three
of
them
joined
the
crowd
swarming
up
the
steps
through
the
giant
oak
front
doors
into
the
cavernous
entrance
hall
which
was
lit
with
flaming
torches
and
housed
a
magnificent
marble
staircase
that
led
to
the
upper
floors
the
door
into
the
Great
Hall
stood
open
at
the
right
Harry
followed
the
crowd
toward
it
but
had
barely
glimpsed
the
enchanted
ceiling
which
was
black
and
cloudy
tonight
when
a
voice
called
Potter
granger
i
want
to
see
you
both
harry
and
Hermione
turned
around
surprised
professor
McGonagall
transfiguration
teacher
and
head
of
Gryffindor
House
was
calling
over
the
heads
of
the
crowd
she
was
a
sternlooking
witch
who
wore
her
hair
in
a
tight
bun
her
sharp
eyes
were
framed
with
square
spectacles
harry
fought
his
way
over
to
her
with
a
feeling
of
foreboding
Professor
McGonagall
had
a
way
of
making
him
feel
he
must
have
done
something
wrong
there's
no
need
to
look
so
worried
I
just
want
a
word
in
my
office
she
told
them
move
along
there
Weasley
ron
stared
as
Professor
McGonagall
ushered
Harry
and
Hermione
away
from
the
chattering
crowd
they
accompanied
her
across
the
entrance
hall
up
the
marble
staircase
and
along
a
corridor
once
they
were
in
her
office
a
small
room
with
a
large
welcoming
fire
professor
McGonagall
motioned
Harry
and
Hermione
to
sit
down
she
settled
herself
behind
her
desk
and
said
abruptly
Professor
Lupin
sent
an
owl
ahead
to
say
that
you
were
taken
ill
on
the
train
Potter
before
Harry
could
reply
there
was
a
soft
knock
on
the
door
and
Madam
Pomfrey
the
nurse
came
bustling
in
harry
felt
himself
going
red
in
the
face
it
was
bad
enough
that
he'd
passed
out
or
whatever
he
had
done
without
everyone
making
all
this
fuss
i'm
fine
he
said
I
don't
need
anything
Oh
it's
you
is
it
said
Madam
Pomfrey
ignoring
this
and
bending
down
to
stare
closely
at
him
i
suppose
you've
been
doing
something
dangerous
again
it
was
a
dementor
Poppy
said
Professor
McGonagall
they
exchanged
a
dark
look
and
Madam
Pomfrey
clucked
disapprovingly
setting
dementors
around
a
school
she
muttered
pushing
back
harry's
hair
and
feeling
his
forehead
he
won't
be
the
last
one
who
collapses
yes
he's
all
clammy
terrible
things
they
are
and
the
effect
they
have
on
people
who
are
already
delicate
i'm
not
delicate
said
Harry
crossly
of
course
you're
not
said
Madam
Pomfrey
absentmindedly
now
taking
his
pulse
what
does
he
need
said
Professor
McGonagall
crisply
bed
rest
should
he
perhaps
spend
tonight
in
the
hospital
wing
i'm
fine
said
Harry
jumping
up
the
thought
of
what
Draco
Malfoy
would
say
if
he
had
to
go
to
the
hospital
wing
was
torture
well
he
should
have
some
chocolate
at
the
very
least
said
Madam
Pomfrey
who
was
now
trying
to
peer
into
harry's
eyes
i've
already
had
some
said
Harry
professor
Lupin
gave
me
some
he
gave
it
to
all
of
us
did
he
now
said
Madam
Pomfrey
approvingly
so
we've
finally
got
a
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
teacher
who
knows
his
remedies
are
you
sure
you
feel
all
right
Potter
professor
McGonagall
said
sharply
yes
said
Harry
very
well
kindly
wait
outside
while
I
have
a
quick
word
with
Miss
Granger
about
her
course
schedule
then
we
can
go
down
to
the
feast
together
harry
went
back
into
the
corridor
with
Madam
Pomfrey
who
left
for
the
hospital
wing
muttering
to
herself
He
had
to
wait
only
a
few
minutes
then
Hermione
emerged
looking
very
happy
about
something
followed
by
Professor
McGonagall
and
the
three
of
them
made
their
way
back
down
the
marble
staircase
to
the
Great
Hall
it
was
a
sea
of
pointed
black
hats
each
of
the
long
House
tables
was
lined
with
students
their
faces
glimmering
by
the
light
of
thousands
of
candles
which
were
floating
over
the
tables
in
midair
professor
Flitwick
who
was
a
tiny
little
wizard
with
a
shock
of
white
hair
was
carrying
an
ancient
hat
and
a
threelegged
stool
out
of
the
hall
oh
said
Hermione
softly
we've
missed
the
Sorting
new
students
at
Hogwarts
were
sorted
into
Houses
by
trying
on
the
sorting
Hat
which
shouted
out
the
House
they
were
best
suited
to
Gryffindor
Ravenclaw
Hufflepuff
or
Slytherin
professor
McGonagall
strode
off
toward
her
empty
seat
at
the
staff
table
and
Harry
and
Hermione
set
off
in
the
other
direction
as
quietly
as
possible
toward
the
Gryffindor
table
people
looked
around
at
them
as
they
passed
along
the
back
of
the
hall
and
a
few
of
them
pointed
at
Harry
had
the
story
of
his
collapsing
in
front
of
the
dementor
traveled
that
fast
he
and
Hermione
sat
down
on
either
side
of
Ron
who
had
saved
them
seats
what
was
all
that
about
he
muttered
to
Harry
harry
started
to
explain
in
a
whisper
but
at
that
moment
the
headmaster
stood
up
to
speak
and
he
broke
off
professor
Dumbledore
though
very
old
always
gave
an
impression
of
great
energy
he
had
several
feet
of
long
silver
hair
and
beard
halfmoon
spectacles
and
an
extremely
crooked
nose
he
was
often
described
as
the
greatest
wizard
of
the
age
but
that
wasn't
why
Harry
respected
him
you
couldn't
help
trusting
Albus
Dumbledore
and
as
Harry
watched
him
beaming
around
at
the
students
he
felt
really
calm
for
the
first
time
since
the
dementor
had
entered
the
train
compartment
welcome
said
Dumbledore
the
candlelight
shimmering
on
his
beard
welcome
to
another
year
at
Hogwarts
i
have
a
few
things
to
say
to
you
all
and
as
one
of
them
is
very
serious
I
think
it
best
to
get
it
out
of
the
way
before
you
become
befuddled
by
our
excellent
feast
dumbledore
cleared
his
throat
and
continued
As
you
will
all
be
aware
after
their
search
of
the
Hogwarts
Express
our
school
is
presently
playing
host
to
some
of
the
dementors
of
Azkaban
who
are
here
on
Ministry
of
Magic
business
he
paused
and
Harry
remembered
what
mr.
Weasley
had
said
about
Dumbledore
not
being
happy
with
the
dementors
guarding
the
school
they
are
stationed
at
every
entrance
to
the
grounds
Dumbledore
continued
and
while
they
are
with
us
I
must
make
it
plain
that
nobody
is
to
leave
school
without
permission
dementors
are
not
to
be
fooled
by
tricks
or
disguises
or
even
Invisibility
Cloaks
he
added
blandly
and
Harry
and
Ron
glanced
at
each
other
it
is
not
in
the
nature
of
a
dementor
to
understand
pleading
or
excuses
i
therefore
warn
each
and
every
one
of
you
to
give
them
no
reason
to
harm
you
i
look
to
the
prefects
and
our
new
Head
Boy
and
Girl
to
make
sure
that
no
student
runs
afoul
of
the
dementors
he
said
percy
who
was
sitting
a
few
seats
down
from
Harry
puffed
out
his
chest
again
and
stared
around
impressively
dumbledore
paused
again
he
looked
very
seriously
around
the
hall
and
nobody
moved
or
made
a
sound
on
a
happier
note
he
continued
I
am
pleased
to
welcome
two
new
teachers
to
our
ranks
this
year
first
Professor
Lupin
who
has
kindly
consented
to
fill
the
post
of
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
teacher
there
was
some
scattered
rather
unenthusiastic
applause
only
those
who
had
been
in
the
compartment
on
the
train
with
Professor
Lupin
clapped
hard
Harry
among
them
professor
Lupin
looked
particularly
shabby
next
to
all
the
other
teachers
in
their
best
robes
look
at
Snape
ron
hissed
in
harry's
ear
professor
Snape
the
Potions
master
was
staring
along
the
staff
table
at
Professor
Lupin
it
was
common
knowledge
that
Snape
anted
the
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
job
but
even
Harry
who
hated
Snape
was
startled
at
the
expression
twisting
his
thin
sallow
face
it
was
beyond
anger
it
was
loathing
harry
knew
that
expression
only
too
well
it
was
the
look
Snape
wore
every
time
he
set
eyes
on
Harry
as
to
our
second
new
appointment
Dumbledore
continued
as
the
lukewarm
applause
for
Professor
Lupin
died
away
well
I
am
sorry
to
tell
you
that
Professor
Kettleburn
our
Care
of
Magical
Creatures
teacher
retired
at
the
end
of
last
year
in
order
to
enjoy
more
time
with
his
remaining
limbs
however
I
am
delighted
to
say
that
his
place
will
be
filled
by
none
other
than
Rubeus
Hagrid
who
has
agreed
to
take
on
this
teaching
job
in
addition
to
his
gamekeeping
duties
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
stared
at
one
another
stunned
then
they
joined
in
with
the
applause
which
was
tumultuous
at
the
Gryffindor
table
in
particular
harry
leaned
forward
to
see
Hagrid
who
was
rubyred
in
the
face
and
staring
down
at
his
enormous
hands
his
wide
grin
hidden
in
the
tangle
of
his
black
beard
we
should've
known
ron
roared
pounding
the
table
who
else
would
have
assigned
us
a
biting
book
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
were
the
last
to
stop
clapping
and
as
Professor
Dumbledore
started
speaking
again
they
saw
that
Hagrid
was
wiping
his
eyes
on
the
tablecloth
well
I
think
that's
everything
of
importance
said
Dumbledore
let
the
feast
begin
the
golden
plates
and
goblets
before
them
filled
suddenly
with
food
and
drink
harry
suddenly
ravenous
helped
himself
to
everything
he
could
reach
and
began
to
eat
it
was
a
delicious
feast
the
hall
echoed
with
talk
laughter
and
the
clatter
of
knives
and
forks
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
however
were
eager
for
it
to
finish
so
that
they
could
talk
to
Hagrid
they
knew
how
much
being
made
a
teacher
would
mean
to
him
hagrid
wasn't
a
fully
qualified
wizard
he
had
been
expelled
from
Hogwarts
in
his
third
year
for
a
crime
he
had
not
committed
it
had
been
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
who
had
cleared
hagrid's
name
last
year
at
long
last
when
the
last
morsels
of
pumpkin
tart
had
melted
from
the
golden
platters
Dumbledore
gave
the
word
that
it
was
time
for
them
all
to
go
to
bed
and
they
got
their
chance
congratulations
Hagrid
hermione
squealed
as
they
reached
the
teachers
table
all
down
ter
you
three
said
Hagrid
wiping
his
shining
face
on
his
napkin
as
he
looked
up
at
them
Can
believe
it
great
man
dumbledore
came
straight
down
to
me
hut
after
Professor
Kettleburn
said
he'd
had
enough
it's
what
I
always
wanted
overcome
with
emotion
he
buried
his
face
in
his
napkin
and
Professor
McGonagall
shooed
them
away
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
joined
the
Gryffindors
streaming
up
the
marble
staircase
and
very
tired
now
along
more
corridors
up
more
and
more
stairs
to
the
hidden
entrance
to
Gryffindor
tower's
large
portrait
of
a
fat
lady
in
a
pink
dress
asked
them
Password
coming
through
coming
through
percy
called
from
behind
the
crowd
the
new
password's
Fortuna
Major
oh
no
said
Neville
Longbottom
sadly
he
always
had
trouble
remembering
the
passwords
through
the
portrait
hole
and
across
the
common
room
the
girls
and
boys
divided
toward
their
separate
staircases
harry
climbed
the
spiral
stair
with
no
thought
in
his
head
except
how
glad
he
was
to
be
back
they
reached
their
familiar
circular
dormitory
with
its
five
fourposter
beds
and
Harry
looking
around
felt
he
was
home
at
last
chapter
six
talons
and
tea
leaves
when
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
entered
the
Great
Hall
for
breakfast
the
next
day
the
first
thing
they
saw
was
Draco
Malfoy
who
seemed
to
be
entertaining
a
large
group
of
Slytherins
with
a
very
funny
story
as
they
passed
Malfoy
did
a
ridiculous
impression
of
a
swooning
fit
and
there
was
a
roar
of
laughter
ignore
him
said
Hermione
who
was
right
behind
Harry
just
ignore
him
it's
not
worth
it
hey
Potter
shrieked
Pansy
Parkinson
a
Slytherin
girl
with
a
face
like
a
pug
potter
the
dementors
are
coming
Potter
woooooooooo
harry
dropped
into
a
seat
at
the
Gryffindor
table
next
to
George
Weasley
new
thirdyear
course
schedules
said
George
passing
then
over
what's
up
with
you
Harry
malfoy
said
Ron
sitting
down
on
george's
other
side
and
glaring
over
at
the
Slytherin
table
george
looked
up
in
time
to
see
Malfoy
pretending
to
faint
with
terror
again
that
little
git
he
said
calmly
he
wasn't
so
cocky
last
night
when
the
dementors
were
down
at
our
end
of
the
train
came
runing
into
our
compartment
didn't
he
Fred
nearly
wet
himself
said
Fred
with
a
contemptuous
glance
at
Malfoy
i
wasn't
too
happy
myself
said
George
they're
horrible
things
those
dementors
sort
of
freeze
your
insides
don't
they
said
Fred
you
didn't
pass
out
though
did
you
said
Harry
in
a
low
voice
forget
it
Harry
said
George
bracingly
dad
had
to
go
out
to
Azkaban
one
time
remember
Fred
and
he
said
it
was
the
worst
place
he'd
ever
been
he
came
back
all
weak
and
shaking
they
suck
the
happiness
out
of
a
place
dementors
most
of
the
prisoners
go
mad
in
there
anyway
we'll
see
how
happy
Malfoy
looks
after
our
first
Quidditch
match
said
Fred
gryffindor
versus
Slytherin
first
game
of
the
season
remember
the
only
time
Harry
and
Malfoy
had
faced
each
other
in
a
Quidditch
match
Malfoy
had
definitely
come
off
worse
feeling
slightly
more
cheerful
Harry
helped
himself
to
sausages
and
fried
tomatoes
hermione
was
examining
her
new
schedule
ooh
good
we're
starting
some
new
subjects
today
she
said
happily
villains
are
these
that
trespass
upon
my
private
lands
come
I
scorn
at
my
fall
perchance
draw
you
knaves
you
dogs
they
watched
in
astonishment
as
the
little
knight
tugged
his
sword
out
of
its
scabbard
and
began
brandishing
it
violently
hopping
up
and
down
in
rage
but
the
sword
was
too
long
for
him
a
particularly
wild
swing
made
him
overbalance
and
he
landed
facedown
in
the
grass
are
you
all
right
said
Harry
moving
closer
to
the
picture
get
back
you
scurvy
braggart
back
you
rogue
the
knight
seized
his
sword
again
and
used
it
to
push
himself
back
up
but
the
blade
sank
deeply
into
the
grass
and
though
he
pulled
with
all
his
might
he
couldn't
get
it
out
again
finally
he
had
to
flop
back
down
onto
the
grass
and
push
up
his
visor
to
mop
his
sweating
face
listen
said
Harry
taking
advantage
of
the
knight's
exhaustion
we're
looking
for
the
North
Tower
you
don't
know
the
way
do
you
a
quest
the
knight's
rage
seemed
to
vanish
instantly
he
clanked
to
his
feet
and
shouted
Come
follow
me
dear
friends
and
we
shall
find
our
goal
or
else
shall
perish
bravely
in
the
charge
he
gave
the
sword
another
fruitless
tug
tried
and
failed
to
mount
the
fat
pony
gave
up
and
cried
On
foot
then
good
sirs
and
gentle
lady
on
on
and
he
ran
clanking
loudly
into
the
left
side
of
the
frame
and
out
of
sight
they
hurried
after
him
along
the
corridor
following
the
sound
of
his
armor
every
now
and
then
they
spotted
him
running
through
a
picture
ahead
be
of
stout
heart
the
worst
is
yet
to
come
yelled
the
knight
and
they
saw
him
reappear
in
front
of
an
alarmed
group
of
women
in
crinolines
whose
picture
hung
on
the
wall
of
a
narrow
spiral
staircase
puffing
loudly
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
climbed
the
tightly
spiraling
steps
getting
dizzier
and
dizzier
until
at
last
they
heard
the
murmur
of
voices
above
them
and
knew
they
had
reached
the
classroom
farewell
cried
the
knight
popping
his
head
into
a
painting
of
some
sinisterlooking
monks
farewell
my
comradesinarms
if
ever
you
have
need
of
noble
heart
and
steely
sinew
call
upon
Sir
Cadogan
yeah
we'll
call
you
muttered
Ron
as
the
knight
disappeared
if
we
ever
need
someone
mental
they
climbed
the
last
few
steps
and
emerged
onto
a
tiny
landing
where
most
of
the
class
was
already
assembled
there
were
no
doors
off
this
landing
but
Ron
nudged
Harry
and
pointed
at
the
ceiling
where
there
was
a
circular
trapdoor
with
a
brass
plaque
on
it
sibyll
Trelawney
Divination
teacher
Harry
read
how're
we
supposed
to
get
up
there
as
though
in
answer
to
his
question
the
trapdoor
suddenly
opened
and
a
silvery
ladder
descended
right
at
harry's
feet
everyone
got
quiet
after
you
said
Ron
grinning
so
Harry
climbed
the
ladder
first
he
emerged
into
the
strangestlooking
classroom
he
had
ever
seen
in
fact
it
didn't
look
like
a
classroom
at
all
more
like
a
cross
between
someone's
attic
and
an
oldfashioned
tea
shop
at
leasttwenty
small
circular
tables
were
crammed
inside
it
all
surrounded
by
chintz
armchairs
and
fat
little
poufs
everything
was
lit
with
a
dim
crimson
light
the
curtains
at
the
windows
were
all
closed
and
the
many
lamps
were
draped
with
dark
red
scarves
it
was
stiflingly
warm
and
the
fire
that
was
burning
under
the
crowded
mantelpiece
was
giving
off
a
heavy
sickly
sort
of
perfume
as
it
heated
a
large
copper
kettle
the
shelves
running
around
the
circular
walls
were
crammed
with
dustylooking
feathers
stubs
of
candles
many
packs
of
tattered
playing
cards
countless
silvery
crystal
balls
and
a
huge
array
of
teacups
ron
appeared
at
harry's
shoulder
as
the
class
assembled
around
them
all
talking
in
whispers
where
is
she
ron
said
a
voice
came
suddenly
out
of
the
shadows
a
soft
misty
sort
of
voice
welcome
it
said
how
nice
to
see
you
in
the
physical
world
at
last
harry's
immediate
impression
was
of
a
large
glittering
insect
professor
Trelawney
moved
into
the
firelight
and
they
saw
that
she
was
very
thin
her
large
glasses
magnified
her
eyes
to
several
times
their
natural
size
and
she
was
draped
in
a
gauzy
spangled
shawl
innumerable
chains
and
beads
hung
around
her
spindly
neck
and
her
arms
and
hands
were
encrusted
with
bangles
and
rings
sit
my
children
sit
she
said
and
they
all
climbed
awkwardly
into
armchairs
or
sank
onto
poufs
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
sat
themselves
around
the
same
round
table
welcome
to
Divination
said
Professor
Trelawney
who
had
seated
herself
in
a
winged
armchair
in
front
of
the
fire
my
name
is
professor
Trelawney
you
may
not
have
seen
me
before
i
find
that
descending
too
often
into
the
hustle
and
bustle
of
the
main
school
clouds
my
Inner
Eye
nobody
said
anything
to
this
extraordinary
pronouncement
professor
Trelawney
delicately
rearranged
her
shawl
and
continued
So
you
have
chosen
to
study
Divination
the
most
difficult
of
all
magical
arts
i
must
warn
you
at
the
outset
that
if
you
do
not
have
the
Sight
there
is
very
little
I
will
be
able
to
teach
you
books
can
take
you
only
so
far
in
this
field
at
these
words
both
Harry
and
Ron
glanced
grinning
at
Hermione
who
looked
startled
at
the
news
that
books
wouldn't
be
much
help
in
this
subject
many
witches
and
wizards
talented
though
they
are
in
the
area
of
loud
bangs
and
smells
and
sudden
disappearings
are
yet
unable
to
penetrate
the
veiled
mysteries
of
the
future
Professor
Trelawney
went
on
her
enormous
gleaming
eyes
moving
from
face
to
nervous
face
it
is
a
Gift
granted
to
few
you
boy
she
said
suddenly
to
Neville
who
almost
toppled
off
his
pouf
is
your
grandmother
well
i
think
so
said
Neville
tremulously
i
wouldn't
be
so
sure
if
I
were
you
dear
said
Professor
Trelawney
the
firelight
glinting
on
her
long
emerald
earrings
neville
gulped
professor
Trelawney
continued
placidly
we
will
be
covering
the
basic
methods
of
Divination
this
year
the
first
term
will
be
devoted
to
reading
the
tea
leaves
next
term
we
shall
progress
to
palmistry
by
the
way
my
dear
she
shot
suddenly
at
Parvati
Patil
beware
a
redhaired
man
parvati
gave
a
startled
look
at
Ron
who
was
right
behind
her
and
edged
her
chair
away
from
him
in
the
second
term
Professor
Trelawney
went
on
we
shall
progress
to
the
crystal
ball
if
we
have
finished
with
fire
omens
that
is
unfortunately
classes
will
be
disrupted
in
February
by
a
nasty
bout
of
flu
i
myself
will
lose
my
voice
and
around
Easter
one
of
our
number
will
leave
us
forever
a
very
tense
silence
followed
this
pronouncement
but
Professor
Trelawney
seemed
unaware
of
it
i
wonder
dear
she
said
to
Lavender
Brown
who
was
nearest
and
shrank
back
in
her
chair
if
you
could
pass
me
the
largest
silver
teapot
lavender
looking
relieved
stood
up
took
an
enormous
teapot
from
the
shelf
and
put
it
down
on
the
table
in
front
of
Professor
Trelawney
thank
you
my
dear
incidentally
that
thing
you
are
dreading
it
will
happen
on
Friday
the
sixteenth
of
October
lavender
trembled
now
I
want
you
all
to
divide
into
pairs
collect
a
teacup
from
the
shelf
come
to
me
and
I
will
fill
it
then
sit
down
and
drink
drink
until
only
the
dregs
remain
swill
these
around
the
cup
three
times
with
the
left
hand
then
turn
the
cup
upside
down
on
its
saucer
wait
for
the
last
of
the
tea
to
drain
away
then
give
your
cup
to
your
partner
to
read
you
will
interpret
the
patterns
using
pages
five
and
six
of
Unfogging
the
Future
i
shall
move
among
you
helping
and
instructing
oh
and
dear
she
caught
Neville
by
the
arm
as
he
made
to
stand
up
after
you've
broken
your
first
cup
would
you
be
so
kind
as
to
select
one
of
the
blue
patterned
ones
i'm
rather
attached
to
the
pink
sure
enough
Neville
had
no
sooner
reached
the
shelf
of
teacups
when
there
was
a
tinkle
of
breaking
china
professor
Trelawney
swept
over
to
him
holding
a
dustpan
and
brush
and
said
One
of
the
blue
ones
then
dear
if
you
wouldn't
mind
thank
you
when
Harry
and
Ron
had
had
their
teacups
filled
they
went
back
to
their
table
and
tried
to
drink
the
scalding
tea
quickly
they
swilled
the
dregs
around
as
Professor
Trelawney
had
instructed
then
drained
the
cups
and
swapped
over
right
said
Ron
as
they
both
opened
their
books
at
pages
five
and
six
what
can
you
see
in
mine
a
load
of
soggy
brown
stuff
said
Harry
the
heavily
perfumed
smoke
in
the
room
was
making
him
feel
sleepy
and
stupid
broaden
your
minds
my
dears
and
allow
your
eyes
to
see
past
the
mundane
professor
Trelawney
cried
through
the
gloom
harry
tried
to
pull
himself
together
right
you've
got
a
crooked
sort
of
cross
he
consulted
Unfogging
the
Future
that
means
you're
going
to
have
trials
and
suffering
sorry
about
that
but
there's
a
thing
that
could
be
the
sun
hang
on
that
means
great
happiness
so
you're
going
to
suffer
but
be
very
happy
you
need
your
Inner
Eye
tested
if
you
ask
me
said
Ron
and
they
both
had
to
stifle
their
laughs
as
Professor
Trelawney
gazed
in
their
direction
my
turn
ron
peered
into
harry's
teacup
his
forehead
wrinkled
with
effort
there's
a
blob
a
bit
like
a
bowler
hat
he
said
maybe
you're
going
to
work
for
the
Ministry
of
Magic
he
turned
the
teacup
the
other
way
up
but
this
way
it
looks
more
like
an
acorn
what's
that
he
scanned
his
copy
of
Unfogging
the
Future
a
windfall
unexpected
gold
excellent
you
can
lend
me
some
and
there's
a
thin
here
he
turned
the
cup
again
that
looks
like
an
animal
yeah
if
that
was
its
head
it
looks
like
a
hippo
no
a
sheep
professor
Trelawney
whirled
around
as
Harry
let
out
a
snort
of
laughter
let
me
see
that
my
dear
she
said
reprovingly
to
Ron
sweeping
over
and
snatching
harry's
cup
from
him
everyone
went
quiet
to
watch
professor
Trelawney
was
staring
into
the
teacup
rotating
it
counterclockwise
the
falcon
my
dear
you
have
a
deadly
enemy
but
everyone
knows
that
said
Hermione
in
a
loud
whisper
professor
Trelawney
stared
at
her
well
they
do
said
Hermione
everybody
knows
about
Harry
and
YouKnowWho
harry
and
Ron
stared
at
her
with
a
mixture
of
amazement
and
admiration
they
had
never
heard
Hermione
speak
to
a
teacher
like
that
before
professor
Trelawney
chose
not
to
reply
she
lowered
her
huge
eyes
to
harry's
cup
again
and
continued
to
turn
it
the
club
an
attack
dear
dear
this
is
not
a
happy
cup
i
thought
that
was
a
bowler
hat
said
Ron
sheepishly
the
skull
danger
in
your
path
my
dear
everyone
was
staring
transfixed
at
Professor
Trelawney
who
gave
the
cup
a
final
turn
gasped
and
then
screamed
there
was
another
tinkle
of
breaking
china
Neville
had
smashed
his
second
cup
professor
Trelawney
sank
into
a
vacant
armchair
her
glittering
hand
at
her
heart
and
her
eyes
closed
my
dear
boy
my
poor
dear
boy
no
it
is
kinder
not
to
say
no
don't
ask
me
what
is
it
Professor
said
Dean
Thomas
at
once
everyone
had
got
to
their
feet
and
slowly
they
crowded
around
Harry
and
ron's
table
pressing
close
to
Professor
trelawney's
chair
to
get
a
good
look
at
harry's
cup
my
dear
Professor
trelawney's
huge
eyes
opened
dramatically
you
have
the
Grim
the
what
said
Harry
he
could
tell
that
he
wasn't
the
only
one
who
didn't
understand
Dean
Thomas
shrugged
at
him
and
Lavender
Brown
looked
puzzled
but
nearly
everybody
else
clapped
their
hands
to
their
mouths
in
horror
the
Grim
my
dear
the
Grim
cried
Professor
Trelawney
who
looked
shocked
that
Harry
hadn't
understood
the
giant
spectral
dog
that
haunts
churchyards
my
dear
boy
it
is
an
omen
the
worst
omen
of
death
harry's
stomach
lurched
that
dog
on
the
cover
of
Death
Omens
in
Flourish
and
Blotts
the
dog
in
the
shadows
of
Magnolia
Crescent
lavender
Brown
clapped
her
hands
to
her
mouth
too
everyone
was
looking
at
Harry
everyone
except
Hermione
who
had
gotten
up
and
moved
around
to
the
back
of
Professor
trelawney's
chair
i
don't
think
it
looks
like
a
Grim
she
said
flatly
professor
Trelawney
surveyed
Hermione
with
mounting
dislike
you'll
forgive
me
for
saying
so
my
dear
but
I
perceive
very
little
aura
around
you
very
little
receptivity
to
the
resonances
of
the
future
seamus
Finnigan
was
tilting
his
head
from
side
to
side
it
looks
like
a
Grim
if
you
do
this
he
said
with
his
eyes
almost
shut
but
it
looks
more
like
a
donkey
from
here
he
said
leaning
to
the
left
when
you've
all
finished
deciding
whether
i'm
going
to
die
Or
not
said
Harry
taking
even
himself
by
surprise
now
nobody
seemed
to
want
to
look
at
him
i
think
we
will
leave
the
lesson
here
for
today
said
Professor
Trelawney
in
her
mistiest
voice
yes
please
pack
away
your
things
silently
the
class
took
their
teacups
back
to
Professor
Trelawney
packed
away
their
books
and
closed
their
bags
even
Ron
was
avoiding
harry's
eyes
until
we
meet
again
said
Professor
Trelawney
faintly
fair
fortune
be
yours
oh
and
dear
she
pointed
at
Neville
you'll
be
late
next
time
so
mind
you
work
extrahard
to
catch
up
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
descended
Professor
trelawney's
ladder
and
the
winding
stair
in
silence
then
set
off
for
Professor
mcgonagall's
Transfiguration
lesson
it
took
them
so
long
to
find
her
classroom
that
early
as
they
had
left
Divination
they
were
only
just
in
time
harry
chose
a
seat
right
at
the
back
of
the
room
feeling
as
though
he
were
sitting
in
a
very
bright
spotlight
the
rest
of
the
class
kept
shooting
furtive
glances
at
him
as
though
he
were
about
to
drop
dead
at
any
moment
he
hardly
heard
what
Professor
McGonagall
was
telling
them
about
Animagi
wizards
who
could
transform
at
will
into
animals
and
wasn't
even
watching
when
she
transformed
herself
in
front
of
their
eyes
into
a
tabby
cat
with
spectacle
markings
around
her
eyes
really
what
has
got
into
you
all
today
said
Professor
McGonagall
turning
back
into
herself
with
a
faint
pop
and
staring
around
at
them
all
not
that
it
matters
but
that's
the
first
time
my
transformation's
not
got
applause
from
a
class
everybody's
heads
turned
toward
Harry
again
but
nobody
spoke
then
Hermione
raised
her
hand
please
Professor
we've
just
had
our
first
Divination
class
and
we
were
reading
the
tea
leaves
and
ah
of
course
said
Professor
McGonagall
suddenly
frowning
there
is
no
need
to
say
any
more
Miss
Granger
tell
me
which
of
you
will
be
dying
this
year
everyone
stared
at
her
me
said
Harry
finally
i
see
said
Professor
McGonagall
fixing
Harry
with
her
beady
eyes
then
you
should
know
Potter
that
Sibyll
Trelawney
has
predicted
the
death
of
one
student
a
year
since
she
arrived
at
this
school
none
of
them
has
died
yet
seeing
death
omens
is
her
favorite
way
of
greeting
a
new
class
if
it
were
not
for
the
fact
that
I
never
speak
ill
of
my
colleagues
professor
McGonagall
broke
off
and
they
saw
that
her
nostrils
had
gone
white
she
went
on
more
calmly
Divination
is
one
of
the
most
imprecise
branches
of
magic
i
shall
not
conceal
from
you
that
I
have
very
little
patience
with
it
true
Seers
are
very
rare
and
Professor
Trelawney
she
stopped
again
and
then
said
in
a
very
matteroffact
tone
You
look
in
excellent
health
to
me
Potter
so
you
will
excuse
me
if
I
don't
let
you
off
homework
today
i
assure
you
that
if
you
die
you
need
not
hand
it
in
hermione
laughed
harry
felt
a
bit
better
it
was
harder
to
feel
scared
of
a
lump
of
tea
leaves
away
from
the
dim
red
light
and
befuddling
perfume
of
Professor
trelawney's
classroom
not
everyone
was
convinced
however
ron
still
looked
worried
and
Lavender
whispered
But
what
about
neville's
cup
when
the
Transfiguration
class
had
finished
they
joined
the
crowd
thundering
toward
the
Great
Hall
for
lunch
ron
cheer
up
said
Hermione
pushing
a
dish
of
stew
toward
him
you
heard
what
Professor
McGonagall
said
ron
spooned
stew
onto
his
plate
and
picked
up
his
fork
but
didn't
start
harry
he
said
in
a
low
serious
voice
You
haven't
seen
a
great
black
dog
anywhere
have
you
yeah
I
have
said
Harry
i
saw
one
the
night
I
left
the
Dursleys
ron
let
his
fork
fall
with
a
clatter
probably
a
stray
said
Hermione
calmly
ron
looked
at
Hermione
as
though
she
had
gone
mad
hermione
if
harry's
seen
a
Grim
that's
that's
bad
he
said
my
my
uncle
Bilius
saw
one
and
and
he
died
twentyfour
hours
later
coincidence
said
Hermione
airily
pouring
herself
some
pumpkin
juice
you
don't
know
what
you're
talking
about
said
Ron
starting
to
get
angry
grims
scare
the
living
daylights
out
of
most
wizards
there
you
are
then
said
Hermione
in
a
superior
tone
they
see
the
Grim
and
die
of
fright
the
grim's
not
an
omen
it's
the
cause
of
death
and
harry's
still
with
us
because
he's
not
stupid
enough
to
see
one
and
think
right
well
i'd
better
kick
the
bucket
then
ron
mouthed
wordlessly
at
Hermione
who
opened
her
bag
took
out
her
new
Arithmancy
book
and
propped
it
open
against
the
juice
jug
i
think
Divination
seems
very
woolly
she
said
searching
for
her
page
a
lot
of
guesswork
if
you
ask
me
there
was
nothing
woolly
about
the
Grim
in
that
cup
said
Ron
hotly
you
didn't
seem
quite
so
confident
when
you
were
telling
Harry
it
was
a
sheep
said
Hermione
coolly
professor
Trelawney
said
you
didn't
have
the
right
aura
you
just
don't
like
being
bad
at
something
for
a
change
he
had
touched
a
nerve
hermione
slammed
her
Arithmancy
book
down
on
the
table
so
hard
that
bits
of
meat
and
carrot
flew
everywhere
if
being
good
at
Divination
means
I
have
to
pretend
to
see
death
omens
in
a
lump
of
tea
leaves
i'm
not
sure
i'll
be
studying
it
much
longer
that
lesson
was
absolute
rubbish
compared
with
my
Arithmancy
class
she
snatched
up
her
bag
and
stalked
away
ron
frowned
after
her
what's
she
talking
about
he
said
to
Harry
she
hasn't
been
to
an
Arithmancy
class
yet
harry
was
pleased
to
get
out
of
the
castle
after
lunch
yesterday's
rain
had
cleared
the
sky
was
a
clear
pale
gray
and
the
grass
was
springy
and
damp
underfoot
as
they
set
off
for
their
first
ever
Care
of
Magical
Creatures
class
ron
and
Hermione
weren't
speaking
to
each
other
harry
walked
beside
them
in
silence
as
they
went
down
the
sloping
lawns
to
hagrid's
hut
on
the
edge
of
the
Forbidden
Forest
it
was
only
when
he
spotted
three
onlytoo
familiar
backs
ahead
of
them
that
he
realized
they
must
be
having
these
lessons
with
the
Slytherins
malfoy
was
talking
animatedly
to
Crabbe
and
Goyle
who
were
chortling
harry
was
quite
sure
he
knew
what
they
were
talking
about
hagrid
was
waiting
for
his
class
at
the
door
of
his
hut
he
stood
in
his
moleskin
overcoat
with
Fang
the
boarhound
at
his
heels
looking
impatient
to
start
c'mon
now
get
a
move

called
as
the
class
approached
got
a
real
treat
for
yeh
today
great
lesson
comin
up
everyone
here
right
follow
me
for
one
nasty
moment
Harry
thought
that
Hagrid
was
going
to
lead
them
into
the
forest
Harry
had
had
enough
unpleasant
experiences
in
there
to
last
him
a
lifetime
however
Hagrid
strolled
off
around
the
edge
of
the
trees
and
five
minutes
later
they
found
themselves
outside
a
kind
of
paddock
there
was
nothing
in
there
everyone
gather
round
the
fence
here
he
called
that's
it
make
sure
yeh
can
see
now
firs
thing
yeh'll
want
ter
do
is
open

books
how
said
the
cold
drawling
voice
of
Draco
Malfoy
eh
said
Hagrid
how
do
we
open
our
books
malfoy
repeated
he
took
out
his
copy
of
The
Monster
Book
of
Monsters
which
he
had
bound
shut
with
a
length
of
rope
other
people
took
theirs
out
too
some
like
Harry
had
belted
their
book
shut
others
had
crammed
them
inside
tight
bags
or
clamped
them
together
with
binder
clips
hasn
hasn
anyone
bin
able
ter
open
their
books
said
Hagrid
looking
crestfallen
the
class
all
shook
their
heads
yeh've
got
ter
stroke
em
said
Hagrid
as
though
this
was
the
most
obvious
thing
in
the
world
look
he
took
hermione's
copy
and
ripped
off
the
Spellotape
that
bound
it
the
book
tried
to
bite
but
Hagrid
ran
a
giant
forefinger
down
its
spine
and
the
book
shivered
and
then
fell
open
and
lay
quiet
in
his
hand
oh
how
silly
we've
all
been
malfoy
sneered
we
should
have
stroked
them
why
didn't
we
guess
i
I
thought
they
were
funny
Hagrid
said
uncertainly
to
Hermione
oh
tremendously
funny
said
Malfoy
really
witty
giving
us
books
that
try
and
rip
our
hands
off
shut
up
Malfoy
said
Harry
quietly
hagrid
was
looking
downcast
and
Harry
wanted
hagrid's
first
lesson
to
be
a
success
righ
then
said
Hagrid
who
seemed
to
have
lost
his
thread
so
so
yeh've
got
yer
books
an
an
now
yeh
need
the
Magical
Creatures
yeah
so
i'll
go
an
get
em
hang
on
he
strode
away
from
them
into
the
forest
and
out
of
sight
god
this
place
is
going
to
the
dogs
said
Malfoy
loudly
that
oaf
teaching
classes
my
father'll
have
a
fit
when
I
tell
him
Shut
up
Malfoy
Harry
repeated
careful
Potter
there's
a
dementor
behind
you
Oooooooh
squealed
Lavender
Brown
pointing
toward
the
opposite
side
of
the
paddock
trotting
toward
them
were
a
dozen
of
the
most
bizarre
creatures
Harry
had
ever
seen
they
had
the
bodies
hind
legs
and
tails
of
horses
but
the
front
legs
wings
and
heads
of
what
seemed
to
be
giant
eagles
with
cruel
steelcolored
beaks
and
large
brilliantly
orange
eyes
the
talons
on
their
front
legs
were
half
a
foot
long
and
deadly
looking
each
of
the
beasts
had
a
thick
leather
collar
around
its
neck
which
was
attached
to
a
long
chain
and
the
ends
of
all
of
these
were
held
in
the
vast
hands
of
Hagrid
who
came
jogging
into
the
paddock
behind
the
creatures
gee
up
there
he
roared
shaking
the
chains
and
urging
the
creatures
toward
the
fence
where
the
class
stood
everyone
drew
back
slightly
as
Hagrid
reached
them
and
tethered
the
creatures
to
the
fence
hippogriffs
hagrid
roared
happily
waving
a
hand
at
them
beau'iful
aren
they
harry
could
sort
of
see
what
Hagrid
meant
once
you
got
over
the
first
shock
of
seeing
something
that
was
half
horse
half
bird
you
started
to
appreciate
the
hippogriffs
gleaming
coats
changing
smoothly
from
feather
to
hair
each
of
them
a
different
color
stormy
gray
bronze
pinkish
roan
gleaming
chestnut
and
inky
black
so
said
Hagrid
rubbing
his
hands
together
and
beaming
around
if
yeh
wan
ter
come
a
bit
nearer
no
one
seemed
to
want
to
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
however
approached
the
fence
cautiously
now
firs
thing
yeh
gotta
know
abou
hippogriffs
is
they're
proud
said
Hagrid
easily
offended
hippogriffs
are
don't
never
insult
one
cause
it
might
be
the
last
thing
yeh
do
malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
weren't
listening
they
were
talking
in
an
undertone
and
Harry
had
a
nasty
feeling
they
were
plotting
how
best
to
disrupt
the
lesson
yeh
always
wait
fer
the
hippogriff
ter
make
the
firs
move
Hagrid
continued
it's
polite
see
yeh
walk
toward
him
and
yeh
bow
an
yeh
wait
if
he
bows
back
yeh're
allowed
ter
touch
him
if
he
doesn
bow
then
get
away
from
him
sharpish
cause
those
talons
hurt
right
who
wants
ter
go
first
most
of
the
class
backed
farther
away
in
answer
even
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
had
misgivings
the
hippogriffs
were
tossing
their
fierce
heads
and
flexing
their
powerful
wings
they
didn't
seem
to
like
being
tethered
like
this
no
one
said
Hagrid
with
a
pleading
look
i'll
do
it
said
Harry
there
was
an
intake
of
breath
from
behind
him
and
both
Lavender
and
Parvati
whispered
Oooh
no
Harry
remember
your
tea
leaves
harry
ignored
them
he
climbed
over
the
paddock
fence
good
man
Harry
roared
Hagrid
right
then
let's
see
how
yeh
get
on
with
Buckbeak
he
untied
one
of
the
chains
pulled
the
gray
hippogriff
away
from
its
fellows
and
slipped
off
its
leather
collar
the
class
on
the
other
side
of
the
paddock
seemed
to
be
holding
its
breath
malfoy's
eyes
were
narrowed
maliciously
easy
now
Harry
said
Hagrid
quietly
yeh've
got
eye
contact
now
try
not
ter
blink
hippogriffs
don
trust
yeh
if
yeh
blink
too
much
harry's
eyes
immediately
began
to
water
but
he
didn't
shut
thern
buckbeak
had
turned
his
great
sharp
head
and
was
staring
at
Harry
with
one
fierce
orange
eye
tha's
it
said
Hagrid
tha's
it
Harry
now
bow
harry
didn't
feel
much
like
exposing
the
back
of
his
neck
to
Buckbeak
but
he
did
as
he
was
told
he
gave
a
short
bow
and
then
looked
up
the
hippogriff
was
still
staring
haughtily
at
him
it
didn't
move
ah
said
Hagrid
sounding
worried
right
back
away
now
Harry
easy
does
it
But
then
to
harry's
enormous
surprise
the
hippogriff
suddenly
bent
its
scaly
front
knees
and
sank
into
what
was
an
unmistakable
bow
well
done
Harry
said
Hagrid
ecstatic
right
yeh
can
touch
him
pat
his
beak
go
on
feeling
that
a
better
reward
would
have
been
to
back
away
Harry
moved
slowly
toward
the
hippogriff
and
reached
out
toward
it
he
patted
the
beak
several
times
and
the
hippogriff
closed
its
eyes
lazily
as
though
enjoying
it
the
class
broke
into
applause
all
except
for
Malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
who
were
looking
deeply
disappointed
righ
then
Harry
said
Hagrid
i
reckon
he
might
let
yeh
ride
him
this
was
more
than
Harry
had
bargained
for
he
was
used
to
a
broomstick
but
he
wasn't
sure
a
hippogriff
would
be
quite
the
same
yeh
climb
up
there
jus
behind
the
wing
joint
said
Hagrid
an
mind
yeh
don
pull
any
of
his
feathers
out
he
won
like
that
harry
put
his
foot
on
the
top
of
Buckbeaks
wing
and
hoisted
himself
onto
its
back
buckbeak
stood
up
harry
wasn't
sure
where
to
hold
on
everything
in
front
of
him
was
covered
with
feathers
go
on
then
roared
Hagrid
slapping
the
hippogriffs
hindquarters
without
warning
twelvefoot
wings
flapped
open
on
either
side
of
Harry
he
just
had
time
to
seize
the
hippogriff
around
the
neck
before
he
was
soaring
upward
it
was
nothing
like
a
broomstick
and
Harry
knew
which
one
he
preferred
the
hippogriff's
wings
beat
uncomfortably
on
either
side
of
him
catching
him
under
his
legs
and
making
him
feel
he
was
about
to
be
thrown
off
the
glossy
feathers
slipped
under
his
fingers
and
he
didn't
dare
get
a
stronger
grip
instead
of
the
smooth
action
of
his
Nimbus
Two
Thousand
he
now
felt
himself
rocking
backward
and
forward
as
the
hindquarters
of
the
hippogriff
rose
and
fell
with
its
wings
buckbeak
flew
him
once
around
the
paddock
and
then
headed
back
to
the
ground
this
was
the
bit
Harry
had
been
dreading
he
leaned
back
as
the
smooth
neck
lowered
feeling
he
was
going
to
slip
off
over
the
beak
then
felt
a
heavy
thud
as
the
four
illassorted
feet
hit
the
ground
he
just
managed
to
hold
on
and
push
himself
straight
again
good
work
Harry
roared
Hagrid
as
everyone
except
Malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
cheered
okay
who
else
wants
a
go
emboldened
by
harry's
success
the
rest
of
the
class
climbed
cautiously
into
the
paddock
hagrid
untied
the
hippogriffs
one
by
one
and
soon
people
were
bowing
nervously
all
over
the
paddock
neville
ran
repeatedly
backward
from
his
which
didn't
seem
to
want
to
bend
its
knees
ron
and
Hermione
practiced
on
the
chestnut
while
Harry
watched
malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
had
taken
over
Buckbeak
he
had
bowed
to
Malfoy
who
was
now
patting
his
beak
looking
disdainful
this
is
very
easy
Malfoy
drawled
loud
enough
for
Harry
to
hear
him
i
knew
it
must
have
been
if
Potter
could
do
it
i
bet
you're
not
dangerous
at
all
are
you
he
said
to
the
hippogriff
are
you
you
great
ugly
brute
it
happened
in
a
flash
of
steely
talons
Malfoy
let
out
a
highpitched
scream
and
next
moment
Hagrid
was
wrestling
Buckbeak
back
into
his
collar
as
he
strained
to
get
at
Malfoy
who
lay
curled
in
the
grass
blood
blossoming
over
his
robes
i'm
dying
malfoy
yelled
as
the
class
panicked
i'm
dying
look
at
me
it's
killed
me
yer
not
dyin
said
Hagrid
who
had
gone
very
white
someone
help
me
gotta
get
him
outta
here
hermione
ran
to
hold
open
the
gate
as
Hagrid
lifted
Malfoy
easily
as
they
passed
Harry
saw
that
there
was
a
long
deep
gash
on
malfoy's
arm
blood
splattered
the
grass
and
Hagrid
ran
with
him
up
the
slope
toward
the
castle
very
shaken
the
Care
of
Magical
Creatures
class
followed
at
a
walk
the
Slytherins
were
all
shouting
about
Hagrid
they
should
fire
him
straight
away
said
Pansy
Parkinson
who
was
in
tears
it
was
malfoy's
fault
snapped
Dean
Thomas
crabbe
and
Goyle
flexed
their
muscles
threateningly
they
all
climbed
the
stone
steps
into
the
deserted
entrance
hall
i'm
going
to
see
if
he's
okay
said
Pansy
and
they
all
watched
her
run
up
the
marble
staircase
the
Slytherins
still
muttering
about
Hagrid
headed
away
in
the
direction
of
their
dungeon
common
room
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
proceeded
upstairs
to
Gryffindor
Tower
you
think
he'll
be
all
right
said
Hermione
nervously
course
he
will
madam
Pomfrey
can
mend
cuts
in
about
a
second
said
Harry
who
had
had
far
worse
injuries
mended
magically
by
the
nurse
that
was
a
really
bad
thing
to
happen
in
hagrid's
first
class
though
wasn't
it
said
Ron
looking
worried
trust
Malfoy
to
mess
things
up
for
him
they
were
among
the
first
to
reach
the
Great
Hall
at
dinnertime
hoping
to
see
Hagrid
but
he
wasn't
there
they
wouldn't
fire
him
would
they
said
Hermione
anxiously
not
touching
her
steakand
kidney
pudding
they'd
better
not
said
Ron
who
wasn't
eating
either
harry
was
watching
the
Slytherin
table
a
large
group
including
Crabbe
and
Goyle
was
huddled
together
deep
in
conversation
harry
was
sure
they
were
cooking
up
their
own
version
of
how
Malfoy
had
been
injured
well
you
can't
say
it
wasn't
an
interesting
first
day
back
said
Ron
gloomily
they
went
up
to
the
crowded
Gryffindor
common
room
after
dinner
and
tried
to
do
the
homework
Professor
McGonagall
had
given
them
but
all
three
of
them
kept
breaking
off
and
glancing
Out
of
the
tower
window
there's
a
light
on
in
hagrid's
window
Harry
said
suddenly
ron
looked
at
his
watch
if
we
hurried
we
could
go
down
and
see
him
it's
still
quite
early
i
don't
know
Hermione
said
slowly
and
Harry
saw
her
glance
at
him
i'm
allowed
to
walk
across
the
grounds
he
said
Pointedly
sirius
Black
hasn't
got
past
the
dementors
yet
has
he
so
they
put
their
things
away
and
headed
out
of
the
portrait
hole
glad
to
meet
nobody
on
their
way
to
the
front
doors
as
they
weren't
entirely
sure
they
were
supposed
to
be
out
the
grass
was
still
wet
and
looked
almost
black
in
the
twilight
when
they
reached
hagrid's
hut
they
knocked
and
a
voice
growled
c'min
hagrid
was
sitting
in
his
shirtsleeves
at
his
scrubbed
wooden
table
his
boarhound
Fang
had
his
head
in
hagrid's
lap
one
look
told
them
that
Hagrid
had
been
drinking
a
lot
there
was
a
pewter
tankard
almost
as
big
as
a
bucket
in
front
of
him
and
he
seemed
to
be
having
difficulty
getting
them
into
focus
spect
it's
a
record
he
said
thickly
when
he
recognized
them
don
reckon
they've
ever
had
a
teacher
who
lasted
on'y
a
day
before
you
haven't
been
fired
Hagrid
gasped
Hermione
not
yet
said
Hagrid
miserably
taking
a
huge
gulp
of
whatever
was
in
the
tankard
but's
only
a
matter
o
time
i
n't
it
after
Malfoy
how
is
he
said
Ron
as
they
all
sat
down
it
wasn't
serious
was
it
madam
Pomfrey
fixed
him
best
she
could
said
Hagrid
dully
but
he's
sayin
it's
still
agony
covered
in
bandages
moanin
he's
faking
it
said
Harry
at
once
madam
Pomfrey
can
mend
anything
she
regrew
half
my
bones
last
year
trust
Malfoy
to
milk
it
for
all
it's
worth
school
gov'nors

told
o
course
said
Hagrid
miseribly
they
reckon
I
started
too
big
shoulda
left
hippogriffs
fer
later
done
flobberworms
or
summat
jus
thought
itdmake
a
good
firs
lessons
all
my
fault
it's
all
malfoy's
fault
Hagrid
said
Hermione
earnestly
we're
witnesses
said
Harry
you
said
hippogriffs
attack
if
you
insult
them
it's
malfoy's
problem
that
he
wasn't
listening
we'll
tell
Dumbledore
what
really
happened
yeah
don't
worry
Hagrid
we'll
back
you
up
said
Ron
tears
leaked
out
of
the
crinkled
corners
of
hagrid's
beetleblack
eyes
he
grabbed
both
Harry
and
Ron
and
pulled
them
into
a
bonebreaking
hug
i
think
you've
had
enough
to
drink
Hagrid
said
Hermione
firmly
she
took
the
tankard
from
the
table
and
went
outside
to
empty
it
at
maybe
she's
right
said
Hagrid
letting
go
of
Harry
and
Ron
who
both
staggered
away
rubbing
their
ribs
hagrid
heaved
himself
out
of
his
chair
and
followed
Hermione
unsteadily
outside
they
heard
a
loud
splash
what's
he
done
said
Harry
nervously
as
Hermione
came
back
in
with
the
empty
tankard
stuck
his
head
in
the
water
barrel
said
Hermione
putting
the
tankard
away
hagrid
came
back
his
long
hair
and
beard
sopping
wet
wiping
the
water
out
of
his
eyes
that's
better
he
said
shaking
his
head
like
a
dog
and
drenching
them
all
listen
it
was
good
of
yeh
ter
come
an
see
me
I
really
Hagrid
stopped
dead
staring
at
Harry
as
though
he'd
only
just

chapter
seven
the
boggart
in
the
wardrobe
malfoy
didn't
reappear
in
classes
until
late
on
Thursday
morning
when
the
Slytherins
and
Gryffindors
were
halfway
through
double
Potions
he
swaggered
into
the
dungeon
his
right
arm
covered
in
bandages
and
bound
up
in
a
sling
acting
in
harry's
opinion
as
though
he
were
the
heroic
survivor
of
some
dreadful
battle
how
is
it
Draco
simpered
Pansy
Parkinson
does
it
hurt
much
yeah
said
Malfoy
putting
on
a
brave
sort
of
grimace
but
Harry
saw
him
wink
at
Crabbe
and
Goyle
when
Pansy
had
looked
away
settle
down
settle
down
said
Professor
Snape
idly
harry
and
Ron
scowled
at
each
other
Snape
wouldn't
have
said
settle
down
if
they'd
walked
in
late
he'd
have
given
them
detention
but
Malfoy
had
always
been
able
to
get
away
with
anything
in
snape's
classes
Snape
was
head
of
Slytherin
House
and
generality
favored
his
own
students
above
all
others
they
were
making
a
new
potion
today
a
Shrinking
Solution
malfoy
set
up
his
cauldron
right
next
to
Harry
and
Ron
so
that
they
were
preparing
their
ingredients
on
the
same
table
sir
Malfoy
called
sir
i'll
need
help
cutting
up
these
daisy
roots
because
of
my
arm
weasley
cut
up
malfoy's
roots
for
him
said
Snape
without
looking
up
ron
went
brick
red
there's
nothing
wrong
with
your
arm
he
hissed
at
Malfoy
malfoy
smirked
across
the
table
weasley
you
heard
Professor
Snape
cut
up
these
roots
ron
seized
his
knife
pulled
malfoy's
roots
toward
him
and
began
to
chop
them
roughly
so
that
they
were
all
different
sizes
professor
drawled
Malfoy
weasley's
mutilating
my
roots
sit
snape
approached
their
table
stared
down
his
hooked
nose
at
the
roots
then
gave
Ron
an
unpleasant
smile
from
beneath
his
long
greasy
black
hair
change
roots
with
Malfoy
Weasley
but
sit
ron
had
spent
the
last
quarter
of
an
hour
carefully
shredding
his
own
roots
into
exactly
equal
pieces
now
said
Snape
in
his
most
dangerous
voice
ron
shoved
his
own
beautifully
cut
roots
across
the
table
a
Malfoy
then
took
up
the
knife
again
and
sir
i'll
need
this
shrivelfig
skinned
said
Malfoy
his
voice
full
of
malicious
laughter
potter
you
can
skin
malfoy's
shrivelfig
said
Snape
giving
Harry
the
look
of
loathing
he
always
reserved
just
for
him
harry
took
malfoy's
shrivelfig
as
Ron
began
trying
to
repair
the
damage
to
the
roots
he
now
had
to
use
harry
skinned
the
shrivelfig
as
fast
as
he
could
and
flung
it
back
across
the
table
at
Malfoy
without
speaking
malfoy
was
smirking
more
broadly
than
ever
seen
your
pal
Hagrid
lately
he
asked
them
quietly
none
of
your
business
said
Ron
jerkily
without
looking
up
i'm
afraid
he
won't
be
a
teacher
much
longer
said
Malfoy
in
a
tone
of
mock
sorrow
father's
not
very
happy
about
my
injury
keep
talking
Malfoy
and
i'll
give
you
a
real
injury
snarled
Ron
he's
complained
to
the
school
governors
and
to
the
Ministry
of
Magic
father's
got
a
lot
of
influence
you
know
and
a
lasting
injury
like
this
he
gave
a
huge
fake
sigh
who
knows
if
my
arm'll
ever
be
the
same
again
so
that's
why
you're
putting
it
on
said
Harry
accidentally
beheading
a
dead
caterpillar
because
his
hand
was
shaking
in
anger
to
try
to
get
Hagrid
fired
well
said
Malfoy
lowering
his
voice
to
a
whisper
partly
Potter
but
there
are
other
benefits
too
weasley
slice
my
caterpillars
for
me
a
few
cauldrons
away
Neville
was
in
trouble
neville
regularly
went
to
pieces
in
Potions
lessons
it
was
his
worst
subject
and
his
great
fear
of
Professor
Snape
made
things
ten
times
worse
his
potion
which
was
supposed
to
be
a
bright
acid
green
had
turned
Orange
Longbottom
said
Snape
ladling
some
up
and
allowing
to
splash
back
into
the
cauldron
so
that
everyone
could
see
orange
tell
me
boy
does
anything
penetrate
that
thick
skull
of
yours
didn't
you
hear
me
say
quite
clearly
that
only
one
tat
spleen
was
needed
didn't
I
state
plainly
that
a
dash
of
leech
juice
would
suffice
what
do
I
have
to
do
to
make
you
understand
Longbottom
neville
was
pink
and
trembling
he
looked
as
though
he
was
on
the
verge
of
tears
please
sir
said
Hermione
please
I
could
help
Neville
put
it
right
i
don't
remember
asking
you
to
show
off
Miss
Granger
said
Snape
coldly
and
Hermione
went
as
pink
as
Neville
longbottom
at
the
end
of
this
lesson
we
will
feed
a
few
drops
of
this
potion
to
your
toad
and
see
what
happens
perhaps
that
will
encourage
you
to
do
it
properly
snape
moved
away
leaving
Neville
breathless
with
fear
help
me
he
moaned
to
Hermione
hey
Harry
said
Seamus
Finnigan
leaning
over
to
borrow
harry's
brass
scales
have
you
heard
daily
Prophet
this
morning
they
reckon
sirius
black's
been
sighted
where
said
Harry
and
Ron
quickly
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
malfoy
looked
up
listening
closely
not
too
far
from
here
said
Seamus
who
looked
excited
it
was
a
Muggle
who
saw
him
course
she
didn't
really
understand
the
Muggles
think
he's
just
an
ordinary
criminal
don't
they
so
she
phoned
the
telephone
hot
line
by
the
time
the
Ministry
of
Magic
got
there
he
was
gone
not
too
far
from
here
ron
repeated
looking
significantly
at
Harry
he
turned
around
and
saw
Malfoy
watching
closely
what
Malfoy
need
something
else
skinned
but
malfoy's
eyes
were
shining
malevolently
and
they
were
fixed
Harry
he
leaned
across
the
table
black
singlehanded
Potter
thinking
Of
trying
to
catch
Yeah
that's
right
said
Harry
offhandedly
malfoys
thin
mouth
was
curving
in
a
mean
smile
of
course
if
it
was
me
he
said
quietly
i'd
have
done
something
before
now
i
wouldn't
be
staying
in
school
like
a
good
boy
i'd
be
out
there
looking
for
him
what
are
you
talking
about
Malfoy
said
Ron
roughly
don't
you
know
Potter
breathed
Malfoy
his
pate
eyes
narrowed
know
what
malfoy
let
out
a
low
sneering
laugh
maybe
you'd
rather
not
risk
your
neck
he
said
want
to
leave
it
to
the
dementors
do
you
but
if
it
was
me
i'd
want
revenge
i'd
hunt
him
down
myself
what
are
you
talking
about
said
Harry
angrily
but
at
that
moment
Snape
called
You
should
have
finished
adding
your
ingredients
by
now
this
potion
needs
to
stew
before
it
can
be
drunk
so
clear
away
while
it
simmers
and
then
we'll
test
longbottom's
crabbe
and
Goyle
laughed
openly
watching
Neville
sweat
as
he
stirred
his
potion
feverishly
hermione
was
muttering
instructions
to
him
out
of
the
corner
of
her
mouth
so
that
Snape
wouldn't
see
harry
and
Ron
packed
away
their
unused
ingredients
and
went
to
wash
their
hands
and
ladles
in
the
stone
basin
in
the
corner
what
did
Malfoy
mean
harry
muttered
to
Ron
as
he
stuck
his
hands
under
the
icy
jet
that
poured
from
the
gargoyle's
mouth
Why
would
I
want
revenge
on
Black
he
hasn't
done
anything
to
me
yet
he's
making
it
up
said
Ron
savagely
he's
trying
to
make
you
do
something
stupid
the
end
of
the
lesson
in
sight
Snape
strode
over
to
Neville
who
was
cowering
by
his
cauldron
everyone
gather
round
said
Snape
his
black
eyes
glittering
and
watch
what
happens
to
longbottom's
toad
if
he
has
managed
to
produce
a
Shrinking
Solution
it
will
shrink
to
a
tadpole
if
as
I
don't
doubt
he
has
done
it
wrong
his
toad
is
likely
to
be
poisoned
the
Gryffindors
watched
fearfully
the
Slytherins
looked
excited
snape
picked
up
Trevor
the
toad
in
his
left
hand
and
dipped
a
small
spoon
into
neville's
potion
which
was
now
green
he
trickled
a
few
drops
down
trevor's
throat
there
was
a
moment
of
hushed
silence
in
which
Trevor
gulped
then
there
was
a
small
pop
and
Trevor
the
tadpole
was
wriggling
in
snape's
palm
the
Gryffindors
burst
into
applause
snape
looking
sour
pulled
a
small
bottle
from
the
pocket
of
his
robe
poured
a
few
drops
on
top
of
Trevor
and
he
reappeared
suddenly
fully
grown
five
points
from
Gryffindor
said
Snape
which
wiped
the
smiles
from
every
face
i
told
you
not
to
help
him
Miss
Granger
class
dismissed
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
climbed
the
steps
to
the
entrance
hall
harry
was
still
thinking
about
what
Malfoy
had
said
while
Ron
was
seething
about
Snape
five
points
from
Gryffindor
because
the
potion
was
all
right
why
didn't
You
lie
Hermione
you
should've
said
Neville
did
it
all
by
himself
hermione
didn't
answer
ron
looked
around
where
is
she
harry
turned
too
they
were
at
the
top
of
the
steps
now
watching
the
rest
of
the
class
pass
them
heading
for
the
Great
Hall
and
lunch
she
was
right
behind
us
said
Ron
frowning
malfoy
passed
them
walking
between
Crabbe
and
Goyle
he
smirked
at
Harry
and
disappeared
there
she
is
said
Harry
hermione
was
panting
slightly
hurrying
up
the
stairs
one
hand
clutched
her
bag
the
other
seemed
to
be
tucking
something
down
the
front
of
her
robes
how
did
you
do
that
said
Ron
what
said
Hermione
joining
them
one
minute
you
were
right
behind
us
the
next
moment
you
were
back
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
again
what
hermione
looked
slightly
confused
oh
I
had
to
go
back
for
something
oh
no
a
seam
had
split
on
hermione's
bag
harry
wasn't
surprised
he
could
see
that
it
was
crammed
with
at
least
a
dozen
large
and
heavy
books
why
are
you
carrying
all
these
around
with
you
ron
asked
her
you
know
how
many
subjects
i'm
taking
said
Hermione
breathlessly
couldn't
hold
these
for
me
could
you
but
Ron
was
turning
over
the
books
she
had
handed
him
looking
at
the
covers
you
havent
got
any
of
these
subjects
today
it's
only
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
this
afternoon
oh
yes
said
Hermione
vaguely
but
she
packed
all
the
books
back
into
her
bag
just
the
same
i
hope
there's
something
good
for
lunch
i'm
starving
she
added
and
she
marched
off
toward
the
Great
Hall
d'you
get
the
feeling
hermione's
not
telling
us
something
ron
asked
Harry
professor
Lupin
wasn't
there
when
they
arrived
at
his
first
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
lesson
they
all
sat
down
took
out
their
books
quills
and
parchment
and
were
talking
when
he
finally
entered
the
room
lupin
smiled
vaguely
and
placed
his
tatty
old
briefcase
on
the
teacher's
desk
he
was
as
shabby
as
ever
but
looked
healthier
than
he
had
on
the
train
as
though
he
had
had
a
few
square
meals
good
afternoon
he
said
would
you
please
put
all
your
books
back
in
your
bags
today's
will
be
a
practical
lesson
you
will
need
only
your
wands
a
few
curious
looks
were
exchanged
as
the
class
put
away
their
books
they
had
never
had
a
practical
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
before
unless
you
counted
the
memorable
class
last
year
when
their
old
teacher
had
brought
a
cageful
of
pixies
to
class
and
set
them
loose
right
then
said
Professor
Lupin
when
everyone
was
ready
if
you'd
follow
me
puzzled
but
interested
the
class
got
to
its
feet
and
followed
Professor
Lupin
out
of
the
classroom
he
led
them
along
the
deserted
corridor
and
around
a
corner
where
the
first
thing
they
saw
was
Peeves
the
Poltergeist
who
was
floating
upside
down
in
midair
and
stuffing
the
nearest
keyhole
with
chewing
gum
peeves
didn't
look
up
until
Professor
Lupin
was
two
feet
away
hen
he
wiggled
his
curlytoed
feet
and
broke
into
song
loony
loopy
Lupin
Peeves
sang
loony
loopy
Lupin
loony
loopy
Lupin
rude
and
unmanageable
as
he
almost
always
was
Peeves
usually
showed
some
respect
toward
the
teachers
everyone
looked
quickly
at
Professor
Lupin
to
see
how
he
would
take
this
to
their
surprise
he
was
still
smiling
i'd
take
that
gum
out
of
the
keyhole
if
I
were
you
Peeves
he
said
pleasantly
mr.
Filch
won't
be
able
to
get
in
to
his
brooms
filch
was
the
Hogwarts
caretaker
a
badtempered
failed
wizard
who
waged
a
constant
war
against
the
students
and
indeed
Peeves
however
peeves
paid
no
attention
to
Professor
lupin's
words
except
to
blow
a
loud
wet
raspberry
professor
Lupin
gave
a
small
sigh
and
took
out
his
wand
this
is
a
useful
little
spell
he
told
the
class
over
his
shoulder
please
watch
closely
he
raised
the
wand
to
shoulder
height
said
Waddiwasi
and
pointed
it
at
Peeves
with
the
force
of
a
bullet
the
wad
of
chewing
gum
shot
out
of
the
keyhole
and
straight
down
peeves's
left
nostril
he
whirled
upright
and
zoomed
away
cursing
cool
sit
said
Dean
Thomas
in
amazement
thank
you
Dean
said
Professor
Lupin
putting
his
wand
away
again
shall
we
proceed
they
set
off
again
the
class
looking
at
shabby
Professor
Lupin
with
increased
respect
he
led
them
down
a
second
corridor
and
stopped
right
outside
the
staffroom
door
inside
please
said
Professor
Lupin
opening
it
and
standing
back
the
staffroom
a
long
paneled
room
full
of
old
mismatched
chairs
was
empty
except
for
one
teacher
professor
Snape
was
sitting
in
a
low
armchair
and
he
looked
around
as
the
class
filed
in
his
eyes
were
glittering
and
there
was
a
nasty
sneer
playing
around
his
mouth
as
Professor
Lupin
came
in
and
made
to
close
the
door
behind
him
Snape
said
Leave
it
open
Lupin
i'd
rather
not
witness
this
he
got
to
his
feet
and
strode
past
the
class
his
black
robes
billowing
behind
him
at
the
doorway
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
said
Possibly
no
one's
warned
you
Lupin
but
this
class
contains
Neville
Longbottom
i
would
advise
you
not
to
entrust
him
with
anything
difficult
not
unless
Miss
Granger
is
hissing
instructions
in
his
ear
neville
went
scarlet
harry
glared
at
Snape
it
was
bad
enough
that
he
bullied
Neville
in
his
own
classes
let
alone
doing
it
in
front
of
other
teachers
professor
Lupin
had
raised
his
eyebrows
i
was
hoping
that
Neville
would
assist
me
with
the
first
stage
of
the
operation
he
said
and
I
am
sure
he
will
perform
it
admirably
neville's
face
went
if
possible
even
redder
snape's
lip
curled
but
he
left
shutting
the
door
with
a
snap
now
then
said
Professor
Lupin
beckoning
the
class
toward
the
end
of
the
room
where
there
was
nothing
but
an
old
wardrobe
where
the
teachers
kept
their
spare
robes
as
Professor
Lupin
went
to
stand
next
to
it
the
wardrobe
gave
a
sudden
wobble
banging
off
the
wall
nothing
to
worry
about
said
Professor
Lupin
calmly
because
a
few
people
had
jumped
backward
in
alarm
there's
a
boggart
in
there
most
people
seemed
to
feel
that
this
was
something
to
worry
about
neville
gave
Professor
Lupin
a
look
of
pure
terror
and
Seamus
Finnigan
eyed
the
now
rattling
doorknob
apprehensively
boggarts
like
dark
enclosed
spaces
said
Professor
Lupin
wardrobes
the
gap
beneath
beds
the
cupboards
under
sinks
i've
even
met
one
that
had
lodged
itself
in
a
grandfather
clock
this
one
moved
in
yesterday
afternoon
and
I
asked
the
headmaster
if
the
staff
would
leave
it
to
give
my
third
years
some
practice
so
the
first
question
we
must
ask
ourselves
is
what
is
a
boggart
hermione
put
up
her
hand
it's
a
shapeshifter
she
said
it
can
take
the
shape
of
whatever
it
thinks
will
frighten
us
most
couldn't
have
put
it
better
myself
said
Professor
Lupin
and
Hermione
glowed
so
the
boggart
sitting
in
the
darkness
within
has
not
yet
assumed
a
form
he
does
not
yet
know
what
will
frighten
the
person
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
nobody
knows
what
a
boggart
looks
like
when
he
is
alone
but
when
I
let
him
out
he
will
immediately
become
whatever
each
of
us
most
fears
this
means
said
Professor
Lupin
choosing
to
ignore
neville's
mall
sputter
of
terror
that
we
have
a
huge
advantage
over
the
boggart
before
we
begin
have
you
spotted
it
Harry
trying
to
answer
a
question
with
Hermione
next
to
him
bobbing
up
and
down
on
the
balls
of
her
feet
with
her
hand
in
the
air
was
very
offputting
but
Harry
had
a
go
er
because
there
are
so
many
of
us
it
won't
know
what
shape
it
should
be
precisely
said
Professor
Lupin
and
Hermione
put
her
hand
down
looking
a
little
disappointed
it's
always
best
to
have
com
pany
when
you're
dealing
with
a
boggart
he
becomes
confused
which
should
he
become
a
headless
corpse
or
a
flesheating
slug
i
once
saw
a
boggart
make
that
very
mistake
tried
to
frighten
two
people
at
once
and
turned
himself
into
half
a
slug
not
remotely
frightening
the
charm
that
repels
a
boggart
is
simple
yet
it
requires
force
of
mind
you
see
the
thing
that
really
finishes
a
boggart
is
laughter
what
you
need
to
do
is
force
it
to
assume
a
shape
that
you
find
amusing
we
will
practice
the
charm
without
wands
first
after
me
please
riddikulus
riddikulus
said
the
class
together
good
said
Professor
Lupin
very
good
but
that
was
the
easy
part
i'm
afraid
you
see
the
word
alone
is
not
enough
and
this
is
where
you
come
in
Neville
the
wardrobe
shook
again
though
not
as
much
as
Neville
who
walked
forward
as
though
he
were
heading
for
the
gallows
right
Neville
said
Professor
Lupin
first
things
first
what
would
you
say
is
the
thing
that
frightens
you
most
in
the
world
neville's
lips
moved
but
no
noise
came
out
didn't
catch
that
Neville
sorry
said
Professor
Lupin
cheerfully
neville
looked
around
rather
wildly
as
though
begging
someone
to
help
him
then
said
in
barely
more
than
a
whisper
Professor
Snape
nearly
everyone
laughed
even
Neville
grinned
apologetically
professor
Lupin
however
looked
thoughtful
professor
Snape
hmmm
neville
I
believe
you
live
with
your
grandmother
er
yes
said
Neville
nervously
but
I
don't
want
the
boggart
to
turn
into
her
either
no
no
you
misunderstand
me
said
Professor
Lupin
now
smiling
i
wonder
could
you
tell
us
what
sort
of
clothes
your
grandmother
usually
wears
neville
looked
startled
but
said
Well
always
the
same
hat
a
tall
one
with
a
stuffed
vulture
on
top
and
a
long
dress
green
normally
and
sometimes
a
foxfur
scarf
and
a
handbag
prompted
Professor
Lupin
a
big
red
one
said
Neville
right
then
said
Professor
Lupin
can
you
picture
those
clothes
very
clearly
Neville
can
you
see
them
in
your
mind's
eye
yes
said
Neville
uncertainty
plainly
wondering
what
was
coming
next
when
the
boggart
bursts
out
of
this
wardrobe
Neville
and
sees
You
it
will
assume
the
form
of
Professor
Snape
said
Lupin
and
You
will
raise
your
wand
thus
and
cry
Riddikulus
and
concentrate
hard
on
your
grandmother's
clothes
if
all
goes
well
Professor
Boggart
Snape
will
be
forced
into
that
vulturetopped
hat
and
that
green
dress
with
that
big
red
handbag
there
was
a
great
shout
of
laughter
the
wardrobe
wobbled
more
violently
if
Neville
is
successful
the
boggart
is
likely
to
shift
his
attention
to
each
of
us
in
turn
said
Professor
Lupin
i
would
like
all
of
you
to
take
a
moment
now
to
think
of
the
thing
that
scares
you
most
and
imagine
how
you
might
force
it
to
look
comical
the
room
went
quiet
harry
thought
what
scared
him
most
in
the
world
his
first
thought
was
Lord
Voldemort
a
Voldemort
returned
to
full
strength
but
before
he
had
even
started
to
plan
a
possible
counterattack
on
a
boggartVoldemort
a
horrible
image
came
floating
to
the
surface
of
his
mind
a
rotting
glistening
hand
slithering
back
beneath
a
black
cloak
a
long
rattling
breath
from
an
unseen
mouth
then
a
cold
so
penetrating
it
felt
like
drowning
harry
shivered
then
looked
around
hoping
no
one
had
noticed
many
people
had
their
eyes
shut
tight
ron
was
muttering
to
himself
Take
its
legs
off
Harry
was
sure
he
knew
what
that
was
about
ron's
greatest
fear
was
spiders
everyone
ready
said
Professor
Lupin
harry
felt
a
lurch
of
fear
he
wasn't
ready
how
could
you
make
a
dementor
less
frightening
but
he
didn't
want
to
ask
for
more
time
everyone
else
was
nodding
and
rolling
up
their
sleeves
neville
we're
going
to
back
away
said
Professor
Lupin
let
you
have
a
clear
field
all
right
i'll
call
the
next
person
forward
everyone
back
now
so
Neville
can
get
a
clear
shot
they
all
retreated
backed
against
the
walls
leaving
Neville
alone
beside
the
wardrobe
he
looked
pale
and
frightened
but
he
had
pushed
up
the
sleeves
of
his
robes
and
was
holding
his
wand
ready
on
the
count
of
three
Neville
said
Professor
Lupin
who
was
pointing
his
own
wand
at
the
handle
of
the
wardrobe
one
two
three
now
a
jet
of
sparks
shot
from
the
end
of
Professor
lupin's
wand
and
hit
the
doorknob
the
wardrobe
burst
open
hooknosed
and
menacing
Professor
Snape
stepped
out
his
eyes
flashing
at
Neville
neville
backed
away
his
wand
up
mouthing
wordlessly
snape
was
bearing
down
upon
him
reaching
inside
his
robes
r
r
riddikulus
squeaked
Neville
there
was
a
noise
like
a
whip
crack
snape
stumbled
he
was
wearing
a
long
lacetrimmed
dress
and
a
towering
hat
topped
with
a
motheaten
vulture
and
he
was
swinging
a
huge
crimson
handbag
there
was
a
roar
of
laughter
the
boggart
paused
confused
and
Professor
Lupin
shouted
Parvati
forward
parvati
walked
forward
her
face
set
snape
rounded
on
her
there
was
another
crack
and
where
he
had
stood
was
a
bloodstained
bandaged
mummy
its
sightless
face
was
turned
to
Parvati
and
it
began
to
walk
toward
her
very
slowly
dragging
its
feet
its
stiff
arms
rising
Riddikulus
cried
Parvati
a
bandage
unraveled
at
the
mummy's
feet
it
became
entangled
fell
face
forward
and
its
head
rolled
off
seamus
roared
Professor
Lupin
seamus
darted
past
Parvati
crack
where
the
mummy
had
been
was
a
woman
with
floorlength
black
hair
and
a
skeletal
greentinged
face
a
banshee
she
opened
her
mouth
wide
and
an
unearthly
sound
filled
the
room
a
long
wailing
shriek
that
made
the
hair
on
harry's
head
stand
on
end
Riddikulus
shouted
Seamus
the
banshee
made
a
rasping
noise
and
clutched
her
throat
her
voice
was
gone
crack
the
banshee
turned
into
a
rat
which
chased
its
tail
in
a
circle
then
crack
became
a
rattlesnake
which
slithered
and
writhed
before
crack
becoming
a
single
bloody
eyeball
it's
confused
shouted
Lupin
we're
getting
there
dean
dean
hurried
forward
crack
the
eyeball
became
a
severed
hand
which
flipped
over
and
began
to
creep
along
the
floor
like
a
crab
riddikulus
yelled
Dean
there
was
a
snap
and
the
hand
was
trapped
in
a
mousetrap
excellent
ron
you
next
ron
leapt
forward
crack
quite
a
few
people
screamed
a
giant
spider
six
feet
tall
and
covered
in
hair
was
advancing
on
Ron
clicking
its
pincers
menacingly
for
a
moment
Harry
thought
Ron
had
frozen
then
Riddikulus
bellowed
Ron
and
the
spider's
legs
vanished
it
rolled
over
and
over
Lavender
Brown
squealed
and
ran
out
of
its
way
and
it
came
to
a
halt
at
harry's
feet
he
raised
his
wand
ready
but
Here
shouted
Professor
Lupin
suddenly
hurrying
forward
crack
the
legless
spider
had
vanished
for
a
second
everyone
looked
wildly
around
to
see
where
it
was
then
they
saw
a
silverywhite
orb
hanging
in
the
air
in
front
of
Lupin
who
said
Riddikulus
almosi
lazily
crack
forward
Neville
and
finish
him
off
said
Lupin
as
the
boggart
landed
on
the
floor
as
a
cockroach
crack
snape
was
back
this
time
Neville
charged
forward
looking
determined
riddikulus
he
shouted
and
they
had
a
split
second's
view
of
Snape
in
his
lacy
dress
before
Neville
let
out
a
great
Ha
of
laughter
and
the
boggart
exploded
burst
into
a
thousand
tiny
wisps
of
smoke
and
was
gone
excellent
cried
Professor
Lupin
as
the
class
broke
into
applause
excellent
Neville
well
done
everyone
let
me
See
five
points
to
Gryffindor
for
every
person
to
tackle
the
boggart
ten
for
Neville
because
he
did
it
twice
and
five
each
to
Hermione
and
Harry
but
I
didn't
do
anything
said
Harry
you
and
Hermione
answered
my
questions
correctly
at
the
start
of
the
class
Harry
Lupin
said
lightly
very
well
everyone
an
excellent
lesson
homework
kindly
read
the
chapter
on
boggarts
and
summarize
it
for
me
to
be
handed
in
on
Monday
that
will
be
all
talking
excitedly
the
class
left
the
staffroom
harry
however
wasn't
feeling
cheerful
professor
Lupin
had
deliberately
stopped
him
from
tackling
the
boggart
why
was
it
because
he'd
seen
Harry
collapse
on
the
train
and
thought
he
wasn't
up
to
much
had
he
thought
Harry
would
pass
out
again
but
no
one
else
seemed
to
have
noticed
anything
did
you
see
me
take
that
banshee
shouted
Seamus
and
the
hand
said
Dean
waving
his
own
around
and
Snape
in
that
hat
and
my
mummy
i
wonder
why
Professor
lupin's
frightened
of
crystal
balls
said
Lavender
thoughtfully
that
was
the
best
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
lesson
we've
ever
had
wasn't
it
said
Ron
excitedly
as
they
made
their
way
back
to
the
classroom
to
get
their
bags
he
seems
like
a
very
good
teacher
said
Hermione
approvingly
but
I
wish
I
could
have
had
a
turn
with
the
boggart
what
would
it
have
been
for
you
said
Ron
sniggering
a
piece
of
homework
that
only
got
nine
out
of
ten
chapter
eight
flight
of
the
fat
fady
in
no
time
at
all
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
had
become
most
people's
favorite
class
only
Draco
Malfoy
and
his
gang
of
Slytherins
had
anything
bad
to
say
about
Professor
Lupin
look
at
the
state
of
his
robes
Malfoy
would
say
in
a
loud
whisper
as
Professor
Lupin
passed
he
dresses
like
our
old
houseelf
but
no
one
else
cared
that
Professor
lupin's
robes
were
patched
and
frayed
his
next
few
lessons
were
just
as
interesting
as
the
first
after
boggarts
they
studied
Red
Caps
nasty
little
goblin
like
creatures
that
lurked
wherever
there
had
been
bloodshed
in
the
dungeons
of
castles
and
the
potholes
of
deserted
battlefields
waiting
to
bludgeon
those
who
had
gotten
lost
from
Red
Caps
they
moved
on
to
kappas
creepy
waterdwellers
that
looked
like
scaly
monkeys
with
webbed
hands
itching
to
strangle
unwitting
waders
in
their
ponds
harry
only
wished
he
was
as
happy
with
some
of
his
other
classes
worst
of
all
was
Potions
snape
was
in
a
particularly
vindictive
mood
these
days
and
no
one
was
in
any
doubt
why
the
story
of
the
boggart
assuming
snape's
shape
and
the
way
that
Neville
had
dressed
it
in
his
grandmother's
clothes
had
traveled
through
the
school
like
wildfire
snape
didn't
seem
to
find
it
funny
his
eyes
flashed
menacingly
at
the
very
mention
of
Professor
lupin's
name
and
he
was
bullying
Neville
worse
than
ever
harry
was
also
growing
to
dread
the
hours
he
spent
in
Professor
trelawney's
stifling
tower
room
deciphering
lopsided
shapes
and
symbols
trying
to
ignore
the
way
Professor
trelawney's
enormous
eyes
filled
with
tears
every
time
she
looked
at
him
he
couldn't
like
Professer
Trelawney
even
though
she
was
treated
with
respect
bordering
on
reverence
by
many
of
the
class
parvati
Patil
and
Lavender
Brown
had
taken
to
haunting
Professor
trelawney's
tower
room
at
lunch
times
and
always
returned
with
annoyingly
superior
looks
on
their
faces
as
though
they
knew
things
the
others
didn't
they
had
also
started
using
hushed
voices
whenever
they
spoke
to
Harry
as
though
he
were
on
his
deathbed
nobody
really
liked
Care
of
Magical
Creatures
which
after
the
actionpacked
first
class
had
become
extremely
dull
hagrid
seemed
to
have
lost
his
confidence
they
were
now
spending
lesson
after
lesson
learning
how
to
look
after
flobberworms
which
had
to
be
some
of
the
most
boring
creatures
in
existence
why
would
anyone
bother
looking
after
them
said
Ron
after
yet
another
hour
of
poking
shredded
lettuce
down
the
flobberworms
throats
at
the
start
of
October
however
Harry
had
something
else
to
occupy
him
something
so
enjoyable
it
more
than
made
up
for
his
unsatisfactory
classes
the
Quidditch
season
was
approaching
and
Oiver
Wood
Captain
of
the
Gryffindor
team
called
a
meeting
on
Thursday
evening
to
discuss
tactics
for
the
new
season
there
were
seven
people
on
a
Quidditch
team
three
Chasers
whose
job
it
was
to
score
goals
by
putting
the
Quaffle
a
red
soccersized
ball
through
one
of
the
fiftyfoothigh
hoops
at
each
end
of
the
field
two
Beaters
who
were
equipped
with
heavy
bats
to
repel
the
Bludgers
two
heavy
black
balls
that
zoomed
around
trying
to
attack
the
players
a
Keeper
who
defended
the
goal
posts
and
the
Seeker
who
had
the
hardest
job
of
all
that
of
catching
the
Golden
Snitch
a
tiny
winged
walnutsized
ball
whose
capture
ended
the
game
and
earned
the
seeker's
team
an
extra
one
hundred
and
fifty
points
oliver
Wood
was
a
burly
seventeenyearold
now
in
his
seventh
and
final
year
at
Hogwarts
there
was
a
quiet
sort
of
desperation
in
his
voice
a's
he
addressed
his
six
fellow
team
members
in
the
chilly
locker
rooms
on
the
edge
of
the
darkening
Quidditch
field
this
is
our
last
chance
my
last
chance
to
win
the
Quidditch
Cup
he
told
them
striding
up
and
down
in
front
of
them
i'll
be
leaving
at
the
end
of
this
year
i'll
never
get
another
shot
at
it
gryffindor
hasn't
won
for
seven
years
now
okay
so
we've
had
the
worst
luck
in
the
world
injuries
then
the
tournamentgetting
called
off
last
year
Wood
swallowed
as
though
the
memory
still
brought
a
lump
to
his
throat
but
we
also
know
we've
got
the
bestruddyteamintheschool
he
said
punching
a
fist
into
his
other
hand
the
old
manic
glint
back
in
his
eye
we've
got
three
superb
Chasers
wood
pointed
at
Alicia
Spinner
Angelina
Johnson
and
Katie
Bell
we've
got
two
unbeatable
Beaters
stop
it
Oliver
you're
embarrassing
us
said
Fred
and
George
Weasley
together
pretending
to
blush
and
we've
got
a
Seeker
who
has
never
failed
to
win
us
a
match
wood
rumbled
glaring
at
Harry
with
a
kind
of
furious
pride
and
me
he
added
as
an
afterthought
we
think
you're
very
good
too
Oliver
said
George
spanking
good
Keeper
said
Fred
the
point
is
Wood
went
on
resuming
his
pacing
the
Quidditch
Cup
should
have
had
our
name
on
it
these
last
two
years
ever
since
Harry
joined
the
team
i've
thought
the
thing
was
in
the
bag
but
we
haven't
got
it
and
this
year's
the
last
chance
we'll
get
to
finally
see
our
name
on
the
thing
wood
spoke
so
dejectedly
that
even
Fred
and
George
looked
sympathetic
oliver
this
year's
our
year
said
Fred
we'll
do
it
Oliver
said
Angelina
definitely
said
Harry
full
of
determination
the
team
started
training
sessions
three
evenings
a
week
the
weather
was
getting
colder
and
wetter
the
nights
darker
but
no
amount
of
mud
wind
or
rain
could
tarnish
harry's
wonderful
vision
of
finally
winning
the
huge
silver
Quidditch
Cup
harry
returned
to
the
Gryffindor
common
room
one
evening
after
training
cold
and
stiff
but
pleased
with
the
way
practice
had
gone
to
find
the
room
buzzing
excitedly
what's
happened
he
asked
Ron
and
Hermione
who
were
sitting
in
two
of
the
best
chairs
by
the
fireside
and
completing
some
star
charts
for
Astronomy
first
Hogsmeade
weekend
said
Ron
pointing
at
a
notice
that
had
appeared
on
the
battered
old
bulletin
board
end
of
October
halloween
excellent
said
Fred
who
had
followed
Harry
through
the
portrait
hole
i
need
to
visit
zonko's
i'm
nearly
out
of
Stink
Pellets
harry
threw
himself
into
a
chair
beside
Ron
his
high
spirits
ebbing
away
hermione
seemed
to
read
his
mind
harry
i'm
sure
you'll
be
able
to
go
next
time
she
said
they're
bound
to
catch
Black
soon
he's
been
sighted
once
already
black's
not
fool
enough
to
try
anything
in
Hogsmeade
said
Ron
ask
McGonagall
if
you
can
go
this
time
Harry
the
next
one
might
not
be
for
ages
ron
said
Hermione
harry's
supposed
to
stay
in
school
he
can't
be
the
only
third
year
left
behind
said
Ron
ask
McGonagall
go
on
Harry
yeah
I
think
I
will
said
Harry
making
up
his
mind
hermione
opened
her
mouth
to
argue
but
at
that
moment
Crookshanks
leapt
lightly
onto
her
lap
a
large
dead
spider
was
dangling
from
his
mouth
does
he
have
to
eat
that
in
front
of
us
said
Ron
scowling
clever
Crookshanks
did
you
catch
that
all
by
yourself
said
Hermione
crookshanks
slowly
chewed
up
the
spider
his
yellow
eyes
fixed
insolently
on
Ron
just
keep
him
over
there
that's
all
said
Ron
irritably
turning
back
to
his
star
chart
ve
got
Scabbers
asleep
in
my
bag
harry
yawned
he
really
wanted
to
go
to
bed
but
he
still
had
his
own
star
chart
to
complete
he
pulled
his
bag
toward
him
took
out
parchment
ink
and
quill
and
started
work
you
can
copy
mine
if
you
like
said
Ron
labeling
his
last
star
with
a
flourish
and
shoving
the
chart
toward
Harry
hermione
who
disapproved
of
copying
pursed
her
lips
but
didn't
say
anything
crookshanks
was
still
staring
unblinkingly
at
Ron
flicking
the
end
of
his
bushy
tail
then
without
warning
he
pounced
oy
ron
roared
seizing
his
bag
as
Crookshanks
sank
four
sets
of
claws
deep
inside
it
and
began
tearing
ferociously
get
off
you
stupid
animal
ron
tried
to
pull
the
bag
away
from
Crookshanks
but
Crookshanks
clung
on
spitting
and
slashing
ron
don't
hurt
him
squealed
Hermione
the
whole
common
room
was
watching
Ron
whirled
the
bag
around
Crookshanks
still
clinging
to
it
and
Scabbers
came
flying
out
of
the
top
catch
that
car
Ron
yelled
as
Crookshanks
freed
himself
from
the
remnants
of
the
bag
sprang
over
the
table
and
chased
after
the
terrified
Scabbers
george
Weasley
made
a
lunge
for
Crookshanks
but
missed
Scabbers
streaked
through
twenty
pairs
of
legs
and
shot
beneath
an
old
chest
of
drawers
crookshanks
skidded
to
a
halt
crouched
low
on
his
bandy
legs
and
started
making
furious
swipes
beneath
it
with
his
front
paw
ron
and
Hermione
hurried
over
Hermione
grabbed
Crookshanks
around
the
middle
and
heaved
him
away
Ron
threw
himself
onto
his
stomach
and
with
great
difficulty
pulled
Scabbers
out
by
the
tail
look
at
him
he
said
furiously
to
Hermione
dangling
Scabbers
in
front
of
her
he's
skin
and
bone
you
keep
that
cat
away
from
him
crookshanks
doesn't
understand
it's
wrong
said
Hermione
her
voice
shaking
all
cats
chase
rats
Ron
there's
something
funny
about
that
animal
said
Ron
who
was
trying
to
persuade
a
frantically
wiggling
Scabbers
back
into
his
pocket
it
heard
me
say
that
Scabbers
was
in
my
bag
oh
what
rubbish
said
Hermione
impatiently
crookshanks
could
smell
him
Ron
how
else
d'you
think
that
cat's
got
it
in
for
Scabbers
said
Ron
ignoring
the
people
around
him
who
were
starting
to
giggle
and
Scabbers
was
here
first
and
he's
ill
ron
marched
through
the
common
room
and
out
of
sight
up
the
stairs
to
the
boys
dormitories
ron
was
still
in
a
bad
mood
with
Hermione
next
day
he
barely
talked
to
her
all
through
Herbology
even
though
he
Harry
and
Hermione
were
working
together
on
the
same
puffapod
how's
Scabbers
hermione
asked
timidly
as
they
stripped
fat
pink
pods
from
the
plants
and
emptied
the
shining
beans
into
a
wooden
pail
he's
hiding
at
the
bottom
of
my
bed
shaking
said
Ron
angrily
missing
the
pail
and
scattering
beans
over
the
greenhouse
floor
careful
Weasley
careful
cried
Professor
Sprout
as
the
beans
burst
into
bloom
before
their
very
eyes
they
had
Transfiguration
next
harry
who
had
resolved
to
ask
Professor
McGonagall
after
the
lesson
whether
he
could
go
into
Hogsmeade
with
the
rest
joined
the
line
outside
the
class
trying
to
decide
how
he
was
going
to
argue
his
case
he
was
distracted
however
by
a
disturbance
at
the
front
of
the
line
lavender
Brown
seemed
to
be
crying
parvati
had
her
arm
around
her
and
was
explaining
something
to
Seamus
Finnigan
and
Dean
Thomas
who
were
looking
very
serious
what's
the
matter
Lavender
said
Hermione
anxiously
as
she
Harry
and
Ron
went
to
join
the
group
she
got
a
letter
from
home
this
morning
Parvati
whispered
it's
her
rabbit
Binky
he's
been
killed
by
a
fox
oh
said
Hermione
i'm
sorry
Lavender
i
should
have
known
said
Lavender
tragically
you
know
what
day
it
is
er
the
sixteenth
of
October
that
thing
you're
dreading
it
will
happen
on
the
sixteenth
of
October
remember
she
was
right
she
was
right
the
whole
class
was
gathered
around
Lavender
now
seamus
shook
his
head
seriously
hermione
hesitated
then
she
said
You
you
were
dreading
Binky
being
killed
by
a
fox
well
not
necessarily
by
a
fox
said
Lavender
looking
up
at
Hermione
with
streaming
eyes
but
I
was
obviously
dreading
him
dying
wasn't
l
oh
said
Hermione
she
paused
again
then
Was
Binky
an
old
rabbit
n
no
sobbed
Lavender
h
he
was
only
a
baby
parvati
tightened
her
arm
around
lavender's
shoulders
but
then
why
would
you
dread
him
dying
said
Hermione
parvati
glared
at
her
well
look
at
it
logically
said
Hermione
turning
to
the
rest
of
the
group
I
mean
Binky
didn't
even
die
today
did
he
lavender
just
got
the
news
today
Lavender
wailed
loudly
and
she
can't
have
been
dreading
it
because
it's
come
as
a
real
shock
don't
mind
Hermione
Lavender
said
Ron
loudly
she
doesn't
think
other
people's
pets
matter
very
much
professor
McGonagall
opened
the
classroom
door
at
that
moment
which
was
perhaps
lucky
Hermione
and
Ron
were
looking
daggers
at
each
other
and
when
they
got
into
class
they
seated
themselves
on
either
side
of
Harry
and
didn't
talk
to
each
other
for
the
whole
class
harry
still
hadn't
decided
what
he
was
going
to
say
to
Professor
McGonagall
when
the
bell
rang
at
the
end
of
the
lesson
but
it
was
she
who
brought
up
the
subject
of
Hogsmeade
first
one
moment
please
she
called
as
the
class
made
to
leave
as
you're
all
in
my
House
you
should
hand
Hogsmeade
permission
forms
to
me
before
Halloween
no
form
no
visiting
the
village
so
don't
forget
neville
put
up
his
hand
please
Professor
I
I
think
i've
lost
Your
grandmother
sent
yours
to
me
directly
Longbottom
said
Professor
McGonagall
she
seemed
to
think
it
was
safer
well
that's
all
you
may
leave
ask
her
now
Ron
hissed
at
Harry
oh.
but
Hermione
began
go
for
it
Harry
said
Ron
stubbornly
harry
waited
for
the
rest
of
the
class
to
disappear
then
headed
nervously
for
Professor
mcgonagall's
desk
yes
Potter
harry
took
a
deep
breath
professor
my
aunt
and
uncle
er
forgot
to
sign
my
form
he
said
professor
McGonagall
looked
over
her
square
spectacles
at
him
but
didn't
say
anything
so
er
d'you
think
it
would
be
all
right
mean
will
It
be
okay
if
I
if
I
go
to
Hogsmeade
professor
McGonagall
looked
down
and
began
shuffling
papers
on
her
desk
i'm
afraid
not
Potter
she
said
you
heard
what
I
said
no
form
no
visiting
the
village
that's
the
rule
but
Professor
my
aunt
and
uncle
you
know
they're
Muggles
they
don't
really
understand
about
about
Hogwarts
forms
and
stuff
Harry
said
while
Ron
egged
him
on
with
vigorous
nods
if
you
said
I
could
go
but
I
don't
say
so
said
Professor
McGonagall
standing
up
and
piling
her
papers
neatly
into
a
drawer
the
form
clearly
states
that
the
parent
or
guardian
must
give
permission
she
turned
to
look
at
him
with
an
odd
expression
on
her
face
was
it
pity
i'm
sorry
Potter
but
that's
my
final
word
you
had
better
hurry
or
you'll
be
late
for
your
next
lesson
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
ron
called
Professor
McGonagall
a
lot
of
names
that
greatly
annoyed
Hermione
Hermione
assumed
an
allforthebest
expression
that
made
Ron
even
angrier
and
Harry
had
to
endure
everyone
in
the
class
talking
loudly
and
happily
about
what
they
were
going
to
do
first
once
they
got
into
Hogsmeade
there's
always
the
feast
said
Ron
in
an
effort
to
cheer
Harry
up
you
know
the
Halloween
feast
in
the
evening
yeah
said
Harry
gloomily
great
the
Halloween
feast
was
always
good
but
it
would
taste
a
lot
better
if
he
was
coming
to
it
after
a
day
in
Hogsmeade
with
everyone
else
nothing
anyone
said
made
him
feel
any
better
about
being
left
behind
dean
Thomas
who
was
good
with
a
quill
had
offered
to
forge
Uncle
vernon's
signature
on
the
form
but
as
Harry
had
already
told
Professor
McGonagall
he
hadn't
had
it
signed
that
was
no
good
ron
halfheartedly
suggested
the
Invisibility
Cloak
but
Hermione
stamped
on
that
one
reminding
Ron
what
Dumbledore
had
told
them
about
the
dementors
being
able
to
see
through
them
percy
had
what
were
possibly
the
least
helpful
words
of
comfort
they
make
a
fuss
about
Hogsmeade
but
I
assure
you
Harry
it's
not
all
it's
cracked
up
to
be
he
said
seriously
all
right
the
sweetshop's
rather
good
and
zonko's
Joke
shop's
frankly
dangerous
and
yes
the
Shrieking
shack's
always
worth
a
visit
but
really
Harry
apart
from
that
you're
not
missing
anything
on
Halloween
morning
Harry
awoke
with
the
rest
and
went
down
to
breakfast
feeling
thoroughly
depressed
though
doing
his
best
to
act
normally
we'll
bring
you
lots
of
sweets
back
from
Honeydukes
said
Hermione
looking
desperately
sorry
for
him
yeah
loads
said
Ron
he
and
Hermione
had
finally
forgotten
their
squabble
about
Crookshanks
in
the
face
of
harry's
difficulties
don't
worry
about
me
said
Harry
in
what
he
hoped
was
at
offhand
voice
i'll
see
you
at
the
feast
have
a
good
time
he
accompanied
them
to
the
entrance
hall
where
Filch
the
caretaker
was
standing
inside
the
front
doors
checking
off
names
against
a
long
list
peering
suspiciously
into
every
face
and
making
sure
that
no
one
was
sneaking
out
who
shouldn't
be
going
staying
here
Potter
shouted
Malfoy
who
was
standing
in
line
with
Crabbe
and
Goyle
scared
of
passing
the
dementors
harry
ignored
him
and
made
his
solitary
way
up
the
marble
staircase
through
the
deserted
corridors
and
back
to
Gryffindor
Tower
password
said
the
Fat
Lady
jerking
out
of
a
doze
fortuna
Major
said
Harry
listlessly
the
portrait
swung
open
and
he
climbed
through
the
hole
into
the
common
room
it
was
full
of
chattering
first
and
second
years
and
a
few
older
students
who
had
obviously
visited
Hogsmeade
so
often
the
novelty
had
worn
off
Harry
harry
hi
Harry
it
was
Colin
Creevey
a
second
year
who
was
deeply
in
awe
of
Harry
and
never
missed
an
opportunity
to
speak
to
him
aren't
you
going
to
Hogsmeade
Harry
why
not
hey
Colin
looked
eagerly
around
at
his
friends
you
can
come
and
sit
with
us
if
you
like
Harry
er
no
thanks
Colin
said
Harry
who
wasn't
in
the
mood
to
have
a
lot
of
people
staring
avidly
at
the
scar
on
his
forehead
i
i've
got
to
go
to
the
library
got
to
get
some
work
done
after
that
he
had
no
choice
but
to
turn
right
around
and
head
back
out
of
the
portrait
hole
again
what
was
the
point
waking
me
up
the
Fat
Lady
called
grumpily
after
him
as
he
walked
away
harry
wandered
dispiritedly
toward
the
library
but
halfway
there
he
changed
his
mind
he
didn't
feel
like
working
he
turned
around
and
came
facetoface
with
Filch
who
had
obviously
just
seen
off
the
last
of
the
Hogsmeade
visitors
what
are
you
doing
filch
snarled
suspiciously
nothing
said
Harry
truthfully
nothing
spat
Filch
his
jowls
quivering
unpleasantly
a
likely
story
sneaking
around
on
your
own
why
aren't
you
in
Hogsmeade
buying
Stink
Pellets
and
Belch
Powder
and
Whizzing
Worms
like
the
rest
of
your
nasty
little
friends
harry
shrugged
well
get
back
to
your
common
room
where
you
belong
snapped
Filch
and
he
stood
glaring
until
Harry
had
passed
out
of
sight
but
Harry
didn't
go
back
to
the
common
room
he
climbed
a
staircase
thinking
vaguely
of
visiting
the
Owlery
to
see
Hedwig
and
was
walking
along
another
corridor
when
a
voice
from
inside
one
of
the
rooms
said
harry
harry
doubled
back
to
see
who
had
spoken
and
met
Professor
Lupin
looking
around
his
office
door
what
are
you
doing
said
Lupin
though
in
a
very
different
voice
from
Filch
where
are
Ron
and
Hermione
hogsmeade
said
Harry
in
a
wouldbe
casual
voice
ah
said
Lupin
he
considered
Harry
for
a
moment
why
don't
you
come
in
i've
just
taken
delivery
of
a
grindylow
for
our
next
lesson
a
what
said
Harry
i
He
followed
Lupin
into
his
office
in
the
corner
stood
a
very
large
tank
of
water
a
sickly
green
creature
with
sharp
little
horns
had
its
face
pressed
against
the
glass
pulling
faces
and
flexing
its
long
spindly
fingers
water
demon
said
Lupin
surveying
the
grindylow
thoughtfully
we
shouldn't
have
much
difficulty
with
him
not
after
the
kappas
the
trick
is
to
break
his
grip
you
notice
the
abnormally
long
fingers
strong
but
very
brittle
the
grindylow
bared
its
green
teeth
and
then
buried
itself
in
a
tangle
of
weeds
in
a
corner
cup
of
tea
lupin
said
looking
around
for
his
kettle
i
was
just
thinking
of
making
one
all
right
said
Harry
awkwardly
lupin
tapped
the
kettle
with
his
wand
and
a
blast
of
steam
issued
suddenly
from
the
spout
sit
down
said
Lupin
taking
the
lid
off
a
dusty
tin
i've
only
got
teabags
i'm
afraid
but
I
daresay
you've
had
enough
of
tea
leaves
harry
looked
at
him
lupin's
eyes
were
twinkling
how
did
you
know
about
that
harry
asked
professor
McGonagall
told
me
said
Lupin
passing
Harry
a
chipped
mug
of
tea
you're
not
worried
are
you
no
said
Harry
he
thought
for
a
moment
of
telling
Lupin
about
the
dog
he'd
seen
in
Magnolia
Crescent
but
decided
not
to
he
didn't
want
Lupin
to
think
he
was
a
coward
especially
since
Lupin
alreadv
seemed
to
think
he
couldn't
cope
with
a
boggart
something
of
harry's
thoughts
seemed
to
have
shown
on
his
face
because
Lupin
said
Anything
worrying
you
Harry
no
Harry
lied
he
drank
a
bit
of
tea
and
watched
the
grindylow
brandishing
a
fist
at
him
yes
he
said
suddenly
putting
his
tea
down
on
lupin's
desk
you
know
that
day
we
fought
the
boggart
yes
said
Lupin
slowly
why
didn't
you
let
me
fight
it
said
Harry
abruptly
lupin
raised
his
eyebrows
i
would
have
thought
that
was
obvious
Harry
he
said
sounding
surprised
harry
who
had
expected
Lupin
to
deny
that
he'd
done
any
such
thing
was
taken
aback
why
he
said
again
well
said
Lupin
frowning
slightly
I
assumed
that
if
the
boggart
faced
you
it
would
assume
the
shape
of
Lord
Voldemort
harry
stared
not
only
was
this
the
last
answer
he'd
expected
but
Lupin
had
said
voldemort's
name
the
only
person
Harry
had
ever
heard
say
the
name
aloud
apart
from
himself
was
Professor
Dumbledore
clearly
I
was
wrong
said
Lupin
still
frowning
at
Harry
but
I
didn't
think
it
a
good
idea
for
Lord
Voldemort
to
materialize
in
the
staffroom
i
imagined
that
people
would
panic
i
didn't
think
of
Voldemort
said
Harry
honestly
i
I
remembered
those
dementors
i
see
said
Lupin
thoughtfully
well
well
i'm
impressed
fie
smiled
slightly
at
the
look
of
surprise
on
harry's
face
that
suggests
that
what
you
fear
most
of
all
is
fear
very
wise
Harry
harry
didn't
know
what
to
say
to
that
so
he
drank
some
mot
tea
so
you've
been
thinking
that
I
didn't
believe
you
capable
of
fighting
the
boggart
said
Lupin
shrewdly
well
yeah
said
Harry
he
was
suddenly
feeling
a
lot
happier
professor
Lupin
you
know
the
dementors
he
was
interrupted
by
a
knock
on
the
door
come
in
called
Lupin
the
door
opened
and
in
came
Snape
he
was
carrying
a
goblet
which
was
smoking
faintly
and
stopped
at
the
sight
of
Harry
his
black
eyes
narrowing
ah
Severus
said
Lupin
smiling
thanks
very
much
could
you
leave
it
here
on
the
desk
for
me
snape
set
down
the
smoking
goblet
his
eyes
wandering
between
Harry
and
Lupin
i
was
just
showing
Harry
my
grindylow
said
Lupin
pleasantly
pointing
at
the
tank
fascinating
said
Snape
without
looking
at
it
you
should
drink
that
directly
Lupin
yes
Yes
I
will
said
Lupin
i
made
an
entire
cauldronful
Snape
continued
if
you
need
more
i
should
probably
take
some
again
tomorrow
thanks
very
much
Severus
not
at
all
said
Snape
but
there
was
a
look
in
his
eye
Harry
didn't
like
he
backed
out
of
the
room
unsmiling
and
watchful
harry
looked
curiously
at
the
goblet
lupin
smiled
professor
Snape
has
very
kindly
concocted
a
potion
for
me
he
said
i
have
never
been
much
of
a
potionbrewer
and
this
one
is
particularly
complex
he
picked
up
the
goblet
and
sniffed
it
pity
sugar
makes
it
useless
he
added
taking
a
sip
and
shuddering
why
harry
began
lupin
looked
at
him
and
answered
the
unfinished
question
i've
been
feeling
a
bit
offcolor
he
said
this
potion
is
the
only
thing
that
helps
i
am
very
lucky
to
be
working
alongside
Professor
Snape
there
aren't
many
wizards
who
are
up
to
making
it
professor
Lupin
took
another
sip
and
Harry
had
a
crazy
urge
to
knock
the
goblet
out
of
his
hands
professor
snape's
very
interested
in
the
Dark
Arts
he
blurted
out
really
said
Lupin
looking
only
mildly
interested
as
he
took
another
gulp
of
potion
some
people
reckon
Harry
hesitated
then
plunged
recklessly
on
some
people
reckon
he'd
do
anything
to
get
the
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
job
lupin
drained
the
goblet
and
pulled
a
face
disgusting
he
said
well
Harry
i'd
better
get
back
to
work
see
you
at
the
feast
later
right
said
Harry
putting
down
his
empty
teacup
the
empty
goblet
was
still
smoking
there
you
go
said
Ron
we
got
as
much
as
we
could
carry
a
shower
of
brilliantly
colored
sweets
fell
into
harry's
lap
it
was
dusk
and
Ron
and
Hermione
had
just
turned
up
in
the
common
room
pinkfaced
from
the
cold
wind
and
looking
as
though
they'd
had
the
time
of
their
lives
thanks
said
Harry
picking
up
a
packet
of
tiny
black
Pepper
Imps
what's
Hogsmeade
like
where
did
you
go
by
the
sound
of
it
everywhere
dervish
and
Banges
the
wizarding
equipment
shop
zonko's
Joke
Shop
into
the
Three
Broomsticks
for
foaming
mugs
of
hot
butterbeer
and
many
places
besides
the
post
office
Harry
about
two
hundred
owls
all
sitting
on
shelves
all
colorcoded
depending
on
how
fast
you
want
your
letter
to
get
there
honeydukes
has
got
a
new
kind
of
fudge
they
were
giving
out
free
samples
there's
a
bit
look
we
think
we
saw
an
ogre
honestly
they
get
all
sorts
at
the
Three
Broomsticks
wish
we
could
have
brought
you
some
butterbeer
really
warms
you
up
what
did
you
do
said
Hermione
looking
anxious
did
you
get
any
work
done
no
said
Harry
lupin
made
me
a
cup
of
tea
in
his
office
and
then
Snape
came
in
he
told
them
all
about
the
goblet
ron's
mouth
fell
open
lupin
drank
it
he
gasped
is
he
mad
hermione
checked
her
watch
we'd
better
go
down
you
know
the
feast'll
be
starting
in
fiveminutes
They
hurried
through
the
portrait
hole
and
into
the
crowd
still
discussing
Snape
but
if
he
you
know
Hermione
dropped
her
voice
glancing
nervously
around
if
he
was
trying
to
to
poison
Lupin
he
wouldn't
have
done
it
in
front
of
Harry
yeah
maybe
said
Harry
as
they
reached
the
entrance
hall
and
crossed
into
the
Great
Hall
it
had
been
decorated
with
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
candlefilled
pumpkins
a
cloud
of
fluttering
live
bats
and
many
flaming
orange
streamers
which
were
swimming
lazily
across
the
stormy
ceiling
like
brilliant
watersnakes
the
food
was
delicious
even
Hermione
and
Ron
who
were
full
to
bursting
with
Honeydukes
sweets
managed
second
helpings
of
everything
harry
kept
glancing
at
the
staff
table
professor
Lupin
looked
cheerful
and
as
well
as
he
ever
did
he
was
talking
animatedly
to
tiny
little
Professor
Flitwick
the
Charms
teacher
harry
moved
his
eyes
along
the
table
to
the
place
where
Snape
sat
was
he
imagining
it
or
were
snape's
eyes
flickering
toward
Lupin
more
often
than
was
natural
the
feast
finished
with
an
entertainment
provided
by
the
Hogwarts
ghosts
they
popped
out
of
the
walls
and
tables
to
do
a
bit
of
formation
gliding
Nearly
Headless
Nick
the
Gryffindor
ghost
had
a
great
success
with
a
reenactment
of
his
own
botched
beheading
it
had
been
such
a
pleasant
evening
that
harry's
good
mood
couldn't
even
be
spoiled
by
Malfoy
who
shouted
through
the
crowd
as
they
all
left
the
hall
The
dementors
send
their
love
Potter
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
followed
the
rest
of
the
Gryffindors
along
the
usual
path
to
Gryffindor
Tower
but
when
they
reached
the
corridor
that
ended
with
the
portrait
of
the
Fat
Lady
they
found
it
jammed
with
students
why
isn't
anyone
going
in
said
Ron
curiously
harry
peered
over
the
heads
in
front
of
him
the
portrait
seemed
to
be
closed
let
me
through
please
came
percy's
voice
and
he
came
bustling
importantly
through
the
crowd
what's
the
holdup
here
you
can't
all
have
forgotten
the
password
excuse
me
i'm
Head
Boy
and
then
a
silence
fell
over
the
crowd
from
the
front
first
so
that
a
chill
seemed
to
spread
down
the
corridor
they
heard
Percy
say
in
a
suddenly
sharp
voice
Somebody
get
Professor
Dumbledore
quick
people's
heads
turned
those
at
the
back
were
standing
on
tiptoe
what's
going
on
said
Ginny
who
had
just
arrived
a
moment
later
Professor
Dumbledore
was
there
sweeping
toward
the
portrait
the
Gryffindors
squeezed
together
to
let
him
through
and
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
moved
closer
to
see
what
the
trouble
was
oh
my
Hermione
grabbed
harry's
arm
the
Fat
Lady
had
vanished
from
her
portrait
which
had
been
slashed
so
viciously
that
strips
of
canvas
littered
the
floor
great
chunks
of
it
had
been
torn
away
completely
dumbledore
took
one
quick
look
at
the
ruined
painting
and
turned
his
eyes
somber
to
see
Professors
McGonagall
Lupin
and
Snape
hurrying
toward
him
we
need
to
find
her
said
Dumbledore
professor
McGonagall
please
go
to
mr.
Filch
at
once
and
tell
him
to
search
every
painting
in
the
castle
for
the
Fat
Lady
you'll
be
lucky
said
a
cackling
voice
it
was
Peeves
the
Poltergeist
bobbing
over
the
crowd
and
looking
delighted
as
he
always
did
at
the
sight
of
wreckage
or
worry
what
do
you
mean
Peeves
said
Dumbledore
calmly
and
peeves's
grin
faded
a
little
he
didn't
dare
taunt
Dumbledore
instead
he
adopted
an
oily
voice
that
was
no
better
than
his
cackle
ashamed
Your
Headship
sit
doesn't
want
to
be
seen
she's
a
horrible
mess
saw
her
running
through
the
landscape
up
on
the
fourth
floor
sir
dodging
between
the
trees
crying
something
dreadful
he
said
happily
poor
thing
he
added
unconvincingly
did
she
say
who
did
it
said
Dumbledore
quietly
oh
yes
Professorhead
said
Peeves
with
the
air
of
one
cradling
a
large
bombshell
in
his
arms
he
got
very
angry
when
she
wouldn't
let
him
in
you
see
peeves
flipped
over
and
grinned
at
Dumbledore
from
between
his
own
legs
nasty
temper
he's
got
that
Sirius
Black
chapter
nine
grim
defeat
professor
Dumbledore
sent
all
the
Gryffindors
back
to
the
Great
Hall
where
they
were
joined
ten
minutes
later
by
the
students
from
Hufflepuff
Ravenclaw
and
Slytherin
who
all
looked
extremely
confused
the
teachers
and
I
need
to
conduct
a
thorough
search
of
the
castle
professor
Dumbledore
told
them
as
Professors
McGonagall
and
Flitwick
closed
all
doors
into
the
hall
i'm
afraid
that
for
your
own
safety
you
will
have
to
spend
the
night
here
i
want
the
prefects
to
stand
guard
over
the
entrances
to
the
hall
and
I
am
leaving
the
Head
Boy
and
Girl
in
charge
any
disturbance
should
be
reported
to
me
immediately
he
added
to
Percy
who
was
looking
immensely
proud
and
important
send
word
with
one
of
the
ghosts
professor
Dumbledore
paused
about
to
leave
the
hall
and
said
Oh
yes
you'll
be
needing
one
casual
wave
of
his
wand
and
the
long
tables
flew
to
the
edges
of
the
hall
and
stood
themselves
against
the
walls
another
wave
and
the
floor
was
covered
with
hundreds
of
squashy
purple
sleeping
bags
sleep
well
said
Professor
Dumbledore
closing
the
door
behind
him
the
hall
immediately
began
to
buzz
excitedly
the
Gryffindors
were
telling
the
rest
of
the
school
what
had
just
happened
everyone
into
their
sleeping
bags
shouted
Percy
come
on
now
no
more
talking
lights
out
in
ten
minutes
c'mon
Ron
said
to
Harry
and
Hermione
they
seized
three
sleeping
bags
and
dragged
them
into
a
corner
do
you
think
black's
still
in
the
castle
hermione
whispered
anxiously
dumbledore
obviously
thinks
he
might
be
said
Ron
it's
very
lucky
he
picked
tonight
you
know
said
Hermione
as
they
climbed
fully
dressed
into
their
sleeping
bags
and
propped
themselves
on
their
elbows
to
talk
the
one
night
we
weren't
in
the
tower
i
reckon
he's
lost
track
of
time
being
on
the
run
said
Ron
didn't
realize
it
was
Halloween
otherwise
he'd
have
come
bursting
in
here
hermione
shuddered
all
around
them
people
were
asking
one
another
the
same
question
How
did
he
get
in
maybe
he
knows
how
to
Apparate
said
a
Ravenclaw
a
few
feet
away
just
appear
out
of
thin
air
you
know
disguised
himself
probably
said
a
Hufflepuff
fifth
year
he
could've
flown
in
suggested
Dean
Thomas
honestly
am
I
the
only
person
who's
ever
bothered
to
read
Hogwarts
A
History
said
Hermione
crossly
to
Harry
and
Ron
probably
said
Ron
why
because
the
castle's
protected
by
more
than
walls
You
know
said
Hermione
there
are
all
sorts
of
enchantments
on
it
to
stop
people
entering
by
stealth
you
can't
just
Apparate
in
here
and
i'd
like
to
see
the
disguise
that
could
fool
those
dementors
they're
guarding
every
single
entrance
to
the
grounds
they'd
have
seen
him
fly
in
too
and
Fitch
knows
all
the
secret
passages
they'll
have
them
covered
the
lights
are
going
out
now
percy
shouted
i
want
everyone
in
their
sleeping
bags
and
no
more
talking
the
candles
all
went
out
at
once
the
only
light
now
came
from
the
silvery
ghosts
who
were
drifting
about
talking
seriously
to
the
prefects
and
the
enchanted
ceiling
which
like
the
sky
outside
was
scattered
with
stars
what
with
that
and
the
whispering
that
still
filled
the
hall
Harry
felt
as
though
he
were
sleeping
outdoors
in
a
light
wind
once
every
hour
a
teacher
would
reappear
in
the
hall
to
check
that
everything
was
quiet
around
three
in
the
morning
when
many
students
had
finally
fallen
asleep
Professor
Dumbledore
came
in
harry
watched
him
looking
around
for
Percy
who
had
been
prowling
between
the
sleeping
bags
telling
people
off
for
talking
percy
was
only
a
short
way
away
from
Harry
Ron
and
Hermlone
who
quickly
pretended
to
be
asleep
as
dumbledore's
footsteps
drew
nearer
any
sign
of
him
Professor
asked
Percy
in
a
whisper
no.
All
well
here
everything
under
control
sir
good
there's
no
point
moving
them
all
now
i've
found
a
temporary
guardian
for
the
Gryffindor
portrait
hole
you'll
be
able
to
move
them
back
in
tomorrow
and
the
Fat
Lady
sir
hiding
in
a
map
of
Argyllshire
on
the
second
floor
apparently
she
refused
to
let
Black
in
without
the
password
so
he
attacked
she's
still
very
distressed
but
once
she's
calmed
down
i'll
have
mr.
Filch
restore
her
harry
heard
the
door
of
the
hall
creak
open
again
and
more
footsteps
headmaster
it
was
Snape
harry
kept
quite
still
listening
hard
the
whole
of
the
third
floor
has
been
searched
he's
not
there
and
Filch
has
done
the
dungeons
nothing
there
either
what
about
the
Astronomy
tower
professor
trelawney's
room
the
Owlery
all
searched
very
well
Severus
i
didn't
really
expect
Black
to
linger
have
you
any
theory
as
to
how
he
got
in
Professor
asked
Snape
harry
raised
his
head
very
slightly
off
his
arms
to
free
his
other
ear
many
Severus
each
of
them
as
unlikely
as
the
next
harry
opened
his
eyes
a
fraction
and
squinted
up
to
where
they
stood
dumbledore's
back
was
to
him
but
he
could
see
percy's
face
rapt
with
attention
and
snape's
profile
which
looked
angry
you
remember
the
conversation
we
had
Headmaster
just
before
ah
the
start
of
term
said
Snape
who
was
barely
opening
his
lips
as
though
trying
to
block
Percy
out
of
the
conversation
i
do
Severus
said
Dumbledore
and
there
was
something
like
warning
in
his
voice
it
seems
almost
impossible
that
Black
could
have
entered
the
school
without
inside
help
i
did
express
my
concerns
whet
you
appointed
i
do
not
believe
a
single
person
inside
this
castle
would
have
helped
Black
enter
it
said
Dumbledore
and
his
tone
made
it
so
clear
that
the
subject
was
closed
that
Snape
didn't
reply
i
must
go
down
to
the
dementors
said
Dumbledore
i
said
I
would
inform
them
when
our
search
was
complete
didn't
they
want
to
help
sit
said
Percy
oh
yes
said
Dumbledore
coldly
but
i'm
afraid
no
dementor
will
cross
the
threshold
of
this
castle
while
I
am
headmaster
percy
looked
slightly
abashed
dumbledore
left
the
hall
walking
quickly
and
quietly
snape
stood
for
a
moment
watching
the
headmaster
with
an
expression
of
deep
resentment
on
his
face
then
he
too
left
harry
glanced
sideways
at
Ron
and
Hermione
both
of
them
had
their
eyes
open
too
reflecting
the
starry
ceiling
What
was
all
that
about
ron
mouthed
the
school
talked
of
nothing
but
Sirius
Black
for
the
next
few
days
the
theories
about
how
he
had
entered
the
castle
became
wilder
and
wilder
Hannah
Abbott
from
Hufflepuff
spent
much
of
their
next
Herbology
class
telling
anyone
who'd
listen
that
Black
could
turn
into
a
flowering
shrub
the
Fat
lady's
ripped
canvas
had
been
taken
off
the
wall
and
Replaced
with
the
portrait
of
Sir
Cadogan
and
his
fat
gray
pony
nobody
was
very
happy
about
this
sir
Cadogan
spent
half
his
time
challenging
people
to
duels
and
the
rest
thinking
up
ridiculously
complicated
passwords
which
he
changed
at
least
twice
a
day
he's
a
complete
lunatic
said
Seamus
Finnigan
angrily
to
Percy
can't
we
get
anyone
else
none
of
the
other
pictures
wanted
the
job
said
Percy
frightened
of
what
happened
to
the
Fat
Lady
sir
Cadogan
was
the
only
one
brave
enough
to
volunteer
sir
Cadogan
however
was
the
least
of
harry's
worries
he
was
now
being
closely
watched
teachers
found
excuses
to
walk
along
corridors
with
him
and
Percy
Weasley
acting
Harry
suspected
on
his
mother's
orders
was
tailing
him
everywhere
like
an
extremely
pompous
guard
dog
to
cap
it
all
Professor
McGonagall
summoned
Harry
into
her
office
with
such
a
somber
expression
on
her
face
Harry
thought
someone
must
have
died
there's
no
point
hiding
it
from
you
any
longer
Potter
she
said
in
a
very
serious
voice
i
know
this
will
come
as
a
shock
to
you
but
Sirius
Black
i
know
he's
after
me
said
Harry
wearily
i
heard
ron's
dad
telling
his
mum
mr.
Weasley
works
for
the
Ministry
of
Magic
professor
McGonagall
seemed
very
taken
aback
she
stared
at
Harry
for
a
moment
or
two
then
said
I
see
well
in
that
case
Potter
you'll
understand
why
I
don't
think
it's
a
good
idea
for
you
to
be
practicing
quidditch
in
the
evenings
out
on
the
field
with
only
Your
team
members
it's
very
exposed
Potter
we've
got
our
first
match
on
Saturday
said
Harry
outraged
i've
got
to
train
Professor
professor
McGonagall
considered
him
intently
harry
knew
she
was
deeply
interested
in
the
Gryffindor
team's
prospects
it
had
been
she
after
all
who'd
suggested
him
as
Seeker
in
the
first
Place
he
waited
holding
his
breath
hmm
professor
McGonagall
stood
up
and
stared
out
of
the
window
at
the
Quidditch
field
just
visible
through
the
rain
well
goodness
knows
i'd
like
to
see
us
win
the
Cup
at
last
but
all
the
same
potter
i'd
be
happier
if
a
teacher
were
present
i'll
ask
Madam
Hooch
to
oversee
your
training
sessions
the
weather
worsened
steadily
as
the
first
Quidditch
match
drew
nearer
undaunted
the
Gryffindor
team
was
training
harder
than
ever
under
the
eye
of
Madam
Hooch
then
at
their
final
training
session
before
saturday's
match
Oliver
Wood
gave
his
team
some
unwelcome
news
we're
not
playing
Slytherin
he
told
them
looking
very
angry
flint's
just
been
to
see
me
we're
playing
Hufflepuff
instead
why
chorused
the
rest
of
the
team
flint's
excuse
is
that
their
seeker's
arm's
still
injured
said
Wood
grinding
his
teeth
furiously
but
it's
obvious
why
they're
doing
it
don't
want
to
play
in
this
weather
think
it'll
damage
their
chances
there
had
been
strong
winds
and
heavy
rain
all
day
and
as
Wood
spoke
they
heard
a
distant
rumble
of
thunder
there's
nothing
wrong
with
malfoy's
arm
said
Harry
furiously
he's
faking
it
i
know
that
but
we
can't
prove
it
said
Wood
bitterly
And
we've
been
practicing
all
those
moves
assuming
we're
playing
Slytherin
and
instead
it's
Hufflepuff
and
their
style's
quite
different
they've
got
a
new
Captain
and
Seeker
Cedric
Diggory
angelina
Alicia
and
Katie
suddenly
giggled
what
said
Wood
frowning
at
this
lighthearted
behavior
he's
that
tall
goodlooking
one
isn't
he
said
Angelina
strong
and
silent
said
Katie
and
they
started
to
giggle
again
he's
only
silent
because
he's
too
thick
to
string
two
words
together
said
Fred
impatiently
i
don't
know
why
you're
worried
Oliver
hufflepuff
is
a
pushover
last
time
we
played
them
Harry
caught
the
Snitch
in
about
five
minutes
remember
we
were
playing
in
completely
different
conditions
wood
shouted
his
eyes
bulging
slightly
diggory's
put
a
very
strong
side
together
he's
an
excellent
Seeker
i
was
afraid
you'd
take
it
like
this
we
mustn't
relax
we
must
keep
our
focus
slytherin
is
trying
to
wrongfoot
us
we
must
win
oliver
calm
down
said
Fred
looking
slightly
alarmed
we're
taking
Hufflepuff
very
seriously
seriously
the
day
before
the
match
the
winds
reached
howling
point
and
the
rain
fell
harder
than
ever
it
was
so
dark
inside
the
corridors
and
classrooms
that
extra
torches
and
lanterns
were
lit
the
Slytherin
team
was
looking
very
smug
indeed
and
none
more
so
than
Malfoy
ah
if
only
my
arm
was
feeling
a
bit
better
he
sighed
as
the
gale
outside
pounded
the
windows
harry
had
no
room
in
his
head
to
worry
about
anything
except
the
match
tomorrow
oliver
Wood
kept
hurrying
up
to
him
between
classes
and
giving
him
tips
the
third
time
this
happened
Wood
talked
for
so
long
that
Harry
suddenly
realized
he
was
ten
minutes
late
for
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
and
set
off
at
a
run
with
Wood
shouting
after
him
diggory's
got
a
very
fast
swerve
Harry
so
you
might
want
to
try
looping
him
harry
skidded
to
a
halt
outside
the
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
classroom
pulled
the
door
open
and
dashed
inside
sorry
i'm
late
Professor
Lupin
but
it
wasn't
Professor
Lupin
who
looked
up
at
him
from
the
teacher's
desk
it
was
Snape
this
lesson
began
ten
minutes
ago
Potter
so
I
think
we'll
make
it
ten
points
from
Gryffindor
sit
down
but
Harry
didn't
move
where's
Professor
Lupin
he
said
he
says
he
is
feeling
too
ill
to
teach
today
said
Snape
with
a
twisted
smile
i
believe
I
told
you
to
sit
down
but
Harry
stayed
where
he
was
what's
wrong
with
him
snape's
black
eyes
glittered
nothing
lifethreatening
he
said
looking
as
though
he
wished
it
were
five
more
points
from
Gryffindor
and
if
I
have
to
ask
you
to
sit
down
again
it
will
be
fifty
harry
walked
slowly
to
his
seat
and
sat
down
snape
looked
around
at
the
class
as
I
was
saying
before
Potter
interrupted
Professor
Lupin
has
not
left
any
record
of
the
topics
you
have
covered
so
far
please
sir
we've
done
boggarts
Red
Caps
kappas
and
grindylows
said
Hermione
quickly
and
we're
just
about
to
start
be
quiet
said
Snape
coldly
i
did
not
ask
for
information
i
was
merely
commenting
on
Professor
lupin's
lack
of
organization
he's
the
best
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
teacher
we've
ever
had
said
Dean
Thomas
boldly
and
there
was
a
murmur
of
agreement
from
the
rest
of
the
class
snape
looked
more
menacing
than
ever
you
are
easily
satisfied
lupin
is
hardly
overtaxing
you
I
Would
expect
first
years
to
be
able
to
deal
with
Red
Caps
and
grindylows
today
we
shall
discuss
harry
watched
him
flick
through
the
textbook
to
the
very
back
chapter
which
he
must
know
they
hadn't
covered
werewolves
said
Snape
but
sir
said
Hermione
seemingly
unable
to
restrain
herself
we're
not
supposed
to
do
werewolves
yet
we're
due
to
start
hinkypunks
miss
Granger
said
Snape
in
a
voice
of
deadly
calm
I
was
under
the
impression
that
I
am
teaching
this
lesson
not
you
and
I
am
telling
you
all
to
turn
to
page
he
glanced
around
again
all
of
you
now
with
many
bitter
sidelong
looks
and
some
sullen
muttering
the
class
opened
their
books
which
of
you
can
tell
me
how
we
distinguish
between
the
werewolf
and
the
true
wolf
said
Snape
everyone
sat
in
motionless
silence
everyone
except
Hermione
whose
hand
as
it
so
often
did
had
shot
straight
into
the
air
anyone
snape
said
ignoring
Hermione
his
twisted
smile
was
back
are
you
telling
me
that
Professor
Lupin
hasn't
even
taught
you
the
basic
distinction
between
we
told
you
said
Parvati
suddenly
we
haven't
got
as
far
as
werewolves
yet
we're
still
on
silence
snarled
Snape
well
well
well
I
never
thought
i'd
meet
a
thirdyear
class
who
wouldn't
even
recognize
a
werewolf
when
they
saw
one
i
shall
make
a
point
of
informing
Professor
Dumbledore
how
very
behind
you
all
are
please
sir
said
Hermione
whose
hand
was
still
in
the
air
the
werewolf
differs
from
the
true
wolf
in
several
small
ways
the
snout
of
the
werewolf
that
is
the
second
time
you
have
spoken
out
of
turn
Miss
Granger
said
Snape
coolly
five
more
points
from
Gryffindor
for
being
an
insufferable
knowitall
hermione
went
very
red
put
down
her
hand
and
stared
at
the
floor
with
her
eyes
full
of
tears
it
was
a
mark
of
how
much
the
class
loathed
Snape
that
they
were
all
glaring
at
him
because
every
one
of
them
had
called
Hermione
a
knowitall
at
least
once
and
Ron
who
told
Hermione
she
was
a
knowitall
at
least
twice
a
week
said
loudly
You
asked
us
a
question
and
she
knows
the
answer
why
ask
if
you
don't
want
to
be
told
the
class
knew
instantly
he'd
gone
too
far
snape
advanced
on
Ron
slowly
and
the
room
held
its
breath
detention
Weasley
Snape
said
silkily
his
face
very
close
to
ron's
and
if
I
ever
hear
you
criticize
the
way
I
teach
a
class
again
you
will
be
very
sorry
indeed
no
one
made
a
sound
throughout
the
rest
of
the
lesson
they
sat
and
made
notes
on
werewolves
from
the
textbook
while
Snape
prowled
up
and
down
the
rows
of
desks
examining
the
work
they
had
been
doing
with
Professor
Lupin
very
poorly
explained
that
is
incorrect
the
kappa
is
more
commonly
found
in
Mongolia
professor
Lupin
gave
this
eight
out
of
ten
i
wouldn't
have
given
it
three
when
the
bell
rang
at
last
Snape
held
them
back
you
will
each
write
an
essay
to
be
handed
in
to
me
on
the
ways
you
recognize
and
kill
werewolves
i
want
two
rolls
of
parchment
or
the
subject
and
I
want
them
by
Monday
morning
it
is
time
somebody
took
this
class
in
hand
weasley
stay
behind
we
need
to
arrange
your
detention
harry
and
Hermione
left
the
room
with
the
rest
of
the
class
who
waited
until
they
were
well
out
of
earshot
then
burst
into
a
furious
tirade
about
Snape
snape's
never
been
like
this
with
any
of
our
other
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
teachers
even
if
he
did
want
the
job
Harry
said
to
Hermione
why's
he
got
it
in
for
Lupin
d'you
think
this
is
all
because
of
the
boggart
i
don't
know
said
Hermione
pensively
but
I
really
hope
Professor
Lupin
gets
better
soon
ron
caught
up
with
them
five
minutes
later
in
a
towering
rage
d'you
know
what
that
he
called
Snape
something
that
made
Hermione
say
Ron
is
making
me
do
i've
got
to
scrub
out
the
bedpans
in
the
hospital
wing
without
magic
he
was
breathing
deeply
his
fists
clenched
why
couldn't
Black
have
hidden
in
snape's
office
eh
he
could
have
finished
him
off
for
us
harry
woke
extremely
early
the
next
morning
so
early
that
it
was
till
dark
for
a
moment
he
thought
the
roaring
of
the
wind
had
woken
him
then
he
felt
a
cold
breeze
on
the
back
of
his
neck
and
sat
bolt
upright
Peeves
the
Poltergeist
had
been
floating
next
to
him
blowing
hard
in
his
ear
what
did
you
do
that
for
said
Harry
furiously
peeves
puffed
out
his
cheeks
blew
hard
and
zoomed
backward
out
of
the
room
cackling
harry
fumbled
for
his
alarm
clock
and
looked
at
it
it
was
half
past
four
cursing
Peeves
he
rolled
over
and
tried
to
get
back
to
sleep
but
it
was
very
difficult
now
that
he
was
awake
to
ignore
the
sounds
of
the
thunder
rumbling
overhead
the
pounding
of
the
wind
against
the
castle
walls
and
the
distant
creaking
of
the
trees
in
the
Forbidden
Forest
in
a
few
hours
he
would
be
out
on
the
Quidditch
field
battling
through
that
gale
finally
he
gave
up
any
thought
of
more
sleep
got
up
dressed
picked
up
his
Nimbus
Two
Thousand
and
walked
quietly
out
of
the
dormitory
as
Harry
opened
the
door
something
brushed
against
his
leg
he
bent
down
just
in
time
to
grab
Crookshanks
by
the
end
of
his
bushy
tail
and
drag
him
outside
you
know
I
reckon
Ron
was
right
about
you
Harry
told
Crookshanks
suspiciously
there
are
plenty
of
mice
around
this
place
go
and
chase
them
go
on
he
added
nudging
Crookshanks
down
the
spiral
staircase
with
his
foot
leave
Scabbers
alone
the
noise
of
the
storm
was
even
louder
in
the
common
roorn
harry
knew
better
than
to
think
the
match
would
be
canceled
Quidditch
matches
weren't
called
off
for
trifles
like
thunderstorms
nevertheless
he
was
starting
to
feel
very
apprehensive
wood
had
pointed
out
Cedric
Diggory
to
him
in
the
corridor
Diggory
was
a
fifth
year
and
a
lot
bigger
than
Harry
seekers
were
usually
light
and
speedy
but
diggory's
weight
would
be
an
advantage
in
this
weather
because
he
was
less
likely
to
be
blown
off
course
harry
whiled
away
the
hours
until
dawn
in
front
of
the
fire
getting
up
every
now
and
then
to
stop
Crookshanks
from
sneaking
up
the
boys
staircase
again
at
long
last
Harry
thought
it
must
be
time
for
breakfast
so
he
headed
through
the
portrait
hole
alone
stand
and
fight
you
mangy
cur
yelled
Sir
Cadogan
oh
shut
up
Harry
yawned
he
revived
a
bit
over
a
large
bowl
of
porridge
and
by
the
time
he'd
started
on
toast
the
rest
of
the
team
had
turned
up
it's
going
to
be
a
tough
one
said
Wood
who
wasn't
eating
anything
stop
worrying
Oliver
said
Alicia
soothingly
we
don't
mind
a
bit
of
rain
but
it
was
considerably
more
than
a
bit
of
rain
such
was
the
popularity
of
Quidditch
that
the
whole
school
turned
out
to
watch
the
match
as
usual
but
they
ran
down
the
lawns
toward
the
Quidditch
field
heads
bowed
against
the
ferocious
wind
umbrellas
being
whipped
out
of
their
hands
as
they
went
just
before
he
entered
the
locker
room
Harry
saw
Malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
laughing
and
pointing
at
him
from
under
an
enormous
umbrella
on
their
way
to
the
stadium
the
team
changed
into
their
scarlet
robes
and
waited
for
wood's
usual
prematch
pep
talk
but
it
didn't
come
he
tried
to
speak
several
times
made
an
odd
gulping
noise
then
shook
his
head
hopelessly
and
beckoned
them
to
follow
him
the
wind
was
so
strong
that
they
staggered
sideways
as
they
walked
out
onto
the
field
if
the
crowd
was
cheering
they
couldn't
hear
it
over
the
fresh
rolls
of
thunder
rain
was
splattering
over
harry's
glasses
how
on
earth
was
he
going
to
see
the
Snitch
in
this
the
Hufflepuffs
were
approaching
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
field
wearing
canaryyellow
robes
the
Captains
walked
up
to
eacb
other
and
shook
hands
Diggory
smiled
at
Wood
but
Wood
no
looked
as
though
he
had
lockjaw
and
merely
nodded
harry
saw
Madam
hooch's
mouth
form
the
words
mount
Your
brooms
He
pulled
his
right
foot
out
of
the
mud
with
a
squelch
and
swung
it
over
his
Nimbus
Two
Thousand
madam
Hooch
put
her
whistle
to
her
lips
and
gave
it
a
blast
that
sounded
shrill
and
distant
they
were
off
Harry
rose
fast
but
his
Nimbus
was
swerving
slightly
with
the
wind
he
held
it
as
steady
as
he
could
and
turned
squinting
into
the
rain
within
five
minutes
Harry
was
soaked
to
his
skin
and
frozen
hardly
able
to
see
his
teammates
let
alone
the
tiny
Snitch
he
flew
backward
and
forward
across
the
field
past
blurred
red
and
yellow
shapes
with
no
idea
of
what
was
happening
in
the
rest
of
the
game
he
couldn't
hear
the
commentary
over
the
wind
the
crowd
was
hidden
beneath
a
sea
of
cloaks
and
battered
umbrellas
twice
Harry
came
very
close
to
being
unseated
by
a
Bludger
his
vision
was
so
clouded
by
the
rain
on
his
glasses
he
hadn't
seen
them
coming
he
lost
track
of
time
it
was
getting
harder
and
harder
to
hold
his
broom
straight
the
sky
was
getting
darker
as
though
night
had
decided
to
come
early
twice
Harry
nearly
hit
another
player
without
knowing
whether
it
was
a
teammate
or
opponent
everyone
was
now
so
wet
and
the
rain
so
thick
he
could
hardly
tell
them
apart
with
the
first
flash
of
lightning
came
the
sound
of
Madam
hooch's
whistle
Harry
could
just
see
the
outline
of
Wood
through
the
thick
rain
gesturing
him
to
the
ground
the
whole
team
splashed
down
into
the
mud
i
called
for
timeout
wood
roared
at
his
team
come
on
under
here
they
huddled
at
the
edge
of
the
field
under
a
large
umbrella
Harry
took
off
his
glasses
and
wiped
them
hurriedly
on
his
robes
what's
the
score
we're
fifty
points
up
said
Wood
but
unless
we
get
the
Snitch
soon
we'll
be
playing
into
the
night
i've
got
no
chance
with
these
on
Harry
said
exasperatedly
waving
his
glasses
at
that
very
moment
Hermione
appeared
at
his
shoulder
she
was
holding
her
cloak
over
her
head
and
was
inexplicably
beaming
i've
had
an
idea
Harry
give
me
your
glasses
quick
he
handed
them
to
her
and
as
the
team
watched
in
amazement
Hermione
tapped
them
with
her
wand
and
said
Impervius
there
she
said
handing
them
back
to
Harry
they'll
repel
water
wood
looked
as
though
he
could
have
kissed
her
brilliant
he
called
hoarsely
after
her
as
she
disappeared
into
the
crowd
okay
team
let's
go
for
it
hermione's
spell
had
done
the
trick
harry
was
still
numb
with
cold
still
wetter
than
he'd
ever
been
in
his
life
but
he
could
see
full
of
fresh
determination
he
urged
his
broom
through
the
turbulent
air
staring
in
every
direction
for
the
Snitch
avoiding
a
Bludger
ducking
beneath
Diggory
who
was
streaking
in
the
opposite
direction
there
was
another
clap
of
thunder
followed
immediately
by
forked
lightning
this
was
getting
more
and
more
dangerous
harry
needed
to
get
the
Snitch
quickly
He
turned
intending
to
head
back
toward
the
middle
of
the
field
but
at
that
moment
another
flash
of
lightning
illuminated
the
stands
and
Harry
saw
something
that
distracted
him
completely
the
silhouette
of
an
enormous
shaggy
black
dog
clearly
imprinted
against
the
sky
motionless
in
the
topmost
empty
row
of
seats
harry's
numb
hands
slipped
on
the
broom
handle
and
his
Nimbus
dropped
a
few
feet
shaking
his
sodden
bangs
out
of
his
eyes
he
squinted
back
into
the
stands
the
dog
had
vanished
harry
came
wood's
anguished
yell
from
the
Gryffindor
goal
posts
harry
behind
you
harry
looked
wildly
around
cedric
Diggory
was
pelting
up
the
field
and
a
tiny
speck
of
gold
was
shimmering
in
the
rainfilled
air
between
them
With
a
jolt
of
panic
Harry
threw
himself
flat
to
the
broornhandle
and
zoomed
toward
the
Snitch
come
on
he
growled
at
his
Nimbus
as
the
rain
whipped
his
face
taster
but
something
odd
was
happening
an
eerie
silence
was
falling
across
the
stadium
the
wind
though
as
strong
as
ever
was
forgetting
to
roar
it
was
as
though
someone
had
turned
off
the
sound
as
though
Harry
had
gone
suddenly
deaf
what
was
going
on
and
then
a
horribly
familiar
wave
of
cold
swept
over
him
inside
him
just
as
he
became
aware
of
something
moving
on
the
field
below
before
he'd
had
time
to
think
Harry
had
taken
his
eyes
off
the
Snitch
and
looked
down
at
least
a
hundred
dementors
their
hidden
faces
pointing
up
at
him
were
standing
beneath
him
it
was
as
though
freezing
water
were
rising
in
his
chest
cutting
at
his
insides
and
then
he
heard
it
again
someone
was
screaming
screaming
inside
his
head
a
woman
not
Harry
not
Harry
please
not
Harry
stand
aside
you
silly
girl
stand
aside
now
not
Harry
please
no
take
me
kill
me
instead
numbing
swirling
white
mist
was
filling
harry's
brain
what
was
he
doing
why
was
he
flying
he
needed
to
help
her
she
was
going
to
die
she
was
going
to
be
murdered
he
was
falling
falling
through
the
icy
mist
not
Harry
please
have
mercy
have
mercy
a
shrill
voice
was
laughing
the
woman
was
screaming
and
Harry
knew
no
more
lucky
the
ground
was
so
soft
i
thought
he
was
dead
for
sure
but
he
didn't
even
break
his
glasses
harry
could
hear
the
voices
whispering
but
they
made
no
sense
whatsoever
he
didn't
have
a
clue
where
he
was
or
how
he'd
got
there
or
what
he'd
been
doing
before
he
got
there
all
he
knew
was
that
every
inch
of
him
was
aching
as
though
it
had
been
beaten
that
was
the
scariest
thing
i've
ever
seen
in
my
life
scariest
the
scariest
thing
hooded
black
figures
cold
screaming
harry's
eyes
snapped
open
he
was
lying
in
the
hospital
wing
the
Gryffindor
Quidditch
team
spattered
with
mud
from
head
to
foot
was
gathered
around
his
bed
ron
and
Hermione
were
also
there
looking
as
though
they'd
just
climbed
out
of
a
swimming
pool
harry
said
Fred
who
looked
extremely
white
underneath
the
mud
how're
you
feeling
it
was
as
though
harry's
memory
was
on
fast
forward
the
lightning
the
Grim
the
Snitch
and
the
dementors
what
happened
he
said
sitting
up
so
suddenly
they
all
gasped
you
fell
off
said
Fred
must've
been
what
fifty
feet
we
thought
you'd
died
said
Alicia
who
was
shaking
hermione
made
a
small
squeaky
noise
her
eyes
were
extremely
bloodshot
but
the
match
said
Harry
what
happened
are
we
doing
a
replay
no
one
said
anything
the
horrible
truth
sank
into
Harry
like
a
stone
we
didn't
lose
diggory
got
the
Snitch
said
George
just
after
you
fell
he
didn't
realize
what
had
happened
when
he
looked
back
and
saw
you
on
the
ground
he
tried
to
call
it
off
wanted
a
rematch
but
they
won
fair
and
square
even
Wood
admits
it
where
is
Wood
said
Harry
suddenly
realizing
he
wasn't
there
still
in
the
showers
said
Fred
we
think
he's
trying
to
drown
himself
harry
put
his
face
to
his
knees
his
hands
gripping
his
hair
fred
grabbed
his
shoulder
and
shook
it
roughly
c'mon
Harry
you've
never
missed
the
Snitch
before
there
had
to
be
one
time
you
didn't
get
it
said
George
it's
not
over
yet
said
Fred
we
lost
by
a
hundred
points
right
so
if
Hufflepuff
loses
to
Ravenclaw
and
we
beat
Ravenclaw
and
Slytherin
hufflepuff'll
have
to
lose
by
at
least
two
hundred
points
said
George
but
if
they
beat
Ravenclaw
no
Way
Ravenclaw
is
too
good
but
if
Slytherin
loses
against
Hufflepuff
it
all
depends
on
the
points
a
margin
of
a
hundred
either
way
harry
lay
there
not
saying
a
word
they
had
lost
for
the
first
time
ever
he
had
lost
a
Quidditch
match
after
ten
minutes
or
so
Madam
Pomfrey
came
over
to
tell
the
team
to
leave
him
in
peace
we'll
come
and
see
you
later
Fred
told
him
don't
beat
yourself
up
harry
you're
still
the
best
Seeker
we've
ever
had
the
team
trooped
out
trailing
mud
behind
them
madam
Pomfrey
shut
the
door
behind
them
looking
disapproving
ron
and
Hermione
moved
nearer
to
harry's
bed
dumbledore
was
really
angry
Hermione
said
in
a
quaking
voice
i've
never
seen
him
like
that
before
he
ran
onto
the
field
as
You
fell
waved
his
wand
and
you
sort
of
slowed
down
before
you
hit
the
ground
then
he
whirled
his
wand
at
the
dementors
shot
silver
stuff
at
them
they
left
the
stadium
right
away
he
was
furious
they'd
come
onto
the
grounds
we
heard
him
then
he
magicked
you
onto
a
stretcher
said
Ron
and
walked
up
to
school
with
you
floating
on
it
everyone
thought
you
were
his
voice
faded
but
Harry
hardly
noticed
he
was
thinking
about
what
the
dementors
had
done
to
him
about
the
screaming
voice
he
looked
up
and
saw
Ron
and
Hermione
lookin
at
him
so
anxiously
that
he
quickly
cast
around
for
something
matteroffact
to
say
did
someone
get
my
Nimbus
ron
and
Hermione
looked
quickly
at
each
other
er
what
said
Harry
looking
from
one
to
the
other
well
when
you
fell
off
it
got
blown
away
said
Hermione
hesitantly
and
and
it
hit
it
hit
oh
Harry
it
hit
the
Whomping
Willow
harry's
insides
lurched
the
Whomping
Willow
was
a
very
violent
tree
that
stood
alone
in
the
middle
of
the
grounds
and
he
said
dreading
the
answer
well
you
know
the
Whomping
Willow
said
Ron
it
it
doesn't
like
being
hit
professor
Flitwick
brought
it
back
just
before
you
came
around
said
Hermione
in
a
very
small
voice
slowly
she
reached
down
for
a
bag
at
her
feet
turned
it
upside
down
and
tipped
a
dozen
bits
of
splintered
wood
and
twig
onto
the
bed
the
only
remains
of
harry's
faithful
finally
beaten
broomstick
chapter
ten
the
marauder's
map
madam
Pomfrey
insisted
on
keeping
Harry
in
the
hospital
wing
for
the
rest
of
the
weekend
he
didn't
argue
or
complain
but
he
wouldn't
let
her
throw
away
the
shattered
remnants
of
his
Nimbus
Two
Thousand
he
knew
he
was
being
stupid
knew
that
the
Nimbus
was
beyond
repair
but
Harry
couldn't
help
it
he
felt
as
though
he'd
lost
one
of
his
best
friends
he
had
a
stream
of
visitors
all
intent
on
cheering
him
up
hagrid
sent
him
a
bunch
of
earwiggy
flowers
that
looked
like
yellow
cabbages
and
Ginny
Weasley
blushing
furiously
turned
up
with
a
getwell
card
she
had
made
herself
which
sang
shrilly
unless
Harry
kept
it
shut
under
his
bowl
of
fruit
the
Gryffindor
team
visited
again
on
Sunday
morning
this
time
accompanied
by
Wood
who
told
Harry
in
a
hollow
dead
sort
of
voice
that
he
didn't
blame
him
in
the
slightest
ron
and
Hermione
left
harry's
bedside
only
at
night
But
nothing
anyone
said
or
did
could
make
Harry
feel
any
better
because
they
knew
only
half
of
what
was
troubling
him
he
hadn't
told
anyone
about
the
Grim
not
even
Ron
and
Hermione
because
he
knew
Ron
would
panic
and
Hermione
would
scoff
the
fact
remained
however
that
it
had
now
appeared
twice
and
both
appearances
had
been
followed
by
nearfatal
accidents
the
first
time
he
had
nearly
been
run
over
by
the
Knight
Bus
the
second
fallen
fifty
feet
from
his
broomstick
was
the
Grim
going
to
haunt
him
until
he
actually
died
was
he
going
to
spend
the
rest
of
his
life
looking
over
his
shoulder
for
the
beast
and
then
there
were
the
dementors
harry
felt
sick
and
humiliated
every
time
he
thought
of
them
everyone
said
the
dementors
were
horrible
but
no
one
else
collapsed
every
time
they
went
near
one
no
one
else
heard
echoes
in
their
head
of
their
dying
parents
because
Harry
knew
who
that
screaming
voice
belonged
to
now
he
had
heard
her
words
heard
them
over
and
over
again
during
the
night
hours
in
the
hospital
wing
while
he
lay
awake
staring
at
the
strips
of
moonlight
on
the
ceiling
when
the
dementors
approached
him
he
heard
the
last
moments
of
his
mother's
life
her
attempts
to
protect
him
harry
from
Lord
Voldemort
and
voldemort's
laughter
before
he
murdered
her
harry
dozed
fitfully
sinking
into
dreams
full
of
clammy
rotted
hands
and
petrified
pleading
jerking
awake
to
dwell
again
on
his
mother's
voice
it
was
a
relief
to
return
to
the
noise
and
bustle
of
the
main
school
on
Monday
where
he
was
forced
to
think
about
other
things
eve
if
he
had
to
endure
Draco
Malfoys
taunting
malfoy
was
almost
beside
himself
with
glee
at
gryffindor's
defeat
he
had
finally
taken
off
his
bandages
and
celebrated
having
the
full
use
of
both
arms
again
by
doing
spirited
imitations
of
Harry
falling
off
his
broom
malfoy
spent
much
of
their
next
Potions
class
doing
dementor
imitations
across
the
dungeon
Ron
finally
cracked
and
flung
a
large
slippery
crocodile
heart
at
Malfoy
which
hit
him
in
the
face
and
caused
Snape
to
take
fifty
points
from
Gryffindor
if
snape's
teaching
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
again
i'm
skiving
off
said
Ron
as
they
headed
toward
lupin's
classroom
after
lunch
check
who's
in
there
Hermione
hermione
peered
around
the
classroom
door
it's
okay
professor
Lupin
was
back
at
work
it
certainly
looked
as
though
he
had
been
ill
his
old
robes
were
hanging
more
loosely
on
him
and
there
were
dark
shadows
beneath
his
eyes
nevertheless
he
smiled
at
the
class
as
they
took
their
seats
and
they
burst
at
once
into
an
explosion
of
complaints
about
snape's
behavior
while
Lupin
had
been
ill
it's
not
fair
he
was
only
filling
in
why
should
he
give
us
homework
we
don't
know
anything
about
werewolves
two
rolls
of
parchment
did
you
tell
Professor
Snape
we
haven't
covered
them
yet
lupin
asked
frowning
slightly
the
babble
broke
out
again
yes
but
he
said
we
were
really
behind
he
wouldn't
listen
two
rolls
of
parchment
professor
Lupin
smiled
at
the
look
of
indignation
on
every
face
don't
worry
i'll
speak
to
Professor
Snape
you
don't
have
to
do
the
essay
oh
no
said
Hermione
looking
very
disappointed
i've
already
finished
it
they
had
a
very
enjoyable
lesson
professor
Lupin
had
brought
along
a
glass
box
containing
a
hinkypunk
a
little
onelegged
creature
who
looked
as
though
he
were
made
of
wisps
of
smoke
rather
frail
and
harmless
looking
lures
travelers
into
bogs
said
Professor
Lupin
as
they
took
notes
you
notice
the
lantern
dangling
from
his
hand
hops
ahead
people
follow
the
light
then
the
hinkypunk
made
a
horrible
squelching
noise
against
the
glass
when
the
bell
rang
everyone
gathered
up
their
things
and
headed
for
the
door
Harry
among
them
but
Wait
a
moment
Harry
Lupin
called
i'd
like
a
word
harry
doubled
back
and
watched
Professor
Lupin
covering
the
hinkypunk's
box
with
a
cloth
i
heard
about
the
match
said
Lupin
turning
back
to
his
desk
and
starting
to
pile
books
into
his
briefcase
and
i'm
sorry
about
your
broomstick
is
there
any
chance
of
fixing
it
no
said
Harry
the
tree
smashed
it
to
bits
lupin
sighed
they
planted
the
Whomping
Willow
the
same
year
that
I
arrived
at
Hogwarts
people
used
to
play
a
game
trying
to
get
near
enough
to
touch
the
trunk
in
the
end
a
boy
called
Davey
Gudgeon
nearly
lost
an
eye
and
we
were
forbidden
to
go
near
it
no
broomstick
would
have
a
chance
did
you
hear
about
the
dementors
too
said
Harry
with
difficulty
lupin
looked
at
him
quickly
yes
I
did
i
don't
think
any
of
us
have
seen
Professor
Dumbledore
that
angry
they
have
been
growing
restless
for
some
time
furious
at
his
refusal
to
let
them
inside
the
grounds
i
suppose
they
were
the
reason
you
fell
yes
said
Harry
he
hesitated
and
then
the
question
he
had
to
ask
burst
from
him
before
he
could
stop
himself
why
why
do
they
affect
me
like
that
am
I
just
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
weakness
said
Professor
Lupin
sharply
as
though
he
had
read
harry's
mind
the
dementors
affect
you
worse
than
the
others
because
there
are
horrors
in
your
past
that
the
others
don't
have
a
ray
of
wintery
sunlight
fell
across
the
classroom
illuminating
lupin's
gray
hairs
and
the
lines
on
his
young
face
dementors
are
among
the
foulest
creatures
that
walk
this
earth
they
infest
the
darkest
filthiest
places
they
glory
in
decay
and
despair
they
drain
peace
hope
and
happiness
out
of
the
air
around
them
even
Muggles
feel
their
presence
though
they
can't
see
them
get
too
near
a
dementor
and
every
good
feeling
every
happy
memory
will
be
sucked
out
of
you
if
it
can
the
dementor
will
feed
on
you
long
enough
to
reduce
you
to
something
like
itself
soulless
and
evil
you'll
be
left
with
nothing
but
the
worst
experiences
of
your
life
and
the
worst
that
happened
to
you
Harry
is
enough
to
make
anyone
fall
off
their
broom
you
have
nothing
to
feel
ashamed
of
when
they
get
near
me
Harry
stared
at
lupin's
desk
his
throat
tight
i
can
hear
Voldemort
murdering
my
mum
lupin
made
a
sudden
motion
with
his
arm
as
though
to
grip
harry's
shoulder
but
thought
better
of
it
there
was
a
moment's
Silence
then
Why
did
they
have
to
come
to
the
match
said
Harry
bitterly
they're
getting
hungry
said
Lupin
coolly
shutting
his
briefcase
with
a
snap
dumbledore
won't
let
them
into
the
school
so
their
supply
of
human
prey
has
dried
up
i
don't
think
they
could
resist
the
large
crowd
around
the
Quidditch
field
all
that
excitement
emotions
running
high
it
was
their
idea
of
a
feast
azkaban
must
be
terrible
Harry
muttered
lupin
nodded
grimly
the
fortress
is
set
on
a
tiny
island
way
out
to
sea
but
they
don't
need
walls
and
water
to
keep
the
prisoners
in
not
when
they're
all
trapped
inside
their
own
heads
incapable
of
a
single
cheery
thought
most
of
them
go
mad
within
weeks
but
Sirius
Black
escaped
from
them
Harry
said
slowly
he
got
away
lupin's
briefcase
slipped
from
the
desk
he
had
to
stoop
quickly
to
catch
it
yes
he
said
straightening
up
Black
must
have
found
a
way
to
fight
them
i
wouldn't
have
believed
it
possible
dementors
are
supposed
to
drain
a
wizard
of
his
powers
if
he
is
left
with
them
too
long
you
made
that
dementor
on
the
train
back
off
said
Harry
suddenly
there
are
certain
defenses
one
can
use
said
Lupin
but
there
was
only
one
dementor
on
the
train
the
more
there
are
the
more
difficult
it
becomes
to
resist
what
defenses
said
Harry
at
once
can
you
teach
me
i
don't
pretend
to
be
an
expert
at
fighting
dementors
Harry
quite
the
contrary
but
if
the
dementors
come
to
another
Quidditch
match
I
need
to
be
able
to
fight
them
lupin
looked
into
harry's
determined
face
hesitated
then
said
well
all
right
i'll
try
and
help
but
it'll
have
to
wait
until
next
term
i'm
afraid
i
have
a
lot
to
do
before
the
holidays
i
chose
a
very
inconvenient
time
to
fall
ill
what
with
the
promise
of
antidementor
lessons
from
Lupin
the
thought
that
he
might
never
have
to
hear
his
mother's
death
again
and
the
fact
that
Ravenclaw
flattened
Hufflepuff
in
their
Quidditch
match
at
the
end
of
November
harry's
mood
took
a
definite
upturn
gryffindor
were
not
out
of
the
running
after
all
although
they
could
not
afford
to
lose
another
match
wood
became
repossessed
of
his
manic
energy
and
worked
his
team
as
hard
as
ever
in
the
chilly
haze
of
rain
that
persisted
into
December
harry
saw
no
hint
of
a
dementor
within
the
grounds
dumbledore's
anger
seemed
to
be
keeping
them
at
their
stations
at
the
entrances
two
weeks
before
the
end
of
the
term
the
sky
lightened
suddenly
to
a
dazzling
opaline
white
and
the
muddy
grounds
were
revealed
one
morning
covered
in
glittering
frost
inside
the
castle
there
was
a
buzz
of
Christmas
in
the
air
professor
Flitwick
the
Charms
teacher
had
already
decorated
his
classroom
with
shimmering
lights
that
turned
out
to
be
real
fluttering
fairies
the
students
were
all
happily
discussing
their
plans
for
the
holidays
both
Ron
and
Hermione
had
decided
to
remain
at
Hogwarts
and
though
Ron
said
it
was
because
he
couldn't
stand
two
weeks
with
Percy
and
Hermione
insisted
she
needed
to
use
the
library
Harry
wasn't
fooled
they
were
doing
it
to
keep
him
company
and
he
was
very
grateful
to
everyone's
delight
except
harry's
there
was
to
be
another
Hogsmeade
trip
on
the
very
last
weekend
of
the
term
we
can
do
all
our
Christmas
shopping
there
said
Hermione
mum
and
Dad
would
really
love
those
Toothflossing
Stringmints
from
Honeydukes
resigned
to
the
fact
that
he
would
be
the
only
third
year
staying
behind
again
Harry
borrowed
a
copy
of
Which
Broomstick
from
Wood
and
decided
to
spend
the
day
reading
up
on
the
different
makes
he
had
been
riding
one
of
the
school
brooms
at
team
practice
an
ancient
Shooting
Star
which
was
very
slow
and
jerky
he
definitely
needed
a
new
broom
of
his
own
on
the
Saturday
morning
of
the
Hogsmeade
trip
Harry
bid
goodbye
to
Ron
and
Hermione
who
were
wrapped
in
cloaks
and
scarves
then
turned
up
the
marble
staircase
alone
and
headed
back
toward
Gryffindor
Tower
snow
had
started
to
fall
outside
the
windows
and
the
castle
was
very
still
and
quiet
psst
Harry
he
turned
halfway
along
the
thirdfloor
corridor
to
see
Fred
and
George
peering
out
at
him
from
behind
a
statue
of
a
humpbacked
oneeyed
witch
what
are
you
doing
said
Harry
curiously
how
come
you're
not
going
to
Hogsmeade
we've
come
to
give
you
a
bit
of
festive
cheer
before
we
go
said
Fred
with
a
mysterious
wink
come
in
here
he
nodded
toward
an
empty
classroom
to
the
left
of
the
oneeyed
statue
harry
followed
Fred
and
George
inside
george
closed
the
door
quietly
and
then
turned
beaming
to
look
at
Harry
early
Christmas
present
for
you
Harry
he
said
fred
pulled
something
from
inside
his
cloak
with
a
flourish
and
laid
it
on
one
of
the
desks
it
was
a
large
square
very
worn
piece
of
parchment
with
nothing
written
on
it
harry
suspecting
one
of
Fred
and
george's
jokes
stared
at
it
what's
that
supposed
to
be
this
Harry
is
the
secret
of
our
success
said
George
patting
the
parchment
fondly
it's
a
wrench
giving
it
to
you
said
Fred
but
we
decided
last
night
your
need's
greater
than
ours
anyway
we
know
it
by
heart
said
George
we
bequeath
it
to
you
we
don't
really
need
it
anymore
and
what
do
I
need
with
a
bit
of
old
parchment
said
Harry
a
bit
of
old
parchment
said
Fred
closing
his
eyes
with
a
grimace
as
though
Harry
had
mortally
offended
him
explain
George
well
when
we
were
in
our
first
year
Harry
young
carefree
and
innocent
harry
snorted
he
doubted
whether
Fred
and
George
had
ever
been
innocent
well
more
innocent
than
we
are
now
we
got
into
a
spot
of
bother
with
Filch
we
let
off
a
Dungbomb
in
the
corridor
and
it
upset
him
for
some
reason
so
he
hauled
us
off
to
his
office
and
started
threatening
us
with
the
usual
detention
disembowelment
and
we
couldn't
help
noticing
a
drawer
in
one
of
his
filing
cabinets
marked
Confiscated
and
Highly
Dangerous
don't
tell
me
said
Harry
starting
to
grin
well
what
would
you've
done
said
Fred
george
caused
a
diversion
by
dropping
another
Dungbomb
I
whipped
the
drawer
open
and
grabbed
this
it's
not
as
bad
as
it
sounds
you
know
said
George
we
don't
reckon
Filch
ever
found
out
how
to
work
it
he
probably
suspected
what
it
was
though
or
he
wouldn't
have
confiscated
it
and
you
know
how
to
work
it
oh
yes
said
Fred
smirking
this
little
beauty's
taught
us
more
than
all
the
teachers
in
this
school
you're
winding
me
up
said
Harry
looking
at
the
ragged
old
bit
of
parchment
oh
are
we
said
George
he
took
out
his
wand
touched
the
parchment
lightly
and
said
I
solemnly
swear
that
I
am
up
to
no
good
and
at
once
thin
ink
lines
began
to
spread
like
a
spider's
web
from
the
point
that
george's
wand
had
touched
they
joined
each
other
they
crisscrossed
they
fanned
into
every
corner
of
the
parchment
then
words
began
to
blossom
across
the
top
great
curly
green
words
that
proclaimed
messrs
moony
Wormtail
Padfoot
and
Prongs
Purveyors
of
Aids
to
Magical
MischiefMakers
are
proud
to
present
the
marauder's
map
It
was
a
map
showing
every
detail
of
the
Hogwarts
castle
and
grounds
but
the
truly
remarkable
thing
were
the
tiny
ink
dots
moving
around
it
each
labeled
with
a
name
in
minuscule
writing
astounded
Harry
bent
over
it
a
labeled
dot
in
the
top
left
corner
showed
that
Professor
Dumbledore
was
pacing
his
study
the
caretaker's
cat
Mrs
norris
was
prowling
the
second
floor
and
Peeves
the
Poltergeist
was
currently
bouncing
around
the
trophy
room
and
as
harry's
eyes
traveled
up
and
down
the
familiar
corridors
he
noticed
something
else
this
map
showed
a
set
of
passages
he
had
never
entered
and
many
of
them
seemed
to
lead
Right
into
Hogsmeade
said
Fred
tracing
one
of
them
with
his
finger
there
are
seven
in
all
now
Filch
knows
about
these
four
he
pointed
them
out
but
we're
sure
we're
the
only
ones
who
know
about
these
don't
bother
with
the
one
behind
the
mirror
on
the
fourth
floor
we
used
it
until
last
winter
but
it's
caved
in
completely
blocked
and
we
don't
reckon
anyone's
ever
used
this
one
because
the
Whomping
willow's
planted
right
over
the
entrance
but
this
one
here
this
one
leads
right
into
the
cellar
of
Honeydukes
we've
used
it
loads
of
times
and
as
you
might've
noticed
the
entrance
is
right
outside
this
room
through
that
oneeyed
old
crone's
hump
moony
Wormtaill
Padfoot
and
Prongs
sighed
George
patting
the
heading
of
the
map
we
owe
them
so
much
noble
men
working
tirelessly
to
help
a
new
generation
of
lawbreakers
said
Fred
solemnly
right
said
George
briskly
don't
forget
to
wipe
it
after
you've
used
it
or
anyone
can
read
it
Fred
said
warningly
just
tap
it
again
and
say
Mischief
managed
and
it'll
go
blank
so
young
Harry
said
Fred
in
an
uncanny
impersonation
of
Percy
mind
you
behave
yourself
see
you
in
Honeydukes
said
George
winking
they
left
the
room
both
smirking
in
a
satisfied
sort
of
way
harry
stood
there
gazing
at
the
miraculous
map
he
watched
the
tiny
ink
Mrs
norris
turn
left
and
pause
to
sniff
at
something
on
the
floor
if
Filch
really
didn't
know
he
wouldn't
have
to
pass
the
dementors
at
all
but
even
as
he
stood
there
flooded
with
excitement
something
Harry
had
once
heard
mr.
Weasley
say
came
floating
out
of
his
memory
never
trust
anything
that
can
think
for
itself
if
you
can't
see
where
it
keeps
its
brain
this
map
was
one
of
those
dangerous
magical
objects
mr.
Weasley
had
been
warning
against
aids
for
Magical
Mischief
Makers
but
then
Harry
reasoned
he
only
wanted
to
use
it
to
get
into
Hogsmeade
it
wasn't
as
though
he
wanted
to
steal
anything
or
attack
anyone
and
Fred
and
George
had
been
using
it
for
years
without
anything
horrible
happening
harry
traced
the
secret
passage
to
Honeydukes
with
his
finger
then
quite
suddenly
as
though
following
orders
he
rolled
up
the
map
stuffed
it
inside
his
robes
and
hurried
to
the
door
of
the
classroom
he
opened
it
a
couple
of
inches
there
was
no
one
outside
very
carefully
he
edged
out
of
the
room
and
behind
the
statue
of
the
oneeyed
witch
what
did
he
have
to
do
he
pulled
out
the
map
again
and
saw
to
his
astonishment
that
a
new
ink
figure
had
appeared
upon
it
labeled
Harry
Potter
this
figure
was
standing
exactly
where
the
real
Harry
was
standing
about
halfway
down
the
thirdfloor
corridor
harry
watched
carefully
his
little
Ink
self
appeared
to
be
tapping
the
witch
with
his
minute
wand
harry
quickly
took
out
his
real
wand
and
tapped
the
statue
nothing
happened
he
looked
back
at
the
map
the
tiniest
speech
bubble
had
appeared
next
to
his
figure
the
word
inside
said
Dissendium
dissendium
harry
whispered
tapping
the
stone
witch
again
at
once
the
statue's
hump
opened
wide
enough
to
admit
a
fairly
thin
person
harry
glanced
quickly
up
and
down
the
corridor
then
tucked
the
map
away
again
hoisted
himself
into
the
hole
headfirst
and
pushed
himself
forward
he
slid
a
considerable
way
down
what
felt
like
a
stone
slide
then
landed
on
cold
damp
earth
he
stood
up
looking
around
it
was
pitch
dark
he
held
up
his
wand
muttered
Lumos
and
saw
that
he
was
in
a
very
narrow
low
earthy
passageway
he
raised
the
map
tapped
it
with
the
tip
of
his
wand
and
muttered
Mischief
managed
the
map
went
blank
at
once
he
folded
it
carefully
tucked
it
inside
his
robes
then
heart
beating
fast
both
excited
and
apprehensive
he
set
off
the
passage
twisted
and
turned
more
like
the
burrow
of
a
giant
rabbit
than
anything
else
harry
hurried
along
it
stumbling
now
and
then
on
the
uneven
floor
holding
his
wand
out
in
front
of
him
it
took
ages
but
Harry
had
the
thought
of
Honeydukes
to
sustain
him
after
what
felt
like
an
hour
the
passage
began
to
rise
panting
Harry
sped
up
his
face
hot
his
feet
very
cold
ten
minutes
later
he
came
to
the
foot
of
some
worn
stone
steps
which
rose
out
of
sight
above
him
careful
not
to
make
any
noise
Harry
began
to
climb
a
hundred
steps
two
hundred
steps
he
lost
count
as
he
climbed
watching
his
feet
then
without
warning
his
head
hit
something
hard
it
seemed
to
be
a
trapdoor
harry
stood
there
massaging
the
top
of
his
head
listening
he
couldn't
hear
any
sounds
above
him
very
slowly
he
pushed
the
trapdoor
open
and
peered
over
the
edge
he
was
in
a
cellar
which
was
full
of
wooden
crates
and
boxes
harry
climbed
out
of
the
trapdoor
and
replaced
it
it
blended
so
perfectly
with
the
dusty
floor
that
it
was
impossible
to
tell
it
was
there
harry
crept
slowly
toward
the
wooden
staircase
that
led
upstairs
now
he
could
definitely
hear
voices
not
to
mention
the
tinkle
of
a
bell
and
the
opening
and
shutting
of
a
door
wondering
what
he
ought
to
do
he
suddenly
heard
a
door
open
much
closer
at
hand
somebody
was
about
to
come
downstairs
and
get
another
box
of
Jelly
Slugs
dear
they've
nearly
cleaned
us
out
said
a
woman's
voice
a
pair
of
feet
was
coming
down
the
staircase
harry
leapt
behind
an
enormous
crate
and
waited
for
the
footsteps
to
pass
he
heard
the
man
shifting
boxes
against
the
opposite
wall
he
might
not
get
another
chance
Quickly
and
silently
Harry
dodged
out
from
his
hiding
place
and
climbed
the
stairs
looking
back
he
saw
an
enormous
backside
and
shiny
bald
head
buried
in
a
box
harry
reached
the
door
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
slipped
through
it
and
found
himself
behind
the
counter
of
Honeydukes
he
ducked
crept
sideways
and
then
straightened
up
honeydukes
was
so
crowded
with
Hogwarts
students
that
no
one
looked
twice
at
Harry
he
edged
among
them
looking
around
and
suppressed
a
laugh
as
he
imagined
the
look
that
would
spread
over
dudley's
piggy
face
if
he
could
see
where
Harry
was
now
there
were
shelves
upon
shelves
of
the
most
succulentlooking
sweets
imaginable
creamy
chunks
of
nougat
shimmering
pink
squares
of
coconut
ice
fat
honeycolored
toffees
hundreds
of

harry
squeezed
himself
through
a
crowd
of
sixth
years
and
saw
a
sign
hanging
in
the
farthest
corner
of
the
shop
unusual
tastes
ron
and
Hermione
were
standing
underneath
it
examining
a
tray
of
bloodflavored
lollipops
harry
sneaked
up
behind
them
ugh
no
Harry
won't
want
one
of
those
they're
for
vampires
I
expect
Hermione
was
saying
how
about
these
said
Ron
shoving
a
jar
of
Cockroach
Clusters
under
hermione's
nose
definitely
not
said
Harry
ron
nearly
dropped
the
jar
harry
squealed
Hermione
what
are
you
doing
here
how
how
did
you
wow
said
Ron
looking
very
impressed
you've
learned
to
Apparate
course
I
haven't
said
Harry
he
dropped
his
voice
so
that
none
of
the
sixth
years
could
hear
him
and
told
them
all
about
the
marauder's
Map
how
come
Fred
and
George
never
gave
it
to
me
said
Ron
outraged
i'm
their
brother
but
Harry
isn't
going
to
keep
it
said
Hermione
as
though
the
idea
were
ludicrous
he's
going
to
hand
it
in
to
Professor
McGonagall
aren't
you
Harry
no
i'm
not
said
Harry
are
you
mad
said
Ron
goggling
at
Hermione
hand
in
something
that
good
if
I
hand
it
in
i'll
have
to
say
where
I
got
it
filch
would
know
Fred
and
George
had
nicked
it
but
what
about
Sirius
Black
hermione
hissed
he
could
be
using
one
of
the
passages
on
that
map
to
get
into
the
castle
the
teachers
have
got
to
know
he
can't
be
getting
in
through
a
passage
said
Harry
quickly
there
are
seven
secret
tunnels
on
the
map
right
fred
and
George
reckon
Filch
already
knows
about
four
of
them
and
of
the
other
three
one
of
them's
caved
in
so
no
one
can
get
through
it
one
of
them's
got
the
Whomping
Willow
planted
over
the
entrance
so
you
can't
get
out
of
it
and
the
one
I
just
came
through
well
it's
really
hard
to
see
the
entrance
to
it
down
in
the
cellar
so
unless
he
knew
it
was
there
harry
hesistated
what
if
Black
did
know
the
passage
was
there
ron
however
cleared
his
throat
significantly
and
pointed
to
a
notice
pasted
on
the
inside
of
the
sweetshop
door
by
order
of
the
ministry
of
magic
Customers
are
reminded
that
until
further
notice
dementors
will
be
patrolling
the
streets
of
Hogsmeade
every
night
after
sundown
this
measure
has
been
put
in
place
for
the
safety
of
Hogsmeade
residents
and
will
be
lifted
upon
the
recapture
of
Sirius
Black
it
is
therefore
advisable
that
you
complete
your
shopping
well
before
nightfall
merry
Christmas
see
said
Ron
quietly
i'd
like
to
see
Black
try
and
break
into
Honeydukes
with
dementors
swarming
all
over
the
village
anyway
hermione
the
Honeydukes
owners
would
hear
a
breakin
wouldn't
they
they
live
over
the
shop
yes
but
but
Hermoine
seemed
to
be
struggling
to
find
another
problem
look
Harry
still
shouldn't
be
coming
into
Hogsmeade
he
hasn't
got
a
signed
form
if
anyone
finds
out
he'll
be
in
so
much
trouble
and
it's
not
nightfall
yet
what
if
Sirius
Black
turns
up
today
now
he'd
have
a
job
spotting
Harry
in
this
said
Ron
nodding
through
the
mullioned
windows
at
the
thick
swirling
snow
come
on
Hermione
it's
Christmas
harry
deserves
a
break
hermione
bit
her
lip
looking
extremely
worried
are
you
going
to
report
me
harry
asked
her
grinning
oh
of
course
not
but
honestly
Harry
seen
the
Fizzing
Whizbees
Harry
said
Ron
grabbing
him
and
leading
him
over
to
their
barrel
and
the
Jelly
Slugs
and
the
Acid
Pops
fred
gave
me
one
of
those
when
I
was
seven
it
burnt
a
hole
right
through
my
tongue
i
remember
Mum
walloping
him
with
her
broomstick
ron
stared
broodingly
into
the
Acid
Pop
box
reckon
fred'd
take
a
bit
of
Cockroach
Cluster
if
I
told
him
they
were
peanuts
when
Ron
and
Hermione
had
paid
for
all
their
sweets
the
three
of
them
left
Honeydukes
for
the
blizzard
outside
hogsmeade
looked
like
a
Christmas
card
the
little
thatched
cottages
and
shops
were
all
covered
in
a
layer
of
crisp
snow
there
were
holly
wreaths
on
the
doors
and
strings
of
enchanted
candles
hanging
in
the
trees
harry
shivered
unlike
the
other
two
he
didn't
have
his
cloak
they
headed
up
the
street
heads
bowed
against
the
wind
Ron
and
Hermione
shouting
through
their
scarves
that's
the
post
office
zonko's
is
up
there
we
could
go
up
to
the
Shrieking
Shack
tell
you
what
said
Ron
his
teeth
chattering
shall
we
go
for
a
butterbeer
in
the
Three
Broomsticks
harry
was
more
than
willing
the
wind
was
fierce
and
his
hands
were
freezing
so
they
crossed
the
road
and
in
a
few
minutes
were
entering
the
tiny
inn
it
was
extremely
crowded
noisy
warm
and
smoky
a
curvy
sort
of
woman
with
a
pretty
face
was
serving
a
bunch
of
rowdy
warlock
up
at
the
bar
that's
Madam
Rosmerta
said
Ron
i'll
get
the
drinks
shall
I
he
added
going
slightly
red
harry
and
Hermione
made
their
way
to
the
back
of
the
room
her
there
was
a
small
vacant
table
between
the
window
and
a
handsome
Christmas
tree
which
stood
next
to
the
fireplace
ron
came
back
five
minutes
later
carrying
three
foaming
tankards
of
hot
butterbeer
merry
Christmas
he
said
happily
raising
his
tankard
harry
drank
deeply
it
was
the
most
delicious
thing
he'd
ever
tasted
and
seemed
to
heat
every
bit
of
him
from
the
inside
a
sudden
breeze
ruffled
his
hair
the
door
of
the
Three
Broomsticks
had
opened
again
harry
looked
over
the
rim
of
his
tankard
and
choked
professors
McGonagall
and
Flitwick
had
just
entered
the
pub
with
a
flurry
of
snowflakes
shortly
followed
by
Hagrid
who
was
deep
in
conversation
with
a
portly
man
in
a
limegreen
bowler
hat
and
a
pinstriped
cloak
Cornelius
Fudge
Minister
of
Magic
in
an
instant
Ron
and
Hermione
had
both
placed
hands
on
the
top
of
harry's
head
and
forced
him
off
his
stool
and
under
the
table
dripping
with
butterbeer
and
crouching
out
of
sight
Harry
clutched
his
empty
tankard
and
watched
the
teachers
and
fudge's
feet
move
toward
the
bar
pause
then
turn
and
walk
right
toward
him
somewhere
above
him
Hermione
whispered
Mobiliarbus
the
Christmas
tree
beside
their
table
rose
a
few
inches
off
the
ground
drifted
sideways
and
landed
with
a
soft
thump
right
in
front
of
their
table
hiding
them
from
view
staring
through
the
dense
lower
branches
harry
saw
four
sets
of
chair
legs
move
back
from
the
table
right
beside
theirs
then
heard
the
grunts
and
sighs
If
the
teachers
and
minister
as
they
sat
down
next
he
saw
another
pair
of
feet
wearing
sparkly
turquoise
high
heels
and
heard
a
woman's
voice
a
small
gillywater
mine
said
Professor
mcgonagall's
voice
four
pints
of
mulled
mead
ta
Rosmerta
said
Hagrid
a
cherry
syrup
and
soda
with
ice
and
umbrella
mmm
said
Professor
Flitwick
smacking
his
lips
so
you'll
be
the
red
currant
rum
Minister
thank
you
Rosmerta
m'dear
said
fudge's
voice
lovely
to
see
you
again
I
must
say
have
one
yourself
won't
you
come
and
join
us
well
thank
you
very
much
Minister
harry
watched
the
glittering
heels
march
away
and
back
again
his
heart
was
pounding
uncomfortably
in
his
throat
why
hadn't
it
occurred
to
him
that
this
was
the
last
weekend
of
term
for
the
teachers
to
And
how
long
were
they
going
to
sit
there
he
needed
time
to
sneak
back
into
Honeydukes
if
he
wanted
to
return
to
school
tonight
hermione's
leg
gave
a
nervous
twitch
next
to
him
so
what
brings
you
to
this
neck
of
the
woods
Minister
came
Madam
rosmerta's
voice
harry
saw
the
lower
part
of
fudge's
thick
body
twist
in
his
chair
as
though
he
were
checking
for
eavesdroppers
then
he
said
in
a
quiet
voice
What
else
m'dear
but
Sirius
Black
i
daresay
you
heard
what
happened
up
at
the
school
at
Halloween
i
did
hear
a
rumor
admitted
Madam
Rosmerta
did
you
tell
the
whole
pub
Hagrid
said
Professor
McGonagall
exasperatedly
do
you
think
Blacks
still
in
the
area
Minister
whispered
Madam
Rosmerta
i'm
sure
of
it
said
Fudge
shortly
you
know
that
the
dementors
have
searched
the
whole
village
twjce
said
Madam
Rosmerta
a
slight
edge
to
her
voice
scared
all
my
customers
away
it's
very
bad
for
business
Minister
rosmerta
dear
I
don't
like
them
any
more
than
you
do
said
Fudge
uncomfortably
necessary
precaution
unfortunate
but
there
you
are
i've
just
met
some
of
them
they're
in
a
fury
against
Dumbledore
he
won't
let
them
inside
the
castle
grounds
i
should
think
not
said
Professor
McGonagall
sharply
how
are
we
supposed
to
teach
with
those
horrors
floating
around
hear
hear
squeaked
tiny
Professor
Flitwick
whose
feet
were
dangling
a
foot
from
the
ground
all
the
same
demurred
Fudge
they
are
here
to
protect
you
all
from
something
much
worse
we
all
know
what
black's
capable
of
do
you
know
I
still
have
trouble
believing
it
said
Madam
Rosmerta
thoughtfully
of
all
the
people
to
go
over
to
the
Dark
Side
Sirius
Black
was
the
last
i'd
have
thought
i
mean
I
remember
him
when
he
was
a
boy
at
Hogwarts
if
you'd
told
me
then
what
he
was
going
to
become
i'd
have
said
you'd
had
too
much
mead
you
don't
know
the
half
of
it
Rosmerta
said
Fudge
gruffly
the
worst
he
did
isn't
widely
known
the
worst
said
Madam
Rosmerta
her
voice
alive
with
curiosity
Worse
than
murdering
all
those
poor
people
you
mean
i
certainly
do
said
Fudge
i
ca'a
believe
that
what
could
possibly
be
worse
you
say
you
remember
him
at
Hogwarts
Rosmerta
mur
mured
Professor
McGonagall
do
you
remember
who
hisbest
friend
was
naturally
said
Madam
Rosmerta
with
a
small
laugh
never
saw
one
without
the
other
did
you
the
number
of
times
I
had
them
in
here
ooh
they
used
to
make
me
laugh
quite
the
double
act
Sirius
Black
and
James
Potter
harry
dropped
his
tankard
with
a
loud
clunk
ron
kicked
him
precisely
said
Professor
McGonagall
black
and
Potter
ringleaders
of
their
little
gang
both
very
bright
of
course
exceptionally
bright
in
fact
but
I
don't
think
we've
ever
had
such
a
pair
of
troublemakers
i
dunno
chuckled
Hagrid
fred
and
George
Weasley
could
give
em
a
run
fer
their
money
you'd
have
thought
Black
and
Potter
were
brothers
chimed
in
Professor
Flitwick
inseparable
of
course
they
were
said
Fudge
potter
trusted
Black
beyond
all
his
other
friends
nothing
changed
when
they
left
school
black
was
best
man
when
James
married
Lily
then
they
named
him
godfather
to
Harry
harry
has
no
idea
of
course
you
can
imagine
how
the
idea
would
torment
him
because
Black
turned
out
to
be
in
league
with
YouKnowWho
whispered
Madam
Rosmerta
worse
even
than
that
rn'dear
fudge
dropped
his
voice
and
proceeded
in
a
sort
of
low
rumble
not
many
people
are
aware
that
the
Potters
knew
YouKnowWho
was
after
them
dumbledore
who
was
of
course
working
tirelessly
against
YouKnowWho
had
a
number
of
useful
spies
one
of
them
tipped
him
off
and
he
alerted
James
and
Lily
at
once
he
advised
them
to
go
into
hiding
well
of
course
YouKnowWho
wasn't
an
easy
person
to
hide
from
dumbledore
told
them
that
their
best
chance
was
the
Fidelius
Charm
how
does
that
work
said
Madam
Rosmerta
breathless
with
interest
professor
Flitwick
cleared
his
throat
an
immensely
complex
spell
he
said
squeakily
involving
the
magical
concealment
of
a
secret
inside
a
single
living
soul
the
information
is
hidden
inside
the
chosen
person
or
SecretKeeper
and
is
henceforth
impossible
to
find
unless
of
course
the
SecretKeeper
chooses
to
divulge
it
as
long
as
the
SecretKeeper
refused
to
speak
YouKnowWho
could
search
the
village
where
Lily
and
James
were
staying
for
years
and
never
find
them
not
even
if
he
had
his
nose
pressed
against
their
sitting
room
window
so
Black
was
the
Potters
SecretKeeper
whispered
Madam
Rosmerta
naturally
said
Professor
McGonagall
james
Potter
told
Dumbledore
that
Black
would
die
rather
than
tell
where
they
were
that
Black
was
planning
to
go
into
hiding
himself
and
yet
Dumbledore
remained
worried
i
remember
him
offering
to
be
the
Potters
SecretKeeper
himself
he
suspected
Black
gasped
Madam
Rosmerta
he
was
sure
that
somebody
close
to
the
Potters
had
been
keeping
YouKnowWho
informed
of
their
movements
said
Professor
McGonagall
darkly
indeed
he
had
suspected
for
some
time
that
someone
on
our
side
had
turned
traitor
and
was
passing
a
lot
of
information
to
YouKnowWho
but
James
Potter
insisted
on
using
Black
he
did
said
Fudge
heavily
and
then
barely
a
week
after
the
Fidelius
Charm
had
been
performed
Black
betrayed
them
breathed
Madam
Rosmerta
he
did
indeed
black
was
tired
of
his
doubleagent
role
he
was
ready
to
declare
his
support
openly
for
YouKnowWho
and
he
seems
to
have
planned
this
for
the
moment
of
the
Potters
death
but
as
we
all
know
youKnowWho
met
his
downfall
in
little
Harry
Potter
powers
gone
horribly
weakened
he
fled
and
this
left
Black
in
a
very
nasty
position
indeed
his
master
had
fallen
at
the
very
moment
when
he
Black
had
shown
his
true
colors
as
a
traitor
he
had
no
choice
but
to
run
for
it
filthy
stinkin
turncoat
hagrid
said
so
loudly
that
half
the
bar
went
quiet
shh
said
Professor
McGonagall
i
met
him
growled
Hagrid
i
musta
bin
the
last
ter
see
him
before
he
killed
all
them
people
it
was
me
what
rescued
Harry
from
Lily
an
james's
house
after
they
was
killed
jus
got
him
outta
the
ruins
poor
little
thing
with
a
great
slash
across
his
forehead
an
his
parents
dead
an
Sirius
Black
turns
up
on
that
flyin
motorbike

ter
ride
never

ter
me
what
he
was
doin
there
i
didn
know
he'd

james's
SecretKeeper

what
he
could
do
white
an
shakin

Professor
McGonagall

your
voice
down
how
was
I
ter

he
wasn
upset
abou
Lily
an
James

Ha

in
the
end
he

i
won't

then
he

that
motorbike
what

he
givin
it
ter
me

was

was
a
matter
o
hours
before
the
Ministry
was
after
him
but
what
if
i'd
given
Harry
to
him
eh
i
bet
he'd
ve
pitched
him
off
the
bike
halfway
out
ter
sea
his
bes
friends
son
but
when
a
wizard
goes
over
ter
the
Dark
Side
there's
nothin
and
no
one
that
matters
to
em
anymore
a
long
silence
followed
hagrid's
story
then
Madam
Rosmerta
said
with
some
satisfaction
But
he
didn't
manage
to
disappear
did
he
the
Ministry
of
Magic
caught
up
with
him
next
day
alas
if
only
we
had
said
Fudge
bitterly
it
was
not
we
who
found
him
it
was
little
Peter
Pettigrew
another
of
the
Potters
friends
maddened
by
grief
no
doubt
and
knowing
that
Black
had
been
the
Potters
SecretKeeper
he
went
after
Black
himself
pettigrew
that
fat
little
boy
who
was
always
tagging
around
after
them
at
Hogwarts
said
Madam
Rosmerta
heroworshipped
Black
and
Potter
said
Professor
McGonagall
never
quite
in
their
league
talentwise
i
was
often
rather
harp
with
him
you
can
imagine
how
I
how
I
regret
that
now
she
sounded
as
though
she
had
a
sudden
head
cold
there
now
Minerva
said
Fudge
kindly
Pettigrew
died
a
hero's
death
eyewitnesses
Muggles
of
course
we
wiped
their
memories
later
told
us
how
Pettigrew
cornered
Black
they
say
he
was
sobbing
lily
and
James
Sirius
how
could
you
and
then
he
went
for
his
wand
well
of
course
Black
was
quicker
blew
Pettigrew
to
smithereens
professor
McGonagall
blew
her
nose
and
said
thickly
Stupid
boy
foolish
boy
he
was
always
hopeless
at
dueling
should
have
left
it
to
the
Ministry
i
tell
yeh
if
i'd
got
ter
Black
before
little
Pettigrew
did
I
wouldn't
ve
messed
around
with
wands
i'd
ve
ripped
him
limb
from
limb
Hagrid
growled
you
don't
know
what
you're
talking
about
Hagrid
said
Fudge
sharply
nobody
but
trained
Hit
Wizards
from
the
Magical
Law
Enforcement
Squad
would
have
stood
a
chance
against
Black
once
he
was
cornered
i
was
Junior
Minister
in
the
Department
of
Magical
Catastrophes
at
the
time
and
I
was
one
of
the
first
on
the
scene
after
Black
murdered
all
those
people
i
I
will
never
forget
it
i
still
dream
about
it
sometimes
a
crater
in
the
middle
of
the
street
so
deep
it
had
cracked
the
sewer
below
bodies
everywhere
muggles
screaming
and
Black
standing
there
laughing
with
what
was
left
of
Pettigrew
in
front
of
him
a
heap
of
bloodstained
robes
and
a
few
a
few
fragments
fudge's
voice
stopped
abruptly
there
was
the
sound
of
five
noses
being
blown
well
there
you
have
it
Rosmerta
said
Fudge
thickly
black
was
taken
away
by
twenty
members
of
the
Magical
Law
Enforcement
Squad
and
Pettigrew
received
the
Order
of
Merlin
First
Class
which
I
think
was
some
comfort
to
his
poor
mother
blades
been
in
Azkaban
ever
since
madam
Rosmerta
let
out
a
long
sigh
is
it
true
he's
mad
Minister
i
wish
I
could
say
that
he
was
said
Fudge
slowly
i
certainly
believe
his
master's
defeat
unhinged
him
for
a
while
the
murder
of
Pettigrew
and
all
those
Muggles
was
the
action
of
a
cornered
and
desperate
man
cruel
pointless
yet
I
met
Black
on
my
last
inspection
of
Azkaban
you
know
most
of
the
prisoners
in
there
sit
muttering
to
themselves
in
the
dark
there's
no
sense
in
them
but
I
was
shocked
at
how
normal
Black
seemed
he
spoke
quite
rationally
to
me
it
was
unnerving
you'd
have
thought
he
was
merely
bored
asked
if
i'd
finished
with
my
newspaper
cool
as
you
please
said
he
missed
doing
the
crossword
yes
I
was
astounded
at
how
little
effect
the
dementors
seemed
to
be
having
on
him
and
he
was
one
of
the
most
heavily
guarded
in
the
place
you
know
dementors
outside
his
door
day
and
night
but
what
do
you
think
he's
broken
out
to
do
said
Madam
Rosmerta
good
gracious
Minister
he
isn't
trying
to
rejoin
YouKnowWho
is
he
i
daresay
that
is
his
er
eventual
plan
said
Fudge
evasively
but
we
hope
to
catch
Black
long
before
that
i
must
say
YouKnowWho
alone
and
friendless
is
one
thing
but
give
him
back
his
most
devoted
servant
and
I
shudder
to
think
how
quickly
he'll
rise
again
there
was
a
small
chink
of
glass
on
wood
someone
had
set
down
their
glass
you
know
Cornelius
if
you're
dining
with
the
headmaster
he'd
better
head
back
up
to
the
castle
said
Professor
McGonagall
one
by
one
the
pairs
of
feet
in
front
of
Harry
took
the
weight
of
their
owners
once
more
hems
of
cloaks
swung
into
sight
and
Madam
rosemerta's
glittering
heels
disappeared
behind
the
bar
the
door
of
the
Three
Broomsticks
opened
again
there
was
another
flurry
of
snow
and
the
teachers
had
disappeared
harry
ron's
and
hermione's
faces
appeared
under
the
table
they
were
both
staring
at
him
lost
for
words
chapter
eleven
the
firebolt
harry
didn't
have
a
very
clear
idea
of
how
he
had
managed
to
get
back
into
the
Honeydukes
cellar
through
the
tunnel
and
into
the
castle
once
more
all
he
knew
was
that
the
return
trip
seemed
to
take
no
time
at
all
and
that
he
hardly
noticed
what
he
was
doing
because
his
head
was
still
pounding
with
the
conversation
he
had
just
heard
why
had
nobody
ever
told
him
dumbledore
Hagrid
mr.
Weasley
Cornelius
Fudge
why
hadn't
anyone
ever
mentioned
the
fact
that
harry's
parents
had
died
because
their
best
friend
had
betrayed
them
ron
and
Herinione
watched
Harry
nervously
all
through
dintier
not
daring
to
talk
about
what
they'd
overheard
because
Percy
was
sitting
close
by
them
when
they
went
upstairs
to
the
crowded
common
room
it
was
to
find
Fred
and
George
had
set
off
half
a
dozen
Dungbombs
in
a
fit
of
end
ofterm
high
spirits
harry
who
didn't
want
Fred
and
George
asking
him
whether
he'd
reached
Hogsmeade
or
not
sneaked
quietly
up
to
the
empty
dormitory
and
headed
straight
for
his
bedside
cabinet
he
pushed
his
books
aside
and
quickly
found
what
he
was
looking
for
the
leatherbound
photo
album
Hagrid
had
given
him
two
years
ago
which
was
full
of
wizard
pictures
of
his
mother
and
father
he
sat
down
on
his
bed
drew
the
hangings
around
him
and
started
turning
the
pages
searching
until
he
stopped
on
a
picture
of
his
parents
wedding
day
there
was
his
father
waving
up
at
him
beaming
the
untidy
black
hair
Harry
had
inherited
standing
up
in
all
directions
there
was
his
mother
alight
with
happiness
arm
in
arm
with
his
dad
and
there
that
must
be
him
their
best
man
harry
had
never
given
him
a
thought
before
if
he
hadn't
known
it
was
the
same
person
he
would
never
have
guessed
it
was
Black
in
this
old
photograph
his
face
wasn't
sunken
and
waxy
but
handsome
full
of
laughter
had
he
already
been
working
for
Voldemort
when
this
picture
had
been
taken
was
he
already
planning
the
deaths
of
the
two
people
next
to
him
did
he
realize
he
was
facing
twelve
years
in
Azkaban
twelve
years
that
would
make
him
unrecognizable
but
the
dementors
don't
affect
him
Harry
thought
staring
into
the
handsome
laughing
face
he
doesn't
have
to
hear
my
Min
screaming
if
they
get
too
close
Harry
slammed
the
album
shut
reached
over
and
stuffed
it
back
into
his
cabinet
took
off
his
robe
and
glasses
and
got
into
bed
making
sure
the
hangings
were
hiding
him
from
view
the
dormitory
door
opened
harry
said
ron's
voice
uncertainly
but
Harry
still
pretending
to
be
asleep
he
heard
Ron
leave
again
and
rolled
over
on
his
back
his
eyes
wide
open
a
hatred
such
as
he
had
never
known
before
was
coursing
through
Harry
like
poison
he
could
see
Black
laughing
at
him
through
the
darkness
as
though
somebody
had
pasted
the
picture
from
the
album
over
his
eyes
he
watched
as
though
somebody
was
playing
him
a
piece
of
film
Sirius
Black
blasting
Peter
Pettigrew
who
resembled
Neville
Longbottom
into
a
thousand
pieces
he
could
hear
though
having
no
idea
what
black's
voice
might
sound
like
a
low
excited
mutter
it
has
happened
My
Lord
the
Potters
have
made
me
their
SecretKeeper
and
then
came
another
voice
laughing
shrilly
the
same
laugh
that
Harry
heard
inside
his
head
whenever
the
dementors
drew
near
harry
you
you
look
terrible
harry
hadn't
gotten
to
sleep
until
daybreak
he
had
awoken
to
find
the
dormitory
deserted
dressed
and
gone
down
the
spiral
staircase
to
a
common
room
that
was
completely
empty
except
for
Ron
who
was
eating
a
Peppermint
Toad
and
massaging
his
stomach
and
Hermione
who
had
spread
her
homework
over
three
tables
where
is
everyone
said
Harry
gone
it's
the
first
day
of
the
holidays
remember
said
Ron
watching
Harry
closely
it's
nearly
lunchtime
I
was
going
to
come
and
wake
you
up
in
a
minute
harry
slumped
into
a
chair
next
to
the
fire
snow
was
still
falling
outside
the
windows
crookshanks
was
spread
out
in
front
of
the
fire
like
a
large
ginger
rug
you
really
don
look
well
you
know
Hermione
said
peering
anxiously
into
his
face
i'm
fine
said
Harry
harry
listen
said
Hermione
exchanging
a
look
with
Ron
you
must
be
really
upset
about
what
we
heard
yesterday
but
the
thing
is
you
mustn't
go
doing
anything
stupid
like
what
said
Harry
like
trying
to
go
after
Black
said
Ron
sharply
harry
could
tell
they
had
rehearsed
this
conversation
while
he
had
been
asleep
he
didn't
say
anything
you
won't
will
you
Harry
said
Hermione
because
black's
not
worth
dying
for
said
Ron
harry
looked
at
them
they
didn't
seem
to
understand
at
all
d'you
know
what
I
see
and
hear
every
time
a
dementor
gets
too
near
me
ron
and
Hermione
shook
their
heads
looking
apprehensive
i
can
hear
my
mum
screaming
and
pleading
with
Voldemort
and
if
you'd
heard
your
mum
screaming
like
that
just
about
to
be
killed
you
wouldn't
forget
it
in
a
hurry
and
if
you
found
out
someone
who
was
supposed
to
be
a
friend
of
hers
betrayed
her
and
sent
Voldemort
after
her
there's
nothing
you
can
do
said
Hermione
looking
stricken
the
dementors
will
catch
Black
and
he'll
go
back
to
Azkaban
and
and
serve
him
right
you
heard
what
Fudge
said
black
isn't
affected
by
Azkaban
like
normal
people
are
it's
not
a
punishment
for
him
like
it
is
for
the
others
so
what
are
you
saying
said
Ron
looking
very
tense
you
want
to
to
kill
Black
or
something
don't
be
silly
said
Herinione
in
a
panicky
voice
harry
doesn't
want
to
kill
anyone
do
you
Harry
again
Harry
didn't
answer
he
didn't
know
what
he
wanted
to
do
all
he
knew
was
that
the
idea
of
doing
nothing
while
Black
was
at
liberty
was
almost
more
than
he
could
stand
malfoy
knows
he
said
abruptly
remember
what
he
said
to
me
in
Potions
if
it
was
me
i'd
hunt
him
down
myself
i'd
want
revenge
you're
going
to
take
malfoy's
advice
instead
of
ours
said
Ron
furiously
listen
you
know
what
pettigrew's
mother
got
back
after
Black
had
finished
with
him
dad
told
me
the
Order
of
Merlin
First
Class
and
pettigrew's
finger
in
a
box
that
was
the
biggest
bit
of
him
they
could
find
black's
a
madman
Harry
and
he's
dangerous
malfoy's
dad
must
have
told
him
said
Harry
ignoring
Ron
he
was
right
in
voldemort's
inner
circle
say
YouKnowWho
will
you
interjected
Ron
angrily
so
obviously
the
Malfoys
knew
Black
was
working
for
Voldemort
and
malfoy'd
love
to
see
you
blown
into
about
a
million
pieces
like
Pettigrew
get
a
grip
malfoy's
just
hoping
you'll
get
Yourself
killed
before
he
has
to
play
you
at
Quidditch
harry
please
said
Hermione
her
eyes
now
shining
with
tears
Please
be
sensible
black
did
a
terrible
terrible
thing
but
ddon't
Put
Yourself
in
danger
it's
what
Black
wants
oh
Harry
you'd
be
Playing
right
into
black's
hands
if
you
went
looking
for
him
your
mum
and
dad
wouldn't
want
you
to
get
hurt
would
they
they'd
never
want
you
to
go
looking
for
Black
i'll
never
know
what
they'd
have
wanted
because
thanks
to
Black
i've
never
spoken
to
them
said
Harry
shortly
there
was
a
silence
in
which
Crookshanks
stretched
luxuriously
flexing
his
claws
ron's
pocket
quivered
look
said
Ron
obviously
casting
around
for
a
change
of
subject
it's
the
holidays
it's
nearly
Christmas
let's
let's
go
down
and
see
Hagrid
we
haven't
visited
him
for
ages
no
said
Hermione
quickly
harry
isn't
supposed
to
leave
the
castle
ron
yeah
let's
go
said
Harry
sitting
up
and
I
can
ask
him
how
come
he
never
mentioned
Black
when
he
told
me
all
about
my
parents
further
discussion
of
Sirius
Black
plainly
wasn't
what
Ron
had
had
in
mind
or
we
could
have
a
game
of
chess
he
said
hastily
or
Gobstones
percy
left
a
set
no
let's
visit
Hagrid
said
Harry
firmly
so
they
got
their
cloaks
from
their
dormitories
and
set
off
through
the
portrait
hole
Stand
and
fight
you
yellowbellied
mongrels
down
through
the
empty
castle
and
out
through
the
oak
front
doors
they
made
their
way
slowly
down
the
lawn
making
a
shallow
trench
in
the
glittering
powdery
snow
their
socks
and
the
hems
of
their
cloaks
soaked
and
freezing
the
Forbidden
Forest
looked
as
though
it
had
been
enchanted
each
tree
smattered
with
silver
and
hagrid's
cabin
looked
like
an
iced
cake
ron
knocked
but
there
was
no
answer
he's
not
out
is
he
said
Hermione
who
was
shivering
under
her
cloak
ron
had
his
ear
to
the
door
there's
a
weird
noise
he
said
listen
is
that
Fang
harry
and
Hermione
put
their
ears
to
the
door
too
from
inside
the
cabin
came
a
series
of
low
throbbing
moans
think
we'd
better
go
and
get
someone
said
Ron
nervously
hagrid
called
Harry
thumping
the
door
hagrid
are
you
in
there
there
was
a
sound
of
heavy
footsteps
then
the
door
creaked
open
hagrid
stood
there
with
his
eyes
red
and
swollen
tears
splashing
down
the
front
of
his
leather
vest
yWve
heard
he
bellowed
and
he
flung
himself
onto
harry's
neck
hagrid
being
at
least
twice
the
size
of
a
normal
man
this
was
no
laughing
matter
harry
about
to
collapse
under
hagrid's
weight
was
rescued
by
Ron
and
Hermione
who
each
seized
Hagrid
under
an
arm
and
heaved
him
back
into
the
cabin
hagrid
allowed
himself
to
be
steered
into
a
chair
and
slumped
over
the
table
sobbing
uncontrollably
his
face
glazed
with
tears
that
dripped
down
into
his
tangled
beard
hagrid
what
is
it
said
Hermione
aghast
harry
spotted
an
officiallooking
letter
lying
open
on
the
table
what's
this
Hagrid
hagrid's
sobs
redoubled
but
he
shoved
the
letter
toward
Harry
who
Picked
it
up
and
read
aloud
dear
mr.
Hagrid
further
to
our
inquiry
into
the
attack
by
a
hippogriff
on
a
student
in
your
class
we
have
accepted
the
assurances
of
Professor
Dumbledore
that
you
bear
no
responsibility
for
the
regrettable
incident
well
that's
okay
then
Hagrid
said
Ron
clapping
Hagrid
oil
the
shoulder
but
Hagrid
continued
to
sob
and
waved
one
of
his
gigantic
hands
inviting
Harry
to
read
on
however
we
must
register
our
concern
about
the
hippogriff
in
question
we
have
decided
to
uphold
the
official
complaint
of
mr.
Lucius
Malfoy
and
this
matter
will
therefore
be
taken
to
the
Committee
for
the
Disposal
of
Dangerous
Creatures
the
hearing
will
take
place
on
April

present
yourself
and
your
hippogriff
at
the
committee's
offices
in
London
on

kept
tethered
and
isolated

in
fellowship

a
list
of
the
school
governors

Ron

hippogriff
Hagrid
i
bet
he'll
get
off
Yeh

them
gargoyles
at
the
Committee
fer
the
Disposal
o
Dangerous
Creatures
choked
Hagrid
wiping
his
eyes
on
his
sleeve
they've
got
it
in
fer
interestin
creatures
a
sudden
sound
from
the
corner
of
hagrid's
cabin
made
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
whip
around
buckbeak
the
hippogriff
was
lying
in
the
corner
chomping
on
something
that
was
oozing
blood
all
over
the
floor
i
couldn
leave
him
tied
up
out
there
in
the
snow
choked
Hagrid
all
on
his
own
at
Christmas
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
looked
at
one
another
they
had
never
seen
eye
to
eye
with
Hagrid
about
what
he
called
interesting
creatures
and
other
people
called
terrifying
monsters
or
the
other
hand
there
didn't
seem
to
be
any
particular
harm
in
Buckbeak
in
fact
by
hagrid's
usual
standards
he
was
positively
cute
you'll
have
to
put
up
a
good
strong
defense
Hagrid
said
Hermione
sitting
down
and
laying
a
hand
on
hagrid's
massive
forearm
i'm
sure
you
can
prove
Buckbeak
is
safe
won't
make
no
diff'rence
sobbed
Hagrid
them
Disposal
devils
they're
all
in
Lucius
malfoy's
pocket
scared
o
him
ad
if
I
lose
the
case
Buckbeak
hagrid
drew
his
finger
swiftly
across
his
throat
then
gave
a
great
wail
and
lurched
forward
his
face
in
his
arms
what
about
Dumbledore
Hagrid
said
Harry
he's
done
more'n
enough
fer
me
already
groaned
Hagrid
got
enough
on
his
plate
what
with
keepin
them
dementors
outta
the
castle
an
Sirius
Black
lurkin
around
ron
and
Hermione
looked
quickly
at
Harry
as
though
expecting
him
to
start
berating
Hagrid
for
not
telling
him
the
truth
about
Black
but
Harry
couldn't
bring
himself
to
do
it
not
now
that
he
saw
Hagrid
so
miserable
and
scared
listen
Hagrid
he
said
you
can't
give
up
hermione's
right
You
just
need
a
good
defense
you
can
call
us
as
witnesses
i'm
sure
i've
read
about
a
case
of
hippogriffbaiting
said
Hermione
thoughtfully
where
the
hippogriff
got
off
i'll
look
it
up
for
you
hagrid
and
see
exactly
what
happened
hagrid
howled
still
more
loudly
harry
and
Hermione
looked
at
Ron
to
help
them
er
shall
I
make
a
cup
of
tea
said
Ron
harry
stared
at
him
it's
what
my
mum
does
whenever
someone's
upset
Ron
muttered
shrugging
at
last
after
many
more
assurances
of
help
with
a
steaming
mug
of
tea
in
front
of
him
Hagrid
blew
his
nose
on
a
handkerchief
the
size
of
a
tablecloth
and
said
Yer
right
i
can
afford
to
go
ter
pieces

pull
meself
together
fang
the
boarhound
came
timidly
out
from
under
the
table
and
laid
his
head
on
hagrid's
knee
i've
not
bin
meself

said
Hagrid
stroking
Fang
with
one
hand
and
mopping
his
face
with
the
other
worried
abou

no

Ron

under
the
table

Hagrid
gloomily
too
much
lettuce

Ron
his
lip
twitching
an
them
dementors
make
me
feel
ruddy
terrible
an
all
said
Hagrid
with
a
sudden
shudder

walk
past

ev'ry
time
I
want
a
drink
in
the
Three
Broomsticks
s
like
bein
back
in
Azkaban
he
fell
silent
gulping
his
tea
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
watched
him
breathlessly
they
had
never
heard
Hagrid
talk
about
his
brief
spell
in
Azkaban
before
after
a
pause
Hermione
said
timidly
Is
it
awful
in
there
Hagrid
yeh've
no
idea
said
Hagrid
quietly
never
bin
anywhere
like
it
thought
I

me
mind
the
day
I

I

Hagrid

in
a
game
of
cards

the
dementors

innocent
said
Hermione
hagrid
snorted

that

to
them
they
don
care
long
as
they've
got
a
couple
o
hundred
humans
stuck
there
with

so
they
can
leech
all
the
happiness
out
of
em
they
don
give
a
damn
who's
guilty
an
who's
not
hagrid
went
quiet
for
a
moment
staring
into
his
tea
then
he
said
quietly
Thought
o
jus
letting
Buckbeak
go
tryin
ter
make
him
fly
away
but
how
d'yeh
explain
ter
a
hippogriff
it's
gotta
go
inter
hidin
an
an
i'm
scared
o
breakin
the
law
he
looked
up
at
them
tears
leaking
down
his
face
again
i
don
ever
want
ter
go
back
ter
Azkaban
the
trip
to
hagrid's
though
far
from
fun
had
nevertheless
had
the
effect
Ron
and
Hermione
had
hoped
though
Harry
had
by
no
means
forgotten
about
Black
he
couldn't
brood
constantly
on
revenge
if
he
wanted
to
help
Hagrid
win
his
case
against
the
Committee
for
the
Disposal
of
Dangerous
Creatures
he
Ron
and
Hermione
went
to
the
library
the
next
day
and
returned
to
the
empty
common
room
laden
with
books
that
might
help
prepare
a
defense
for
Buckbeak
the
three
of
them
sat
in
front
of
the
roaring
fire
slowly
turning
the
pages
of
dusty
volumes
about
famous
cases
If
marauding
beasts
speaking
occasionally
when
they
ran
across
something
relevant
here's
something
there
was
a
case
in
but
the
hippogriff
was
convicted
ugh
look
what
they
did
to
it
that's
disgusting
this
might
help
look
a
manticore
savaged
someone
in
and
they
let
the
manticore
off
oh
no
that
was
only
because
everyone
was
too
scared
to
go
near
it
meanwhile
in
the
rest
of
the
castle
the
usual
magnificent
Christmas
decorations
had
been
put
up
despite
the
fact
that
hardly
any
of
the
students
remained
to
enjoy
them
thick
streamers
of
holly
and
mistletoe
were
strung
along
the
corridors
mysterious
lights
shone
from
inside
every
suit
of
armor
and
the
Great
Hall
was
filled
with
its
usual
twelve
Christmas
trees
glittering
with
golden
stars
a
powerful
and
delicious
smell
of
cooking
pervaded
the
corridors
and
by
Christmas
Eve
it
had
grown
so
strong
that
even
Scabbers
poked
his
nose
out
of
the
shelter
of
ron's
pocket
to
sniff
hopefully
at
the
air
on
Christmas
morning
Harry
was
woken
by
Ron
throwing
his
pillow
at
him
oy
presents
harry
reached
for
his
glasses
and
put
them
on
squinting
through
the
semidarkness
to
the
foot
of
his
bed
where
a
small
heap
of
parcels
had
appeared
ron
was
already
ripping
the
paper
off
his
own
presents
another
sweater
from
Mum
maroon
again
see
if
you've
got
one
harry
had
mrs
weasley
had
sent
him
a
scarlet
sweater
with
the
Gryffindor
lion
knitted
on
the
front
also
a
dozen
homebaked
mince
pies
some
Christmas
cake
and
a
box
of
nut
brittle
as
he
moved
all
these
things
aside
he
saw
a
long
thin
package
lying
underneath
what's
that
said
Ron
looking
over
a
freshly
unwrapped
pair
of
maroon
socks
in
his
hand
dunno
harry
ripped
the
parcel
open
and
gasped
as
a
magnificent
gleaming
broomstick
rolled
out
onto
his
bedspread
ron
dropped
his
socks
and
jumped
off
his
bed
for
a
closer
look
i
don't
believe
it
he
said
hoarsely
it
was
a
Firebolt
identical
to
the
dream
broom
Harry
had
gone
to
see
every
day
in
Diagon
Alley
its
handle
glittered
as
he
picked
it
up
he
could
feel
it
vibrating
and
let
go
it
hung
in
midair
unsupported
at
exactly
the
right
height
for
him
to
mount
it
his
eyes
moved
from
the
golden
registration
number
at
the
top
of
the
handle
right
down
to
the
perfectly
smooth
streamlined
birch
twigs
that
made
up
the
tail
who
sent
it
to
you
said
Ron
in
a
hushed
voice
look
and
see
if
there's
a
card
said
Harry
ron
ripped
apart
the
firebolt's
wrappings
nothing
blimey
who'd
spend
that
much
on
you
well
said
Harry
feeling
stunned
i'm
betting
it
wasn't
the
Dursleys
i
bet
it
was
Dumbledore
said
Ron
now
walking
around
and
around
the
Firebolt
taking
in
every
glorious
inch
he
sent
you
the
Invisibility
Cloak
anonymously
that
was
my
dad's
though
said
Harry
dumbledore
was
just
Passing
it
on
to
me
he
wouldn't
spend
hundreds
of
Galleons
on
me
he
can't
go
giving
students
stuff
like
this
that's
why
he
wouldn't
say
it
was
from
him
said
Ron
in
case
some
git
like
Malfoy
said
it
was
favoritism
hey
Harry
Ron
gave
a
great
whoop
of
laughter
Malfoy
wait
till
he
sees
you
on
this
he'll
be
sick
as
a
pig
this
is
an
international
standard
broom
this
is
i
can't
believe
this
Harry
muttered
running
a
hand
along
the
Firebolt
while
Ron
sank
onto
harry's
bed
laughing
his
head
off
at
the
thought
of
Malfoy
who
i
know
said
Ron
controlling
himself
I
know
who
it
could've
been
Lupin
what
said
Harry
now
starting
to
laugh
himself
Lupin
listen
if
he
had
this
much
gold
he'd
be
able
to
buy
himself
some
new
robes
yeah
but
he
likes
you
said
Ron
and
he
was
away
when
your
Nimbus
got
smashed
and
he
might've
heard
about
it
and
decided
to
visit
Diagon
Alley
and
get
this
for
you
what
d'you
mean
he
was
away
said
Harry
he
was
ill
when
I
was
playing
in
that
match
well
he
wasn't
in
the
hospital
wing
said
Ron
i
was
there
cleaning
out
the
bedpans
on
that
detention
from
Snape
remember
harry
frowned
at
Ron
i
can't
see
Lupin
affording
something
like
this
what're
you
two
laughing
about
hermione
had
just
come
in
wearing
her
dressing
gown
and
carrying
Crookshanks
who
was
looking
very
grumpy
with
a
string
of
tinsel
tied
around
his
neck
don't
bring
him
in
here
said
Ron
hurriedly
snatching
Scabbers
from
the
depths
of
his
bed
and
stowing
him
in
his
pajama
pocket
but
Hermione
wasn't
listening
she
dropped
Crookshanks
onto
seamus's
empty
bed
and
stared
openmouthed
at
the
Firebolt
oh
Harry
who
sent
you
that
no
idea
said
Harry
there
wasn't
a
card
or
anything
with
it
to
his
great
surprise
Hermione
did
not
appear
either
excited
or
intrigued
by
the
news
on
the
contrary
her
face
fell
and
she
bit
her
lip
what's
the
matter
with
you
said
Ron
i
don't
know
said
Hermione
slowly
but
it's
a
bit
odd
isn't
it
i
mean
this
is
supposed
to
be
quite
a
good
broom
isn't
it
ron
sighed
exasperatedly
it's
the
best
broom
there
is
Hermione
he
said
so
it
must've
been
really
expensive
probably
cost
more
than
all
the
Slytherins
brooms
put
together
said
Ron
happily
well
who'd
send
Harry
something
as
expensive
as
that
and
not
even
tell
him
they'd
sent
it
said
Hermione
who
cares
said
Ron
impatiently
listen
Harry
can
I
have
a
go
on
it
can
I
i
don't
think
anyone
should
ride
that
broom
just
yet
said
Hermione
shrilly
harry
and
Ron
looked
at
her
what
d'you
think
harry's
going
to
do
with
it
sweep
the
floor
said
Ron
but
before
Hermione
could
answer
Crookshanks
sprang
from
seamus's
bed
right
at
ron's
chest
get
him
out
of
here
ron
bellowed
as
crookshanks's
claws
ripped
his
pajamas
and
Scabbers
attempted
a
wild
escape
over
his
shoulder
ron
seized
Scabbers
by
the
tail
and
aimed
a
misjudged
kick
at
Crookshanks
that
hit
the
trunk
at
the
end
of
harry's
bed
knocking
it
over
and
causing
Ron
to
hop
up
and
down
howling
with
pain
crookshanks's
fur
suddenly
stood
on
end
a
shrill
tint
whistling
was
filling
the
room
the
Pocket
Sneakoscope
had
become
dislodged
from
Uncle
vernon's
old
socks
and
was
whirling
and
gleaming
on
the
floor
i
forgot
about
that
harry
said
bending
down
and
picking
up
the
Sneakoscope
i
never
wear
those
socks
if
I
can
help
it
the
Sneakoscope
whirled
and
whistled
in
his
palm
crookshanks
was
hissing
and
spitting
at
it
you'd
better
take
that
cat
out
of
here
Hermione
said
Ron
furiously
sitting
on
harry's
bed
nursing
his
toe
can't
you
shut
that
thing
up
he
added
to
Harry
as
Hermione
strode
out
of
the
room
crookshanks's
yellow
eyes
still
fixed
maliciously
on
Ron
harry
stuffed
the
Sneakoscope
back
inside
the
socks
and
threw
it
back
into
his
trunk
all
that
could
be
heard
now
were
ron's
stifled
moans
of
pain
and
rage
scabbers
was
huddled
in
ron's
hands
it
had
been
a
while
since
Harry
had
seen
him
out
of
ron's
pocket
and
he
was
unpleasantly
surprised
to
see
that
Scabbers
once
so
fat
was
now
very
skinny
patches
of
fur
seemed
to
have
fallen
out
too
he's
not
looking
too
good
is
he
harry
said
it's
stress
said
Ron
he'd
be
fine
if
that
big
stupid
furball
left
him
alone
but
Harry
remembering
what
the
woman
at
the
Magical
Menagerie
had
said
about
rats
living
only
three
years
couldn't
help
feeling
that
unless
Scabbers
had
powers
he
had
never
revealed
he
was
reaching
the
end
of
his
life
and
despite
ron's
frequent
conplaints
that
Scabbers
was
both
boring
and
useless
he
was
sure
Ron
would
be
very
miserable
if
Scabbers
died
christmas
spirit
was
definitely
thin
on
the
ground
in
the
Gryffindor
common
room
that
morning
hermione
had
shut
Crookshanks
in
her
dormitory
but
was
furious
with
Ron
for
trying
to
kick
him
Ron
was
still
fuming
about
crookshanks's
fresh
attempt
to
eat
Scabbers
harry
gave
up
trying
to
make
them
talk
to
each
other
and
devoted
himself
to
examining
the
Firebolt
which
he
had
brought
down
to
the
common
room
with
him
for
some
reason
this
seemed
to
annoy
Hermione
as
well
she
didn't
say
anything
but
she
kept
looking
darkly
at
the
broom
as
though
it
too
had
been
criticizing
her
cat
at
lunchtime
they
went
down
to
the
Great
Hall
to
find
that
the
House
tables
had
been
moved
against
the
walls
again
and
that
a
single
table
set
for
twelve
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
professors
Dumbledore
mcGonagall
Snape
Sprout
and
Flitwick
were
there
along
with
Filch
the
caretaker
who
had
taken
off
his
usual
brown
coat
and
was
wearing
a
very
old
and
rather
moldy
looking
tailcoat
there
were
only
three
other
students
two
extremely
nervouslooking
first
years
and
a
sullenfaced
Slytherin
fifth
year
merry
Christmas
said
Dumbledore
as
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
approached
the
table
as
there
are
so
few
of
us
it
seemed
foolish
to
use
the
House
tables
sit
down
sit
down
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
sat
down
side
by
side
at
the
end
of
the
table
crackers
said
Dumbledore
enthusiastically
offering
the
end
of
a
large
silver
noisemaker
to
Snape
who
took
it
reluctantly
and
tugged
with
a
bang
like
a
gunshot
the
cracker
flew
apart
to
reveal
a
large
pointed
witchs
hat
topped
with
a
stuffed
vulture
harry
remembering
the
boggart
caught
ron's
eye
and
they
both
grinned
snape's
mouth
thinned
and
he
pushed
the
hat
toward
Dumbledore
who
swapped
it
for
his
wizard's
hat
at
once
dig
in
he
advised
the
table
beaming
around
as
Harry
was
helping
himself
to
roast
potatoes
the
doors
of
the
Great
Hall
opened
again
it
was
Professor
Trelawney
gliding
toward
them
as
though
on
wheels
she
had
put
on
a
green
sequined
dress
in
honor
of
the
occasion
making
her
look
more
than
ever
like
a
glittering
oversized
dragonfly
sibyll
this
is
a
pleasant
surprise
said
Dumbledore
standing
up
i
have
been
crystal
gazing
Headmaster
said
Professor
Trelawney
in
her
mistiest
most
faraway
voice
and
to
my
astonishment
I
saw
myself
abandoning
my
solitary
luncheon
and
coming
to
join
you
who
am
I
to
refuse
the
promptings
of
fate
i
at
once
hastened
from
my
tower
and
I
do
beg
you
to
forgive
my
lateness
certainly
certainly
said
Dumbledore
his
eyes
twinkling
let
me
draw
you
up
a
chair
and
he
did
indeed
draw
a
chair
in
midair
with
his
wand
which
revolved
for
a
few
seconds
before
falling
with
a
thud
between
Professors
Snape
and
McGonagall
professor
Trelawney
however
did
not
sit
down
her
enormous
eyes
had
been
roving
around
the
table
and
she
suddenly
uttered
a
kind
of
soft
scream
i
dare
not
Headmaster
if
I
join
the
table
we
shall
be
thirteen
nothing
could
be
more
unlucky
never
forget
that
when
thirteen
dine
together
the
first
to
rise
will
be
the
first
to
die
we'll
risk
it
Sibyll
said
Professor
McGonagall
inpatiendy
do
sit
down
the
turkey's
getting
stone
cold
professor
Trelawney
hesitated
then
lowered
herself
into
the
empty
chair
eyes
shut
and
mouth
clenched
tight
as
though
expecting
a
thunderbolt
to
hit
the
table
professor
McGonagall
poked
a
large
spoon
into
the
nearest
tureen
tripe
Sibyll
professor
Trelawney
ignored
her
eyes
open
again
she
looked
around
once
more
and
said
But
where
is
dear
Professor
Lupin
i'm
afraid
the
poor
fellow
is
ill
again
said
Dumbledore
indicating
that
everybody
should
start
serving
themselves
most
unfortunate
that
it
should
happen
on
Christmas
Day
but
surely
you
already
knew
that
Sibyll
said
Professor
McGonagall
her
eyebrows
raised
professor
Trelawney
gave
Professor
McGonagall
a
very
cold
look
certainly
I
knew
Minerva
she
said
quietly
but
one
does
not
parade
the
fact
that
one
is
All
Knowing
i
frequently
act
as
though
I
am
not
possessed
of
the
Inner
Eye
so
as
not
to
make
others
nervous
that
explains
a
great
deal
said
Professor
McGonagall
tartly
professor
trelawney's
voice
suddenly
became
a
good
deal
less
misty
if
you
must
know
Minerva
I
have
seen
that
poor
Professor
Lupin
will
not
be
with
us
for
very
long
he
seems
aware
himself
that
his
time
is
short
he
positively
fled
when
I
offered
to
crystal
gaze
for
him
imagine
that
said
Professor
McGonagall
dryly
i
doubt
said
Dumbledore
in
a
cheerful
but
slightly
raised
voice
which
put
an
end
to
Professor
McGonagall
and
Professor
trelawney's
conversation
that
Professor
Lupin
is
in
any
immediate
danger
severus
you've
made
the
potion
for
him
again
yes
Headmaster
said
Snape
w
what
said
Harry
scrambling
to
his
feet
why
it
will
need
to
be
checked
for
jinxes
said
Professor
McGonagall
of
course
i'm
no
expert
but
I
daresay
Madam
Hooch
and
Professor
Flitwick
will
strip
it
down
strip
it
down
repeated
Ron
as
though
Professor
McGonagall
was
mad
it
shouldn't
take
more
than
a
few
weeks
said
Professor
McGonagall
you
will
have
it
back
if
we
are
sure
it
is
jinxfree
there's
nothing
wrong
with
it
said
Harry
his
voice
shaking
slightly
honestly
Professor
you
can't
know
that
Potter
said
Professor
McGonagall
quite
kindly
not
until
you've
flown
it
at
any
rate
and
i'm
afraid
that
is
out
of
the
question
until
we
are
certain
that
it
has
not
been
tampered
with
i
shall
keep
you
informed
professor
McGonagall
turned
on
her
heel
and
carried
the
Firebolt
out
of
the
portrait
hole
which
closed
behind
her
harry
stood
staring
after
her
the
tin
of
HighFinish
Polish
still
clutched
in
his
hands
ron
however
rounded
on
Hermione
what
did
you
go
running
to
McGonagall
for
hermione
threw
her
book
aside
she
was
still
pink
in
the
face
but
stood
up
and
faced
Ron
defiantly
because
I
thought
and
Professor
McGonagall
agrees
with
me
that
that
broom
was
probably
sent
to
Harry
by
Sirius
Black
chapter
twelve
the
patronus
harry
knew
that
Hermione
had
meant
well
but
that
didn't
stop
him
from
being
angry
with
her
he
had
been
the
owner
of
the
best
broom
in
the
world
for
a
few
short
hours
and
now
because
of
her
interference
he
didn't
know
whether
he
would
ever
see
it
again
he
was
positive
that
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
the
Firebolt
now
but
what
sort
of
state
would
it
be
in
once
it
had
been
subjected
to
all
sorts
of
antijinx
tests
ron
was
furious
with
Hermione
too
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
the
strippingdown
of
a
brand
new
Firebolt
was
nothing
less
than
criminal
damage
hermione
who
remained
convinced
that
she
had
acted
for
the
best
started
avoiding
the
common
room
harry
and
Ron
supposed
she
had
taken
refuge
in
the
library
and
didn't
try
to
persuade
her
to
come
back
all
in
all
they
were
glad
when
the
rest
of
the
school
returned
shortly
after
New
Year
and
Gryffindor
Tower
became
crowded
and
noisy
again
wood
sought
Harry
out
on
the
night
before
term
started
had
a
good
Christmas
he
said
and
then
without
waiting
for
an
answer
he
sat
down
lowered
his
voice
and
said
i've
been
doing
some
thinking
over
Christmas
Harry
after
last
match
you
know
if
the
dementors
come
to
the
next
one
i
mean
we
can't
afford
you
to
well
wood
broke
off
looking
awkward
i'm
working
on
it
said
Harry
quickly
professor
Lupin
said
he'd
train
me
to
ward
off
the
dementors
we
should
be
starting
this
week
he
said
he'd
have
time
after
Christmas
ah
said
Wood
his
expression
clearing
well
in
that
case
I
really
didn't
want
to
lose
you
as
Seeker
Harry
and
have
you
ordered
a
new
broom
yet
no
said
Harry
what
you'd
better
get
a
move
on
you
know
you
can't
ride
that
Shooting
Star
against
Ravenclaw
he
got
a
Firebolt
for
Christmas
said
Ron
a
Firebolt
no
seriously
a
a
real
Firebolt
don't
get
excited
Oliver
said
Harry
gloomily
i
haven't
got
it
anymore
it
was
confiscated
and
he
explained
all
about
how
the
Firebolt
was
now
being
checked
for
jinxes
jinxed
how
could
it
be
jinxed
sirius
Black
Harry
said
wearily
he's
supposed
to
be
after
me
so
McGonagall
reckons
he
might
have
sent
it
waving
aside
the
information
that
a
famous
murderer
was
after
his
Seeker
Wood
said
But
Black
couldn't
have
bought
a
Firebolt
he's
on
the
run
the
whole
country's
on
the
lookout
for
him
how
could
he
just
walk
into
Quality
Quidditch
Supplies
and
buy
a
broomstick
i
know
said
Harry
but
McGonagall
still
wants
to
strip
it
down
wood
went
pale
i'll
go
and
talk
to
her
Harry
he
promised
i'll
make
her
see
reason
a
Firebolt
a
real
Firebolt
on
our
team
she
wants
Gryffindor
to
win
as
much
as
we
do
i'll
make
her
see
sense
a
Firebolt
classes
started
again
the
next
day
the
last
thing
anyone
felt
like
doing
was
spending
two
hours
on
the
grounds
on
a
raw
January
morning
but
Hagrid
had
provided
a
bonfire
full
of
salamanders
for
their
enjoyment
and
they
spent
an
unusually
good
lesson
collecting
dry
wood
and
leaves
to
keep
the
fire
blazing
while
the
flameloving
lizards
scampered
up
and
down
the
crumbling
whitehot
logs
the
first
Divination
lesson
of
the
new
term
was
much
less
fun
Professor
Trelawney
was
now
teaching
them
palmistry
and
she
lost
no
time
in
informing
Harry
that
he
had
the
shortest
life
line
she
had
ever
seen
it
was
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
that
Harry
was
keen
to
get
to
after
his
conversation
with
Wood
he
wanted
to
get
started
on
his
antidementor
lessons
as
soon
as
possible
ah
yes
said
Lupin
when
Harry
reminded
him
of
his
promise
at
the
end
of
class
let
me
see
how
about
eight
o'clock
on
Thursday
evening
the
History
of
Magic
classroom
should
be
large
enough
i'll
have
to
think
carefully
about
how
we're
going
to
do
this
we
can't
bring
a
real
dementor
into
the
castle
to
practice
on
still
looks
ill
doesn't
he
said
Ron
as
they
walked
down
the
corridor
heading
to
dinner
what
d'you
reckon's
the
matter
with
him
there
was
a
loud
and
impatient
tuh
from
behind
them
it
was
Hermione
who
had
been
sitting
at
the
feet
of
a
suit
of
armor
repacking
her
bag
which
was
so
full
of
books
it
wouldn't
close
and
what
are
you
tutting
at
us
for
said
Ron
irritably
nothing
said
Hermione
in
a
lofty
voice
heaving
her
bag
back
over
her
shoulder
yes
you
were
said
Ron
i
said
I
wonder
what's
wrong
with
Lupin
and
you
well
isn't
it
obvious
said
Hermione
with
a
look
of
maddening
superiority
if
you
don't
want
to
tell
us
don't
snapped
Ron
fine
said
Hermione
haughtily
and
she
marched
off
she
doesn't
know
said
Ron
staring
resentfully
after
Hermione
she's
just
trying
to
get
us
to
talk
to
her
again
at
eight
o'clock
on
Thursday
evening
Harry
left
Gryffindor
Tower
for
the
History
of
Magic
classroom
it
was
dark
and
empty
when
he
arrived
but
he
lit
the
lamps
with
his
wand
and
had
waited
only
five
minutes
when
Professor
Lupin
turned
up
carrying
a
large
packing
case
which
he
heaved
onto
Professor
binn's
desk
what's
that
said
Harry
another
boggart
said
Lupin
stripping
off
his
cloak
i've
been
combing
the
castle
ever
since
Tuesday
and
very
luckily
I
found
this
one
lurking
inside
mr.
filch's
filing
cabinet
it's
the
nearest
we'll
get
to
a
real
dementor
the
boggart
will
turn
into
a
dementor
when
he
sees
you
so
we'll
be
able
to
practice
on
him
i
can
store
him
in
my
office
when
we're
not
using
him
there's
a
cupboard
under
my
desk
he'll
like
okay
said
Harry
trying
to
sound
as
though
he
wasn't
apprehensive
at
all
and
merely
glad
that
Lupin
had
found
such
a
good
substitute
for
a
real
dementor
so
professor
Lupin
had
taken
out
his
own
wand
and
indicated
that
Harry
should
do
the
same
the
spell
I
am
going
to
try
and
teach
you
is
highly
advanced
magic
Harry
well
beyond
ordinary
Wizarding
Level
it
is
called
the
Patronus
Charm
how
does
it
work
said
Harry
nervously
well
when
it
works
correctly
It
conjures
up
a
Patronus
said
Lupin
which
is
a
kind
of
anti
dementor
a
guardian
that
acts
as
a
shield
between
you
and
the
dementor
harry
had
a
sudden
vision
of
himself
crouching
behind
a
Hagridsized
figure
holding
a
large
club
professor
Lupin
continued
The
Patronus
is
a
kind
of
positive
force
a
projection
of
the
very
things
that
the
dementor
feeds
upon
hope
happiness
the
desire
to
survive
but
it
cannot
feel
despair
as
real
humans
can
so
the
dementors
can't
hurt
it
but
I
must
warn
you
Harry
that
the
charm
might
be
too
advanced
for
you
many
qualified
wizards
have
difficulty
with
it
what
does
a
Patronus
look
like
said
Harry
curiously
each
one
is
unique
to
the
wizard
who
conjures
it
and
how
do
you
conjure
it
with
an
incantation
which
will
work
only
if
you
are
concentrating
with
all
your
might
on
a
single
very
happy
memory
harry
cast
his
mind
about
for
a
happy
memory
certainly
nothing
that
had
happened
to
him
at
the
Dursleys
was
going
to
do
finally
he
settled
on
the
moment
when
he
had
first
ridden
a
broomstick
right
he
said
trying
to
recall
as
exactly
as
possible
the
wonderful
soaring
sensation
of
his
stomach
the
incantation
is
this
Lupin
cleared
his
throat
expecto
patronum
expecto
patronum
Harry
repeated
under
his
breath
expecto
patronum
concentrating
hard
on
your
happy
memory
oh
yeah
said
Harry
quickly
forcing
his
thoughts
back
to
that
first
broom
ride
expecto
patrono
no
patronum
sorry
expecto
patronum
expecto
patronum
something
whooshed
suddenly
out
of
the
end
of
his
wand
it
looked
like
a
wisp
of
silvery
gas
did
you
see
that
said
Harry
excitedly
something
happened
very
good
said
Lupin
smiling
right
then
ready
to
try
it
on
a
dementor
yes
Harry
said
gripping
his
wand
very
tightly
and
moving
into
the
middle
of
the
deserted
classroom
he
tried
to
keep
his
mind
on
flying
but
something
else
kept
intruding
any
second
now
he
might
hear
his
mother
again
but
he
shouldn't
think
that
or
he
would
hear
her
again
and
he
didn't
want
to
or
did
he
lupin
grasped
the
lid
of
the
packing
case
and
pulled
a
dementor
rose
slowly
from
the
box
its
hooded
face
turned
toward
Harry
one
glistening
scabbed
hand
gripping
its
cloak
the
lamps
around
the
classroom
flickered
and
went
out
the
dementor
stepped
from
the
box
and
started
to
sweep
silently
toward
Harry
drawing
a
deep
rattling
breath
a
wave
of
piercing
cold
broke
over
him
Expecto
patronum
harry
yelled
expecto
patronum
expecto
but
the
classroom
and
the
dementor
were
dissolving
harry
was
failing
again
through
thick
white
fog
and
his
mother's
voice
was
louder
than
ever
echoing
inside
his
head
Not
Harry
not
Harry
please
i'll
do
anything
stand
aside
stand
aside
girl
harry
harry
jerked
back
to
life
he
was
lying
flat
on
his
back
on
the
floor
the
classroom
lamps
were
alight
again
he
didn't
have
to
ask
what
had
happened
sorry
he
muttered
sitting
up
and
feeling
cold
sweat
trickling
down
behind
his
glasses
are
you
all
right
said
Lupin
yes
harry
pulled
himself
up
on
one
of
the
desks
and
leaned
against
it
here
Lupin
handed
him
a
Chocolate
Frog
eat
this
before
we
try
again
i
didn't
expect
you
to
do
it
your
first
time
in
fact
I
would
have
been
astounded
if
you
had
it's
getting
worse
Harry
muttered
biting
off
the
frog's
head
i
could
hear
her
louder
that
time
and
him
Voldemort
Lupin
looked
paler
than
usual
harry
if
you
don't
want
to
continue
I
will
more
than
understand
i
do
said
Harry
fiercely
stuffing
the
rest
of
the
Chocolate
Frog
into
his
mouth
i've
got
to
what
if
the
dementors
turn
up
at
our
match
against
Ravenclaw
i
can't
afford
to
fall
off
again
if
we
lose
this
game
we've
lost
the
Quidditch
Cup
all
right
then
said
Lupin
you
might
want
to
select
other
memory
a
happy
memory
I
mean
to
concentrate
on
that
one
doesn't
seem
to
have
been
strong
enough
harry
thought
hard
and
decided
his
feelings
when
Gryffindor
had
won
the
House
Championship
last
year
had
definitely
qualified
as
very
happy
he
gripped
his
wand
tightly
again
and
took
up
his
position
in
the
middle
of
the
classroom
ready
said
Lupin
gripping
the
box
lid
ready
said
Harry
trying
hard
to
fill
his
head
with
happy
thoughts
about
Gryffindor
winning
and
not
dark
thoughts
about
what
was
going
to
happen
when
the
box
opened
go
said
Lupin
pulling
off
the
lid
the
room
went
icily
cold
and
dark
once
more
the
dementor
glided
forward
drawing
its
breath
one
rotting
hand
was
extending
toward
Harry
Expecto
patronum
harry
yelled
expecto
patronum
expecto
Pat
white
fog
obscured
his
senses
big
blurred
shapes
were
moving
around
him
then
came
a
new
voice
a
man's
voice
shouting
panicking
Lily
take
Harry
and
go
it's
him
go
run
i'll
hold
him
off
the
sounds
of
someone
stumbling
ftom
a
room
a
door
bursting
open
a
cackle
of
high
pitched
laughter
Harry
harry
wake
up
lupin
was
tapping
Harry
hard
on
the
face
this
time
it
was
a
minute
before
Harry
understood
why
he
was
lying
on
a
dusty
classroom
floor
i
heard
my
dad
Harry
mumbled
that's
the
first
time
i've
ever
heard
him
he
tried
to
take
on
Voldemort
himself
to
give
my
mum
time
to
run
for
it
harry
suddenly
realized
that
there
were
tears
on
his
face
mingling
with
the
sweat
he
bent
his
face
as
low
as
possible
wiping
them
off
on
his
robes
pretending
to
do
up
his
shoelace
so
that
Lupin
wouldn't
see
you
heard
James
said
Lupin
in
a
strange
voice
yeah
face
dry
Harry
looked
up
why
you
didn't
know
my
dad
did
you
i
I
did
as
a
matter
of
fact
said
Lupin
we
were
friends
at
Hogwarts
listen
Harry
perhaps
we
should
leave
it
here
for
tonight
this
charm
is
ridiculously
advanced
i
shouln't
have
suggested
putting
you
through
this
no
said
Harry
he
got
up
again
i'll
have
one
more
go
i'm
not
thinking
of
happy
enough
things
that's
what
it
is
hang
on
he
racked
his
brains
a
really
really
happy
memory
one
that
he
could
turn
into
a
good
strong
Patronus
the
moment
when
he'd
first
found
out
he
was
a
wizard
and
would
be
leaving
the
Dursleys
for
Hogwarts
if
that
wasn't
a
happy
memory
he
didn't
know
what
was
concentrating
very
hard
on
how
he
had
felt
when
he'd
realized
he'd
be
leaving
Privet
Drive
Harry
got
to
his
feet
and
faced
the
packing
case
once
more
ready
said
Lupin
who
looked
as
though
he
were
doing
this
against
his
better
judgment
concentrating
hard
all
right
go
he
pulled
off
the
lid
of
the
case
for
the
third
time
and
the
dementor
rose
out
of
it
the
room
fell
cold
and
dark
expecto
patronum
harry
bellowed
expecto
patronum
expecto
patronum
the
screaming
inside
harry's
head
had
started
again
except
this
time
it
sounded
as
though
it
were
coming
from
a
badly
tuned
radio
softer
and
louder
and
softer
again
and
he
could
still
see
the
dementor
it
had
halted
and
then
a
huge
silver
shadow
came
bursting
out
of
the
end
of
harry's
wand
to
hover
between
him
and
the
dementor
and
though
harry's
legs
felt
like
water
he
was
still
on
his
feet
though
for
how
much
longer
he
wasn't
sure
Riddikulus
roared
Lupin
springing
forward
there
was
a
loud
crack
and
harry's
cloudy
Patronus
vanished
along
with
the
dementor
he
sank
into
a
chair
feeling
as
exhausted
as
if
he'd
just
run
a
mile
and
felt
his
legs
shaking
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
he
saw
Professor
Lupin
forcing
the
boggart
back
into
the
packing
case
with
his
wand
it
had
turned
into
a
silvery
orb
again
excellent
lupin
said
striding
over
to
where
Harry
sat
excellent
harry
that
was
definitely
a
start
can
we
have
another
go
just
one
more
go
not
now
said
Lupin
firmly
you've
had
enough
for
one
night
here
he
handed
Harry
a
large
bar
of
Honeydukes
best
chocolate
eat
the
lot
or
Madam
Pomfrey
will
be
after
my
blood
same
time
next
week
okay
said
Harry
he
took
a
bite
of
the
chocolate
and
watched
Lupin
extinguishing
the
lamps
that
had
rekindled
with
the
disappearance
of
the
dementor
a
thought
had
just
occurred
to
him
professor
Lupin
he
said
if
you
knew
my
dad
you
must've
known
Sirius
Black
as
well
lupin
turned
very
quickly
what
gives
you
that
idea
he
said
sharply
nothing
I
mean
I
just
knew
they
were
friends
at
Hogwarts
too
lupin's
face
relaxed
yes
I
knew
him
he
said
shortly
or
I
thought
I
did
you'd
better
be
off
Harry
it's
getting
late
harry
left
the
classroom
walking
along
the
corridor
and
around
a
corner
then
took
a
detour
behind
a
suit
of
armor
and
sank
down
on
its
plinth
to
finish
his
chocolate
wishing
he
hadn't
mentioned
Black
as
Lupin
was
obviously
not
keen
on
the
subject
then
harry's
thoughts
wandered
back
to
his
mother
and
father
he
felt
drained
and
strangely
empty
even
though
he
was
so
full
of
chocolate
terrible
though
it
was
to
hear
his
parents
last
moments
replayed
inside
his
head
these
were
the
only
times
Harry
had
heard
their
voices
since
he
was
a
very
small
child
but
he'd
never
be
able
to
produce
a
proper
Patronus
if
he
half
wanted
to
hear
his
parents
again
they're
dead
he
told
himself
sternly
they're
dead
and
listening
to
echoes
of
them
won't
bring
them
back
you'd
better
get
a
grip
on
yourself
if
you
want
that
Quidditch
Cup
he
stood
up
crammed
the
last
bit
of
chocolate
into
his
mouth
and
headed
back
to
Gryffindor
Tower
ravenclaw
played
Slytherin
a
week
after
the
start
of
term
slytherin
won
though
narrowly
according
to
Wood
this
was
good
news
for
Gryffindor
who
would
take
second
place
if
they
beat
Ravenclaw
too
he
therefore
increased
the
number
of
team
practices
to
five
a
leek
this
meant
that
with
lupin's
antidementor
classes
which
in
themselves
were
more
draining
than
six
Quidditch
practices
Harry
had
just
one
night
a
week
to
do
all
his
homework
even
so
he
was
showing
the
strain
nearly
as
much
as
Hermione
whose
immense
workload
finally
seemed
to
be
getting
to
her
every
night
without
fail
Hermione
was
to
be
seen
in
a
corner
of
the
common
room
several
tables
spread
with
books
Arithmancy
charts
rune
dictionaries
diagrams
of
Muggles
lifting
heavy
objects
and
file
upon
file
of
extensive
notes
she
barely
spoke
to
anybody
and
snapped
when
she
was
interrupted
how's
she
doing
it
ron
muttered
to
Harry
one
evening
as
Harry
sat
finishing
a
nasty
essay
on
Undetectable
Poisons
for
Snape
harry
looked
up
hermione
was
barely
visible
behind
a
tottering
pile
of
books
doing
what
getting
to
all
her
classes
ron
said
i
heard
her
talking
to
Professor
Vector
that
Arithmancy
witch
this
morning
they
were
going
on
about
yesterday's
lesson
but
Hermione
can't
ve
been
there
because
she
was
with
us
in
Care
of
Magical
Creatures
and
Ernie
McMillan
told
me
she's
never
missed
a
Muggle
Studies
class
but
half
of
them
are
at
the
same
time
as
Divination
and
she's
never
missed
one
of
them
either
harry
didn't
have
time
to
fathom
the
mystery
of
hermione's
impossible
schedule
at
the
moment
he
really
needed
to
get
on
with
snape's
essay
two
seconds
later
however
he
was
interrupted
again
this
time
by
Wood
bad
news
Harry
i've
just
been
to
see
Professor
McGonagall
about
the
Firebolt
she
er
got
a
bit
shirty
with
me
told
m
i'd
got
my
priorities
wrong
seemed
to
think
I
cared
more
about
winning
the
Cup
than
I
do
about
you
staying
alive
just
because
I
told
her
I
didn't
care
if
it
threw
you
off
as
long
as
you
caught
the
Snitch
first
wood
shook
his
head
in
disbelief
honestly
the
way
she
was
yelling
at
me
you'd
think
i'd
said
something
terrible
then
I
asked
her
how
much
longer
she
was
going
to
keep
it
he
screwed
up
his
face
and
imitated
Professor
mcgonagall's
severe
voice
as
long
as
necessary
Wood
i
reckon
it's
time
you
ordered
a
new
broom
Harry
there's
an
order
form
at
the
back
of
Which
Broomstick
you
could
get
a
Nimbus
Two
Thousand
and
One
like
malfoy's
got
i'm
not
buying
anything
Malfoy
thinks
is
good
said
Harry
flatly
january
faded
imperceptibly
into
February
with
no
change
in
the
bitterly
cold
weather
the
match
against
Ravenclaw
was
drawing
nearer
and
nearer
but
Harry
still
hadn't
ordered
a
new
broom
he
was
now
asking
Professor
McGonagall
for
news
of
the
Firebolt
after
every
Transfiguration
lesson
Ron
standing
hopefully
at
his
shoulder
Hermione
rushing
past
with
her
face
averted
no
Potter
you
can't
have
it
back
yet
Professor
McGonagall
told
him
the
twelfth
time
this
happened
before
he'd
even
opened
his
mouth
we've
checked
for
most
of
the
usual
curses
but
Professor
Flitwick
believes
the
broom
might
be
carrying
a
Hurling
Hex
i
shall
tell
you
once
we've
finished
checking
it
now
please
stop
badgering
me
to
make
matters
even
worse
harry's
antidementor
lessons
were
not
going
nearly
as
well
as
he
had
hoped
several
sessions
on
he
was
able
to
produce
an
indistinct
silvery
shadow
every
time
the
boggartdementor
approached
him
but
his
Patronus
was
too
feeble
to
drive
the
dementor
away
all
it
did
was
hover
like
a
semitransparent
cloud
draining
Harry
of
energy
as
he
fought
to
keep
it
there
harry
felt
angry
with
himself
guilty
about
his
secret
desire
to
hear
his
parents
voices
again
you're
expecting
too
much
of
yourself
said
Professor
Lupin
sternly
in
their
fourth
week
of
practice
for
a
thirteenyearold
wizard
even
an
indistinct
Patronus
is
a
huge
achievement
you
aren't
passing
out
anymore
are
you
i
thought
a
Patronus
would
charge
the
dementors
down
or
something
said
Harry
dispiritedly
make
them
disappear
the
true
Patronus
does
do
that
said
Lupin
but
you've
achieved
a
great
deal
in
a
very
short
space
of
time
if
the
dementors
put
in
an
appearance
at
your
next
Quidditch
match
You
will
be
able
to
keep
them
at
bay
long
enough
to
get
back
to
the
ground
you
said
it's
harder
if
there
are
loads
of
them
said
Harry
i
have
complete
confidence
in
you
said
Lupin
smiling
here
you've
earned
a
drink
something
from
the
Three
Broomsticks
you
won't
have
tried
it
before
he
pulled
two
bottles
out
of
his
briefcase
butterbeer
said
Harry
without
thinking
yeah
I
like
that
stuff
lupin
raised
an
eyebrow
oh
Ron
and
Hermione
brought
me
some
back
from
Hogsmeade
Harry
lied
quickly
i
see
said
Lupin
though
he
still
looked
slightly
suspicious
well
let's
drink
to
a
Gryffindor
victory
against
Ravenclaw
not
that
i'm
supposed
to
take
sides
as
a
teacher
he
added
hastily
They
drank
the
butterbeer
in
silence
until
Harry
voiced
something
he'd
been
wondering
for
a
while
what's
under
a
dementor's
hood
professor
Lupin
lowered
his
bottle
thoughtfully
hmmm
well
the
only
people
who
really
know
are
in
no
condition
to
tell
us
you
see
the
dementor
lowers
its
hood
only
to
use
its
last
and
worst
weapon
what's
that
they
call
it
the
dementor's
Kiss
said
Lupin
with
a
slightly
twisted
smile
it's
what
dementors
do
to
those
they
wish
to
destroy
utterly
i
suppose
there
must
be
some
kind
of
mouth
under
there
because
they
clamp
their
jaws
upon
the
mouth
of
the
victim
and
and
suck
out
his
soul
harry
accidentally
spat
out
a
bit
of
butterbeer
what
they
kill
oh
no
said
Lupin
much
worse
than
that
you
can
exist
without
your
soul
you
know
as
long
as
your
brain
and
heart
are
still
working
but
you'll
have
no
sense
of
self
anymore
no
memory
no
anything
there's
no
chance
at
all
of
recovery
you'll
just
exist
as
an
empty
shell
and
your
soul
is
gone
forever
lost
lupin
drank
a
little
more
butterbeer
then
said
it's
the
fate
that
awaits
Sirius
Black
it
was
in
the
Daily
Prophet
this
morning
the
Ministry
have
given
the
dementors
permission
to
perform
it
if
they
find
him
harry
sat
stunned
for
a
moment
at
the
idea
of
someone
having
their
soul
sucked
out
through
their
mouth
but
then
he
thought
of
Black
he
deserves
it
he
said
suddenly
you
think
so
said
Lupin
lightly
do
you
really
think
anyone
deserves
that
yes
said
Harry
defiantly
for
for
some
things
he
would
have
liked
to
have
told
Lupin
about
the
conversation
he'd
overheard
about
Black
in
the
Three
Broomsticks
about
Black
betraying
his
mother
and
father
but
it
would
have
involved
revealing
that
he'd
gone
to
Hogsmeade
without
permission
and
he
knew
Lupin
wouldn't
be
very
impressed
by
that
so
he
finished
his
butterbeer
thanked
Lupin
and
left
the
History
of
Magic
classroom
harry
half
wished
that
he
hadn't
asked
what
was
under
a
dementor's
hood
the
answer
had
been
so
horrible
and
he
was
so
lost
in
unpleasant
thoughts
of
what
it
would
feel
like
to
have
your
soul
sucked
out
of
you
that
he
walked
headlong
into
Professor
McGonagall
halfway
up
the
stairs
do
watch
where
you're
going
Potter
sorry
Professor
i've
just
been
looking
for
you
in
the
Gryffindor
common
room
Well
here
it
is
we've
done
everything
we
could
think
of
and
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
anything
wrong
with
it
at
all
you've
got
a
very
good
friend
somewhere
Potter
harry's
jaw
dropped
she
was
holding
out
his
Firebolt
and
it
looked
as
magnificent
as
ever
i
can
have
it
back
harry
said
weakly
seriously
seriously
said
Professor
McGonagall
and
she
was
actually
smiling
i
daresay
you'll
need
to
get
the
feel
of
it
before
saturday's
match
won't
you
and
Potter
do
try
and
win
won't
you
or
we'll
be
out
of
the
running
for
the
eighth
year
in
a
row
as
Professor
Snape
was
kind
enough
to
remind
me
only
last
night
speechless
Harry
carried
the
Firebolt
back
upstairs
toward
Gryffindor
Tower
as
he
turned
a
corner
he
saw
Ron
dashing
toward
him
grinning
from
ear
to
ear
she
gave
it
to
You
excellent
listen
can
I
still
have
a
go
on
it
tomorrow
yeah
anything
said
Harry
his
heart
lighter
than
it
had
been
in
a
month
you
know
what
we
should
make
up
with
Hermione
she
was
only
trying
to
help
yeah
all
right
said
Ron
she's
in
the
common
room
how
working
for
a
change
they
turned
into
the
corridor
to
Gryffindor
Tower
and
saw
Neville
Longbottom
pleading
with
Sir
Cadogan
who
seemed
to
be
refusing
him
entrance
i
wrote
them
down
neville
was
saying
tearfully
but
I
must've
dropped
them
somewhere
a
likely
tale
roared
Sir
Cadogan
then
spotting
Harry
and
Ron
Good
even
my
fine
young
yeomen
come
clap
this
loon
in
irons
he
is
trying
to
force
entry
to
the
chambers
within
oh
shut
up
said
Ron
as
he
and
Harry
drew
level
with
Neville
i've
lost
the
passwords
neville
told
them
miserably
i
made
him
tell
me
what
passwords
he
was
going
to
use
this
week
because
he
keeps
changing
them
and
now
I
don't
know
what
i've
done
with
them
oddsbodikins
said
Harry
to
Sir
Cadogan
who
looked
extremely
disappointed
and
reluctantly
swung
forward
to
let
them
into
the
common
room
there
was
a
sudden
excited
murmur
as
every
head
turned
and
the
next
moment
Harry
was
surrounded
by
people
exclaiming
over
his
Firebolt
where'd
you
get
it
Harry
will
you
let
me
have
a
go
have
you
ridden
it
yet
Harry
ravenclaw'll
have
no
chance
they're
all
on
Cleansweep
Sevens
can
I
just
hold
it
Harry
after
ten
minutes
or
so
during
which
the
Firebolt
was
Passed
around
and
admired
from
every
angle
the
crowd
dispersed
and
Harry
and
Ron
had
a
clear
view
of
Hermione
the
only
person
who
hadn't
rushed
over
to
them
bent
over
her
work
and
carefully
avoiding
their
eyes
harry
and
Ron
approached
her
table
and
at
last
she
looked
up
i
got
it
back
said
Harry
grinning
at
her
and
holding
up
the
Firebolt
see
Hermione
there
wasn't
anything
wrong
with
it
said
Ron
well
there
might
have
been
said
Hermione
i
mean
at
least
you
know
now
that
it's
safe
yeah
I
suppose
so
said
Harry
id
better
put
it
upstairs
i'll
take
it
said
Ron
eagerly
i've
got
to
give
Scabbers
his
rat
tonic
he
took
the
Firebolt
and
holding
it
as
if
it
were
made
of
glass
carried
it
away
up
the
boys
staircase
can
I
sit
down
then
harry
asked
Hermione
i
suppose
so
said
Hermione
moving
a
great
stack
of
parchment
off
a
chair
harry
looked
around
at
the
cluttered
table
at
the
long
Arithmancy
essay
on
which
the
ink
was
still
glistening
at
the
even
longer
Muggle
Studies
essay
Explain
Why
Muggles
Need
Electricity
and
at
the
rune
translation
Hermione
was
now
poring
over
how
are
you
getting
through
all
this
stuff
harry
asked
her
oh
well
you
know
working
hard
said
Hermione
closeup
Harry
saw
that
she
looked
almost
as
tired
as
Lupin
why
don't
you
just
drop
a
couple
of
subjects
harry
asked
watching
her
lifting
books
as
she
searched
for
her
rune
dictionary
i
couldn't
do
that
said
Hermione
looking
scandalized
arithmancy
looks
terrible
said
Harry
picking
up
a
very
complicatedlooking
number
chart
oh
no
it's
wonderful
said
Hermione
earnestly
it's
my
favorite
subject
it's
but
exactly
what
was
wonderful
about
Arithmancy
Harry
never
found
out
at
that
precise
moment
a
strangled
yell
echoed
down
the
boys
staircase
the
whole
common
room
fell
silent
staring
petrified
at
the
entrance
then
came
hurried
footsteps
growing
louder
and
louder
and
then
Ron
came
leaping
into
view
dragging
with
him
a
bedsheet
look
he
bellowed
striding
over
to
hermione's
table
look
he
yelled
shaking
the
sheets
in
her
face
ron
what
scabbers
look
scabbers
hermione
was
leaning
away
from
Ron
looking
utterly
bewildered
harry
looked
down
at
the
sheet
Ron
was
holding
there
was
something
red
on
it
something
that
looked
horribly
like
blood
ron
yelled
into
the
stunned
silence
he's
gone
and
you
know
what
was
on
the
floor
n
no
said
Hermione
in
a
trembling
voice
ron
threw
something
down
onto
hermione's
rune
translation
hermione
and
Harry
leaned
forward
lying
on
top
of
the
weird
spiky
shapes
were
several
long
ginger
cat
hairs
chapter
thirteen
gryffindor
versus
ravenclaw
it
looked
like
the
end
of
Ron
and
hermione's
friendship
each
was
so
angry
with
the
other
that
Harry
couldn't
see
how
they'd
ever
make
up
ron
was
enraged
that
Hermione
had
never
taken
crookshanks's
attempts
to
eat
Scabbers
seriously
hadn't
bothered
to
keep
a
close
enough
watch
on
him
and
was
still
trying
to
pretend
that
Crookshanks
was
innocent
by
suggesting
that
Ron
look
for
Scabbers
under
all
the
boys
beds
hermione
meanwhile
maintained
fiercely
that
Ron
had
no
proof
that
Crookshanks
had
eaten
Scabbers
that
the
ginger
hairs
might
have
been
there
since
Christmas
and
that
Ron
had
been
prejudiced
against
her
cat
ever
since
Crookshanks
had
landed
on
ron's
head
in
the
Magical
Menagerie
personally
Harry
was
sure
that
Crookshanks
had
eaten
Scabbers
and
when
he
tried
to
point
out
to
Hermione
that
the
evidence
all
pointed
that
way
she
lost
her
temper
with
Harry
too
okay
side
with
Ron
I
knew
you
would
she
said
shrilly
first
the
Firebolt
now
Scabbers
everything's
my
fault
isn't
it
just
leave
me
alone
Harry
i've
got
a
lot
of
work
to
do
ron
had
taken
the
loss
of
his
rat
very
hard
indeed
come
on
Ron
you
were
always
saying
how
boring
Scabbers
was
said
Fred
bracingly
and
he's
been
offcolor
for
ages
he
was
wasting
away
it
was
probably
better
for
him
to
snuff
it
quickly
one
swallow
he
probably
didn't
feel
a
thing
fred
said
Ginny
indignantly
all
he
did
was
eat
and
sleep
Ron
you
said
it
yourself
said
George
he
bit
Goyle
for
us
once
ron
said
miserably
remember
Harry
yeah
that's
true
said
Harry
his
finest
hour
said
Fred
unable
to
keep
a
straight
face
let
the
scar
on
goyle's
finger
stand
as
a
lasting
tribute
to
his
memory
oh
come
on
Ron
get
yourself
down
to
Hogsmeade
and
buy
a
new
rat
what's
the
point
of
moaning
in
a
lastditch
attempt
to
cheer
Ron
up
Harry
persuaded
him
to
come
along
to
the
Gryffindor
team's
final
practice
before
the
Ravenclaw
match
so
that
he
could
have
a
ride
on
the
Firebolt
after
they'd
finished
this
did
seem
to
take
ron's
mind
off
Scabbers
for
a
moment
Great
can
I
try
and
shoot
a
few
goals
on
it
so
they
set
off
for
the
Quidditch
field
together
madam
Hooch
who
was
still
overseeing
Gryffindor
practices
to
keep
an
eye
on
Harry
was
just
as
impressed
with
the
Firebolt
as
everyone
else
had
been
she
took
it
in
her
hands
before
takeoff
and
gave
them
the
benefit
of
her
professional
opinion
look
at
the
balance
on
it
if
the
Nimbus
series
has
a
fault
it's
a
slight
list
to
the
tail
end
you
often
find
they
develop
a
drag
after
a
few
years
they've
updated
the
handle
too
a
bit
slimmer
than
the
Cleansweeps
reminds
me
of
the
old
Silver
Arrows
a
Pity
they've
stopped
making
them
i
learned
to
fly
on
one
and
a
very
fine
old
broom
it
was
too
she
continued
in
this
vein
for
some
time
until
Wood
said
Er
Madam
Hooch
is
it
okay
if
Harry
has
the
Firebolt
back
we
need
to
practice
oh
right
here
you
are
then
Potter
said
Madam
Hooch
i'll
sit
over
here
with
Weasley
she
and
Ron
left
the
field
to
sit
in
the
stadium
and
the
Gryffindor
team
gathered
around
Wood
for
his
final
instructions
for
tomorrow's
match
harry
i've
just
found
out
who
Ravenclaw
is
playing
as
Seeker
it's
Cho
Chang
she's
a
fourth
year
and
she's
pretty
good
i
really
hoped
she
wouldn't
be
fit
she's
had
some
problems
with
injuries
wood
scowled
his
displeasure
that
Cho
Chang
had
made
a
full
recovery
then
said
On
the
other
hand
she
rides
a
Comet
Two
Sixty
which
is
going
to
look
like
a
joke
next
to
the
Firebolt
he
gave
harry's
broom
a
look
of
fervent
admiration
then
said
Okay
everyone
let's
go
and
at
long
last
Harry
mounted
his
Firebolt
and
kicked
off
from
the
ground
it
was
better
than
he'd
ever
dreamed
the
Firebolt
turned
with
the
lightest
touch
it
seemed
to
obey
his
thoughts
rather
than
his
grip
it
sped
across
the
field
at
such
speed
that
the
stadium
turned
into
a
greenandgray
blur
Harry
turned
it
so
sharply
that
Alicia
Spinnet
screamed
then
he
went
into
a
perfectly
controlled
dive
brushing
the
grassy
field
with
his
toes
before
rising
thirty
forty
fifty
feet
into
the
air
again
harry
i'm
letting
the
Snitch
out
wood
called
harry
turned
and
raced
a
Bludger
toward
the
goal
posts
he
outstripped
it
easily
saw
the
Snitch
dart
out
from
behind
Wood
and
within
ten
seconds
had
caught
it
tightly
in
his
hand
the
team
cheered
madly
harry
let
the
Snitch
go
again
gave
it
a
minute's
head
start
then
tore
after
it
weaving
in
and
out
of
the
others
he
spotted
it
lurking
near
Katie
bell's
knee
looped
her
easily
and
caught
it
again
it
was
the
best
practice
ever
the
team
inspired
by
the
presence
of
the
Firebolt
in
their
midst
performed
their
best
moves
faultlessly
and
by
the
time
they
hit
the
ground
again
Wood
didn't
have
a
single
criticism
to
make
which
as
George
Weasley
pointed
out
was
a
first
i
can't
see
what's
going
to
stop
us
tomorrow
said
Wood
not
unless
Harry
you've
sorted
out
your
dementor
problem
haven't
you
yeah
said
Harry
thinking
of
his
feeble
Patronus
and
wishing
it
were
stronger
the
dementors
won't
turn
up
again
Oliver
dumbledore'd
go
ballistic
said
Fred
confidently
well
let's
hope
not
said
Wood
anyway
good
work
everyone
let's
get
back
to
the
tower
turn
in
early
i'm
staying
out
for
a
bit
Ron
wants
a
go
on
the
Firebolt
Harry
told
Wood
and
while
the
rest
of
the
team
headed
off
to
the
locker
rooms
harry
strode
over
to
Ron
who
vaulted
the
barrier
to
the
stands
and
came
to
meet
him
madam
Hooch
had
fallen
asleep
in
her
seat
here
you
go
said
Harry
handing
Ron
the
Firebolt
ron
an
expression
of
ecstasy
on
his
face
mounted
the
broom
and
zoomed
off
into
the
gathering
darkness
while
Harry
walked
around
the
edge
of
the
field
watching
him
night
had
fallen
before
Madam
Hooch
awoke
with
a
start
told
Harry
and
Ron
off
for
not
waking
her
and
insisted
that
they
go
back
to
the
castle
harry
shouldered
the
Firebolt
and
he
and
Ron
walked
out
of
the
shadowy
stadium
discussing
the
firebolt's
superbly
smooth
action
its
phenomenal
acceleration
and
its
pinpoint
turning
they
were
halfway
toward
the
castle
when
Harry
glancing
to
his
left
saw
something
that
made
his
heart
turn
over
a
pair
of
eyes
gleaming
out
of
the
darkness
harry
stopped
dead
his
heart
banging
against
his
ribs
what's
the
matter
said
Ron
harry
pointed
ron
pulled
out
his
wand
and
muttered
Lumos
a
beam
of
light
fell
across
the
grass
hit
the
bottom
of
a
tree
and
illuminated
its
branches
there
crouching
among
the
budding
leaves
was
Crookshanks
get
out
of
here
ron
roared
and
he
stooped
down
and
seized
a
stone
lying
on
the
grass
but
before
he
could
do
anything
else
Crookshanks
had
vanished
with
one
swish
of
his
long
ginger
tail
see
ron
said
furiously
chucking
the
stone
down
again
she's
still
letting
him
wander
about
wherever
he
wants
probably
washing
down
Scabbers
with
a
couple
of
birds
now
harry
didn't
say
anything
he
took
a
deep
breath
as
relief
seeped
through
him
he
had
been
sure
for
a
moment
that
those
eyes
had
belonged
to
the
Grim
they
set
off
for
the
castle
once
more
slightly
ashamed
of
his
moment
of
panic
Harry
didn't
say
anything
to
Ron
nor
did
he
look
left
or
right
until
they
had
reached
the
welllit
entrance
hall
harry
went
down
to
breakfast
the
next
morning
with
the
rest
of
the
boys
in
his
dormitory
all
of
whom
seemed
to
think
the
Firebolt
deserved
a
sort
of
guard
of
honor
as
Harry
entered
the
Great
Hall
heads
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
Firebolt
and
there
was
a
good
deal
of
excited
muttering
harry
saw
with
enormous
satisfaction
that
the
Slytherin
team
were
all
looking
thunderstruck
did
you
see
his
face
said
Ron
gleefully
looking
back
at
Malfay
he
can't
believe
it
this
is
brilliant
wood
too
was
basking
in
the
reflected
glory
of
the
Firebolt
put
it
here
Harry
he
said
laying
the
broom
in
the
middle
of
the
table
and
carefully
turning
it
so
that
its
name
faced
upward
people
from
the
Ravenclaw
and
Hufflepuff
tables
were
soon
coming
over
to
look
cedric
Diggory
came
over
to
congratulate
Harry
on
having
acquired
such
a
superb
replacement
for
his
Nimbus
and
percy's
Ravenclaw
girlfriend
penelope
Clearwater
asked
if
she
could
actually
hold
the
Firebolt
now
now
Penny
no
sabotage
said
Percy
heartily
as
she
examined
the
Firebolt
closely
penelope
and
I
have
got
a
bet
on
he
told
the
team
ten
Galleons
on
the
outcome
of
the
match
penelope
put
the
Firebolt
down
again
thanked
Harry
and
went
back
to
her
table
harry
make
sure
you
win
said
Percy
in
an
urgent
whisper
i
haven't
got
ten
Galleons
yes
i'm
coming
Penny
andhe
bustled
off
to
join
her
in
a
piece
of
toast
sure
you
can
manage
that
broom
Potter
said
a
cold
drawling
voice
draco
Malfoy
had
arrived
for
a
closer
look
Crabbe
and
Coyle
right
behind
him
yeah
reckon
so
said
Harry
casually
got
plenty
of
special
features
hasn't
it
said
Malfoy
eyes
glittering
maliciously
shame
it
doesn't
come
with
a
parachute
in
case
you
get
too
near
a
dementor
crabbe
and
Goyle
sniggered
pity
you
can't
attach
an
extra
arm
to
yours
Malfoy
said
Harry
then
it
could
catch
the
Snitch
for
you
the
Gryffindor
team
laughed
loudly
malfoy's
pale
eyes
narrowed
and
he
stalked
away
they
watched
him
rejoin
the
rest
of
the
Slytherin
team
who
put
their
heads
together
no
doubt
asking
Malfoy
whether
harry's
broom
really
was
a
Firebolt
at
a
quarter
to
eleven
the
Gryffindor
team
set
off
for
the
locker
rooms
the
weather
couldn't
have
been
more
different
from
their
match
against
Hufflepuff
it
was
a
clear
cool
day
with
a
very
light
breeze
there
would
be
no
visibility
problems
this
time
and
Harry
though
nervous
was
starting
to
feel
the
excitement
only
a
Quidditch
match
could
bring
they
could
hear
the
rest
of
the
school
moving
into
the
stadium
beyond
harry
took
off
his
black
school
robes
removed
his
wand
from
his
pocket
and
stuck
it
inside
the
Tshirt
he
was
going
to
wear
under
his
Quidditch
robes
he
only
hoped
he
wouldn't
need
it
he
wondered
suddenly
whether
Professor
Lupin
was
in
the
crowd
watching
you
know
what
we've
got
to
do
said
Wood
as
they
prepared
to
leave
the
locker
rooms
if
we
lose
this
match
we're
out
of
the
running
just
just
fly
like
you
did
in
practice
yesterday
and
we'll
be
okay
they
walked
out
onto
the
field
to
tumultuous
applause
the
Ravenclaw
team
dressed
in
blue
were
already
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
field
their
Seeker
Cho
Chang
was
the
only
girl
on
their
team
she
was
shorter
than
Harry
by
about
a
head
and
Harry
couldn't
help
noticing
nervous
as
he
was
that
she
was
extremely
pretty
she
smiled
at
Harry
as
the
teams
faced
each
other
behind
their
captains
and
he
felt
a
slight
lurch
in
the
region
of
his
stomach
that
he
didn't
think
had
anything
to
do
with
nerves
wood
Davies
shake
hands
Madam
Hooch
said
briskly
and
Wood
shook
hands
with
the
Ravenclaw
Captain
mount
your
brooms
on
my
whistle
three
two
one
harry
kicked
off
into
the
air
and
the
Firebolt
zoomed
higher
and
faster
than
any
other
broom
he
soared
around
the
stadium
and
began
squinting
around
for
the
Snitch
listening
all
the
while
to
the
commentary
which
was
being
provided
by
the
Weasley
twins
friend
Lee
Jordan
they're
off
and
the
big
excitement
this
match
is
the
Firebolt
that
Harry
Potter
is
flying
for
Gryffindor
according
to
Which
Broomstick
the
firebolt's
going
to
be
the
broom
of
choice
for
the
national
teams
at
this
year's
World
Championship
jordan
would
you
mind
telling
us
what's
going
on
in
the
match
interrupted
Professor
mcgonagall's
voice
right
you
are
Professor
just
giving
a
bit
of
background
information
the
Firebolt
incidentally
has
a
builtin
autobrake
and
jordan
okay
okay
Gryffindor
in
possession
Katie
Bell
of
Gryffindor
heading
for
goal
harry
streaked
past
Katie
in
the
opposite
direction
gazing
around
for
a
glint
of
gold
and
noticing
that
Cho
Chang
was
tailing
him
closely
she
was
undoubtedly
a
very
good
flier
she
kept
cutting
across
him
forcing
him
to
change
direction
show
her
your
acceleration
Harry
fred
yelled
as
he
whooshed
past
in
pursuit
of
a
Bludger
that
was
aiming
for
Alicia
harry
urged
the
Firebolt
forward
as
they
rounded
the
Ravenclaw
goal
posts
and
Cho
fell
behind
just
as
Katie
succeeded
in
scoring
the
first
goal
of
the
match
and
the
Gryffindor
end
of
the
field
went
wild
he
saw
it
the
Snitch
was
close
to
the
ground
flitting
near
one
of
the
barriers
harry
dived
Cho
saw
what
he
was
doing
and
tore
after
him
Harry
was
speeding
up
excitement
flooding
him
dives
were
his
speciality
he
was
ten
feet
away
Then
a
Bludger
hit
by
one
of
the
Ravenclaw
Beaters
came
pelting
out
of
nowhere
Harry
veered
off
course
avoiding
it
by
an
inch
and
in
those
few
crucial
seconds
the
Snitch
had
vanished
there
was
a
great
Ooooooh
of
disappointment
from
the
Gryffindor
supporters
but
much
applause
for
their
Beater
from
the
Ravenclaw
end
george
Weasley
vented
his
feelings
by
hitting
the
second
Bludger
directly
at
the
offending
Beater
who
was
forced
to
roll
right
over
in

to
avoid
it
gryffindor
leads
by
eighty
points
to
zero
and
look
at
that
Firebolt
go
potter's
really
putting
it
through
its
paces
now
see
it
turn
chang's
Comet
is
just
no
match
for
it
the
firebolt's
precision
balance
is
really
noticeable
in
these
long
jordan
are
you
being
paid
to
advertise
firebolts
get
on
with
the
commentary
ravenclaw
was
pulling
back
they
had
now
scored
three
goals
which
put
Gryffindor
only
fifty
points
ahead
if
Cho
got
the
Snitch
before
him
ravenclaw
would
win
harry
dropped
lower
narrowly
avoiding
a
Ravenclaw
Chaser
scanning
the
field
frantically
a
glint
of
gold
a
flutter
of
tiny
wings
the
Snitch
was
circling
the
Gryffindor
goal
post
Harry
accelerated
eyes
fixed
on
the
speck
of
gold
ahead
but
just
then
Cho
appeared
out
of
thin
air
blocking
him
harry
this
is
no
time
to
be
A
gentleman
wood
roared
as
Harry
swerved
to
avoid
a
collision
knock
her
off
her
broom
if
you
have
to
harry
turned
and
caught
sight
of
Cho
she
was
grinning
the
Snitch
had
vanished
again
harry
turned
his
Firebolt
upward
and
was
soon
twenty
feet
above
the
game
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
he
saw
Cho
following
him
she'd
decided
to
mark
him
rather
than
search
for
the
Snitch
herself
all
right
then
if
she
wanted
to
tail
him
she'd
have
to
take
the
consequences
he
dived
again
and
Cho
thinking
he'd
seen
the
Snitch
tried
to
follow
Harry
pulled
out
of
the
dive
very
sharply
she
hurtled
downward
he
rose
fast
as
a
bullet
once
more
and
then
saw
it
for
the
third
time
the
Snitch
was
glittering
way
above
the
field
at
the
Ravenclaw
end
he
accelerated
so
many
feet
below
did
Cho
he
was
winning
gaining
on
the
Snitch
with
every
second
then
Oh
screamed
Cho
pointing
distracted
Harry
looked
down
three
dementors
three
tall
black
hooded
dementors
were
looking
up
at
him
he
didn't
stop
to
think
plunging
a
hand
down
the
neck
of
his
robes
he
whipped
out
his
wand
and
roared
Expecto
patronum
something
silverwhite
something
enormous
erupted
from
the
end
of
his
wand
he
knew
it
had
shot
directly
at
the
dementors
but
didn't
pause
to
watch
his
mind
still
miraculously
clear
he
looked
ahead
he
was
nearly
there
he
stretched
out
the
hand
still
grasping
his
wand
and
just
managed
to
close
his
fingers
over
the
small
struggling
Snitch
madam
hooch's
whistle
sounded
harry
turned
around
in
midair
and
saw
six
scarlet
blurs
bearing
down
on
him
next
moment
the
whole
team
was
hugging
him
so
hard
he
was
nearly
pulled
off
his
broom
down
below
he
could
hear
the
roars
of
the
Gryffindors
in
the
crowd
that's
my
boy
wood
kept
yelling
alicia
Angelina
and
Katie
had
all
kissed
Harry
Fred
had
him
in
a
grip
so
tight
Harry
felt
as
though
his
head
would
come
off
In
complete
disarray
the
team
managed
to
make
its
way
back
to
the
ground
harry
got
off
his
broom
and
looked
up
to
see
a
gaggle
of
Gryffindor
supporters
sprinting
onto
the
field
Ron
in
the
lead
before
he
knew
it
he
had
been
engulfed
by
the
cheering
crowd
yes
ron
yelled
yanking
harry's
arm
into
the
air
yes
yes
well
done
Harry
said
Percy
looking
delighted
ten
Galleons
to
me
must
find
Penelope
excuse
me
good
for
you
Harry
roared
Seamus
Finnigan
ruddy
brilliant
boomed
Hagrid
over
the
heads
of
the
milling
Gryffindors
that
was
quite
some
Patronus
said
a
voice
in
harry's
ear
harry
turned
around
to
see
Professor
Lupin
who
looked
both
shaken
and
pleased
the
dementors
didn't
affect
me
at
all
harry
said
excitedly
i
didn't
feel
a
thing
that
would
be
because
they
er
weren't
dementors
said
Professor
Lupin
come
and
see
he
led
Harry
out
of
the
crowd
until
they
were
able
to
see
the
edge
of
the
field
you
gave
mr.
Malfoy
quite
a
fright
said
Lupin
harry
stared
lying
in
a
crumpled
heap
on
the
ground
were
Malfoy
crabbe
Goyle
and
Marcus
Flint
the
Slytherin
team
Captain
all
struggling
to
remove
themselves
from
long
black
hooded
robes
it
looked
as
though
Malfoy
had
been
standing
on
goyle's
shoulders
standing
over
them
with
an
expression
of
the
utmost
fury
on
her
face
was
Professor
McGonagall
an
unworthy
trick
she
was
shouting
a
low
and
cowardly
attempt
to
sabotage
the
Gryffindor
Seeker
detention
for
all
of
you
and
fifty
points
from
Slytherin
i
shall
be
speaking
to
Professor
Dumbledore
about
this
make
no
mistake
ah
here
he
comes
now
if
anything
could
have
set
the
seal
on
gryffindor's
victory
it
was
this
ron
who
had
fought
his
way
through
to
harry's
side
doubled
up
with
laughter
as
they
watched
Malfoy
fighting
to
extricate
himself
from
the
robe
goyle's
head
still
stuck
inside
it
come
on
Harry
said
George
fighting
his
way
over
party
gryffindor
common
room
now
right
said
Harry
and
feeling
happier
than
he
had
in
ages
he
and
the
rest
of
the
team
led
the
way
still
in
their
scarlet
robes
out
of
the
stadium
and
back
up
to
the
castle
it
felt
as
though
they
had
already
won
the
Quidditch
Cup
the
party
went
on
all
day
and
well
into
the
night
fred
and
George
Weasley
disappeared
for
a
couple
of
hours
and
returned
with
armfuls
of
bottles
of
butterbeer
pumpkin
fizz
and
several
bags
full
of
Honeydukes
sweets
how
did
you
do
that
squealed
Angelina
Johnson
as
George
started
throwing
Peppermint
Toads
into
the
crowd
with
a
little
help
from
Moony
Wormtail
Padfoot
and
Prongs
Fred
muttered
in
harry's
ear
only
one
person
wasn't
joining
in
the
festivities
hermione
incredibly
was
sitting
in
a
corner
attempting
to
read
an
enormous
book
entitled
Home
Life
and
Social
Habits
of
British
Muggles
harry
broke
away
from
the
table
where
Fred
and
George
had
started
juggling
butterbeer
bottles
and
went
over
to
her
did
you
even
come
to
the
match
he
asked
her
of
course
I
did
said
Hermione
in
a
strangely
highpitched
voice
not
looking
up
and
i'm
very
glad
we
won
and
I
think
you
did
really
well
but
I
need
to
read
this
by
Monday
come
on
Hermione
come
and
have
some
food
Harry
said
looking
over
at
Ron
and
wondering
whether
he
was
in
a
good
enough
mood
to
bury
the
hatchet
i
can't
Harry
i've
still
got
four
hundred
and
twentytwo
pages
to
read
said
Hermione
now
sounding
slightly
hysterical
anyway
she
glanced
over
at
Ron
too
he
doesn't
want
me
to
join
in
there
was
no
arguing
with
this
as
Ron
chose
that
moment
to
say
loudly
if
Scabbers
hadn't
just
been
eaten
he
could
have
had
some
of
those
Fudge
Flies
he
used
to
really
like
them
hermione
burst
into
tears
before
Harry
could
say
or
do
anything
she
tucked
the
enormous
book
under
her
arm
and
still
sobbing
ran
toward
the
staircase
to
the
girls
dormitories
and
out
of
sight
can't
you
give
her
a
break
harry
asked
Ron
quietly
no
said
Ron
flatly
if
she
just
acted
like
she
was
sorry
but
she'll
never
admit
she's
wrong
Hermione
she's
still
acting
like
Scabbers
has
gone
on
vacation
or
something
the
Gryffindor
party
ended
only
when
Professor
McGonagall
turned
up
in
her
tartan
dressing
gown
and
hair
net
at
one
in
the
morning
to
insist
that
they
all
go
to
bed
harry
and
Ron
climbed
the
stairs
to
their
dormitory
still
discussing
the
match
at
last
exhausted
Harry
climbed
into
bed
twitched
the
hangings
of
his
fourposter
shut
to
block
out
a
ray
of
moonlight
lay
back
and
felt
himself
almost
instantly
drifting
off
to
sleep
he
had
a
very
strange
dream
he
was
walking
through
a
forest
his
Firebolt
over
his
shoulder
following
something
silverywhite
it
was
winding
its
way
through
the
trees
ahead
and
he
could
only
catch
glimpses
of
it
between
the
leaves
anxious
to
catch
up
with
it
he
sped
up
but
as
he
moved
faster
so
did
his
quarry
harry
broke
into
a
run
and
ahead
he
heard
hooves
gathering
speed
now
he
was
running
flat
out
and
ahead
he
could
hear
galloping
then
he
turned
a
corner
into
a
clearing
and
aaarrgghh
nooo
harry
woke
as
suddenly
as
though
he'd
been
hit
in
the
face
disoriented
in
the
total
darkness
he
fumbled
with
his
hangings
he
could
hear
movements
around
him
and
Seamus
finnigan's
voice
from
the
other
side
of
the
room
what's
going
on
harry
thought
he
heard
the
dormitory
door
slam
at
last
finding
the
divide
in
his
curtains
he
ripped
them
back
and
at
the
same
moment
dean
Thomas
lit
his
lamp
ron
was
sitting
up
in
bed
the
hangings
torn
from
one
side
a
look
of
utmost
terror
on
his
face
black
sirius
Black
with
a
knife
what
here
just
now
slashed
the
curtains
woke
me
up
you
sure
you
weren't
dreaming
Ron
said
Dean
look
at
the
curtains
i
tell
you
he
was
here
they
all
scrambled
out
of
bed
Harry
reached
the
dormitory
door
first
and
they
sprinted
back
down
the
staircase
doors
opened
behind
them
and
sleepy
voices
called
after
them
who
shouted
what're
you
doing
the
common
room
was
lit
with
the
glow
of
the
dying
fire
still
littered
with
the
debris
from
the
party
it
was
deserted
are
you
sure
you
weren't
dreaming
Ron
i'm
telling
you
I
saw
him
what's
all
the
noise
professor
McGonagall
told
us
to
go
to
bed
a
few
of
the
girls
had
come
down
their
staircase
pulling
or
dressing
gowns
and
yawning
boys
too
were
reappearing
excellent
are
we
carrying
on
said
Fred
Weasley
brightly
everyone
back
upstairs
said
Percy
hurrying
into
the
common
room
and
pinning
his
Head
Boy
badge
to
his
pajamas
as
he
spoke
perce
Sirius
Black
said
Ron
faintly
in
our
dormitory
with
a
knife
woke
me
up
the
common
room
went
very
still
nonsense
said
Percy
looking
startled
you
had
too
much
to
eat
Ron
had
a
nightmare
i'm
telling
you
now
really
enough's
enough
professor
McGonagall
was
back
she
slammed
the
portrait
behind
her
as
she
entered
the
common
room
and
stared
furiously
around
i
am
delighted
that
Gryffindor
won
the
match
but
this
is
getting
ridiculous
percy
I
expected
better
of
you
i
certainly
didn't
authorize
this
Professor
said
Percy
puffing
himself
up
indignantly
i
was
just
telling
them
all
to
get
back
to
bed
my
brother
Ron
here
had
a
nightmare
it
wasn't
A
nightmare
ron
yelled
professor
I
woke
up
and
sirius
black
was
standing
over
me
holding
A
knife
professor
McGonagall
stared
at
him
don't
be
ridiculous
Weasley
how
could
he
possibly
have
gotten
through
the
portrait
hole
ask
him
said
Ron
pointing
a
shaking
finger
at
the
back
of
Sir
cadogan's
picture
ask
him
if
he
saw
glaring
suspiciously
at
Ron
Professor
McGonagall
pushed
the
Portrait
back
open
and
went
outside
the
whole
common
room
listened
with
bated
breath
sir
Cadogan
did
you
just
let
a
man
enter
Gryffindor
Tower
certainly
good
lady
cried
Sir
Cadogan
there
was
a
stunned
silence
both
inside
and
outside
the
common
room
you
you
did
said
Professor
McGonagall
but
but
the
password
he
had
em
said
Sir
Cadogan
proudly
had
the
whole
week's
my
lady
read
em
off
a
little
piece
of
paper
professor
McGonagall
pulled
herself
back
through
the
portrait
hole
to
face
the
stunned
crowd
she
was
white
as
chalk
which
person
she
said
her
voice
shaking
which
abysmally
foolish
person
wrote
down
this
week's
passwords
and
left
them
lying
around
there
was
utter
silence
broken
by
the
smallest
of
terrified
squeaks
neville
Longbottom
trembling
from
head
to
fluffy
slippered
toes
raised
his
hand
slowly
into
the
air
chapter
fourteen
snape's
grudge
no
one
in
Gryffindor
Tower
slept
that
night
they
knew
that
the
castle
was
being
searched
again
and
the
whole
House
stayed
awake
in
the
common
room
waiting
to
hear
whether
Black
had
been
caught
professor
McGonagall
came
back
at
dawn
to
tell
them
that
he
had
again
escaped
throughout
the
day
everywhere
they
went
they
saw
signs
of
tighter
security
Professor
Flitwick
could
be
seen
teaching
the
front
doors
to
recognize
a
large
picture
of
Sirius
Black
Filch
was
suddenly
bustling
up
and
down
the
corridors
boarding
up
everything
from
tiny
cracks
in
the
walls
to
mouse
holes
sir
Cadogan
had
been
fired
his
portrait
had
been
taken
back
to
its
lonely
landing
on
the
seventh
floor
and
the
Fat
Lady
was
back
she
had
been
expertly
restored
but
was
still
extremely
nervous
and
had
agreed
to
return
to
her
job
only
on
condition
that
she
was
given
extra
protection
a
bunch
of
surly
security
trolls
had
been
hired
to
guard
her
they
paced
the
corridor
in
a
menacing
group
talking
in
grunts
and
comparing
the
size
of
their
clubs
harry
couldn't
help
noticing
that
the
statue
of
the
oneeyed
witch
on
the
third
floor
remained
unguarded
and
unblocked
it
seemed
that
Fred
and
George
had
been
right
in
thinking
that
they
and
now
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
were
the
only
ones
who
knew
about
the
hidden
passageway
within
it
d'you
reckon
we
should
tell
someone
harry
asked
Ron
we
know
he's
not
coming
in
through
honeyduke's
said
Ron
dismissively
we'd've
heard
if
the
shop
had
been
broken
into
harry
was
glad
Ron
took
this
view
if
the
oneeyed
witch
was
boarded
up
too
he
would
never
be
able
to
go
into
Hogsmeade
again
ron
had
become
an
instant
celebrity
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
people
were
paying
more
attention
to
him
than
to
Harry
and
it
was
clear
that
Ron
was
rather
enjoying
the
experience
though
still
severely
shaken
by
the
night's
events
he
was
happy
to
tell
anyone
who
asked
what
had
happened
with
a
wealth
of
detail
i
was
asleep
and
I
heard
this
ripping
noise
and
I
thought
it
was
in
my
dream
you
know
but
then
there
was
this
draft
i
woke
up
and
one
side
of
the
hangings
on
my
bed
had
been
pulled
down
i
rolled
over
and
I
saw
him
standing
over
me
like
a
skeleton
with
loads
of
filthy
hair
holding
this
great
long
knife
must've
been
twelve
inches
and
he
looked
at
me
and
I
looked
at
him
and
then
I
yelled
and
he
scampered
why
though
ron
added
to
Harry
as
the
group
of
secondyear
girls
who
had
been
listening
to
his
chilling
tale
departed
why
did
he
run
harry
had
been
wondering
the
same
thing
why
had
Black
having
got
the
wrong
bed
not
silenced
Ron
and
proceeded
to
Harry
black
had
proved
twelve
years
ago
that
he
didn't
mind
murdering
innocent
people
and
this
time
he
had
been
facing
five
unarmed
boys
four
of
whom
were
asleep
he
must've
known
he'd
have
a
job
getting
back
out
of
the
castle
once
you'd
yelled
and
woken
people
up
said
Harry
thoughtfully
he'd've
had
to
kill
the
whole
House
to
get
back
through
the
portrait
hole
then
he
would
ve
met
the
teachers
neville
was
in
total
disgrace
professor
McGonagall
was
so
furious
with
him
she
had
banned
him
from
all
future
Hogsmeade
visits
given
him
a
detention
and
forbidden
anyone
to
give
him
the
password
into
the
tower
poor
Neville
was
forced
to
wait
outside
the
common
room
every
night
for
somebody
to
let
him
in
while
the
security
trolls
leered
unpleasantly
at
him
none
of
these
punishments
however
came
close
to
matching
the
one
his
grandmother
had
in
store
for
him
two
days
after
black's
breakin
she
sent
Neville
the
very
worst
thing
a
Hogwarts
student
could
receive
over
breakfast
a
Howler
the
school
owls
swooped
into
the
Great
Hall
carrying
the
mail
as
usual
and
Neville
choked
as
a
huge
barn
owl
landed
in
front
of
him
a
scarlet
envelope
clutched
in
its
beak
harry
and
Ron
who
were
sitting
opposite
him
recognized
the
letter
as
a
Howler
at
once
Ron
had
got
one
from
his
mother
the
year
before
run
for
it
Neville
Ron
advised
neville
didn't
need
telling
twice
he
seized
the
envelope
and
holding
it
before
him
like
a
bomb
sprinted
out
of
the
hall
while
the
Slytherin
table
exploded
with
laughter
at
the
sight
of
him
they
heard
the
Howler
go
off
in
the
entrance
hall
neville's
grandmother's
voice
magically
magnified
to
a
hundred
times
its
Usual
volume
shrieking
about
how
he
had
brought
shame
on
the
whole
family
harry
was
too
busy
feeling
sorry
for
Neville
to
notice
immediately
that
he
had
a
letter
too
hedwig
got
his
attention
by
nipping
him
sharply
on
the
wrist
ouch
oh
thanks
Hedwig
harry
tore
open
the
envelope
while
Hedwig
helped
herself
to
some
of
neville's
cornflakes
the
note
inside
said
dear
Harry
and
Ron
How
Abut

tea
with
me
this
afternoon
round
six
i'll
come
collect
you
from
the
castle

the
entrance
hall
you're
not
allowed
out
on
your
own
cheers
Hagrid
He
probably
wants
to
hear
all
about
Black
said
Ron
so
at
six
o'clock
that
afternoon
Harry
and
Ron
left
Gryffindor
Tower
passed
the
security
trolls
at
a
run
and
headed
down
to
the
entrance
hall
hagrid
was
already
waiting
for
them
all
right
Hagrid
said
Ron
s'pose
you
want
to
hear
about
Saturday
night
do
you
i've
already
heard
all
abou
it
said
Hagrid
opening
the
front
doors
and
leading
them
outside
oh
said
Ron
looking
slightly
put
out
the
first
thing
they
saw
on
entering
hagrid's
cabin
was
Buckbeak
who
was
stretched
out
on
top
of
hagrid's
patchwork
quilt
his
enormous
wings
folded
tight
to
his
body
enjoying
a
large
plate
of
dead
ferrets
averting
his
eyes
from
this
unpleasant
sight
Harry
saw
a
gigantic
hairy
brown
suit
and
a
very
horrible
yellowandorange
tie
hanging
from
the
top
of
hagrid's
wardrobe
door
what
are
they
for
Hagrid
said
Harry
buckbeaks
case
against
the
Committee
fer
the
Disposal
o
Dangerous
Creatures
said
Hagrid
this
Friday
him
an
me'll
be
goin
down
ter
London
together
i've
booked
two
beds
on
the
Knight
Bus
harry
felt
a
nasty
pang
of
guilt
he
had
completely
forgotten
that
buckbeak's
trial
was
so
near
and
judging
by
the
uneasy
look
on
ron's
face
he
had
too
they
had
also
forgotten
their
promise
about
helping
him
prepare
buckbeak's
defense
the
arrival
of
the
Firebolt
had
driven
it
clean
out
of
their
minds
hagrid
poured
them
tea
and
offered
them
a
plate
of
Bath
buns
but
they
knew
better
than
to
accept
they
had
had
too
much
experience
with
hagrid's
cooking
i
got
somethin
ter
discuss
with
you
two
said
Hagrid
sitting
himself
between
them
and
looking
uncharacteristically
serious
what
said
Harry
hermione
said
Hagrid
what
about
her
said
Ron
she's

a
righ
state

what

Hagrid
continued
doggedly
she's

Harry

awkwardly

Hagrid

really
upset

Ron
she's

her
heart
in

Hermione

ron
said
angrily
but
she's
still
sticking
up
for
it
it's
a
maniac
and
she
won't
hear
a
word
against
it
ah
well
people
can
be
a
bit
stupid
abou
their
pets
said
Hagrid
wisely
behind
him
Buckbeak
spat
a
few
ferret
bones
onto
hagrid's
pillow
they
spent
the
rest
of
their
visit
discussing
gryffindor's
improved
chances
for
the
Quidditch
Cup
at
nine
o'clock
Hagrid
walked
them
back
up
to
the
castle
a
large
group
of
people
was
bunched
around
the
bulletin
board
when
they
returned
to
the
common
room
hogsmeade
next
weekend
said
Ron
craning
over
the
heads
to
read
the
new
notice
what
d'you
reckon
he
added
quietly
to
Harry
as
they
went
to
sit
down
well
Filch
hasn't
done
anything
about
the
passage
into
Honeydukes
harry
said
even
more
quietly
harry
said
a
voice
in
his
right
ear
harry
started
and
looked
around
at
Hermione
who
was
sitting
at
the
table
right
behind
them
and
clearing
a
space
in
the
wall
of
books
that
had
been
hiding
her
harry
if
you
go
into
Hogsmeade
again
i'll
tell
Professor
McGonagall
about
that
map
said
Hermione
can
you
hear
someone
talking
Harry
growled
Ron
not
looking
at
Hermione
ron
how
can
you
let
him
go
with
you
after
what
Sirius
Black
nearly
did
to
you
i
mean
it
i'll
tell
so
now
you're
trying
to
get
Harry
expelled
said
Ron
furiously
haven't
you
done
enough
damage
this
year
hermione
opened
her
mouth
to
respond
but
with
a
soft
hiss
Crookshanks
leapt
onto
her
lap
hermione
took
one
frightened
look
at
the
expression
on
ron's
face
gathered
up
Crookshanks
and
hurried
away
toward
the
girls
dormitories
so
how
about
it
ron
said
to
Harry
as
though
there
had
been
no
interruption
come
on
last
time
we
went
you
didn't
see
anything
you
haven't
even
been
inside
zonko's
yet
harry
looked
around
to
check
that
Hermione
was
well
out
of
earshot
okay
he
said
but
i'm
taking
the
Invisibility
Cloak
this
time
on
Saturday
morning
Harry
packed
his
Invisibility
Cloak
in
his
bag
slipped
the
marauder's
Map
into
his
pocket
and
went
down
to
breakfast
with
everyone
else
hermione
kept
shooting
suspicious
looks
down
the
table
at
him
but
he
avoided
her
eye
and
was
careful
to
let
her
see
him
walking
back
up
the
marble
staircase
in
the
entrance
hall
as
everybody
else
proceeded
to
the
front
doors
bye
harry
called
to
Ron
see
you
when
you
get
back
ron
grinned
and
winked
harry
hurried
up
to
the
third
floor
slipping
the
marauder's
Map
out
of
his
pocket
as
he
went
crouching
behind
the
oneeyed
witch
he
smoothed
it
out
a
tiny
dot
was
moving
in
his
direction
harry
squinted
at
it
the
minuscule
writing
next
to
it
read
Neville
Longbottom
harry
quickly
pulled
out
his
wand
muttered
Dissendium
and
shoved
his
bag
into
the
statue
but
before
he
could
climb
in
himself
Neville
came
around
the
corner
harry
i
forgot
you
weren't
going
to
Hogsmeade
either
hi
Neville
said
Harry
moving
swiftly
away
from
the
statue
and
pushing
the
map
back
into
his
pocket
what
are
you
up
to
nothing
shrugged
Neville
want
a
game
of
Exploding
Snap
er
not
now
I
was
going
to
go
to
the
library
and
do
that
vampire
essay
for
Lupin
i'll
come
with
you
said
Neville
brightly
i
haven't
done
it
either
er
hang
on
yeah
I
forgot
I
finished
it
last
night
great
you
can
help
me
said
Neville
his
round
face
anxious
i
don't
understand
that
thing
about
the
garlic
at
all
do
they
have
to
eat
it
or
he
broke
off
with
a
small
gasp
looking
over
harry's
shoulder
it
was
Snape
neville
took
a
quick
step
behind
Harry
and
what
are
you
two
doing
here
said
Snape
coming
to
a
halt
and
looking
from
one
to
the
other
an
odd
place
to
meet
to
harry's
immense
disquiet
snape's
black
eyes
flicked
to
the
doorways
on
either
side
of
them
and
then
to
the
oneeyed
witch
we're
not
meeting
here
said
Harry
we
just
met
here
indeed
said
Snape
you
have
a
habit
of
turning
up
in
unexpected
places
Potter
and
you
are
very
rarely
there
for
no
good
reason
i
suggest
the
pair
of
you
return
to
Gryffindor
Tower
where
you
belong
harry
and
Neville
set
off
without
another
word
as
they
turned
the
corner
Harry
looked
back
snape
was
running
one
of
his
hands
over
the
oneeyed
witch's
head
examining
it
closely
harry
managed
to
shake
Neville
off
at
the
Fat
Lady
by
telling
him
the
password
then
pretending
he'd
left
his
vampire
essay
in
the
library
and
doubling
back
once
out
of
sight
of
the
security
trolls
he
pulled
out
the
map
again
and
held
it
close
to
his
nose
the
third
floor
corridor
seemed
to
be
deserted
harry
scanned
the
map
carefully
and
saw
with
a
leap
of
relief
that
the
tiny
dot
labeled
Severus
Snape
was
now
back
in
its
office
he
sprinted
back
to
the
oneeyed
witch
opened
her
hump
heaved
himself
inside
and
slid
down
to
meet
his
bag
at
the
bottom
of
the
stone
chute
he
wiped
the
marauder's
Map
blank
again
then
set
off
at
a
run
harry
completely
hidden
beneath
the
Invisibility
Cloak
emerged
into
the
sunlight
outside
Honeydukes
and
prodded
Ron
in
the
back
it's
me
he
muttered
what
kept
you
ron
hissed
snape
was
hanging
around
they
set
off
up
the
High
Street
where
are
you
ron
kept
muttering
out
of
the
corner
of
his
mouth
are
you
still
there
this
feels
weird
they
went
to
the
post
office
Ron
pretended
to
be
checking
the
price
of
an
owl
to
Bill
in
Egypt
so
that
Harry
could
have
a
good
look
around
the
owls
sat
hooting
softly
down
at
him
at
least
three
hundred
of
them
from
Great
Grays
right
down
to
tiny
little
Scops
owls
Local
Deliveries
Only
which
were
so
small
they
could
have
sat
in
the
palm
of
harry's
hand
then
they
visited
zonko's
which
was
so
packed
with
students
Harry
had
to
exercise
great
care
not
to
tread
on
anyone
and
cause
a
panic
there
were
jokes
and
tricks
to
fulfill
even
fred's
and
george's
wildest
dreams
Harry
gave
Ron
whispered
orders
and
passed
him
some
gold
from
under
the
cloak
they
left
zonko's
with
their
money
bags
considerably
lighter
than
they
had
been
on
entering
but
their
pockets
bulging
with
Dungbombs
Hiccup
Sweets
Frog
Spawn
Soap
and
a
NoseBiting
Teacup
apiece
the
day
was
fine
and
breezy
and
neither
of
them
felt
like
staying
indoors
so
they
walked
past
the
Three
Broomsticks
and
climbed
a
slope
to
visit
the
Shrieking
Shack
the
most
haunted
dwelling
in
Britain
it
stood
a
little
way
above
the
rest
of
the
village
and
even
in
daylight
was
slightly
creepy
with
its
boarded
windows
and
dank
overgrown
garden
even
the
Hogwarts
ghosts
avoid
it
said
Ron
as
they
leaned
on
the
fence
looking
up
at
it
i
asked
Nearly
Headless
Nick
he
says
he's
heard
a
very
rough
crowd
lives
here
no
one
can
get
in
fred
and
George
tried
obviously
but
all
the
entrances
are
sealed
shut
harry
feeling
hot
from
their
climb
was
just
considering
taking
off
the
cloak
for
a
few
minutes
when
they
heard
voices
nearby
someone
was
climbing
toward
the
house
from
the
other
side
of
the
hill
moments
later
Malfoy
had
appeared
followed
closely
by
Crabbe
and
Goyle
malfoy
was
speaking
should
have
an
owl
from
Father
any
time
now
he
had
to
go
to
the
hearing
to
tell
them
about
my
arm
about
how
I
couldn't
use
it
for
three
months
crabbe
and
Goyle
sniggered
i
really
wish
I
could
hear
that
great
hairy
moron
trying
to
defend
himself
there's
no
arm
in
im
onest
that
hippogriff's
as
good
as
dead
malfoy
suddenly
caught
sight
of
Ron
his
pale
face
split
in
a
malevolent
grin
what
are
you
doing
Weasley
malfoy
looked
up
at
the
crumbling
house
behind
Ron
suppose
you'd
love
to
live
here
wouldn't
you
Weasley
dreaming
about
having
your
own
bedroom
i
heard
your
family
all
sleep
in
one
room
is
that
true
harry
seized
the
back
of
ron's
robes
to
stop
him
from
leaping
on
Malfoy
leave
him
to
me
he
hissed
in
ron's
ear
the
opportunity
was
too
perfect
to
miss
harry
crept
silently
around
behind
Malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
bent
down
and
scooped
a
large
handful
of
mud
out
of
the
path
we
were
just
discussing
your
friend
Hagrid
Malfoy
said
to
Ron
just
trying
to
imagine
what
he's
saying
to
the
Committee
for
the
Disposal
of
Dangerous
Creatures
d'you
think
he'll
cry
when
they
cut
off
his
hippogriff's
splat
malfoy's
head
jerked
forward
as
the
mud
hit
him
his
silverblond
hair
was
suddenly
dripping
in
muck
what
the
ron
had
to
hold
onto
the
fence
to
keep
himself
standing
he
was
laughing
so
hard
malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
spun
stupidly
on
the
spot
staring
wildly
around
Malfoy
trying
to
wipe
his
hair
clean
what
was
that
who
did
that
very
haunted
up
here
isn't
it
said
Ron
with
the
air
of
one
commenting
on
the
weather
crabbe
and
Goyle
were
looking
scared
their
bulging
muscles
were
no
use
against
ghosts
malfoy
was
staring
madly
around
at
the
deserted
landscape
harry
sneaked
along
the
path
where
a
particularly
sloppy
puddle
yielded
some
foulsmelling
green
sludge
splatter
crabbe
and
Goyle
caught
some
this
time
goyle
hopped
furiously
on
the
spot
trying
to
rub
it
out
of
his
small
dull
eyes
it
came
from
over
there
said
Malfoy
wiping
his
face
and
staring
at
a
spot
some
six
feet
to
the
left
of
Harry
crabbe
blundered
forward
his
long
arms
outstretched
like
a
zombie
harry
dodged
around
him
picked
up
a
stick
and
lobbed
it
at
crabbe's
back
harry
doubled
up
with
silent
laughter
as
Crabbe
did
a
kind
of
pirouette
in
midair
trying
to
see
who
had
thrown
it
as
Ron
was
the
only
person
Crabbe
could
see
it
was
Ron
he
started
toward
but
Harry
stuck
out
his
leg
crabbe
stumbled
and
his
huge
flat
foot
caught
the
hem
of
harry's
cloak
harry
felt
a
great
tug
then
the
cloak
slid
off
his
face
for
a
split
second
Malfoy
stared
at
him
aaargh
he
yelled
pointing
at
harry's
head
then
he
turned
tail
and
ran
at
breakneck
speed
back
down
the
hill
Crabbe
and
Goyle
behind
him
harry
tugged
the
cloak
up
again
but
the
damage
was
done
harry
ron
said
stumbling
forward
and
staring
hopelessly
at
the
point
where
Harry
had
disappeared
you'd
better
run
for
it
if
Malfoy
tells
anyone
you'd
better
get
back
to
the
castle
quick
See
you
later
said
Harry
and
without
another
word
he
tore
back
down
the
path
toward
Hogsmeade
would
Malfoy
believe
what
he
had
seen
would
anyone
believe
Malfoy
nobody
knew
about
the
Invisibility
Cloak
nobody
except
Dumbledore
harry's
stomach
turned
over
Dumbledore
would
know
exactly
what
had
happened
if
Malfoy
said
any
thing
Back
into
Honeydukes
back
down
the
cellar
steps
across
the
stone
floor
through
the
trapdoor
Harry
pulled
off
the
cloak
tucked
it
under
his
arm
and
ran
flat
out
along
the
passage
malfoy
would
get
back
first
how
long
would
it
take
him
to
find
a
teacher
panting
a
sharp
pain
in
his
side
Harry
didn't
slow
down
until
he
reached
the
stone
slide
he
would
have
to
leave
the
cloak
where
it
was
it
was
too
much
of
a
giveaway
in
case
Malfoy
had
tipped
off
a
teacher
he
hid
it
in
a
shadowy
corner
then
started
to
climb
fast
as
he
could
his
sweaty
hands
slipping
on
the
sides
of
the
chute
he
reached
the
inside
of
the
witch's
hump
tapped
it
with
his
wand
stuck
his
head
through
and
hoisted
himself
out
the
hump
closed
and
just
as
Harry
jumped
out
from
behind
the
statue
he
heard
quick
footsteps
approaching
it
was
Snape
he
approached
Harry
at
a
swift
walk
his
black
robes
swishing
then
stopped
in
front
of
him
so
he
said
there
was
a
look
of
surpressed
triumph
about
him
harry
tried
to
look
innocent
all
too
aware
of
his
sweaty
face
and
his
muddy
hands
which
he
quickly
hid
in
his
pockets
come
with
me
Potter
said
Snape
harry
followed
him
downstairs
trying
to
wipe
his
hands
clean
on
the
inside
of
his
robes
without
Snape
noticing
they
walked
down
the
stairs
to
the
dungeons
and
then
into
snape's
office
harry
had
been
in
here
only
once
before
and
he
had
been
in
very
serious
trouble
then
too
snape
had
aquired
a
few
more
slimy
horrible
things
in
jars
since
last
time
all
standing
on
shelves
behind
his
desk
glinting
in
the
firelight
and
adding
to
the
threatening
atmosphere
sit
said
Snape
harry
sat
snape
however
remained
standing
mr.
Malfoy
has
just
been
to
see
me
with
a
strange
story
Potter
said
Snape
harry
didn't
say
anything
he
tells
me
that
he
was
up
by
the
Shrieking
Shack
when
he
ran
into
Weasley
apparently
alone
still
Harry
didn't
speak
mr.
Malfoy
states
that
he
was
standing
talking
to
Weasley
when
a
large
amount
of
mud
hit
him
in
the
back
of
the
head
how
do
you
think
that
could
have
happened
harry
tried
to
look
mildly
surprised
i
don't
know
Professor
snape's
eyes
were
boring
into
harry's
it
was
exactly
like
trying
to
stare
down
a
hippogriff
harry
tried
hard
not
to
blink
mr.
Malfoy
then
saw
an
extraordinary
apparition
can
you
imagine
what
it
might
have
been
Potter
no
said
Harry
now
trying
to
sound
innocently
curious
it
was
your
head
Potter
floating
in
midair
there
was
a
long
silence
maybe
he'd
better
go
to
Madam
Pomfrey
said
Harry
if
he's
seeing
things
like
what
would
your
head
have
been
doing
in
Hogsmeade
Potter
said
Snape
softly
your
head
is
not
allowed
in
Hogsmeade
no
part
of
your
body
has
permission
to
be
in
Hogsmeade
i
know
that
said
Harry
striving
to
keep
his
face
free
of
guilt
or
fear
it
sounds
like
malfoy's
having
hallucin
malfoy
is
not
having
hallucinations
snarled
Snape
and
he
bent
down
a
hand
on
each
arm
of
harry's
chair
so
that
their
faces
were
a
foot
apart
if
your
head
was
in
Hogsmeade
so
was
the
rest
of
you
i've
been
up
in
Gryffindor
Tower
said
Harry
like
you
told
Can
anyone
confirm
that
harry
didn't
say
anything
snape's
thin
mouth
curled
into
a
horrible
smile
so
he
said
straightening
up
again
everyone
from
the
Minister
of
Magic
downward
has
been
trying
to
keep
famous
Harry
Potter
safe
from
Sirius
Black
but
famous
Harry
Potter
is
a
law
unto
himself
Let
the
ordinary
people
worry
about
his
safety
famous
Harry
Potter
goes
where
he
wants
to
with
no
thought
for
the
consequences
harry
stayed
silent
snape
was
trying
to
provoke
him
into
telling
the
truth
he
wasn't
going
to
do
it
snape
had
no
proof
yet
how
extraordinarily
like
your
father
you
are
Potter
Snape
said
suddenly
his
eyes
glinting
he
too
was
exceedingly
arrogant
a
small
amount
of
talent
on
the
Quidditch
field
made
him
think
he
was
a
cut
above
the
rest
of
us
too
strutting
around
the
place
with
his
friends
and
admirers
the
resemblance
between
you
is
uncanny
my
dad
didn't
strut
said
Harry
before
he
could
stop
himself
and
neither
do
I
your
father
didn't
set
much
store
by
rules
either
Snape
went
on
pressing
his
advantage
his
thin
face
full
of
malice
rules
were
for
lesser
mortals
not
Quidditch
Cupwinners
his
head
was
so
swollen
shut
up
harry
was
suddenly
on
his
feet
rage
such
as
he
had
not
felt
since
his
last
night
in
Privet
Drive
was
coursing
through
him
he
didn't
care
that
snape's
face
had
gone
rigid
the
black
eyes
flashing
dangerously
what
did
you
say
to
me
Potter
i
told
you
to
shut
up
about
my
dad
harry
yelled
i
know
the
truth
all
right
he
saved
your
life
dumbledore
told
me
you
wouldn't
even
be
here
if
it
wasn't
for
my
dad
snape's
sallow
skin
had
gone
the
color
of
sour
milk
and
did
the
headmaster
tell
you
the
circumstances
in
which
your
father
saved
my
life
he
whispered
or
did
he
consider
the
details
too
unpleasant
for
precious
potter's
delicate
ears
harry
bit
his
lip
he
didn't
know
what
had
happened
and
didn't
want
to
admit
it
but
Snape
seemed
to
have
guessed
the
truth
i
would
hate
for
you
to
run
away
with
a
false
idea
of
your
father
potter
he
said
a
terrible
grin
twisting
his
face
have
you
been
imagining
some
act
of
glorious
heroism
then
let
me
correct
you
your
saintly
father
and
his
friends
played
a
highly
amusing
joke
on
me
that
would
have
resulted
in
my
death
if
your
father
hadn't
got
cold
feet
at
the
last
moment
there
was
nothing
brave
about
what
he
did
he
was
saving
his
own
skin
as
much
as
mine
had
their
joke
succeeded
he
would
have
been
expelled
from
Hogwarts
snape's
uneven
yellowish
teeth
were
bared
turn
out
your
pockets
Potter
he
spat
suddenly
harry
didn't
move
there
was
a
pounding
in
his
ears
turn
out
your
pockets
or
we
go
straight
to
the
headmaster
pull
them
out
Potter
cold
with
dread
Harry
slowly
pulled
out
the
bag
of
zonko's
tricks
and
the
marauder's
Map
snap
picked
up
the
zonko's
bag
ron
gave
them
to
me
said
Harry
praying
he'd
get
a
chance
to
tip
Ron
off
before
Snape
saw
him
he
brought
them
back
from
Hogsmeade
last
time
indeed
and
you've
been
carrying
them
around
ever
since
how
very
touching
and
what
is
this
snape
had
picked
up
the
map
harry
tried
with
all
his
might
to
keep
his
face
impassive
spare
bit
of
parchment
he
said
with
a
shrug
snape
turned
it
over
his
eyes
on
Harry
surely
you
don't
need
such
a
very
old
piece
of
parchment
he
said
why
don't
I
just
throw
this
away
his
hand
moved
toward
the
fire
no
harry
said
quickly
so
said
Snape
his
long
nostrils
quivering
is
this
another
treasured
gift
from
mr.
Weasley
or
is
it
something
else
a
letter
perhaps
written
in
invisible
ink
or
instructions
to
get
into
Hogsmeade
without
passing
the
dementors
harry
blinked
snape's
eyes
gleamed
let
me
see
let
me
see
he
muttered
taking
out
his
wand
and
smoothing
the
map
out
on
his
desk
reveal
your
secret
he
said
touching
the
wand
to
the
parchment
nothing
happened
harry
clenched
his
hands
to
stop
them
from
shaking
show
yourself
snape
said
tapping
the
map
sharply
it
stayed
blank
harry
was
taking
deep
calming
breaths
professor
Severus
Snape
master
of
this
school
commands
you
to
yield
the
information
you
conceal
snape
said
hitting
the
map
with
his
wand
as
though
an
invisible
hand
were
writing
upon
it
words
appeared
on
the
smooth
surface
of
the
map
mooney
presents
his
compliments
to
Professor
Snape
and
begs
him
to
keep
his
abnormally
large
nose
out
of
other
people's
business
snape
froze
harry
stared
dumbstruck
at
the
message
but
the
map
didn't
stop
there
more
writing
was
appearing
beneath
the
first
mr.
Prongs
agrees
with
mr.
Moony
and
would
like
to
add
that
Professor
Snape
is
an
ugle
git
it
would
have
been
very
funny
if
the
situation
hadn't
been
so
serious
and
there
was
more
mr.
Padfoot
would
like
to
register
his
astonishment
that
an
idiot
like
that
ever
became
a
professor
harry
closed
his
eyes
in
horror
when
he'd
opened
them
the
map
had
had
its
last
word
mr.
Wormtail
bids
Professor
Snape
good
day
and
advises
him
to
wash
his
hair
the
slimeball
harry
waited
for
the
blow
to
fall
so
said
Snape
softly
we'll
see
about
this
he
strode
across
to
his
fire
seized
a
fistful
of
glittering
powder
from
a
jar
on
the
fireplace
and
threw
it
into
the
flames
lupin
snape
called
into
the
fire
i
want
a
word
utterly
bewildered
Harry
stared
at
the
fire
a
large
shape
had
appeared
in
it
revolving
very
fast
seconds
later
Professor
Lupin
was
clambering
out
of
the
fireplace
brushing
ash
off
his
shabby
robes
you
called
Severus
said
Lupin
mildly
i
certainly
did
said
Snape
his
face
contorted
with
fury
as
he
strode
back
to
his
desk
i
have
just
asked
Potter
to
empty
his
pockets
he
was
carrying
this
snape
pointed
at
the
parchment
on
which
the
words
of
Messrs
moony
wormtail
Padfoot
and
Prongs
were
still
shining
an
odd
closed
expression
appeared
on
lupin's
face
well
said
Snape
lupin
continued
to
stare
at
the
map
harry
had
the
impression
that
Lupin
was
doing
some
very
quick
thinking
well
said
Snape
again
this
parchment
is
plainly
full
of
Dark
Magic
this
is
supposed
to
be
your
area
of
expertise
Lupin
where
do
you
imagine
Potter
got
such
a
thing
lupin
looked
up
and
by
the
merest
halfglance
in
harry's
direction
warned
him
not
to
interrupt
full
of
Dark
Magic
he
repeated
mildly
do
you
really
think
so
severus
it
looks
to
me
as
though
it
is
merely
a
piece
of
parchment
that
insults
anybody
who
reads
it
childish
but
surely
not
dangerous
i
imagine
Harry
got
it
from
a
joke
shop
indeed
said
Snape
his
jaw
had
gone
rigid
with
anger
you
think
a
joke
shop
could
supply
him
with
such
a
thing
you
don't
think
it
more
likely
that
he
got
it
directly
from
the
manufacturers
harry
didn't
understand
what
Snape
was
talking
about
nor
apparently
did
Lupin
you
mean
by
mr.
Wormtail
or
one
of
these
people
he
said
harry
do
you
know
any
of
these
men
no
said
Harry
quickly
you
see
Severus
said
Lupin
turning
back
to
Snape
it
looks
like
a
Zonko
product
to
me
right
on
cue
Ron
came
bursting
into
the
office
he
was
completely
out
of
breath
and
stopped
just
short
of
snape's
desk
clutching
the
stitch
in
his
chest
and
trying
to
speak
i
gave
Harry
that
stuff
he
choked
bought
it
in
zonko's
ages
ago
well
said
Lupin
clapping
his
hands
together
and
looking
around
cheerfully
that
seems
to
clear
that
up
severus
i'll
take
this
back
shall
I
he
folded
the
map
and
tucked
it
inside
his
robes
harry
Ron
come
with
me
I
need
a
word
about
my
vampire
essay
excuse
us
Severus
harry
didn't
dare
look
at
Snape
as
they
left
his
office
he.
Ron
and
Lupin
walked
all
the
way
back
into
the
entrance
hall
before
speaking
then
Harry
turned
to
Lupin
professor
I
i
don't
want
to
hear
explanations
said
Lupin
shortly
he
glanced
around
the
empty
entrance
hall
and
lowered
his
voice
i
happen
to
know
that
this
map
was
confiscated
by
mr.
Filch
many
years
ago
yes
I
know
it
s
a
map
he
said
as
Harry
and
Ron
looked
amazed
i
don't
want
to
know
how
it
fell
into
your
possession
i
am
however
astounded
that
you
didn't
hand
it
in
particularly
after
what
happened
the
last
time
a
student
left
information
about
the
castle
lying
around
and
I
can't
let
you
have
it
back
Harry
harry
had
expected
that
and
was
too
keen
for
explanations
to
protest
why
did
Snape
think
i'd
got
it
from
the
manufacturers
because
Lupin
hesitated
because
these
mapmakers
would
have
wanted
to
lure
you
out
of
school
they'd
think
it
extremely
entertaining
do
you
know
them
said
Harry
impressed
we've
met
he
said
shortly
he
was
looking
at
Harry
more
seriously
than
ever
before
don't
expect
me
to
cover
up
for
you
again
Harry
i
cannot
make
you
take
Sirius
Black
seriously
but
I
would
have
thought
that
what
you
have
heard
when
the
dementors
draw
near
you
would
have
had
more
of
an
effect
on
you
your
parents
gave
their
lives
to
keep
you
alive
Harry
a
poor
way
to
repay
them
gambling
their
sacrifice
for
a
bag
of
magic
tricks
he
walked
away
leaving
Harry
feeling
worse
by
far
than
he
had
at
any
point
in
snape's
office
slowly
he
and
Ron
mounted
the
marble
staircase
as
Harry
passed
the
oneeyed
witch
he
remembered
the
Invisibility
Cloak
it
was
still
down
there
but
he
didn't
dare
go
and
get
it
it's
my
fault
said
Ron
abruptly
i
persuaded
you
to
go
lupin's
right
it
was
stupid
we
shouldn't've
done
it
he
broke
off
they
reached
the
corridor
where
the
security
trolls
were
pacing
and
Hermione
was
walking
toward
them
one
look
at
her
face
convinced
Harry
that
she
had
heard
what
had
happened
his
heart
plummeted
had
she
told
Professor
McGonagall
come
to
have
a
good
gloat
said
Ron
savagely
as
she
stopped
in
front
of
them
or
have
you
just
been
to
tell
on
us
no
said
Hermione
she
was
holding
a
letter
in
her
hands
and
her
lip
was
trembling
i
just
thought
you
ought
to
know
hagrid
lost
his
case
buckbeak
is
going
to
be
executed
chapter
fifteen
the
quidditch
final
he
sent
me
this
Hermione
said
holding
out
the
letter
harry
took
it
the
parchment
was
damp
and
enormous
teardrops
had
smudged
the
ink
so
badly
in
places
that
it
was
very
difficult
to
read
dear
Hermione
We
lost
i'm
allowed
to
bring
him
back
to
Hogwarts
execution
date
to
be
fixed
beaky
has
enjoyed
London
i
won't
forget
all
the
help
you
gave
us
hagrid
They
can't
do
this
said
Harry
they
can't
buckbeak
isn't
dangerous
malfoy's
dad's
frightened
the
Committee
into
it
said
Hermione
wiping
her
eyes
you
know
what
he's
like
they're
a
bunch
of
doddery
old
fools
and
they
were
scared
there'll
be
an
appeal
though
there
always
is
only
I
can't
see
any
hope
nothing
will
have
changed
yeah
it
will
said
Ron
fiercely
you
won't
have
to
do
all
the
work
alone
this
time
Hermione
i'll
help
oh
Ron
hermione
flung
her
arms
around
ron's
neck
and
broke
down
completely
ron
looking
quite
terrified
patted
her
very
awkwardly
on
the
top
of
the
head
finally
Hermione
drew
away
ron
i'm
really
really
sorry
about
Scabbers
she
sobbed
oh
well
he
was
old
said
Ron
looking
thoroughly
relieved
that
she
had
let
go
of
him
and
he
was
a
bit
useless
you
never
know
Mum
and
Dad
might
get
me
an
owl
now
the
safety
measures
imposed
on
the
students
since
black's
second
breakin
made
it
impossible
for
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
to
go
and
visit
Hagrid
in
the
evenings
their
only
chance
of
talking
to
him
was
during
Care
of
Magical
Creatures
lessons
he
seemed
numb
with
shock
at
the
verdict
s'all
my
fault
got
all
tonguetied
they
was
all
sittin
there
in
black
robes
an
I
kep
droppin
me
notes
and
forgettin
all
them
dates
yeh
looked
up
fer
me
Hermione
an
then
Lucius
Malfoy
stood
up
an
said
his
bit
and
the
Committee
jus
did
exac'ly
what
he
told
em
there's
still
the
appeal
said
Ron
fiercely
don't
give
up
Yet
we're
working
on
it
they
were
walking
back
up
to
the
castle
with
the
rest
of
the
class
ahead
they
could
see
Malfoy
who
was
walking
with
Crabbe
and
Goyle
and
kept
looking
back
laughing
derisively
s'no
good
Ron
said
Hagrid
sadly
as
they
reached
the
castle
steps
that
committee's
in
Lucius
malfoy's
pocket
i'm
jus
gonna
make
sure
the
rest
o
beaky's
time
is
the
happiest
he's
ever
had
i
owe
him
that
hagrid
turned
around
and
hurried
back
toward
his
cabin
his
face
buried
in
his
handkerchief
look
at
him
blubber
malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
had
been
standing
just
inside
the
castle
doors
listening
have
you
ever
seen
anything
quite
as
pathetic
said
Malfoy
and
he's
supposed
to
be
our
teacher
harry
and
Ron
both
made
furious
moves
toward
Malfoy
but
Hermione
got
there
first
smack
she
had
slapped
Malfoy
across
the
face
with
all
the
strength
she
could
muster
malfoy
staggered
harry
Ron
Crabbe
and
Goyle
stood
flabbergasted
as
Hermione
raised
her
hand
again
don't
you
dare
call
Hagrid
pathetic
you
foul
you
evil
hermione
said
Ron
weakly
and
he
tried
to
grab
her
hand
as
she
swung
it
back
get
off
Ron
hermione
pulled
out
her
wand
malfoy
stepped
backward
crabbe
and
Goyle
looked
at
him
for
instructions
thoroughly
bewildered
c'mon
Malfoy
muttered
and
in
a
moment
all
three
of
them
had
disappeared
into
the
passageway
to
the
dungeons
hermione
ron
said
again
sounding
both
stunned
and
irnpressed
harry
you'd
better
beat
him
in
the
Quidditch
final
hermione
said
shrilly
you
just
better
had
because
I
can't
stand
it
if
Slytherin
wins
we're
due
in
Charms
said
Ron
still
goggling
at
Hermione
we'd
better
go
they
hurried
up
the
marble
staircase
toward
Professor
flitwick's
classroom
you're
late
boys
said
Professor
Flitwick
reprovingly
as
Harry
opened
the
classroom
door
come
along
quickly
wands
out
we're
experimenting
with
Cheering
Charms
today
we've
already
divided
into
pairs
harry
and
Ron
hurried
to
a
desk
at
the
back
and
opened
their
bags
ron
looked
behind
him
where's
Hermione
gone
harry
looked
around
too
hermione
hadn't
entered
the
classroom
yet
Harry
knew
she
had
been
right
next
to
him
when
he
had
opened
the
door
that's
weird
said
Harry
staring
at
Ron
maybe
maybe
she
went
to
the
bathroom
or
something
but
Hermione
didn't
turn
up
all
lesson
she
could've
done
with
a
Cheering
Charm
on
her
too
said
Ron
as
the
class
left
for
lunch
all
grinning
broadly
the
Cheering
Charms
had
left
them
with
a
feeling
of
great
contentment
hermione
wasn't
at
lunch
either
by
the
time
they
had
finished
their
apple
pie
the
aftereffects
of
the
Cheering
Charms
were
wearing
off
and
Harry
and
Ron
had
started
to
get
slightly
worried
you
don't
think
Malfoy
did
something
to
her
ron
said
anxiously
as
they
hurried
upstairs
toward
Gryffindor
Tower
they
passed
the
security
trolls
gave
the
Fat
Lady
the
password
Flibbertigibbet
and
scrambled
through
the
portrait
hole
into
the
common
room
hermione
was
sitting
at
a
table
fast
asleep
her
head
resting
on
an
open
Arithmancy
book
they
went
to
sit
down
on
either
side
of
her
harry
prodded
her
awake
wh
what
said
Hermione
waking
with
a
start
and
staring
wildly
around
is
it
time
to
go
w
which
lesson
have
we
got
now
divination
but
it's
not
for
another
twenty
minutes
said
Harry
hermione
why
didn't
you
come
to
Charms
what
oh
no
hermione
squeaked
i
forgot
to
go
to
Charms
but
how
could
you
forget
said
Harry
you
were
with
us
till
we
were
right
outside
the
classroom
i
don't
believe
it
hermione
wailed
was
Professor
Flitwick
angry
oh
it
was
Malfoy
I
was
thinking
about
him
and
I
lost
track
of
things
you
know
what
Hermione
said
Ron
looking
down
at
the
enormous
Arithmancy
book
Hermione
had
been
using
as
a
pillow
i
reckon
you're
cracking
up
you're
trying
to
do
too
much
no
i'm
not
said
Hermione
brushing
her
hair
out
of
her
eyes
and
staring
hopelessly
around
for
her
bag
i
just
made
a
mistake
that's
all
i'd
better
go
and
see
Professor
Flitwick
and
say
sorry
i'll
see
you
in
Divination
hermione
joined
them
at
the
foot
of
the
ladder
to
Professor
Trelawneys
classroom
twenty
minutes
later
looking
extremely
harrassed
i
can't
believe
I
missed
Cheering
Charms
and
I
bet
they
come
up
in
our
exams
Professor
Flitwick
hinted
they
might
together
they
climbed
the
ladder
into
the
dim
stifling
tower
room
glowing
on
every
little
table
was
a
crystal
ball
full
of
pearly
white
mist
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
sat
down
together
at
the
same
rickety
table
i
thought
we
weren't
starting
crystal
balls
until
next
term
Ron
muttered
casting
a
wary
eye
around
for
Professor
Trelawney
in
case
she
was
lurking
nearby
don't
complain
this
means
we've
finished
palmistry
Harry
muttered
back
i
was
getting
sick
of
her
flinching
every
time
she
looked
at
my
hands
good
day
to
you
said
the
familiar
misty
voice
and
Professor
Trelawney
made
her
usual
dramatic
entrance
out
of
the
shadows
parvati
and
Lavender
quivered
with
excitement
their
faces
lit
by
the
milky
glow
of
their
crystal
ball
i
have
decided
to
introduce
the
crystal
ball
a
little
earlier
than
I
had
planned
said
Professor
Trelawney
sitting
with
her
back
to
the
fire
and
gazing
around
the
fates
have
informed
me
that
your
examination
in
June
will
concern
the
Orb
and
I
am
anxious
to
give
you
sufficient
practice
hermione
snorted
well
honestly
the
fates
have
informed
her
who
sets
the
exam
she
does
what
an
amazing
prediction
she
said
not
troubling
to
keep
her
voice
low
harry
and
Ron
choked
back
laughs
it
was
hard
to
tell
whether
Professor
Trelawney
had
heard
them
as
her
face
was
hidden
in
shadow
she
continued
however
as
though
she
had
not
crystal
gazing
is
a
particularly
refined
art
she
said
dreamily
i
do
not
expect
any
of
you
to
See
when
first
you
peer
into
the
orb's
infinite
depths
we
shall
start
by
practicing
relaxing
the
conscious
mind
and
external
eyes
Ron
began
to
snigger
uncontrollably
and
had
to
stuff
his
fist
in
his
mouth
to
stifle
the
noise
so
as
to
clear
the
Inner
Eye
and
the
superconscious
perhaps
if
we
are
lucky
some
of
you
will
see
before
the
end
of
the
class
and
so
they
began
harry
at
least
felt
extremely
foolish
staring
blankly
at
the
crystal
ball
trying
to
keep
his
mind
empty
when
thoughts
such
as
this
is
stupid
kept
drifting
across
it
it
didn't
help
that
Ron
kept
breaking
into
silent
giggles
and
Hermione
kept
tutting
seen
anything
yet
harry
asked
them
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour's
quiet
crystal
gazing
yeah
there's
a
burn
on
this
table
said
Ron
pointing
someone's
spilled
their
candle
this
is
such
a
waste
of
time
Hermione
hissed
i
could
be
practicing
something
useful
i
could
be
catching
up
on
Cheering
Charms
professor
Trelawney
rustled
past
would
anyone
like
me
to
help
them
interpret
the
shadowy
portents
within
their
Orb
she
murmured
over
the
clinking
of
her
bangles
i
don't
need
help
Ron
whispered
it's
obvious
what
this
means
there's
going
to
be
loads
of
fog
tonight
both
Harry
and
Hermione
burst
out
laughing
now
really
said
Professor
Trelawney
as
everyone's
heads
turned
in
their
direction
parvati
and
Lavender
were
looking
scandalized
you
are
disturbing
the
clairvoyant
vibrations
she
approached
their
table
and
peered
into
their
crystal
ball
harry
felt
his
heart
sinking
he
was
sure
he
knew
what
was
coming
There
is
something
here
professor
Trelawney
whispered
lowerng
her
face
to
the
ball
so
that
it
was
reflected
twice
in
her
huge
glasses
something
moving
but
what
is
it
harry
was
prepared
to
bet
everything
he
owned
Including
his
Firebolt
that
it
wasn't
good
news
whatever
it
was
and
sure
enough
My
dear
Professor
Trelawney
breathed
gazing
up
at
Harry
it
is
here
plainer
than
ever
before
my
dear
stalking
toward
you
growing
ever
closer
the
Gr
oh
for
goodness
sake
said
Hermione
loudly
not
that
ridiculous
Grim
again
professor
Trelawney
raised
her
enormous
eyes
to
hermione's
face
parvati
whispered
something
to
Lavender
and
they
both
glared
at
Hermione
too
professor
Trelawney
stood
up
surveying
Hermione
with
unmistakable
anger
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
from
the
moment
you
have
arrived
in
this
class
my
dear
it
has
been
apparent
that
you
do
not
have
what
the
noble
art
of
Divination
requires
indeed
I
don't
remember
ever
meeting
a
student
whose
mind
was
so
hopelessly
mundane
there
was
a
moment's
silence
then
Fine
said
Hermione
suddenly
getting
up
and
cramming
Unfogging
the
Future
back
into
her
bag
fine
she
repeated
swinging
the
bag
over
her
shoulder
and
almost
knocking
Ron
off
his
chair
i
give
up
i'm
leaving
and
to
the
whole
class's
amazement
Hermione
strode
over
to
the
trapdoor
kicked
it
open
and
climbed
down
the
ladder
out
of
sight
it
took
a
few
minutes
for
the
class
to
settle
down
again
professor
Trelawney
seemed
to
have
forgotten
all
about
the
Grim
she
turned
abruptly
from
Harry
and
ron's
table
breathing
rather
heavily
as
she
tugged
her
gauzy
shawl
more
closely
to
her
ooooo
said
Lavender
suddenly
making
everyone
start
ooooo
professor
Trelawney
i've
just
remembered
you
saw
her
leaving
didn't
you
didn't
you
Professor
around
Easter
one
of
our
number
will
leave
us
forever
you
said
it
ages
ago
Professor
professor
Trelawney
gave
her
a
dewy
smile
yes
my
dear
I
did
indeed
know
that
Miss
Granger
would
be
leaving
us
one
hopes
however
that
one
might
have
mistaken
the
Signs
the
Inner
Eye
can
be
a
burden
you
know
lavender
and
Parvati
looked
deeply
impressed
and
moved
over
so
that
Professor
Trelawney
could
join
their
table
instead
some
day
hermione's
having
eh
ron
muttered
to
Harry
looking
awed
yeah
harry
glanced
into
the
crystal
ball
but
saw
nothing
but
swirling
white
mist
had
Professor
Trelawney
really
seen
the
Grim
again
would
he
the
last
thing
he
needed
was
another
nearfatal
accident
with
the
Quidditch
final
drawing
ever
nearer
the
Easter
holidays
were
not
exactly
relaxing
the
third
years
had
never
had
so
much
homework
neville
Longbottom
seemed
close
to
a
nervous
collapse
and
he
wasn't
the
only
one
call
this
a
holiday
seamus
Finnigan
roared
at
the
common
room
one
afternoon
the
exams
are
ages
away
what're
they
playing
at
but
nobody
had
as
much
to
do
as
Hermione
even
without
Divination
she
was
taking
more
subjects
than
anybody
else
she
was
usually
last
to
leave
the
common
room
at
night
first
to
arrive
at
the
library
the
next
morning
she
had
shadows
like
lupin's
under
her
eyes
and
seemed
constantly
close
to
tears
ron
had
taken
over
responsibility
for
buckbeak's
appeal
when
he
wasn't
doing
his
own
work
he
was
poring
over
enormously
thick
volumes
with
names
like
The
Handbook
of
Hippogriff
Psychology
and
Fowl
or
Foul
a
Study
of
Hippogriff
Brutality
he
was
so
absorbed
he
even
forgot
to
be
horrible
to
Crookshanks
harry
meanwhile
had
to
fit
in
his
homework
around
Quidditch
practice
every
day
not
to
mention
endless
discussions
of
tactics
with
Wood
the
GryffindorSlytherin
match
would
take
place
on
the
first
Saturday
after
the
Easter
holidays
slytherin
was
leading
the
tournament
by
exactly
two
hundred
points
this
meant
as
Wood
constantly
reminded
his
team
that
they
needed
to
win
the
match
by
more
than
that
amount
to
win
the
Cup
it
also
meant
that
the
burden
of
winning
fell
largely
on
Harry
because
capturing
the
Snitch
was
worth
one
hundred
and
fifty
points
so
you
must
catch
it
only
if
we're
more
than
fifty
points
up
Wood
told
Harry
constantly
only
if
we're
more
than
fifty
points
up
Harry
or
we
win
the
match
but
lose
the
Cup
you've
got
that
haven't
you
you
must
catch
the
Snitch
only
if
we're
i
know
oliver
harry
yelled
the
whole
of
Gryffindor
House
was
obsessed
with
the
coming
match
gryffindor
hadn't
won
the
Quidditch
Cup
since
the
legendary
Charlie
Weasley
ron's
second
oldest
brother
had
been
seeker
but
Harry
doubted
whether
any
of
them
even
Wood
wanted
to
win
as
much
as
he
did
the
enmity
between
Harry
and
Malfoy
was
at
its
highest
point
ever
malfoy
was
still
smarting
bout
the
mudthrowing
incident
in
Hogsmeade
and
was
even
more
furious
that
Harry
had
somehow
wormed
his
way
out
of
punishment
harry
hadn't
forgotten
malfoy's
attempt
to
sabotage
him
in
the
match
against
Ravenclaw
but
it
was
the
matter
of
Buckbeak
that
made
him
most
determined
to
beat
Malfoy
in
front
of
the
entire
school
never
in
anyone's
memory
had
a
match
approached
in
such
a
highly
charged
atmosphere
by
the
time
the
holidays
were
over
tension
between
the
two
teams
and
their
Houses
was
at
the
breaking
point
a
number
of
small
scuffles
broke
out
in
the
corridors
culminating
in
a
nasty
incident
in
which
a
Gryffindor
fourth
year
and
a
Slytherin
sixth
year
ended
up
in
the
hospital
wing
with
leeks
sprouting
out
of
their
ears
harry
was
having
a
particularly
bad
time
of
it
he
couldn't
walk
to
class
without
Slytherins
sticking
out
their
legs
and
trying
to
trip
him
up
Crabbe
and
Goyle
kept
popping
up
wherever
he
went
and
slouching
away
looking
disappointed
when
they
saw
him
surrounded
by
people
wood
had
given
instructions
that
Harry
should
be
accompanied
everywhere
he
went
in
case
the
Slytherins
tried
to
put
him
out
of
action
the
whole
of
Gryffindor
House
took
up
the
challenge
enthusiastically
so
that
it
was
impossible
for
Harry
to
get
to
classes
on
time
because
he
was
surrounded
by
a
vast
chattering
crowd
harry
was
more
concerned
for
his
firebolt's
safety
than
his
own
when
he
wasn't
flying
it
he
locked
it
securely
in
his
trunk
and
frequently
dashed
back
up
to
Gryffindor
Tower
at
break
times
to
check
that
it
was
still
there
all
usual
pursuits
were
abandoned
in
the
Gryffindor
common
room
the
night
before
the
match
even
Hermione
had
Put
down
her
books
i
can't
work
I
can't
concentrate
she
said
nervously
there
was
a
great
deal
of
noise
fred
and
George
Weasley
were
dealing
with
the
pressure
by
being
louder
and
more
exuberant
than
ever
oliver
Wood
was
crouched
over
a
model
of
a
Quidditch
field
in
the
corner
prodding
little
figures
across
it
with
his
wand
and
muttering
to
himself
Angelina
Alicia
and
Katie
were
laughing
at
fred's
and
george's
jokes
harry
was
sitting
with
Ron
and
Hermione
removed
from
the
center
of
things
trying
not
to
think
about
the
next
day
because
every
time
he
did
he
had
the
horrible
sensation
that
something
very
large
was
fighting
to
get
out
of
his
stomach
you're
going
to
be
fine
Hermione
told
him
though
she
looked
positively
terrified
you've
got
a
Firebolt
said
Ron
yeah
said
Harry
his
stomach
writhing
it
came
as
a
relief
when
Wood
suddenly
stood
up
and
yelled
Team
bed
harry
slept
badly
first
he
dreamed
that
he
had
overslept
and
that
Wood
was
yelling
Where
were
you
we
had
to
use
Neville
instead
then
he
dreamed
that
Malfoy
and
the
rest
of
the
Slytherin
team
arrived
for
the
match
riding
dragons
he
was
flying
at
breakneck
speed
trying
to
avoid
a
spurt
of
flames
from
malfoy's
steed's
mouth
when
he
realized
he
had
forgotten
his
Firebolt
he
fell
through
the
air
and
woke
with
a
start
it
was
a
few
seconds
before
Harry
remembered
that
the
match
hadn't
taken
place
yet
that
he
was
safe
in
bed
and
that
the
Slytherin
team
definitely
wouldn't
be
allowed
to
play
on
dragons
he
was
feeling
very
thirsty
quietly
as
he
could
he
got
out
of
his
fourposter
and
went
to
pour
himself
some
water
from
the
silver
jug
beneath
the
window
the
grounds
were
still
and
quiet
no
breath
of
wind
disturbed
the
treetops
in
the
Forbidden
Forest
the
Whomping
Willow
was
motionless
and
innocentlooking
it
looked
as
though
the
conditions
for
the
match
would
be
perfect
harry
set
down
his
goblet
and
was
about
to
turn
back
to
his
bed
when
something
caught
his
eye
an
animal
of
some
kind
was
prowling
across
the
silvery
lawn
harry
dashed
to
his
bedside
table
snatched
up
his
glasses
and
put
them
on
then
hurried
back
to
the
window
it
couldn't
be
the
Grim
not
now
not
right
before
the
match
He
peered
out
at
the
grounds
again
and
after
a
minute's
frantic
searching
spotted
it
it
was
skirting
the
edge
of
the
forest
now
it
wasn't
the
Grim
at
all
it
was
a
cat
harry
clutched
the
window
ledge
in
relief
as
he
recognized
the
bottlebrush
tail
it
was
only
Crookshanks
or
was
it
only
Crookshanks
harry
squinted
pressing
his
nose
flat
against
the
glass
crookshanks
seemed
to
have
come
to
a
halt
harry
was
sure
he
could
see
something
else
moving
in
the
shadow
of
the
trees
too
and
just
then
it
emerged
a
gigantic
shaggy
black
dog
moving
stealthily
across
the
lawn
Crookshanks
trotting
at
its
side
harry
stared
what
did
this
mean
if
Crookshanks
could
see
the
dog
as
well
how
could
it
be
an
omen
of
harry's
death
ron
harry
hissed
ron
wake
up
huh
i
need
you
to
tell
me
if
you
can
see
something
s'all
dark
Harry
Ron
muttered
thickly
what're
you
or
about
down
here
harry
looked
quickly
back
out
of
the
window
crookshanks
and
the
dog
had
vanished
harry
climbed
onto
the
windowsill
to
look
right
down
into
the
shadows
of
the
castle
but
they
weren't
there
where
had
they
gone
a
loud
snore
told
him
Ron
had
fallen
asleep
again
harry
and
the
rest
of
the
Gryffindor
team
entered
the
Great
Hall
the
next
day
to
enormous
applause
harry
couldn't
help
grinning
broadly
as
he
saw
that
both
the
Ravenclaw
and
Hufflepuff
tables
were
applauding
them
too
the
Slytherin
table
hissed
loudly
as
they
passed
harry
noticed
that
Malfoy
looked
even
paler
than
usual
wood
spent
the
whole
of
breakfast
urging
his
team
to
eat
while
touching
nothing
himself
Then
he
hurried
them
off
to
the
field
before
anyone
else
had
finished
so
they
could
get
an
idea
of
the
conditions
as
they
left
the
Great
Hall
everyone
applauded
again
good
luck
Harry
called
Cho
harry
felt
himself
blushing
okay
no
wind
to
speak
of
sun's
a
bit
bright
that
could
impair
your
vision
watch
out
for
it
ground's
fairly
hard
good
that'll
give
us
a
fast
kickoff
wood
paced
the
field
staring
around
with
the
team
behind
him
finally
they
saw
the
front
doors
of
the
castle
open
in
the
distance
and
the
rest
of
the
school
spilling
onto
the
lawn
locker
rooms
said
Wood
tersely
none
of
them
spoke
as
they
changed
into
their
scarlet
robes
harry
wondered
if
they
were
feeling
like
he
was
as
though
he'd
eaten
something
extremely
wriggly
for
breakfast
in
what
seemed
like
no
time
at
all
Wood
was
saying
Okay
it's
time
let's
go
they
walked
out
onto
the
field
to
a
tidal
wave
of
noise
threequarters
of
the
crowd
was
wearing
scarlet
rosettes
waving
scarlet
flags
with
the
gryffindor
lion
upon
them
or
brandishing
banners
with
slogans
like
go
gryffindor
and
lions
for
the
cuk
Behind
the
Slytherin
goal
posts
however
two
hundred
people
were
wearing
green
the
silver
serpent
of
Slytherin
glittered
on
their
flags
and
Professor
Snape
sat
in
the
very
front
row
wearing
green
like
everyone
else
and
a
very
grim
smile
and
here
are
the
Gryffindors
yelled
Lee
Jordan
who
was
acting
as
commentator
as
usual
potter
Bell
Johnson
Spinnet
Weasley
Weasley
and
Wood
widely
acknowledged
as
the
best
team
Hogwarts
has
seen
in
a
good
few
years
lee's
comments
were
drowned
by
a
tide
of
boos
from
the
Slytherin
end
and
here
come
the
Slytherin
team
led
by
Captain
Flint
he's
Made
some
changes
in
the
lineup
and
seems
to
be
going
for
size
rather
than
skill
more
boos
from
the
Slytherin
crowd
harry
however
thought
Lee
had
a
point
malfoy
was
easily
the
smallest
person
On
the
Slytherin
team
the
rest
of
them
were
enormous
captains
shake
hands
said
Madam
Hooch
flint
and
Wood
approached
each
other
and
grasped
each
other's
hand
very
tightly
it
looked
as
though
each
was
trying
to
break
the
other's
fingers
mount
your
brooms
said
Madam
Hooch
three
two
one
the
sound
of
her
whistle
was
lost
in
the
roar
from
the
crowd
as
fourteen
brooms
rose
into
the
air
harry
felt
his
hair
fly
back
off
his
forehead
his
nerves
left
him
in
the
thrill
of
the
flight
he
glanced
around
saw
Malfoy
on
his
tail
and
sped
off
in
search
of
the
Snitch
and
it's
Gryffindor
in
possession
Alicia

of
Gryffindor
with
the
Quaffle

around

the

was
screaming
its
delight
ouch
angelina
was
nearly
thrown
from
her

as
Marcus
Flint
went
smashing
into
her
sorry
said
Flint
as
the
crowd
below
booed
sorry

see
her
a
moment
later
Fred
Weasley
chucked
his
beater's
club
at
the
back
of
flint's
head
flint's
nose
smashed
into
the
handle
of
his
broom
and
began
to

Madam

yelled
Lee
into
the

that

descended
on
the
crowd

harry
turned
the
Firebolt
sharply
to

Flint
still
bleeding

Harry
zoomed
away
gazing
around
for
the
Snitch
but
still
making
sure
he
caught
every
word
of
lee's
commentary
it
was
essential
that
he
hold
Malfoy
off
the
Snitch
until
Gryffindor
was
more
than
fifty
points
up
gryffindor
in

no

madam
hooch's
whistle
rang
out
again
as
she
soared
over
to
Montague
and
began
shouting
at
him
a
minute
later
Katie
had
put

Professor
harry
felt
a
huge
jolt
of
excitement
he
had
seen
the
Snitch
it
was
shimmering
at
the
foot
of
one
of
the
Gryffindor
goal
posts
but
he
mustn't
catch
it
yet
and
if
Malfoy
saw
it
Faking
a
look
of
sudden
concentration
Harry
pulled
his
Firebolt
around
and
sped
off
toward
the
Slytherin
end
it
worked
malfoy
went
haring
after
him
clearly
thinking
Harry
had
seen
the
Snitch
there
whoosh
one
of
the
Bludgers
came
streaking
past
harry's
right
ear
hit
by
the
gigantic
Slytherin
Beater
Derrick
then
again
whoosh
the
second
Bludger
grazed
harry's
elbow
the
other
Beater
Bole
was
closing
in
harry
had
a
fleeting
glimpse
of
Bole
and
Derrick
zooming
toward
him
clubs
raised
He
turned
the
Firebolt
upward
at
the
last
second
and
Bole
and
Derrick
collided
with
a
sickening
crunch
ha
haaa
yelled
Lee
Jordan
as
the
Slytherin
Beaters
lurched
away
from
each
other
clutching
their
heads
too
bad
boys
you'll
need
to
get
up
earlier
than
that
to
beat
a
Firebold
And
it's
Gryffindor
in

again
as
Johnson
takes
the
Quaffle
Flint
alongside
her
poke
him
in
the

Angelina
it

but
Flint

there
was
an
eruption
of
cheers
from
the
Slytherin

and
Lee
swore
so
badly
that
Professor
McGonagall
tried
to
tug
the
magical
megaphone
away
from
him
sorry
Professor
sorry
woia

again
so
Gryffindor
in
the
lead
thirty
points
to
ten
and
Gryffindor
in
possession
it
was
turning
into
the
dirtiest
game
Harry
had
ever
played
in
enraged
that
Gryffindor
had
taken
such
an
early
lead
the
Slytherins
were
rapidly
resorting
to
any
means
to
take
the
Quaffle
bole
hit
Alicia
with
his
club
and
tried
to
say
he'd
thought
she
was
a
Bludger
george
Weasley
elbowed
Bole
in
the
face
in
retaliation
madam
Hooch
awarded
both
teams
penalties
and
Wood
pulled
off
another
spectacular
save
making
the
score
fortyten
to
Gryffindor
the
Snitch
had
disappeared
again
malfoy
was
still
keeping
close
to
Harry
as
he
soared
over
the
match
looking
around
for
it
once
Gryffindor
was
fifty
points
ahead
Katie
scored
fiftyten
fred
and
George
Weasley
were
swooping
around
her
clubs
raised
in

any
of
the
Slytherins
were
thinking
of
revenge
bole
and
Derrick
took
advantage
of
fred's
and
george's
absence
to
aim
both
Bludgers
at
Wood
they
caught
him
in
the
stomach
one
after
the
other
and
he
rolled
over
in
the
air
clutching
his
broom
completely
winded
madam
Hooch
was
beside
herself
you
do
not
attack
the
keeper
unless
the
quaffle
is
within
the
scoring
area
she
shrieked
at
Bole
and
Derrick

and
Angelina
scored

moments
later
Fred
Weasley
pelted
a
Bludger
at
Warrington
knocking
the
Quaffle
Out
of
his
hands
Alicia
seized
it
and
put
it
through
the
Slytherin
goal
seventyten
the
Gryffindor
crowd
below
was
screaming
itself
hoarse
Gryffindor
was
sixty
points
in
the
lead
and
if
Harry
caught
the
Snitch
now
the
Cup
was
theirs
harry
could
almost
feel
hundreds
of
eyes
following
him
as
he
soared
around
the
field
high
above
the
rest
of
the
game
with
Malfoy
speeding
along
behind
him
and
then
he
saw
it
the
Snitch
was
sparkling
twenty
feet
above
him
harry
put
on
a
huge
burst
of
speed
the
wind
was
roaring
in
his
ears
he
stretched
out
his
hand
but
suddenly
the
Firebolt
was
slowing
down
Horrified
he
looked
around
malfoy
had
thrown
himself
forward
grabbed
hold
of
the
firebolt's
tail
and
was
pulling
it
back

harry
was
angry
enough
to
hit
Malfoy
but

panting
with
the
effort
of
holding
onto
the
Firebolt

and
she
too
was
shouting
furiously
alicia
took

but
she
was
so
angry
she
missed
by
several
feet
the
Gryffindor

was
losing

and
the
Slytherins
delighted
by

on

being

looked
around
every

apart
from

was
streaking
up
the

toward
Angelina
including
the
Slytherin
Keeper
they
were
all
going
to
block
her
Harry
wheeled
the
Firebolt
around
bent
so
low
he
was
lying
flat
along
the
handle
and
kicked
it
forward
like
a
bullet
he
shot
toward
the

aaaaaaarrrgh

scattered
as

harry

had

pelted
headlong
into
the
stands
skidded
to
a
halt
in
midair
reversed
and
zoomed
back
into
the
middle
of
the
field
and
then
he
saw
something
to
make
his
heart
stand
still
malfoy
was
diving
a
look
of
triumph
on
his
face
there
a
few
feet
above
the
grass
below
was
a
tiny
golden
glimmer
harry
urged
the
Firebolt
downward
but
Malfoy
was
miles
ahead
Go
go
go
harry
urged
his
broom
he
was
gaining
on
Malfay
Harry
flattened
himself
to
the
broom
handle
as
Bole
sent
a
Bludger
at
him
he
was
at
malfoy's
ankles
he
was
level
Harry
threw
himself
forward
took
both
hands
off
his
broom
he
knocked
malfoy's
arm
out
of
the
way
and
yes
he
pulled
out
of
his
dive
his
hand
in
the
air
and
the
stadium
exploded
harry
soared
above
the
crowd
an
odd
ringing
in
his
ears
the
tiny
golden
ball
was
held
tight
in
his
fist
beating
its
wings
hopelessly
against
his
fingers
then
Wood
was
speeding
toward
him
halfblinded
by
tears
he
seized
Harry
around
the
neck
and
sobbed
unrestrainedly
into
his
shoulder
harry
felt
two
large
thumps
as
Fred
and
George
hit
them
then
angelina's
alicia's
and
katie's
voices
we've

tangled
together
in
a
manyarmed
hug
the
Gryffindor
team
sank
yelling
hoarsely
back
to
earth
wave
upon
wave
of
crimson
supporters
was
pouring
over
the
barriers
onto
the
field
hands
were
raining
down
on
their
backs
harry
had
a
confused
impression
of
noise
and
bodies
pressing
in
on
him
then
he
and
the
rest
of
the
team
were
hoisted
onto
the
shoulders
of
the
crowd
thrust
into
the
light
he
saw

Plastered

professor
McGonagall
was
sobbing
harder
even
than
Wood
wiping
her
eyes
with
an
enormous
Gryffindor
flag
and
there
fighting
their
way
toward
Harry
were
Ron
and
Hermione
words
failed
them
they
simply
beamed
as
Harry
was
borne
toward
the
stands
where
Dumbledore
stood
waiting
with
the
enormous
Quidditch
Cup
if
only
there
had
been
a
dementor
around
as
a
sobbing
Wood
passed
Harry
the

as
he
lifted
it
into

Harry
felt
he
could
have

the
world's
best
Patronus
chapter

professor
trelawney's
prediction
harry's
euphoria
at
finally
winning
the
Quidditch
Cup
lasted
at
least
a
week
even
the
weather
seemed
to
be
celebrating
as
June
approached
the
days
became
cloudless
and
sultry
and
all
anybody
felt
like
doing
was
strolling
onto
the
grounds
and
flopping
down
on
the
grass
with
several
pints
of
iced
pumpkin
juice
perhaps
playing
a
casual
game
of
Gobstones
or
watching
the
giant
squid
propel
itself
dreamily
across
the
surface
of
the
lake
but
they
couldn't
exams
were
nearly
upon
them
and
instead
of
lazing
around
outside
the
students
were
forced
to
remain
inside
the
castle
trying
to
bully
their
brains
into
concentrating
while
enticing
wafts
of
summer
air
drifted
in
through
the
windows
even
Fred
and
George
Weasley
had
been
spotted
working
they
were
about
to
take
their
O
w.l.s
Ordinary
Wizarding
Levels
percy
was
getting
ready
to
take
his
N
e.w.t.s
Nastily
Exhausting
Wizarding
Tests
the
highest
qualification
Hogwarts
offered
as
Percy
hoped
to
enter
the
Ministry
of
Magic
he
needed
top
grades
he
was
becoming
increasingly
edgy
and
gave
very
severe
punishments
to
anybody
who
disturbed
the
quiet
of
the
common
room
in
the
evenings
in
fact
the
only
person
who
seemed
more
anxious
than
Percy
was
Hermione
harry
and
Ron
had
given
up
asking
her
how
she
was
managing
to
attend
several
classes
at
once
but
they
couldn't
restrain
themselves
when
they
saw
the
exam
schedule
she
had
drawn
up
for
herself
the
first
column
read
monday
o'clock
Arithmancy
o'clock
Transfiguration
Lunch
o'clock
Charms
o'clock
Ancient
Runes
Hermione
ron
said
cautiously
because
she
was
liable
to
explode
when
interrupted
these
days
er
are
you
sure
you've
copied
down
these
times
right
what
snapped
Hermione
picking
up
the
exam
schedule
and
examining
it
yes
of
course
I
have
is
there
any
point
asking
how
you're
going
to
sit
for
two
exams
at
once
said
Harry
no
said
Hermione
shortly
have
either
of
you
seen
my
copy
of
Numerology
and
Gramatica
oh
yeah
I
borrowed
it
for
a
bit
of
bedtime
reading
said
Ron
but
very
quietly
hermione
started
shifting
heaps
of
parchment
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
plenty
of
opportunity
to
speak
to
Hagrid
beaky's
gettin
a
bit
depressed
Hagrid
told
them
bending
low
on
the
pretense
of
checking
that
harry's
flobberworm
was
still
alive
bin
cooped
up
too
long
but
still
we'll
know
day
after
tomorrow
one
way
or
the
other
they
had
Potions
that
afternoon
which
was
an
unqualified
disaster
try
as
Harry
might
he
couldn't
get
his
Confusing
Concoction
to
thicken
and
Snape
standing
watch
with
an
air
of
vindictive
pleasure
scribbled
something
that
looked
suspiciously
like
a
zero
onto
his
notes
before
moving
away
then
came
Astronomy
at
midnight
up
on
the
tallest
tower
History
of
Magic
on
Wednesday
morning
in
which
Harry
scribbled
everything
Florean
Fortescue
had
ever
told
him
about
medieval
witchhunts
while
wishing
he
could
have
had
one
of
fortescue's
choconut
sundaes
with
him
in
the
stifling
classroom
wednesday
afternoon
meant
Herbology
in
the
greenhouses
under
a
bakinghot
sun
then
back
to
the
common
room
once
more
with
sunburnt
necks
thinking
longingly
of
this
time
next
day
when
it
would
all
be
over
their
second
to
last
exam
on
Thursday
morning
was
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
professor
Lupin
had
compiled
the
most
unusual
exam
any
of
them
had
ever
taken
a
sort
of
obstacle
course
outside
in
the
sun
where
they
had
to
wade
across
a
deep
paddling
pool
containing
a
grindylow
cross
a
series
of
potholes
full
of
Red
Caps
squish
their
way
across
a
patch
of
marsh
while
ignoring
misleading
directions
from
a
hinkypunk
then
climb
into
an
old
trunk
and
battle
with
a
new
boggart
excellent
Harry
Lupin
muttered
as
Harry
climbed
out
of
the
trunk
grinning
full
marks
flushed
with
his
success
Harry
hung
around
to
watch
Ron
and
Hermione
ron
did
very
well
until
he
reached
the
hinkypunk
which
successfully
confused
him
into
sinking
waisthigh
into
the
quagmire
hermione
did
everything
perfectly
until
she
reached
the
trunk
with
the
boggart
in
it
after
about
a
minute
inside
it
she
burst
out
again
screaming
hermione
said
Lupin
startled
what's
the
matter
p
P
Professor
McGonagall
hermione
gasped
pointing
into
the
trunk
sh
she
said
i'd
failed
everything
it
took
a
little
while
to
calm
Hermione
down
when
at
last
she
had
regained
a
grip
on
herself
she
Harry
and
Ron
went
back
to
the
castle
ron
was
still
slightly
inclined
to
laugh
at
hermione's
boggart
but
an
argument
was
averted
by
the
sight
that
met
them
on
the
top
of
the
steps
cornelius
Fudge
sweating
slightly
in
his
pinstriped
cloak
was
standing
there
staring
out
at
the
grounds
he
started
at
the
sight
of
Harry
hello
there
Harry
he
said
just
had
an
exam
I
expect
nearly
finished
yes
said
Harry
hermione
and
Ron
not
being
on
speaking
terms
with
the
Minister
of
Magic
hovered
awkwardly
in
the
background
lovely
day
said
Fudge
casting
an
eye
over
the
lake
pity
pity
he
sighed
deeply
and
looked
down
at
Harry
i'm
here
on
an
unpleasant
mission
Harry
the
Committee
for
the
Disposal
of
Dangerous
Creatures
required
a
witness
to
the
execution
of
a
mad
hippogriff
as
I
needed
to
visit
Hogwarts
to
check
on
the
Black
situation
I
was
asked
to
step
in
does
that
mean
the
appeal's
already
happened
ron
interrupted
stepping
forward
no
no
it's
scheduled
for
this
afternoon
said
Fudge
looking
curiously
at
Ron
then
you
might
not
have
to
witness
an
execution
at
A
said
Eon
stoutly
the
hippogriff
might
get
off
before
Fudge
could
answer
two
wizards
came
through
the
castle
doors
behind
him
one
was
so
ancient
he
appeared
to
be
withering
before
their
very
eyes
the
other
was
tall
and
strapping
with
a
thin
back
mustache
harry
gathered
that
they
were
representatives
of
the
Committee
for
the
Disposal
of
Dangerous
Creatures
because
tie
very
old
wizard
squinted
toward
hagrid's
cabin
and
said
in
a
feeble
voice
Dear
dear
i'm
getting
too
old
for
this
two
o'clock
isn't
it
Fudge
the
blackmustached
man
was
fingering
something
in
his
belt
Harry
looked
and
saw
that
he
was
running
one
broad
thumb
along
the
blade
of
a
shining
axe
ron
opened
his
mouth
to
say
something
but
Hermione
nudged
him
hard
in
the
ribs
and
jerked
her
head
toward
the
entrance
hall
why'd
you
stop
me
said
Ron
angrily
as
they
entered
the
Great
Hall
for
lunch
did
you
see
them
they've
even
got
the
axe
ready
this
isn't
justice
ron
your
dad
works
for
the
Ministry
you
can't
go
saying
things
like
that
to
his
boss
said
Hermione
but
she
too
looked
very
upset
as
long
as
Hagrid
keeps
his
head
this
time
and
argue
hi
case
properly
they
can't
possibly
execute
Buckbeak
but
Harry
could
tell
Hermione
didn't
really
believe
what
she
was
saying
all
around
them
people
were
talking
excitedly
as
they
ate
their
lunch
happily
anticipating
the
end
of
the
exams
that
afternoon
but
Harry
ron
and
Hermione
lost
in
worry
about
Hagrid
and
Buckbeak
didn't
join
in
harry's
and
ron's
last
exam
was
Divination
hermione's
Muggle
Studies
they
walked
up
the
marble
staircase
together
Hermione
left
them
on
the
first
floor
and
Harry
and
Ron
proceeded
all
the
way
up
to
the
seventh
where
many
of
their
class
were
sitting
on
the
spiral
staircase
to
Professor
trelawney's
classroom
trying
to
cram
in
a
bit
of
lastminute
studying
she's
seeing
us
all
separately
Neville
informed
them
as
they
went
to
sit
down
next
to
him
he
had
his
copy
of
Unfogging
the
Future
open
on
his
lap
at
the
pages
devoted
to
crystal
gazing
have
either
of
you
ever
seen
anything
in
a
crystal
ball
he
asked
them
unhappily
nope
said
Ron
in
an
offhand
voice
he
kept
checking
his
watch
Harry
knew
that
he
was
counting
down
the
time
until
buckbeak's
appeal
started
the
line
of
people
outside
the
classroom
shortened
very
slowly
as
each
person
climbed
back
down
the
silver
ladder
the
rest
of
the
class
hissed
What
did
she
ask
was
it
okay
but
they
all
refused
to
say
she
says
the
crystal
ball's
told
her
that
if
I
tell
you
i'll
have
a
horrible
accident
squeaked
Neville
as
he
clambered
back
down
the
ladder
toward
Harry
and
Ron
who
had
now
reached
the
landing
that's
convenient
snorted
Ron
you
know
i'm
starting
to
think
Hermione
was
right
about
her
he
jabbed
his
thumb
toward
the
trapdoor
overhead
she's
a
right
old
fraud
yeah
said
Harry
looking
at
his
own
watch
itwas
now
two
o'clock
wish
she'd
hurry
up
parvati
came
back
down
the
ladder
glowing
with
pride
she
says
i've
got
all
the
makings
of
a
true
Seer
she
informed
Harry
and
Ron
i
saw
loads
of
stuff
well
good
luck
she
hurried
off
down
the
spiral
staircase
toward
Lavender
ronald
Weasley
said
the
familiar
misty
voice
from
over
their
heads
ron
grimaced
at
Harry
and
climbed
the
silver
ladder
out
of
sight
harry
was
now
the
only
person
left
to
be
tested
he
settled
himself
on
the
floor
with
his
back
against
the
wall
listening
to
a
fly
buzzing
in
the
sunny
window
his
mind
across
the
grounds
with
Hagrid
finally
after
about
twenty
minutes
ron's
large
feet
reappeared
on
the
ladder
how'd
it
go
harry
asked
him
standing
up
rubbish
said
Ron
couldn't
see
a
thing
so
I
made
some
stuff
up
don't
think
she
was
convinced
though
meet
you
in
the
common
room
Harry
muttered
as
Professor
trelawney's
voice
called
Harry
Potter
the
tower
room
was
hotter
than
ever
before
the
curtains
were
closed
the
fire
was
alight
and
the
usual
sickly
scent
made
Harry
cough
as
he
stumbled
through
the
clutter
of
chairs
and
table
to
where
Professor
Trelawney
sat
waiting
for
him
before
a
large
crystal
ball
good
day
my
dear
she
said
softly
if
you
would
kindly
gaze
into
the
Orb
take
your
time
now
then
tell
me
what
you
see
within
it
harry
bent
over
the
crystal
ball
and
stared
stared
as
hard
as
he
could
willing
it
to
show
him
something
other
than
swirling
white
fog
but
nothing
happened
well
professor
Trelawney
prompted
delicately
what
do
you
see
the
heat
was
overpowering
and
his
nostrils
were
stinging
with
the
perfumed
smoke
wafting
from
the
fire
beside
them
he
thought
of
what
Ron
had
just
said
and
decided
to
pretend
er
said
Harry
a
dark
shape
um
what
does
it
resemble
whispered
Professor
Trelawney
think
now
harry
cast
his
mind
around
and
it
landed
on
Buckbeak
a
hippogriff
he
said
firmly
indeed
whispered
Professor
Trelawney
scribbling
keenly
on
the
parchment
perched
upon
her
knees
my
boy
you
may
well
be
seeing
the
outcome
of
poor
hagrid's
trouble
with
the
Ministry
of
Magic
look
closer
does
the
hippogriff
appear
to
have
its
head
yes
said
Harry
firmly
are
you
sure
professor
Trelawney
urged
him
are
you
quite
sure
dear
you
don't
see
it
writhing
on
the
ground
perhaps
and
a
shadowy
figure
raising
an
axe
behind
it
no
said
Harry
starting
to
feel
slightly
sick
no
blood
no
weeping
Hagrid
no
said
Harry
again
wanting
more
than
ever
to
leave
the
room
and
the
heat
it
looks
fine
it's
flying
away
professor
Trelawney
sighed
well
dear
I
think
we'll
leave
it
there
a
little
disappointing
but
i'm
sure
you
did
your
best
relieved
Harry
got
up
picked
up
his
bag
and
turned
to
go
but
then
a
loud
harsh
voice
spoke
behind
him
it
will
happen
tonight
harry
wheeled
around
professor
Trelawney
had
gone
rigid
in
her
armchair
her
eyes
were
unfocused
and
her
mouth
sagging
s
sorry
said
Harry
but
Professor
Trelawney
didn't
seem
to
hear
him
her
eyes
started
to
roll
harry
sat
there
in
a
panic
she
looked
as
though
she
was
about
to
have
some
sort
of
seizure
he
hesitated
thinking
of
running
to
the
hospital
wing
and
then
Professor
Trelawney
spoke
again
in
the
same
harsh
voice
quite
unlike
her
own
the
dark
lord
lies
alone
and
friendless
abandoned
by
his
followers
his
servant
has
been
chained
these
twelve
years
tonight
before
midnight
the
servant
will
break
free
and
set
out
to
rejoin
his
master
the
dark
lord
will
rise
again
with
his
servants
aid
greater
and
more
terrible
than
ever
he
was
tonight
before
midnight
the
servant
will
set
ou
to
rejoin
his
master
professor
trelawney's
head
fell
forward
onto
her
chest
she
made
a
grunting
sort
of
noise
harry
sat
there
staring
at
her
then
quite
suddenly
Professor
trelawney's
head
snapped
up
again
i'm
so
sorry
dear
boy
she
said
dreamily
the
heat
of
the
day
you
know
i
drifted
off
for
a
moment
harry
sat
there
staring
at
her
is
there
anything
wrong
my
dear
you
you
just
told
me
that
the
the
Dark
lord's
going
to
rise
again
that
his
servant's
going
to
go
back
to
him
professor
Trelawney
looked
thoroughly
startled
the
Dark
Lord
heWhoMustNotBeNamed
my
dear
boy
that's
hardly
something
to
joke
about
rise
again
indeed
But
you
just
said
it
you
said
the
Dark
Lord
i
think
you
must
have
dozed
off
too
dear
said
Professor
Trelawney
i
would
certainly
not
presume
to
predict
anything
quite
as
farfetched
as
that
harry
climbed
back
down
the
ladder
and
the
spiral
staircase
wondering
had
he
just
heard
Professor
Trelawney
make
a
real
prediction
or
had
that
been
her
idea
of
an
impressive
end
to
the
test
five
minutes
later
he
was
dashing
past
the
security
trolls
outside
the
entrance
to
Gryffindor
Tower
Professor
trelawney's
words
still
resounding
in
his
head
people
were
striding
past
him
in
the
opposite
direction
laughing
and
joking
heading
for
the
grounds
and
a
bit
of
longawaited
freedom
by
the
time
he
had
reached
the
portrait
hole
and
entered
the
common
room
it
was
almost
deserted
over
in
the
corner
however
sat
Ron
and
Hermione
professor
Trelawney
Harry
panted
just
told
me
but
he
stopped
abruptly
at
the
sight
of
their
faces
buckbeak
lost
said
Ron
weakly
hagrid's
just
sent
this
hagrid's
note
was
dry
this
time
no
tears
had
splattered
it
yet
his
hand
seemed
to
have
shaken
so
much
as
he
wrote
that
it
was
hardly
legible
lost
appeal
they're
going
to
execute
at
sunset
nothing
you
can
do
don't
come
down
i
don't
want
you
to
see
it
hagrid
we've
got
to
go
said
Harry
at
once
he
can't
just
sit
there
on
his
own
waiting
for
the
executioner
sunset
though
said
Ron
who
was
staring
out
the
window
ill
a
glazed
sort
of
way
we'd
never
be
allowed
specially
you
Harry
harry
sank
his
head
into
his
hands
thinking
if
we
only
had
the
Invisibility
Cloak
where
is
it
said
Hermione
harry
told
her
about
leaving
it
in
the
passageway
under
the
oneeyed
witch
if
Snape
sees
me
anywhere
near
there
again
i'm
in
serious
trouble
he
finished
that's
true
said
Hermione
getting
to
her
feet
if
he
sees
you
how
do
you
open
the
witch's
hump
again
you
you
tap
it
and
say
Dissendium
said
Harry
but
hermione
didn't
wait
for
the
rest
of
his
sentence
she
strode
across
the
room
pushed
open
the
Fat
lady's
portrait
and
vanished
from
sight
she
hasn't
gone
to
get
it
ron
said
staring
after
her
she
had
hermione
returned
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
with
the
silvery
cloak
folded
carefully
under
her
robes
hermione
I
don't
know
what's
gotten
into
you
lately
said
Ron
astounded
first
you
hit
Malfoy
then
you
walk
out
on
Professor
Trelawney
hermione
looked
rather
flattered
they
went
down
to
dinner
with
everybody
else
but
did
not
return
to
Gryffindor
Tower
afterward
harry
had
the
cloak
hidden
down
tie
front
of
his
robes
he
had
to
keep
his
arms
folded
to
hide
the
lump
they
skulked
in
an
empty
chamber
off
the
entrance
hall
listening
until
they
were
sure
it
was
deserted
they
heard
a
last
pair
of
people
hurrying
across
the
hall
and
a
door
slamming
hermione
poked
her
head
around
the
door
okay
she
whispered
no
one
there
cloak
on
walking
very
close
together
so
that
nobody
would
see
them
they
crossed
the
hall
on
tiptoe
beneath
the
cloak
then
walked
down
the
stone
front
steps
into
the
grounds
the
sun
was
already
sinking
behind
the
Forbidden
Forest
gilding
the
top
branches
of
the
trees
they
reached
hagrid's
cabin
and
knocked
he
was
a
minute
in
answering
and
when
he
did
he
looked
all
around
for
his
visitor
palefaced
and
trembling
it's
us
Harry
hissed
we're
wearing
the
Invisibility
Cloak
let
us
in
and
we
can
take
it
off
yeh
shouldn've
come
hagrid
whispered
but
he
stood
back
and
they
stepped
inside
hagrid
shut
the
door
quickly
and
Harry
pulled
off
the
cloak
hagrid
was
not
crying
nor
did
he
throw
himself
upon
their
necks
he
looked
like
a
man
who
did
not
know
where
he
was
or
what
to
do
this
helplessness
was
worse
to
watch
than
tears
wan
some
tea
he
said
his
great
hands
were
shaking
as
he
reached
for
the
kettle
where's
Buckbeak
Hagrid
said
Hermione
hesitantly
i
I
took
him
outside
said
Hagrid
spilling
milk
all
over
the
table
as
he
filled
up
the
jug
he's
tethered
in
me
pumpkin
patch
thought
he
oughta
see
the
trees
an
an
smell
fresh
air
before
hagrid's
hand
trembled
so
violently
that
the
milk
jug
slipped
from
his
grasp
and
shattered
all
over
the
floor
i'll
do
it
Hagrid
said
Hermione
quickly
hurrying
over
and
starting
to
clean
up
the
mess
there's
another
one
in
the
cupboard
Hagrid
said
sitting
down
and
wiping
his
forehead
on
his
sleeve
harry
glanced
at
Ron
who
looked
back
hopelessly
isn't
there
anything
anyone
can
do
Hagrid
harry
asked
fiercely
sitting
down
next
to
him
dumbledore

tried

Hagrid

no
power

Committee

hagrid
swallowed
his
eyes
were
darting
all
over
the
cabin
as
though
looking
for
some
shred
of
hope
or
comfort
dumbledore's
gonna
come

dumbledore
hermione
who
had
been
rummaging
in
hagrid's
cupboard
for
another
milk
jug
let
out
a
small
quickly
stifled
sob
she
straightened
up
with
the
new
jug
in
her
hands
fighting
back
tears
we'll
stay
with
you
too
Hagrid
she
began
but
Hagrid
shook
his
shaggy
head

Harry
yeh'll
be
in
big
trouble
silent
tears
were
now
streaming
down
hermione's
face
but
she
hid
them
from
Hagrid
bustling
around
making
tea
then
as
she
picked
up
the
milk
bottle
to
pour
some
into
the
jug
she
let
out
a
shriek
ron
I
don't
believe
it
it's
Scabbers
ron
gaped
at
her
what
are
you
talking
about
hermione
carried
the
milk
jug
over
to
the
table
and
turned
it
upside
down
with
a
frantic
squeak
and
much
scrambling
to
get
back
inside
scabbers
the
rat
came
sliding
out
onto
the
table
scabbers
said
Ron
blankly
scabbers
what
are
you
doing
here
he
grabbed
the
struggling
rat
and
held
him
up
to
the
light
scabbers
looked
dreadful
he
was
thinner
than
ever
large
tufts
of
hair
had
fallen
out
leaving
wide
bald
patches
and
he
writhed
in
ron's
hands
as
though
desperate
to
free
himself
it's
okay
Scabbers
said
Ron
no
cats
there's
nothing
here
to
hurt
you
hagrid
suddenly
stood
up
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
window
his
normally
ruddy
face
had
gone
the
color
of
parchment
they're
comin
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
whipped
around
a
group
of
men
was
walking
down
the
distant
castle
steps
in
front
was
Albus
Dumbledore
his
silver
beard
gleaming
in
the
dying
sun
next
to
him
trotted
Cornelius
Fudge
behind
them
came
the
feeble
old
Committee
member
and
the
executioner
macnair
yeh
gotta
go
said
Hagrid
every
inch
of
him
was
trembling
they
mustn
find
yeh
here
go
now
ron
stuffed
Scabbers
into
his
pocket
and
Hermione
picked
up
the
cloak
i'll
let
yeh
out
the
back
way
said
Hagrid
they
followed
him
to
the
door
into
his
back
garden
harry
felt
strangely
unreal
and
even
more
so
when
he
saw
Buckbeak
a
few
yards
away
tethered
to
a
tree
behind
hagrid's
Pumpkin
patch
buckbeak
seemed
to
know
something
was
happening
he
turned
his
sharp
head
from
side
to
side
and
pawed
the
ground
nervously
it's
okay
Beaky
said
Hagrid
softly
it's
okay
he
turned
to
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
go
on
he
said
get
goin
but
they
didn't
move
hagrid
we
can't
we'll
tell
them
what
really
happened
they
can't
kill
him
go
said
Hagrid
fiercely
it's
bad
enough
without
you
lot
in
trouble
an
all
they
had
no
choice
as
Hermione
threw
the
cloak
over
Harry
and
Ron
they
heard
voices
at
the
front
of
the
cabin
hagrid
looked
at
the
place
where
they
had
just
vanished
from
sight
go
quick
he
said
hoarsely
don
listen
and
he
strode
back
into
his
cabin
as
someone
knocked
at
the
front
door
slowly
in
a
kind
of
horrified
trance
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
set
off
silently
around
hagrid's
house
as
they
reached
the
other
side
the
front
door
closed
with
a
sharp
snap
please
let's
hurry
Hermione
whispered
i
can't
stand
it
I
can't
bear
it
they
started
up
the
sloping
lawn
toward
the
castle
the
sun
was
sinking
fast
now
the
sky
had
turned
to
a
clear
purpletinged
grey
but
to
the
west
there
was
a
rubyred
glow
ron
stopped
dead
oh
please
Ron
Hermione
began
it's
Scabbers
he
won't
stay
put
ron
was
bent
over
trying
to
keep
Scabbers
in
his
pocket
but
the
rat
was
going
berserk
squeaking
madly
twisting
and
flailing
trying
to
sink
his
teeth
into
ron's
hand
scabbers
it's
me
you
idiot
it's
Ron
Ron
hissed
they
heard
a
door
open
behind
them
and
men's
voices
oh
Ron
please
let's
move
they're
going
to
do
it
hermione
breathed
okay
Scabbers
stay
put
they
walked
forward
Harry
like
Hermione
was
trying
not
to
listen
to
the
rumble
of
voices
behind
them
ron
stopped
again
i
can't
hold
him
Scabbers
shut
up
everyone'll
hear
us
the
rat
was
squealing
wildly
but
not
loudly
enough
to
cover
up
the
sounds
drifting
from
hagrid's
garden
there
was
a
jumble
of
indistinct
male
voices
a
silence
and
then
without
warning
the
unmistakable
swish
and
thud
of
an
axe
hermione
swayed
on
the
spot
they
did
it
she
whispered
to
Harry
i
d
don't
believe
it
they
did
it
chapter
seventeen
cat
rat
and
dog
harry's
mind
had
gone
blank
with
shock
the
three
of
them
stood
transfixed
with
horror
under
the
Invisibility
Cloak
the
very
last
rays
of
the
setting
sun
were
casting
a
bloody
light
over
the
long
shadowed
grounds
then
behind
them
they
heard
a
wild
howling
hagrid
Harry
muttered
without
thinking
about
what
he
was
doing
he
made
to
turn
back
but
both
Ron
and
Hermione
seized
his
arms
we
can't
said
Ron
who
was
paperwhite
he'll
be
in
worse
trouble
if
they
know
we've
been
to
see
him
hermione's
breathing
was
shallow
and
uneven
how
could
they
she
choked
how
could
they
come
on
said
Ron
whose
teeth
seemed
to
be
chattering
they
set
off
back
toward
the
castle
walking
slowly
to
keep
themselves
hidden
under
the
cloak
the
light
was
fading
fast
now
by
the
time
they
reached
open
ground
darkness
was
settling
like
a
spell
around
them
scabbers
keep
still
Ron
hissed
clamping
his
hand
over
his
chest
the
rat
was
wriggling
madly
ron
came
to
a
sudden
halt
trying
to
force
Scabbers
deeper
into
his
pocket
what's
the
matter
with
you
You
stupid
rat
stay
still
ouch
he
bit
me
ron
be
quiet
hermione
whispered
urgently
fudge'll
be
out
here
in
a
minute
he
won't
stay
put
scabbers
was
plainly
terrified
he
was
writhing
with
all
his
might
trying
to
break
free
of
ron's
grip
what's
the
matter
with
him
but
Harry
had
just
seen
stinking
toward
them
his
body
low
to
the
ground
wide
yellow
eyes
glinting
eerily
in
the
darkness
Crookshanks
whether
he
could
see
them
or
was
following
the
sound
of
scabbers's
squeaks
Harry
couldn't
tell
crookshanks
hermione
moaned
no
go
away
Crookshanks
go
away
but
the
cat
was
getting
nearer
Scabbers
no
too
late
the
rat
had
slipped
between
ron's
clutching
fingers
hit
the
ground
and
scampered
away
in
one
bound
Crookshanks
sprang
after
him
and
before
Harry
or
Hermione
could
stop
him
Ron
had
thrown
the
Invisibility
Cloak
off
himself
and
pelted
away
into
the
darkness
ron
hermione
moaned
she
and
Harry
looked
at
each
other
then
followed
at
a
sprint
it
as
impossible
to
run
full
out
under
the
cloak
they
pulled
it
off
and
it
streamed
behind
them
like
a
banner
as
they
hurtled
after
Ron
they
could
hear
his
feet
thundering
along
ahead
and
his
shouts
at
Crookshanks
get
away
from
him
get
away
Scabbers
come
here
there
was
a
loud
thud
gotcha
get
off
you
stinking
cat
harry
and
Hermione
almost
fell
over
Ron
they
skidded
to
a
stop
right
in
front
of
him
he
was
sprawled
on
the
ground
but
Scabbers
was
back
in
his
pocket
he
had
both
hands
held
tight
over
the
quivering
lump
ron
come
on
back
under
the
cloak
Hermione
panted
dumbledore
the
Minister
they'll
be
coming
back
out
in
a
minute
but
before
they
could
cover
themselves
again
before
they
could
even
catch
their
breath
they
heard
the
soft
pounding
of
gigantic
paws
something
was
bounding
toward
them
quiet
as
a
shadow
an
enormous
paleeyed
jetblack
dog
harry
reached
for
his
wand
but
too
late
the
dog
had
made
an
enormous
leap
and
the
front
paws
hit
him
on
the
chest
he
keeled
over
backward
in
a
whirl
of
hair
he
felt
its
hot
breath
saw
inch
long
teeth
But
the
force
of
its
leap
had
carried
it
too
far
it
rolled
off
him
dazed
feeling
as
though
his
ribs
were
broken
Harry
tried
to
stand
up
he
could
hear
it
growling
as
it
skidded
around
for
a
new
attack
ron
was
on
his
feet
as
the
dog
sprang
back
toward
them
he
pushed
Harry
aside
the
dog's
jaws
fastened
instead
around
ron's
outstretched
arm
harry
lunged
forward
he
seized
a
handful
of
the
brute's
hair
but
it
was
dragging
Ron
away
as
easily
as
though
he
were
a
rag
doll
Then
out
of
nowhere
something
hit
Harry
so
hard
across
the
face
he
was
knocked
off
his
feet
again
he
heard
Hermione
shriek
with
pain
and
fall
too
harry
groped
for
his
wand
blinking
blood
out
of
his
eyes
Lumos
he
whispered
the
wandlight
showed
him
the
trunk
of
a
thick
tree
they
had
chased
Scabbers
into
the
shadow
of
the
Whomping
Willow
and
its
branches
were
creaking
as
though
in
a
high
wind
whipping
backward
and
forward
to
stop
them
going
nearer
and
there
at
the
base
of
the
trunk
was
the
dog
dragging
Ron
backward
into
a
large
gap
in
the
roots
Ron
was
fighting
furiously
but
his
head
and
torso
were
slipping
out
of
sight
Ron
harry
shouted
trying
to
follow
but
a
heavy
branch
whipped
lethally
through
the
air
and
he
was
forced
backward
again
all
they
could
see
now
was
one
of
ron's
legs
which
he
had
hooked
around
a
root
in
an
effort
to
stop
the
dog
from
pulling
him
farther
underground
but
a
horrible
crack
cut
the
air
like
a
gunshot
ron's
leg
had
broken
and
a
moment
later
his
foot
vanished
from
sight
harry
we've
got
to
go
for
help
Hermione
gasped
she
was
bleeding
too
the
Willow
had
cut
her
across
the
shoulder
no
that
thing's
big
enough
to
eat
him
we
haven't
got
time
harry
we're
never
going
to
get
through
without
help
another
branch
whipped
down
at
them
twigs
clenched
like
knuckles
if
that
dog
can
get
in
we
can
Harry
panted
darting
here
and
there
trying
to
find
a
way
through
the
vicious
swishing
branches
but
he
couldn't
get
an
inch
nearer
to
the
tree
roots
without
being
in
range
of
the
tree's
blows
oh
help
help
Hermione
whispered
frantically
dancing
U
certainly
on
the
spot
Please
crookshanks
darted
forward
he
slithered
between
the
battering
branches
like
a
snake
and
placed
his
front
paws
upon
a
knot
on
the
trunk
abruptly
as
though
the
tree
had
been
turned
to
marble
it
stopped
moving
not
a
leaf
twitched
or
shook
crookshanks
hermione
whispered
uncertainly
she
now
grasped
harry's
arm
painfully
hard
how
did
he
know
he's
friends
with
that
dog
said
Harry
grimly
i've
seen
them
together
come
on
and
keep
your
wand
out
they
covered
the
distance
to
the
trunk
in
seconds
but
before
they
had
reached
the
gap
in
the
roots
Crookshanks
had
slid
into
it
with
a
flick
of
his
bottlebrush
tail
harry
went
next
he
crawled
forward
headfirst
and
slid
down
an
earthy
slope
to
the
bottom
of
a
very
low
tunnel
crookshanks
was
a
little
way
along
his
eyes
flashing
in
the
light
from
harry's
wand
seconds
later
Hermione
slithered
down
beside
him
where's
Ron
she
whispered
in
a
terrified
voice
this
way
said
Harry
setting
off
bentbacked
after
Crookshanks
where
does
this
tunnel
come
out
hermione
asked
breathlessly
from
behind
him
i
don't
know
it's
marked
on
the
marauder's
Map
but
Fred
and
George
said
no
one's
ever
gotten
into
it
it
goes
off
the
edge
of
the
map
but
it
looked
like
it
was
heading
for
Hogsmeade
they
moved
as
fast
as
they
could
bent
almost
double
ahead
of
them
crookshanks's
tail
bobbed
in
and
out
of
view
on
and
on
went
the
passage
it
felt
at
least
as
long
as
the
one
to
Honeydukes
all
Harry
could
think
of
was
Ron
and
what
the
enormous
dog
might
be
doing
to
him
he
was
drawing
breath
in
sharp
painful
gasps
running
at
a
crouch
and
then
the
tunnel
began
to
rise
moments
later
it
twisted
and
Crookshanks
had
gone
instead
Harry
could
see
a
patch
of
dim
light
through
a
small
opening
he
and
Hermione
paused
gasping
for
breath
edging
forward
both
raised
their
wands
to
see
what
lay
beyond
it
was
a
room
a
very
disordered
dusty
room
paper
was
peeling
from
the
walls
there
were
stains
all
over
the
floor
every
piece
of
furniture
was
broken
as
though
somebody
had
smashed
it
the
windows
were
all
boarded
up
harry
glanced
at
Hermione
who
looked
very
frightened
but
nodded
harry
pulled
himself
out
of
the
hole
staring
around
the
room
was
deserted
but
a
door
to
their
right
stood
open
leading
to
a
shadowy
hallway
hermione
suddenly
grabbed
harry's
arm
again
her
wide
eyes
were
traveling
around
the
boarded
windows
harry
she
whispered
I
think
we're
in
the
Shrieking
Shack
harry
looked
around
his
eyes
fell
on
a
wooden
chair
near
them
large
chunks
had
been
torn
out
of
it
one
of
the
legs
had
been
ripped
off
entirely
ghosts
didn't
do
that
he
said
slowly
at
that
moment
there
was
a
creak
overhead
something
had
Moved
upstairs
both
of
them
looked
up
at
the
ceiling
hermione's
grip
on
harry's
arm
was
so
tight
he
was
losing
feeling
inhis
fingers
he
raised
his
eyebrows
at
her
she
nodded
again
and
let
go
quietly
as
they
could
they
crept
out
into
the
hall
and
up
the
crumbling
staircase
everything
was
covered
in
a
thick
layer
of
dust
except
the
floor
where
a
wide
shiny
stripe
had
been
made
by
something
being
dragged
upstairs
they
reached
the
dark
landing
nox
they
whispered
together
and
the
lights
at
the
end
of
their
wands
went
out
only
one
door
was
open
as
they
crept
toward
it
they
heard
movement
from
behind
it
a
low
moan
and
then
a
deep
loud
purring
they
exchanged
a
last
look
a
last
nod
wand
held
tightly
before
him
Harry
kicked
the
door
wide
open
on
a
magnificent
fourposter
bed
with
dusty
hangings
lay
Crookshanks
purring
loudly
at
the
sight
of
them
on
the
floor
beside
him
clutching
his
leg
which
stuck
out
at
a
strange
angle
was
Ron
harry
and
Hermione
dashed
across
to
him
ron
are
you
okay
where's
the
dog
not
a
dog
Ron
moaned
his
teeth
were
gritted
with
pain
harry
it's
a
trap
what
he's
the
dog
he's
an
Animagus
ron
was
staring
over
harry's
shoulder
harry
wheeled
around
with
a
snap
the
man
in
the
shadows
closed
the
door
behind
them
a
mass
of
filthy
matted
hair
hung
to
his
elbows
if
eyes
hadn't
been
shining
out
of
the
deep
dark
sockets
he
might
have
been
a
corpse
the
waxy
skin
was
stretched
so
tightly
over
the
bones
of
his
face
it
looked
like
a
skull
his
yellow
teeth
were
bared
in
a
grin
it
was
Sirius
Black
expelliarmus
he
croaked
pointing
ron's
wand
at
them
harry's
and
hermione's
wands
shot
out
of
their
hands
high
in
the
air
and
Black
caught
them
then
he
took
a
step
closer
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
Harry
i
thought
you'd
come
and
help
your
friend
he
said
hoarsely
his
voice
sounded
as
though
he
had
long
since
lost
the
habit
of
using
it
your
father
would
have
done
the
same
for
me
brave
of
you
not
to
run
for
a
teacher
i'm
grateful
it
will
make
everything
much
easier
the
taunt
about
his
father
rang
in
harry's
ears
as
though
Black
had
bellowed
it
a
boiling
hate
erupted
in
harry's
chest
leaving
no
place
for
fear
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
wanted
his
wand
back
in
his
hand
not
to
defend
himself
but
to
attack
to
kill
without
knowing
what
he
was
doing
he
started
forward
but
there
was
a
sudden
movement
on
either
side
of
him
and
two
pairs
of
hands
grabbed
him
and
held
him
back
no
Harry
hermione
gasped
in
a
petrified
whisper
Ron
however
spoke
to
Black
if
you
want
to
kill
Harry
you'll
have
to
kill
us
too
he
said
fiercely
though
the
effort
of
standing
upright
was
draining
him
of
still
more
color
and
he
swayed
slightly
as
he
spoke
something
flickered
in
black's
shadowed
eyes
lie
down
he
said
quietly
to
Ron
you
will
damage
that
leg
even
more
did
you
hear
me
ron
said
weakly
though
he
was
clinging
painfully
to
Harry
to
stay
upright
you'll
have
to
kill
all
three
of
us
there'll
be
only
one
murder
here
tonight
said
Brack
and
his
grin
widened
why's
that
harry
spat
trying
to
wrench
himself
free
of
Ron
and
Hermione
didn't
care
last
time
did
you
didn't
mind
slaughtering
all
those
Muggles
to
get
at
Pettigrew
what's
the
matter
gone
soft
in
Azkaban
harry
hermione
whimpered
be
quiet
he
killed
my
mum
and
dad
harry
roared
and
with
a
huge
effort
he
broke
free
of
hermione's
and
ron's
restraint
and
lunged
forward
He
had
forgotten
about
magic
he
had
forgotten
that
he
was
short
and
skinny
and
thirteen
whereas
Black
was
a
tall
fullgrown
man
all
Harry
knew
was
that
he
wanted
to
hurt
Black
as
badly
as
he
could
and
that
he
didn't
care
how
much
he
got
hurt
in
return
Perhaps
it
was
the
shock
of
Harry
doing
something
so
stupid
but
Black
didn't
raise
the
wands
in
time
one
of
harry's
hands
fastened
over
his
wasted
wrist
forcing
the
wand
tips
away
the
knuckles
of
harry's
other
hand
collided
with
the
side
of
black's
head
and
they
fell
backward
into
the
wall
hermione
was
screaming
Ron
was
yelling
there
was
a
blinding
flash
as
the
wands
in
black's
hand
sent
a
jet
of
sparks
into
the
air
that
missed
harry's
face
by
inches
Harry
felt
the
shrunken
arm
under
his
fingers
twisting
madly
but
he
clung
on
his
other
hand
punching
every
part
of
Black
it
could
find
but
black's
free
hand
had
found
harry's
throat
No
he
hissed
i've
waited
too
long
the
fingers
tightened
Harry
choked
his
glasses
askew
then
he
saw
hermione's
foot
swing
out
of
nowhere
black
let
go
of
Harry
with
a
grunt
of
pain
Ron
had
thrown
himself
on
black's
wand
hand
and
Harry
heard
a
faint
clatter
He
fought
free
of
the
tangle
of
bodies
and
saw
his
own
wand
rolling
across
the
floor
he
threw
himself
toward
it
but
Argh
crookshanks
had
joined
the
fray
both
sets
of
front
claws
had
sunk
themselves
deep
into
harry's
arm
Harry
threw
him
off
but
Crookshanks
now
darted
toward
harry's
wand
no
you
don't
roared
Harry
and
he
aimed
a
kick
at
Crookshanks
that
made
the
cat
leap
aside
spitting
Harry
snatched
up
his
wand
and
turned
Get
out
of
the
way
he
shouted
at
Ron
and
Hermione
they
didn't
need
telling
twice
hermione
gasping
for
breath
her
lip
bleeding
scrambled
aside
snatching
up
her
and
ron's
wands
ron
crawled
to
the
fourposter
and
collapsed
onto
it
panting
his
white
face
now
tinged
with
green
both
hands
clutching
his
broken
leg
black
was
sprawled
at
the
bottom
of
the
wall
his
thin
chest
rose
and
fell
rapidly
as
he
watched
Harry
walking
slowly
nearer
his
wand
pointing
straight
at
black's
heart
going
to
kill
me
Harry
he
whispered
harry
stopped
right
above
him
his
wand
still
pointing
at
black's
chest
looking
down
at
him
a
livid
bruise
was
rising
around
black's
left
eye
and
his
nose
was
bleeding
you
killed
my
parents
said
Harry
his
voice
shaking
slightly
but
his
wand
hand
quite
steady
black
stared
up
at
him
out
of
those
sunken
eyes
i
don't
deny
it
he
said
very
quietly
but
if
you
knew
the
whole
story
the
whole
story
harry
repeated
a
furious
pounding
in
his
ears
you
sold
them
to
Voldemort
that's
all
I
need
to
know
you've
got
to
listen
to
me
Black
said
and
there
was
a
note
of
urgency
in
his
voice
now
you'll
regret
it
if
you
don't
you
don't
understand
i
understand
a
lot
better
than
you
think
said
Harry
and
his
voice
shook
more
than
ever
you
never
heard
her
did
you
my
mum
trying
to
stop
Voldemort
killing
me
and
you
did
that
you
did
it
before
either
of
them
could
say
another
word
something
ginger
streaked
past
Harry
Crookshanks
leapt
onto
black's
chest
and
settled
himself
there
right
over
black's
heart
black
blinked
and
looked
down
at
the
cat
get
off
he
murmured
trying
to
push
Crookshanks
off
him
but
Crookshanks
sank
his
claws
into
black's
robes
and
wouldn't
shift
he
turned
his
ugly
squashed
face
to
Harry
and
looked
up
at
him
with
those
great
yellow
eyes
to
his
right
Hermione
gave
a
dry
sob
harry
stared
down
at
Black
and
Crookshanks
his
grip
tightening
on
the
wand
so
what
if
he
had
to
kill
the
cat
too
it
was
in
league
with
Black
if
it
was
prepared
to
die
trying
to
protect
Black
that
wasn't
harry's
business
if
Black
wanted
to
save
it
that
only
proved
he
cared
more
for
Crookshanks
than
for
harry's
parents
harry
raised
the
wand
now
was
the
moment
to
do
it
now
was
the
moment
to
avenge
his
mother
and
father
he
was
going
to
kill
Black
he
had
to
kill
Black
this
was
his
chance
the
seconds
lengthened
and
still
Harry
stood
frozen
there
wand
poised
black
staring
up
at
him
Crookshanks
on
his
chest
ron's
ragged
breathing
came
from
near
the
bed
Hermione
was
quite
silent
and
then
came
a
new
sound
Muffled
footsteps
were
echoing
up
through
the
floor
someone
was
moving
downstairs
we're
up
here
hermione
screamed
suddenly
we're
up
here
sirius
black
quick
black
made
a
startled
movement
that
almost
dislodged
Crookshanks
Harry
gripped
his
wand
convulsively
Do
it
now
said
a
voice
in
his
head
but
the
footsteps
were
thundering
up
the
stairs
and
Harry
still
hadn't
done
it
the
door
of
the
room
burst
open
in
a
shower
of
red
sparks
and
Harry
wheeled
around
as
Professor
Lupin
came
hurtling
into
the
room
his
face
bloodless
his
wand
raised
and
ready
his
eyes
flickered
over
Ron
lying
on
the
floor
over
Hermione
cowering
next
to
the
door
to
Harry
standing
there
with
his
wand
covering
Black
and
then
to
Black
himself
crumpled
and
bleeding
at
harry's
feet
expelliarmus
lupin
shouted
harry's
wand
flew
once
more
out
of
his
hand
so
did
the
two
Hermione
was
holding
lupin
caught
them
all
deftly
then
moved
into
the
room
staring
at
Black
who
still
had
Crookshanks
lying
Protectively
across
his
chest
harry
stood
there
feeling
suddenly
empty
he
hadn't
done
it
his
nerve
had
failed
him
black
was
going
to
be
handed
back
to
the
dementors
then
Lupin
spoke
in
a
very
tense
voice
where
is
he
Sirius
harry
looked
quickly
at
Lupin
he
didn't
understannd
what
Lupin
meant
who
was
Lupin
talking
about
he
turned
to
look
at
Black
again
black's
face
was
quite
expressionless
for
a
few
seconds
he
didn't
move
at
all
then
very
slowly
he
raised
his
empty
hand
and
pointed
straight
at
Ron
mystified
Harry
glanced
around
at
Ron
who
looked
bewildered
but
then
lupin
muttered
staring
at
Black
so
intently
it
seemed
he
was
trying
to
read
his
mind
why
hasn't
he
shown
himself
before
now
unless
lupin's
eyes
suddenly
widened
as
though
he
was
seeing
something
beyond
Black
something
none
of
the
rest
could
see
unless
he
was
the
one
unless
you
switched
without
telling
me
very
slowly
his
sunken
gaze
never
leaving
lupin's
face
Black
nodded
professor
Harry
interrupted
loudly
what's
going
on
but
he
never
finished
the
question
because
what
he
saw
made
his
voice
die
in
his
throat
lupin
was
lowering
his
wand
gazing
fixed
at
Black
the
Professor
walked
to
black's
side
seized
his
hand
pulled
him
to
his
feet
so
that
Crookshanks
fell
to
the
floor
and
embraced
Black
like
a
brother
harry
felt
as
though
the
bottom
had
dropped
out
of
his
stomach
don't
believe
it
hermione
screamed
lupin
let
go
of
Black
and
turned
to
her
she
had
raised
herself
off
the
floor
and
was
pointing
at
Lupin
wildeyed
you
you
hermione
you
and
him
hermione
calm
down
i
didn't
tell
anyone
hermione
shrieked
i've
been
covering
up
for
you
hermione
listen
to
me
please
Lupin
shouted
i
can
explain
harry
could
feel
himself
shaking
not
with
fear
but
with
a
fresh
wave
of
fury
i
trusted
you
he
shouted
at
Lupin
his
voice
wavering
out
of
control
and
all
the
time
you've
been
his
friend
you're
wrong
said
Lupin
i
haven't
been
sirius's
friend
but
I
am
now
Let
me
explain
no
hermione
screamed
harry
don't
trust
him
he's
been
helping
Black
get
into
the
castle
he
wants
you
dead
too
he's
a
werewolf
there
was
a
ringing
silence
everyone's
eyes
were
now
on
Lupin
who
looked
remarkably
calm
though
rather
pale
not
at
all
up
to
your
usual
standard
Hermione
he
said
only
one
out
of
three
i'm
afraid
i
have
not
been
helping
Sirius
get
into
the
castle
and
I
certainly
don't
want
Harry
dead
an
odd
shiver
passed
over
his
face
but
I
won't
deny
that
I
am
a
werewolf
ron
made
a
valiant
effort
to
get
up
again
but
fell
back
with
a
whimper
of
pain
lupin
made
toward
him
looking
concerned
but
Ron
gasped
Get
away
ftom
me
werewolf
lupin
stopped
dead
then
with
an
obvious
effort
he
turned
to
Hermione
and
said
How
long
have
you
known
ages
Hermione
whispered
since
I
did
Professor
snape's
essay
he'll
be
delighted
said
Lupin
coolly
he
assigned
that
essay
hoping
someone
would
realize
what
my
symptoms
meant
did
you
check
the
lunar
chart
and
realize
that
I
was
always
ill
at
the
full
moon
or
did
you
realize
that
the
boggart
changed
into
the
moon
when
it
saw
me
both
Hermione
said
quietly
lupin
forced
a
laugh
you're
the
cleverest
witch
of
your
age
i've
ever
met
Hermione
i'm
not
Hermione
whispered
if
i'd
been
a
bit
cleverer
i'd
have
told
everyone
what
you
are
but
they
already
know
said
Lupin
at
least
the
staff
do
dumbledore
hired
you
when
he
knew
you
were
a
werewolf
ron
gasped
is
he
mad
some
of
the
staff
thought
so
said
Lupin
he
had
to
work
very
hard
to
convince
certain
teachers
that
i'm
trustworthy
and
he
was
wrong
harry
yelled
youve
been
helping
him
all
the
time
he
was
pointing
at
Black
who
suddenly
crossed
to
the
fourposter
bed
and
sank
onto
it
his
face
hidden
in
one
shaking
hand
crookshanks
leapt
up
beside
him
and
stepped
onto
his
lap
purring
ron
edged
away
from
both
of
them
dragging
his
leg
i
have
not
been
helping
Sirius
said
Lupin
if
you'll
give
me
a
chance
i'll
explain
look
he
separated
harry's
ron's
and
hermione's
wands
and
threw
each
back
to
its
owner
Harry
caught
his
stunned
there
said
Lupin
sticking
his
own
wand
back
into
his
belt
you're
armed
we're
not
now
will
you
listen
harry
didn't
know
what
to
think
was
it
a
trick
if
you
haven't
been
helping
him
he
said
with
a
furious
glance
at
Black
how
did
you
know
he
was
here
the
map
said
Lupin
the
marauder's
Map
i
was
in
my
office
examining
it
you
know
how
to
work
it
harry
said
suspiciously
of
course
I
know
how
to
work
it
said
Lupin
waving
his
hand
impatiently
i
helped
write
it
i'm
Moony
that
was
my
friends
nickname
for
me
at
school
you
wrote
the
important
thing
is
I
was
watching
it
carefully
this
evening
because
I
had
an
idea
that
you
Ron
and
Hermione
might
try
and
sneak
out
of
the
castle
to
visit
Hagrid
before
his
hippogriff
was
executed
and
I
was
right
wasn't
I
he
had
started
to
pace
up
and
down
looking
at
them
little
patches
of
dust
rose
at
his
feet
you
might
have
been
wearing
your
father's
old
cloak
Harry
how
d'you
know
about
the
cloak
the
number
of
times
I
saw
James
disappearing
under
it
said
Lupin
waving
an
impatient
hand
again
the
point
is
even
if
you're
wearing
an
Invisibility
Cloak
you
still
show
up
on
the
marauder's
Map
i
watched
you
cross
the
grounds
and
enter
hagrid's
hut
twenty
minutes
later
you
left
Hagrid
and
set
off
back
toward
the
castle
but
you
were
now
accompanied
by
somebody
else
what
said
Harry
no
we
weren't
i
couldn't
believe
my
eyes
said
Lupin
still
pacing
and
ignoring
harry's
interruption
i
thought
the
map
must
be
malfunctioning
how
could
he
be
with
you
no
one
was
with
us
said
Harry
and
then
I
saw
another
dot
moving
fast
toward
you
labeled
Sirius
Black
i
saw
him
collide
with
you
I
watched
as
he
pulled
two
of
you
into
the
Whomping
Willow
one
of
us
ron
said
angrily
no
Ron
said
Lupin
two
of
you
he
had
stopped
his
pacing
his
eyes
moving
over
Ron
do
you
think
I
could
have
a
look
at
the
rat
he
said
evenly
what
said
Ron
what's
Scabbers
got
to
do
with
it
everything
said
Lupin
could
I
see
him
please
ron
hesitated
then
put
a
hand
inside
his
robes
scabbers
emerged
thrashing
desperately
Ron
had
to
seize
his
long
bald
tail
to
stop
him
escaping
crookshanks
stood
up
on
black's
leg
and
made
a
soft
hissing
noise
lupin
moved
closer
to
Ron
he
seemed
to
be
holding
his
breath
as
he
gazed
intently
at
Scabbers
what
ron
said
again
holding
Scabbers
close
to
him
looking
scared
what's
my
rat
got
to
do
with
anything
that's
not
a
rat
croaked
Sirius
Black
suddenly
what
d'you
mean
of
course
he's
a
rat
no
he's
not
said
Lupin
quietly
he's
a
wizard
an
Animagus
said
Black
by
the
name
of
Peter
Pettigrew
chapter
eighteen
moony
wormtail
paddfoot
and
prongs
it
took
a
few
seconds
for
the
absurdity
of
this
statement
to
sink
in
then
Ron
voiced
what
Harry
was
thinking
you're
both
mental
ridiculous
said
Hermione
faintly
peter
pettigrew's
dead
said
Harry
he
killed
him
twelve
years
ago
he
pointed
at
Black
whose
face
twitched
convulsively
i
meant
to
he
growled
his
yellow
teeth
bared
but
little
Peter
got
the
better
of
me
not
this
time
though
and
Crookshanks
was
thrown
to
the
floor
as
Black
lunged
at
Scabbers
Ron
yelled
with
pain
as
black's
weight
fell
on
his
broken
leg
sirius
no
lupin
yelled
launching
himself
forwards
and
dragging
Black
away
from
Ron
again
wait
you
can't
do
it
just
like
that
they
need
to
understand
we've
got
to
explain
we
can
explain
afterwards
snarled
Black
trying
to
throw
Lupin
off
one
hand
was
still
clawing
the
air
as
it
tried
to
reach
Scabbers
who
was
squealing
like
a
piglet
scratching
ron's
face
and
neck
as
he
tried
to
escape
they've
got
a
right
to
know
everything
lupin
panted
still
trying
to
restrain
Black
ron's
kept
him
as
a
pet
there
are
parts
of
it
even
I
don't
understand
and
Harry
you
owe
Harry
the
truth
Sirius
black
stopped
struggling
though
his
hollowed
eyes
were
still
fixed
on
Scabbers
who
was
clamped
tightly
under
ron's
bitten
scratched
ad
bleeding
hands
all
right
then
Black
said
without
taking
his
eyes
off
the
rat
tell
them
whatever
you
like
but
make
it
quick
Remus
i
want
to
commit
the
murder
I
was
imprisoned
for
you're
nutters
both
of
you
said
Ron
shakily
looking
round
at
Harry
and
Hermione
for
support
i've
had
enough
of
this
i'm
off
he
tried
to
heave
himself
up
on
his
good
leg
but
Lupin
raised
his
wand
again
pointing
it
at
Scabbers
you're
going
to
hear
me
out
Ron
he
said
quietly
just
keep
a
tight
hold
on
Peter
while
you
listen
he's
not
peter
he's
scabbers
ron
yelled
trying
to
fore
the
rat
back
into
his
front
pocket
but
Scabbers
was
fighting
to
hard
Ron
swayed
and
overbalanced
and
Harry
caught
him
am
pushed
him
back
down
to
the
bed
then
ignoring
Black
Harry
turned
to
Lupin
there
were
witnesses
who
saw
Pettigrew
die
he
said
a
whole
street
full
of
them
they
didn't
see
what
they
thought
they
saw
said
Black
savagely
still
watching
Scabbers
struggling
in
ron's
hands
everyone
thought
Sirius
killed
Peter
said
Lupin
nodding
i
believed
it
myself
until
I
saw
the
map
tonight
because
the
marauder's
map
never
lies
peter's
alive
ron's
holding
him
Harry
harry
looked
down
at
Ron
and
as
their
eyes
met
they
agreed
silently
black
and
Lupin
were
both
out
of
their
minds
their
story
made
no
sense
whatsoever
how
could
Scabbers
be
Peter
Pettigrew
azkaban
must
have
unhinged
Black
after
all
but
why
was
Lupin
playing
along
with
him
then
Hermione
spoke
in
a
trembling
wouldbe
calm
sort
of
voice
as
though
trying
to
will
Professor
Lupin
to
talk
sensibly
but
Professor
Lupin
scabbers
can't
be
Pettigrew
it
just
can't
be
true
you
know
it
can't
why
can't
it
be
true
lupin
said
calmly
as
though
they
were
in
class
and
Hermione
had
simply
spotted
a
problem
in
an
experiment
with
grindylows
because
because
people
would
know
if
Peter
Pettigrew
had
been
an
Animagus
we
did
Animagi
in
class
with
Professor
McGonagall
and
I
looked
them
up
when
I
did
my
homework
the
Ministry
of
Magic
keeps
tabs
on
witches
and
wizards
who
can
become
animals
there's
a
register
showing
what
animal
they
become
and
their
markings
and
things
and
I
went
and
looked
Professor
McGonagall
up
on
the
register
and
there
have
been
only
seven
Animagi
this
century
and
pettigrew's
name
wasn't
on
the
list
harry
had
barely
had
time
to
marvel
inwardly
at
the
effort
Hermione
put
into
her
homework
when
Lupin
started
to
laugh
light
again
Hermione
he
said
but
the
Ministry
never
knew
that
here
used
to
be
three
unregistered
Animagi
running
around
Hogwarts
i
you're
going
to
tell
them
the
story
get
a
move
on
Remus
said
Black
who
was
still
watching
scabbers's
every
desperate
move
i've
waited
twelve
years
i'm
not
going
to
wait
much
longer
all
right
but
you'll
need
to
help
me
Sirius
said
Lupin
I
only
know
how
it
began
lupin
broke
off
there
had
been
a
loud
creak
behind
him
the
bedroom
door
had
opened
of
its
own
accord
all
five
of
them
stared
at
it
then
Lupin
strode
toward
it
and
looked
out
into
the
landing
no
one
there
this
place
is
haunted
said
Ron
it's
not
said
Lupin
still
looking
at
the
door
in
a
puzzled
way
the
Shrieking
Shack
was
never
haunted
the
screams
and
howls
the
villagers
used
to
hear
were
made
by
me
he
pushed
his
graying
hair
out
of
his
eyes
thought
for
a
moment
then
said
that's
where
all
of
this
starts
with
my
becoming
a
werewolf
none
of
this
could
have
happened
if
I
hadn't
been
bitter
and
if
I
hadn't
been
so
foolhardy
he
looked
sober
and
tired
ron
started
to
interrupt
but
Hermione
said
shh
she
was
watching
Lupin
very
intently
i
as
a
very
small
boy
when
I
received
the
bite
my
parents
tried
everything
but
in
those
days
there
was
no
cure
the
potion
that
Professor
Snape
has
been
making
for
me
is
a
very
recent
discovery
it
makes
me
safe
you
see
as
long
as
I
take
it
in
the
week
preceding
the
full
moon
I
keep
my
mind
when
I
transform
i'm
able
to
curl
up
in
my
office
a
harmless
wolf
and
wait
for
the
moon
to
wane
again
before
the
Wolfsbane
Potion
was
discovered
however
I
became
a
fully
fledged
monster
once
a
month
it
seemed
impossible
that
I
would
be
able
to
come
to
Hogwarts
other
parents
weren't
likely
to
want
their
children
exposed
to
me
but
then
Dumbledore
became
Headmaster
and
he
was
sympathetic
he
said
that
as
long
as
we
took
certain
precautions
there
was
no
reason
I
shouldn't
come
to
school
lupin
sighed
and
looked
directly
at
Harry
i
told
you
months
ago
that
the
Whomping
Willow
was
planted
the
year
I
came
to
Hogwarts
the
truth
is
that
it
was
planted
because
I
came
to
Hogwarts
this
house
Lupin
looked
miserably
around
the
room
the
tunnel
that
leads
to
it
they
were
built
for
my
use
once
a
month
I
was
smuggled
out
of
the
castle
into
this
place
to
transform
the
tree
was
placed
at
the
tunnel
mouth
to
stop
anyone
coming
across
me
while
I
was
dangerous
harry
couldn't
see
where
this
story
was
going
but
he
was
listening
raptly
all
the
same
the
only
sound
apart
from
lupin's
voice
was
scabbers's
frightened
squeaking
my
transformations
in
those
days
were
were
terrible
it
is
very
painful
to
turn
into
a
werewolf
i
was
separated
from
humans
to
bite
so
I
bit
and
scratched
myself
instead
the
villagers
heard
the
noise
and
the
screaming
and
thought
they
were
hearing
particularly
violent
spirits
dumbledore
encouraged
the
rumor
even
now
when
the
house
has
been
silent
for
years
the
villagers
don't
dare
approach
it
but
apart
from
my
transformations
I
was
happier
than
I
had
ever
been
in
my
life
for
the
first
time
ever
I
had
friends
three
great
friends
sirius
Black
peter
Pettigrew
and
of
course
your
father
Harry
James
Potter
now
my
three
friends
could
hardly
fail
to
notice
that
I
disappeared
once
a
month
i
made
up
all
sorts
of
stories
i
told
them
my
mother
was
ill
and
that
I
had
to
go
home
to
see
her
i
was
terrified
they
would
desert
me
the
moment
they
found
out
what
I
was
but
of
course
they
like
you
Hermione
worked
out
the
truth
and
they
didn't
desert
me
at
all
instead
they
did
something
for
me
that
would
make
my
transformations
not
only
bearable
but
the
best
times
of
my
life
they
became
Animagi
my
dad
too
said
Harry
astounded
yes
indeed
said
Lupin
it
took
them
the
best
part
of
three
years
to
work
out
how
to
do
it
your
father
and
Sirius
here
were
the
cleverest
students
in
the
school
and
lucky
they
were
because
the
Animagus
transformation
can
go
horribly
wrong
one
reason
the
Ministry
keeps
a
close
watch
on
those
attempting
to
do
it
peter
needed
all
the
help
he
could
get
from
James
and
Sirius
finally
in
our
fifth
year
they
managed
it
they
could
each
turn
into
a
different
animal
at
will
but
how
did
that
help
you
said
Hermione
sounding
puzzled
they
couldn't
keep
me
company
as
humans
so
they
kept
me
company
as
animals
said
Lupin
a
werewolf
is
only
a
danger
to
people
they
sneaked
out
of
the
castle
every
month
under
james's
Invisibility
Cloak
they
transformed
peter
as
the
smallest
could
slip
beneath
the
willow's
attacking
branches
and
touch
the
knot
that
freezes
it
they
would
then
slip
down
the
tunnel
and
join
me
under
their
influence
I
became
less
dangerous
my
body
was
still
wolfish
but
my
mind
seemed
to
become
less
so
while
I
was
with
them
hurry
up
Remus
snarled
Black
who
was
still
watching
Scabbers
with
a
horrible
sort
of
hunger
on
his
face
i'm
getting
there
Sirius
i'm
getting
there
well
highly
exciting
possibilities
were
open
to
us
now
that
we
could
all
transform
soon
we
were
leaving
the
Shrieking
Shack
and
roaming
the
school
grounds
and
the
village
by
night
sirius
and
James
transformed
into
such
large
animals
they
were
able
to
keep
a
werewolf
in
check
i
doubt
whether
any
Hogwarts
students
ever
found
out
more
about
the
Hogwarts
grounds
and
Hogsmeade
than
we
did
and
that's
how
we
came
to
write
the
marauder's
Map
and
sign
it
with
our
nicknames
sirius
is
Padfoot
peter
is
Wormtail
james
was
Prongs
what
sort
of
animal
harry
began
but
Hermione
cut
him
off
that
was
still
really
dangerous
running
around
in
the
dark
with
a
werewolf
what
if
you'd
given
the
others
the
slip
and
bitten
somebody
a
thought
that
still
haunts
me
said
Lupin
heavily
and
there
were
near
misses
many
of
them
we
laughed
about
them
afterwards
we
were
young
thoughtless
carried
away
with
our
own
cleverness
i
sometimes
felt
guilty
about
betraying
dumbledore's
trust
of
course
he
had
admitted
me
to
Hogwarts
when
no
other
headmaster
would
have
done
so
and
he
had
no
idea
I
was
breaking
the
rules
he
had
set
down
for
my
own
and
others
safety
he
never
knew
I
had
led
three
fellow
students
into
becoming
Animagi
illegally
but
I
always
managed
to
forget
my
guilty
feelings
every
time
we
sat
down
to
plan
our
next
month's
adventure
and
I
haven't
changed
lupin's
face
had
hardened
and
there
was
selfdisgust
in
his
voice
all
this
year
I
have
been
battling
with
myself
wondering
whether
I
should
tell
Dumbledore
that
Sirius
was
an
Animagus
but
I
didn't
do
it
why
because
I
was
too
cowardly
it
would
have
meant
admitting
that
i'd
betrayed
his
trust
while
I
was
at
school
admitting
that
i'd
led
others
along
with
me
and
dumbledore's
trust
has
meant
everything
to
me
he
let
me
into
Hogwarts
as
a
boy
and
he
gave
me
a
job
when
I
have
been
shunned
all
my
adult
life
unable
to
find
paid
work
because
of
what
I
am
and
so
I
convinced
myself
that
Sirius
was
getting
into
the
school
using
dark
arts
he
learned
from
Voldemort
that
being
an
Animagus
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
so
in
a
way
snape's
been
right
about
me
all
along
snape
said
Black
harshly
taking
his
eyes
off
Scabbers
for
the
first
time
in
minutes
and
looking
up
at
Lupin
what's
Snape
got
to
do
with
it
he's
here
Sirius
said
Lupin
heavily
he's
teaching
here
as
well
he
looked
up
at
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
professor
Snape
was
at
school
with
us
he
fought
very
hard
against
my
appointment
to
the
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
job
he
has
been
telling
Dumbledore
A
year
that
I
am
not
to
be
trusted
he
has
his
reasons
you
see
Sirius
here
played
a
trick
on
him
which
nearly
killed
him
a
trick
which
involved
me
black
made
a
derisive
noise
it
served
him
right
he
sneered
sneaking
around
trying
to
find
out
what
we
were
up
to
hoping
he
could
get
us
expelled
severus
was
very
interested
in
where
I
went
every
month
lupin
told
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
we
were
in
the
same
year
you
know
and
we
er
didn't
like
each
other
very
much
he
especially
disliked
James
jealous
I
think
of
james's
talent
on
the
Quidditch
field
anyway
Snape
had
seen
me
crossing
the
grounds
with
Madam
Pomfrey
one
evening
as
she
led
me
toward
the
Whomping
Willow
to
transform
sirius
thought
it
would
be
er
amusing
to
tell
Snape
all
he
had
to
do
was
prod
the
knot
on
the
tree
trunk
with
a
long
stick
and
he'd
be
able
to
get
in
after
me
well
of
course
Snape
tried
it
if
he'd
got
as
far
as
this
house
he'd
have
met
a
fully
grown
werewolf
but
your
father
who'd
heard
what
Sirius
had
done
went
after
Snape
and
pulled
him
back
at
great
risk
to
his
life
snape
glimpsed
me
though
at
the
end
of
the
tunnel
he
was
forbidden
by
Dumbledore
to
tell
anybody
but
from
that
time
on
he
knew
what
I
was
so
that's
why
Snape
doesn't
like
you
said
Harry
slowly
because
he
thought
you
were
in
on
the
joke
that's
right
sneered
a
cold
voice
from
the
wall
behind
Lupin
severus
Snape
was
pulling
off
the
Invisibility
Cloak
his
wand
pointing
directly
at
Lupin
chapter
nineteen
the
servant
of
lord
voldemort
hermione
screamed
black
leapt
to
his
feet
harry
felt
as
though
he'd
received
a
huge
electric
shock
i
found
this
at
the
base
of
the
Whomping
Willow
said
Snape
throwing
the
cloak
aside
careful
to
keep
this
wand
pointing
directly
at
lupin's
chest
very
useful
Potter
I
thank
you
snape
was
slightly
breathless
but
his
face
was
full
of
suppressed
triumph
you're
wondering
perhaps
how
I
knew
you
were
here
he
said
his
eyes
glittering
i've
just
been
to
your
office
Lupin
you
forgot
to
take
your
potion
tonight
so
I
took
a
gobletful
along
and
very
lucky
I
did
lucky
for
me
I
mean
lying
on
your
desk
was
a
certain
map
one
glance
at
it
told
me
all
I
needed
to
know
i
saw
you
running
along
this
passageway
and
out
of
sight
severus
Lupin
began
but
Snape
overrode
him
i've
told
the
headmaster
again
and
again
that
you're
helping
your
old
friend
Black
into
the
castle
Lupin
and
here's
the
proof
not
even
I
dreamed
you
would
have
the
nerve
to
use
this
old
place
as
your
hideout
severus
you're
making
a
mistake
said
Lupin
urgently
you
haven't
heard
everything
I
can
explain
Sirius
is
not
here
to
kill
Harry
two
more
for
Azkaban
tonight
said
Snape
his
eyes
now
gleaming
fanatically
i
shall
be
interested
to
see
how
Dumbledore
takes
this
he
was
quite
convinced
you
were
harmless
you
know
Lupin
a
tame
werewolf
you
fool
said
Lupin
softly
is
a
schoolboy
grudge
worth
putting
an
innocent
man
back
inside
Azkaban
bang
thin
snakelike
cords
burst
from
the
end
of
snape's
wand
and
twisted
themselves
around
lupin's
mouth
wrists
and
ankles
he
overbalanced
and
fell
to
the
floor
unable
to
move
with
a
roar
of
rage
black
started
toward
Snape
but
Snape
pointed
his
wand
straight
between
black's
eyes
give
me
a
reason
he
whispered
give
me
a
reason
to
do
it
and
I
swear
I
will
black
stopped
dead
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
say
which
face
showed
more
hatred
harry
stood
there
paralyzed
not
knowing
what
to
do
or
whom
to
believe
he
glanced
around
at
Ron
and
Hermione
ron
looked
just
as
confused
as
he
did
still
fighting
to
keep
hold
on
the
struggling
Scabbers
hermione
however
took
an
uncertain
step
toward
Snape
and
said
in
a
very
breathless
voice
Professor
Snape
it
it
wouldn't
hurt
to
hear
what
they've
got
to
say
w
would
it
miss
Granger
you
are
already
facing
suspension
from
this
school
snape
spat
you
Potter
and
Weasley
are
outofbounds
in
the
company
of
a
convicted
murderer
and
a
werewolf
for
once
in
your
life
hold
your
tongue
but
if
if
there
was
a
mistake
keep
quiet
you
stupid
girl
snape
shouted
looking
suddenly
quite
deranged
don't
talk
about
what
you
don't
understand
a
few
sparks
shot
out
of
the
end
of
his
wand
which
was
still
pointed
at
black's
face
hermione
fell
silent
vengeance
is
very
sweet
Snape
breathed
at
Black
how
I
hoped
I
would
be
the
one
to
catch
you
the
joke's
on
you
again
Severus
Black
snarled
as
long
as
this
boy
brings
his
rat
up
to
the
castle
he
jerked
his
head
at
Ron
i'll
come
quietly
up
to
the
castle
said
Snape
silkily
i
don't
think
we
need
to
go
that
far
all
I
have
to
do
is
call
the
dementors
once
we
get
out
of
the
Willow
they'll
be
very
pleased
to
see
you
Black
pleased
enough
to
give
you
a
little
kiss
I
daresay
what
little
color
there
was
in
Blacks
face
left
it
you
you've
got
to
hear
me
out
he
croaked
the
rat
look
at
the
rat
but
there
was
a
mad
glint
in
snape's
eyes
that
Harry
had
never
seen
before
he
seemed
beyond
reason
come
on
all
of
you
he
said
he
clicked
his
fingers
and
the
ends
of
the
cords
that
bound
Lupin
flew
to
his
hands
i'll
drag
the
werewolf
perhaps
the
dementors
will
have
a
kiss
for
him
too
before
he
knew
what
he
was
doing
Harry
had
crossed
the
room
in
three
strides
and
blocked
the
door
get
out
of
the
way
Potter
you're
in
enough
trouble
already
snarled
Snape
if
I
hadn't
been
here
to
save
your
skin
professor
Lupin
could
have
killed
me
about
a
hundred
times
this
year
harry
said
i've
been
alone
with
him
loads
of
times
having
defense
lessons
against
the
dementors
if
he
was
helping
Black
why
didn't
he
just
finish
me
off
then
don't
ask
me
to
fathom
the
way
a
werewolf's
mind
works
hissed
Snape
get
out
of
the
way
Potter
youre
pathetic
harry
yelled
just
because
they
made
A
fool
of
you
at
school
you
won't
even
listen
silence
i
will
not
be
spoken
to
like
that
snape
shrieked
looking
madder
than
ever
like
father
like
son
Potter
i
have
just
saved
your
neck
you
should
be
thanking
me
on
bended
knee
you
would
have
been
well
served
if
he'd
killed
you
you'd
have
died
like
your
father
too
arrogant
to
believe
you
might
be
mistaken
in
Black
now
get
out
of
the
way
or
I
will
make
you
get
out
of
the
way
potter
harry
made
up
his
mind
in
a
split
second
before
Snape
could
take
even
one
step
toward
him
he
had
raised
his
wand
expelliarmus
he
yelled
except
that
his
wasn't
the
only
voice
that
shouted
there
was
a
blast
that
made
the
door
rattle
on
its
hinges
Snape
was
lifted
off
his
feet
and
slammed
into
the
wall
then
slid
down
it
to
the
floor
a
trickle
of
blood
oozing
from
under
his
hair
he
had
been
knocked
out
harry
looked
around
both
Ron
and
Hermione
had
tried
to
disarm
Snape
at
exactly
the
same
moment
snape's
wand
soared
in
a
high
arc
and
landed
on
the
bed
next
to
Crookshanks
you
shouldn't
have
done
that
said
Black
looking
at
Harry
you
should
have
left
him
to
me
harry
avoided
black's
eyes
he
wasn't
sure
even
now
that
he'd
done
the
right
thing
we
attacked
a
teacher
we
attacked
a
teacher
hermione
whimpered
staring
at
the
lifeless
Snape
with
frightened
eyes
oh
we're
going
to
be
in
so
much
trouble
lupin
was
struggling
against
his
bonds
black
bent
down
quickly
and
untied
him
lupin
straightened
up
rubbing
his
arms
where
the
ropes
had
cut
into
them
thank
you
Harry
he
said
i'm
still
not
saying
I
believe
you
he
told
Lupin
then
it's
time
we
offered
you
some
proof
said
Lupin
you
boy
give
me
Peter
please
now
ron
clutched
Scabbers
closer
to
his
chest
come
off
it
he
said
weakly
are
you
trying
to
say
he
broke
out
of
Azkaban
just
to
get
his
hands
on
Scabbers
i
mean
he
looked
up
at
Harry
and
Hermione
for
support
Okay
say
Pettigrew
could
turn
into
a
rat
there
are
millions
of
rats
how's
he
supposed
to
know
which
one
he's
after
if
he
was
locked
up
in
Azkaban
you
know
Sirius
that's
a
fair
question
said
Lupin
turning
to
Black
and
frowning
slightly
how
did
you
find
out
where
he
was
black
put
one
of
his
clawlike
hands
inside
his
robes
and
took
out
a
crumpled
piece
of
paper
which
he
smoothed
flat
and
held
out
to
show
the
others
it
was
the
photograph
of
Ron
and
his
family
that
had
appeared
in
the
Daily
Prophet
the
previous
summer
and
there
on
ron's
shoulder
was
Scabbers
how
did
you
get
this
lupin
asked
Black
thunderstruck
fudge
said
Black
when
he
came
to
inspect
Azkaban
last
year
he
gave
me
his
paper
and
there
was
Peter
on
the
front
page
on
this
boy's
shoulder
i
knew
him
at
once
how
many
times
had
I
seen
him
transform
and
the
caption
said
the
boy
would
be
going
back
to
Hogwarts
to
where
Harry
was
my
God
said
Lupin
softly
staring
from
Scabbers
to
the
picture
in
the
paper
and
back
again
his
front
paw
what
about
it
said
Ron
defiantly
he's
got
a
toe
missing
said
Black
of
course
Lupin
breathed
so
simple
so
brilliant
he
cut
it
off
himself
just
before
he
transformed
said
Black
when
I
cornered
him
he
yelled
for
the
whole
street
to
hear
that
i'd
betrayed
Lily
and
James
then
before
I
could
curse
him
he
blew
apart
the
street
with
the
wand
behind
his
back
killed
everyone
within
twenty
feet
of
himself
and
sped
down
into
the
sewer
with
the
other
rats
didn't
you
ever
hear
Ron
said
Lupin
the
biggest
bit
of
Peter
they
found
was
his
finger
look
Scabbers
probably
had
a
fight
with
another
rat
or
something
he's
been
in
my
family
for
ages
right
twelve
years
in
fact
said
Lupin
didn't
you
ever
wonder
why
he
was
living
so
long
we
we've
been
taking
good
care
of
him
said
Ron
not
looking
too
good
at
the
moment
though
is
he
said
Lupin
i'd
guess
he's
been
losing
weight
ever
since
he
heard
Sirius
was
on
the
loose
again
he's
been
scared
of
that
mad
cat
said
Ron
nodding
toward
Crookshanks
who
was
still
purring
on
the
bed
but
that
wasn't
right
Harry
thought
suddenly
scabbers
had
been
looking
ill
before
he
met
Crookshanks
ever
since
ron's
return
from
Egypt
since
the
time
when
Black
had
escaped
this
cat
isn't
mad
said
Black
hoarsely
he
reached
out
a
bony
hand
and
stroked
crookshanks's
fluffy
head
he's
the
most
intelligent
of
his
kind
i've
ever
met
he
recognized
Peter
for
what
he
was
right
away
and
when
he
met
me
he
knew
I
was
no
dog
it
was
a
while
before
he
trusted
me
finally
I
managed
to
communicate
to
him
what
I
was
after
and
he's
been
helping
me
what
do
you
mean
breathed
Hermione
he
tried
to
bring
Peter
to
me
but
couldn't
so
he
stole
the
passwords
into
Gryffindor
Tower
for
me
as
I
understand
it
he
took
them
from
a
boy's
bedside
table
harry's
brain
seemed
to
be
sagging
under
the
weight
of
what
he
was
hearing
it
was
absurd
and
yet
but
Peter
got
wind
of
what
was
going
on
and
ran
for
it
croaked
Black
this
cat
Crookshanks
did
you
call
him
told
me
Peter
had
left
blood
on
the
sheets
i
supposed
he
bit
himself
well
faking
his
own
death
had
worked
once
these
words
jolted
Harry
to
his
senses
and
why
did
he
fake
his
death
he
said
furiously
because
he
knew
you
were
about
to
kill
him
like
you
killed
my
parents
no
said
Lupin
Harry
and
now
you've
come
to
finish
him
off
yes
I
have
said
Black
with
an
evil
look
at
Scabbers
then
I
should've
let
Snape
take
you
harry
shouted
harry
said
Lupin
hurriedly
don't
you
see
all
this
time
we've
thought
Sirius
betrayed
your
parents
and
Peter
tracked
him
down
but
it
was
the
other
way
around
don't
you
see
peter
betrayed
your
mother
and
father
Sirius
tracked
Peter
down
that's
not
true
harry
yelled
he
was
their
secretkeeper
he
said
so
before
you
turned
up
he
said
he
killed
them
he
was
pointing
at
Black
who
shook
his
head
slowly
the
sunken
eyes
were
suddenly
over
bright
harry
i
as
good
as
killed
them
he
croaked
i
persuaded
Lily
and
James
to
change
to
Peter
at
the
last
moment
persuaded
them
to
use
him
as
SecretKeeper
instead
of
me
i'm
to
blame
I
know
it
the
night
they
died
i'd
arranged
to
check
on
Peter
make
sure
he
was
still
safe
but
when
I
arrived
at
his
hiding
place
he'd
gone
yet
there
was
no
sign
of
a
struggle
it
didn't
feel
right
i
was
scared
i
set
out
for
your
parents
house
straight
away
and
when
I
saw
their
house
destroyed
and
their
bodies
i
realized
what
Peter
must've
done
what
i'd
done
his
voice
broke
he
turned
away
enough
of
this
said
Lupin
and
there
was
a
steely
note
in
his
voice
Harry
had
never
heard
before
there's
one
certain
way
to
prove
what
really
happened
ron
give
me
that
rat
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
him
if
I
give
him
to
you
ron
asked
Lupin
tensely
force
him
to
show
himself
said
Lupin
if
he
really
is
a
rat
it
won't
hurt
him
ron
hesitated
then
at
long
last
he
held
out
Scabbers
and
Lupin
took
him
scabbers
began
to
squeak
without
stopping
twisting
and
turning
his
tiny
black
eyes
bulging
in
his
head
ready
Sirius
said
Lupin
black
had
already
retrieved
snape's
wand
from
the
bed
he
approached
Lupin
and
the
struggling
rat
and
his
wet
eyes
suddenly
seemed
to
be
burning
in
his
face
together
he
said
quietly
i
think
so
said
Lupin
holding
Scabbers
tightly
in
one
hand
and
his
wand
in
the
other
on
the
count
of
three
one
two
three
a
flash
of
bluewhite
light
erupted
from
both
wands
for
a
moment
scabbers
was
frozen
in
midair
his
small
gray
form
twisting
madly
Ron
yelled
the
rat
fell
and
hit
the
floor
there
was
another
blinding
flash
of
light
and
then
It
was
like
watching
a
speededup
film
of
a
growing
tree
a
head
was
shooting
upward
from
the
ground
limbs
were
sprouting
a
moment
later
a
man
was
standing
where
Scabbers
had
been
cringing
and
wringing
his
hands
crookshanks
was
spitting
and
snarling
on
the
bed
the
hair
on
his
back
was
standing
up
he
was
a
very
short
man
hardly
taller
than
Harry
and
Hermione
his
thin
colorless
hair
was
unkempt
and
there
was
a
large
bald
patch
on
top
he
had
the
shrunken
appearance
of
a
plump
man
who
has
lost
a
lot
of
weight
in
a
short
time
his
skin
looked
grubby
almost
like
scabbers's
fur
and
something
of
the
rat
lingered
around
his
pointed
nose
and
his
very
small
watery
eyes
he
looked
around
at
them
all
his
breathing
fast
and
shallow
harry
saw
his
eyes
dart
to
the
door
and
back
again
well
hello
Peter
said
Lupin
pleasantly
as
though
rats
frequently
erupted
into
old
school
friends
around
him
long
time
no
see
s
Sirius
r
Remus
even
pettigrew's
voice
was
squeaky
again
his
eyes
darted
toward
the
door
my
friends
my
old
friends
black's
wand
arm
rose
but
Lupin
seized
him
around
the
wrist
gave
him
a
warning
took
then
turned
again
to
Pettigrew
his
voice
light
and
casual
we've
been
having
a
little
chat
Peter
about
what
happened
the
night
Lily
and
James
died
you
might
have
missed
the
finer
points
while
you
were
squeaking
around
down
there
on
the
bed
remus
gasped
Pettigrew
and
Harry
could
see
beads
of
sweat
breaking
out
over
his
pasty
face
you
don't
believe
him
do
you
he
tried
to
kill
me
Remus
so
we've
heard
said
Lupin
more
coldly
i'd
like
to
clear
up
one
or
two
little
matters
with
you
Peter
if
you'll
be
so
he's
come
to
try
and
kill
me
again
pettigrew
squeaked
suddenly
pointing
at
Black
and
Harry
saw
that
he
used
his
middle
finger
because
his
index
was
missing
he
killed
Lily
and
James
and
now
he's
going
to
kill
me
too
you've
got
to
help
me
Remus
black's
face
looked
more
skulllike
than
ever
as
he
stared
at
Pettigrew
with
his
fathomless
eyes
no
one's
going
to
try
and
kill
you
until
we've
sorted
a
few
things
out
said
Lupin
sorted
things
out
squealed
Pettigrew
looking
wildly
about
him
once
more
eyes
taking
in
the
boarded
windows
and
again
the
only
door
i
knew
he'd
come
after
me
i
knew
he'd
be
back
for
me
i've
been
waiting
for
this
for
twelve
years
you
knew
Sirius
was
going
to
break
out
of
Azkaban
said
Lupin
his
brow
furrowed
when
nobody
has
ever
done
it
before
he's
got
dark
powers
the
rest
of
us
can
only
dream
of
pettigrew
shouted
shrilly
how
else
did
he
get
out
of
there
i
suppose
HeWhoMustNotBeNamed
taught
him
a
few
tricks
black
started
to
laugh
a
horrible
mirthless
laugh
that
filled
the
whole
room
voldemort
teach
me
tricks
he
said
pettigrew
flinched
as
though
Black
had
brandished
a
whip
at
him
what
scared
to
hear
your
old
master's
name
said
Black
i
don't
blame
you
Peter
his
lot
aren't
very
happy
with
you
are
they
don't
know
what
you
mean
Sirius
muttered
Pettigrew
his
breathing
faster
than
ever
his
whole
face
was
shining
with
sweat
now
you
haven't
been
hiding
from
me
for
twelve
years
said
Black
you've
been
hiding
from
voldemort's
old
supporters
i
heard
things
in
Azkaban
peter
they
all
think
you're
dead
or
you'd
have
to
answer
to
them
i've
heard
them
screaming
all
sorts
of
things
in
their
sleep
sounds
like
they
think
the
doublecrosser
doublecrossed
them
voldemort
went
to
the
Potters
on
your
information
and
Voldemort
met
his
downfall
there
and
not
all
voldemort's
supporters
ended
up
in
Azkaban
did
they
there
are
still
plenty
out
here
biding
their
time
pretending
they've
seen
the
error
of
their
ways
if
they
ever
got
wind
that
you
were
still
alive
Peter
don't
know
what
you're
talking
about
said
Pettigrew
again
more
shrilly
than
ever
he
wiped
his
face
on
his
sleeve
and
looked
up
at
Lupin
you
don't
believe
this
this
madness
Remus
i
must
admit
Peter
I
have
difficulty
in
understanding
why
an
innocent
man
would
want
to
spend
twelve
years
as
a
rat
said
Lupin
evenly
innocent
but
scared
squealed
Pettigrew
if
voldemort's
supporters
were
after
me
it
was
because
I
put
one
of
their
best
men
in
Azkaban
the
spy
Sirius
Black
black's
face
contorted
how
dare
you
he
growled
sounding
suddenly
like
the
bearsized
dog
he
had
been
i
a
spy
for
Voldemort
when
did
I
ever
sneak
around
people
who
were
stronger
and
more
powerful
than
myself
but
you
Peter
i'll
never
understand
why
I
didn't
see
you
were
the
spy
from
the
start
you
always
liked
big
friends
who'd
look
after
you
didn't
you
it
used
to
be
us
me
and
Remus
and
James
pettigrew
wiped
his
face
again
he
was
almost
panting
for
breath
me
a
spy
must
be
out
of
your
mind
never
don't
know
how
you
can
say
such
a
lily
and
James
only
made
you
SecretKeeper
because
I
suggested
it
black
hissed
so
venomously
that
Pettigrew
took
a
step
backward
i
thought
it
was
the
perfect
plan
a
bluff
voldemort
would
be
sure
to
come
after
me
would
never
dream
they'd
use
a
weak
talentless
thing
like
you
it
must
have
been
the
finest
moment
of
your
miserable
life
telling
Voldemort
you
could
hand
him
the
Potters
pettigrew
was
muttering
distractedly
Harry
caught
words
like
farfetched
and
lunacy
but
he
couldn't
help
paying
more
attention
to
the
ashen
color
of
pettigrew's
face
and
the
way
his
eyes
continued
to
dart
toward
the
windows
and
door
professor
Lupin
said
Hermione
timidly
can
can
I
say
something
certainly
Hermione
said
Lupin
courteously
well
Scabbers
I
mean
this
this
man
he's
been
sleeping
in
harry's
dormitory
for
three
years
if
he's
working
for
YouKnowWho
how
come
he
never
tried
to
hurt
Harry
before
now
there
said
Pettigrew
shrilly
pointing
at
Ron
with
his
maimed
hand
thank
you
you
see
Remus
i
have
never
hurt
a
hair
of
harry's
head
why
should
I
i'll
tell
you
why
said
Black
because
you
never
did
anything
for
anyone
unless
you
could
see
what
was
in
it
for
you
voldemort's
been
in
hiding
for
fifteen
years
they
say
he's
half
dead
you
weren't
about
to
commit
murder
right
under
Albus
dumbledore's
nose
for
a
wreck
of
a
wizard
who'd
lost
all
of
his
power
were
you
you'd
want
to
be
quite
sure
he
was
the
biggest
bully
in
the
playground
before
you
went
back
to
him
wouldn't
you
why
else
did
you
find
a
wizard
family
to
take
you
in
keeping
an
ear
out
for
news
weren't
you
Peter
just
in
case
your
old
protector
regained
strength
and
it
was
safe
to
rejoin
him
pettigrew
opened
his
mouth
and
closed
it
several
times
he
seemed
to
have
lost
the
ability
to
talk
er
mr.
Black
Sirius
said
Hermione
black
jumped
at
being
addressed
like
this
and
stared
at
Hermione
as
though
he
had
never
seen
anything
quite
like
her
if
you
don't
mind
me
asking
how
how
did
you
get
out
of
Azkaban
if
you
didn't
use
Dark
Magic
thank
you
gasped
Pettigrew
nodding
frantically
at
her
exactly
precisely
what
I
but
Lupin
silenced
him
with
a
look
black
was
frowning
slightly
at
Hermione
but
not
as
though
he
were
annoyed
with
her
he
seemed
to
be
pondering
his
answer
i
don't
know
how
I
did
it
he
said
slowly
i
think
the
only
reason
I
never
lost
my
mind
is
that
I
knew
I
was
innocent
that
wasn't
a
happy
thought
so
the
dementors
couldn't
suck
it
out
of
me
but
it
kept
me
sane
and
knowing
who
I
am
helped
me
keep
my
powers
so
when
it
all
became
too
much
i
could
transform
in
my
cell
become
a
dog
dementors
can't
see
you
know
he
swallowed
they
feel
their
way
toward
people
by
feeding
off
their
emotions
they
could
tell
that
my
feelings
were
less
less
human
less
complex
when
I
was
a
dog
but
they
thought
of
course
that
I
was
losing
my
mind
like
everyone
else
in
there
so
it
didn't
trouble
them
but
I
was
weak
very
weak
and
I
had
no
hope
of
driving
them
away
from
me
without
a
wand
but
then
I
saw
Peter
in
that
picture
i
realized
he
was
at
Hogwarts
with
Harry
perfectly
positioned
to
act
if
one
hint
reached
his
ears
that
the
Dark
Side
was
gathering
strength
again
pettigrew
was
shaking
his
head
mouthing
noiselessly
but
staring
all
the
while
at
Black
as
though
hypnotized
ready
to
strike
at
the
moment
he
could
be
sure
of
allies
and
to
deliver
the
last
Potter
to
them
if
he
gave
them
Harry
who'd
dare
say
he'd
betrayed
Lord
Voldemort
he'd
be
welcomed
back
with
honors
so
you
see
I
had
to
do
something
i
was
the
only
one
who
knew
Peter
was
still
alive
harry
remembered
what
mr.
Weasley
had
told
Mrs
wealsey
the
guards
say
he's
been
talking
in
his
sleep
always
the
same
words
he's
at
Hogwarts
it
was
as
if
someone
had
lit
a
fire
In
my
head
and
the
dementors
couldn't
destroy
it
it
wasn't
a
happy
feeling
it
was
an
obsession
but
it
gave
me
strength
it
cleared
my
mind
so
one
night
when
they
opened
my
door
to
bring
food
I
slipped
past
them
as
a
dog
it's
so
much
harder
for
them
to
sense
animal
emotions
that
they
were
confused
i
was
thin
very
thin
thin
enough
to
slip
through
the
bars
i
swam
as
a
dog
back
to
the
mainland
i
journeyed
north
and
slipped
into
the
Hogwarts
grounds
as
a
dog
i've
been
living
in
the
forest
ever
since
except
when
I
came
to
watch
the
Quidditch
of
course
you
fly
as
well
as
your
father
did
Harry
he
looked
at
Harry
who
did
not
look
away
believe
me
croaked
Black
believe
me
Harry
i
never
betrayed
James
and
Lily
i
would
have
died
before
I
betrayed
them
and
at
long
last
Harry
believed
him
throat
too
tight
to
speak
he
nodded
no
pettigrew
had
fallen
to
his
knees
as
though
harry's
nod
had
been
his
own
death
sentence
he
shuffled
forward
on
his
knees
groveling
his
hands
clasped
in
front
of
him
as
though
praying
sirius
it's
me
it's
Peter
your
friend
you
wouldn't
black
kicked
out
and
Pettigrew
recoiled
there's
enough
filth
on
my
robes
without
you
touching
them
said
Black
remus
pettigrew
squeaked
turning
to
Lupin
instead
writhing
imploringly
in
front
of
him
you
don't
believe
this
wouldn't
Sirius
have
told
you
they'd
changed
the
plan
not
if
he
thought
I
was
the
spy
Peter
said
Lupin
i
assume
that's
why
you
didn't
tell
me
Sirius
he
said
casually
over
Pettigrews
head
forgive
me
Remus
said
Black
not
at
all
Padfoot
old
friend
said
Lupin
who
was
now
rolling
up
his
sleeves
and
will
you
in
turn
forgive
me
for
believing
you
were
the
spy
of
course
said
Black
and
the
ghost
of
a
grin
flitted
across
his
gaunt
face
he
too
began
rolling
up
his
sleeves
shall
we
kill
him
together
yes
I
think
so
said
Lupin
grimly
you
wouldn't
you
won't
gasped
Pettigrew
and
he
scrambled
around
to
Ron
ron
haven't
I
been
a
good
friend
a
good
pet
you
won't
let
them
kill
me
Ron
will
you
you're
on
my
side
aren't
you
but
Ron
was
staring
at
Pettigrew
with
the
utmost
revulsion
i
let
you
sleep
in
my
bed
he
said
kind
boy
kind
master
pettigrew
crawled
toward
Ron
You
won't
let
them
do
it
i
was
your
rat
i
was
a
good
pet
if
you
made
a
better
rat
than
a
human
it's
not
much
to
boast
about
peter
said
Black
harshly
ron
going
still
paler
with
pain
wrenched
his
broken
leg
out
of
pettigrew's
reach
pettigrew
turned
on
his
knees
staggered
forward
and
seized
the
hem
of
hermione's
robes
sweet
girl
clever
girl
you
you
won't
let
them
help
me
hermione
pulled
her
robes
out
of
pettigrew's
clutching
hands
and
backed
away
against
the
wall
looking
horrified
pettigrew
knelt
trembling
uncontrollably
andturned
his
head
slowly
toward
Harry
harry
harry
you
look
just
like
your
father
just
like
him
how
dare
you
speak
to
harry
roared
Black
how
dare
you
face
him
how
dare
you
talk
about
james
in
front
of
him
harry
whispered
Pettigrew
shuffling
toward
him
hands
outstretched
harry
James
wouldn't
have
wanted
me
killed
james
would
have
understood
Harry
he
would
have
shown
me
mercy
both
Black
and
Lupin
strode
forward
seized
pettigrew's
shoulders
and
threw
him
backward
onto
the
floor
he
sat
there
twitching
with
terror
staring
up
at
them
you
sold
Lily
and
James
to
Voldemort
said
Black
who
was
shaking
too
do
you
deny
it
pettigrew
burst
into
tears
it
was
horrible
to
watch
like
an
oversized
balding
baby
cowering
on
the
floor
sirius
Sirius
what
could
I
have
done
the
Dark
Lord
you
have
no
idea
he
has
weapons
you
can't
imagine
i
was
scared
Sirius
I
was
never
brave
like
you
and
Remus
and
James
i
never
meant
it
to
happen
heWhoMustNotBeNamed
forced
me
don't
lie
bellowed
Black
you'd
been
passing
information
to
him
for
A
year
before
lily
and
james
died
you
were
his
spy
he
he
was
taking
over
everywhere
gasped
Pettigrew
wh
what
was
there
to
be
gained
by
refusing
him
what
was
there
to
be
gained
by
fighting
the
most
evil
wizard
who
has
ever
existed
said
Black
with
a
terrible
fury
in
his
face
only
innocent
lives
Peter
you
don't
understand
whined
Pettigrew
he
would
have
killed
me
sirius
then
you
should
have
died
roared
Black
died
rather
than
betray
your
friends
as
we
would
have
done
for
you
black
and
Lupin
stood
shoulder
to
shoulder
wands
raised
you
should
have
realized
said
Lupin
quietly
if
Voldemort
didn't
kill
you
we
would
goodbye
Peter
hermione
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
turned
to
the
wall
no
harry
yelled
he
ran
forward
placing
himself
in
front
Pettigrew
facing
the
wands
you
can't
kill
him
he
said
breathlessly
you
can't
black
and
Lupin
both
looked
staggered
harry
this
piece
of
vermin
is
the
reason
you
have
no
parents
Black
snarled
this
cringing
bit
of
filth
would
have
seen
you
die
too
without
turning
a
hair
you
heard
him
his
own
stinking
skin
meant
more
to
him
than
your
whole
family
i
know
Harry
panted
we'll
take
him
up
to
the
castle
we'll
hand
him
over
to
the
dementors
he
can
go
to
Azkaban
but
don't
kill
him
harry
gasped
Pettigrew
and
he
flung
his
arms
around
harry's
knees
you
thank
you
it's
more
than
I
deserve
thank
you
get
off
me
Harry
spat
throwing
pettigrew's
hands
off
him
in
disgust
i'm
not
doing
this
for
you
i'm
doing
it
because
I
don't
reckon
my
dad
would've
wanted
them
to
become
killers
just
for
you
no
one
moved
or
made
a
sound
except
Pettigrew
whose
breath
was
coming
in
wheezes
as
he
clutched
his
chest
black
and
Lupin
were
looking
at
each
other
then
with
one
movement
they
lowered
their
wands
you're
the
only
person
who
has
the
right
to
decide
Harry
said
Black
but
think
think
what
he
did
he
can
go
to
Azkaban
Harry
repeated
if
anyone
deserves
that
place
he
does
pettigrew
was
still
wheezing
behind
him
very
well
said
Lupin
stand
aside
Harry
harry
hesitated
i'm
going
to
tie
him
up
said
Lupin
that's
all
I
swear
harry
stepped
out
of
the
way
thin
cords
shot
from
lupin's
wand
this
time
and
next
moment
Pettigrew
was
wriggling
on
the
floor
bound
and
gagged
but
if
you
transform
Peter
growled
Black
his
own
wand
pointing
at
Pettigrew
too
we
will
kill
you
you
agree
Harry
harry
looked
down
at
the
pitiful
figure
on
the
floor
and
nodded
so
that
Pettigrew
could
see
him
right
said
Lupin
suddenly
businesslike
ron
I
can't
mend
bones
nearly
as
well
as
Madam
Pomfrey
so
I
think
it's
best
if
we
just
strap
your
leg
up
until
we
can
get
you
to
the
hospital
wing
he
hurried
over
to
Ron
bent
down
tapped
ron's
leg
with
his
wand
and
muttered
Ferula
bandages
spun
up
ron's
leg
strapping
it
tightly
to
a
splint
lupin
helped
him
to
his
feet
Ron
put
his
weight
gingerly
on
the
leg
and
didn't
wince
that's
better
he
said
thanks
what
about
Professor
Snape
said
Hermione
in
a
small
voice
looking
down
at
snape's
prone
figure
there's
nothing
seriously
wrong
with
him
said
Lupin
bending
over
Snape
and
checking
his
pulse
you
were
just
a
little
overenthusiastic
still
out
cold
er
perhaps
it
will
be
best
if
we
don't
revive
him
until
we're
safety
back
in
the
castle
we
can
take
him
like
this
he
muttered
Mobilicorpus
as
though
invisible
strings
were
tied
to
snape's
wrists
neck
and
knees
he
was
pulled
into
a
standing
position
head
still
lolling
unpleasantly
like
a
grotesque
puppet
he
hung
a
few
inches
above
the
ground
his
limp
feet
dangling
lupin
picked
up
the
Invisibility
Cloak
and
tucked
it
safely
into
his
pocket
and
two
of
us
should
be
chained
to
this
said
Black
nudging
Pettigrew
with
his
toe
just
to
make
sure
i'll
do
it
said
Lupin
and
me
said
Ron
savagely
limping
forward
black
conjured
heavy
manacles
from
thin
air
soon
Pettigrew
was
upright
again
left
arm
chained
to
lupin's
right
right
arm
to
ron's
left
ron's
face
was
set
he
seemed
to
have
taken
scabbers's
true
identity
as
a
personal
insult
crookshanks
leapt
lightly
off
the
bed
and
led
the
way
out
of
the
room
his
bottlebrush
tail
held
jauntily
high
chapter
twenty
the
dementor's
kiss
harry
had
never
been
part
of
a
stranger
group
crookshanks
led
the
way
down
the
stairs
Lupin
Pettigrew
and
Ron
went
next
looking
like
entrants
in
a
sixlegged
race
next
came
Professor
Snape
drifting
creepily
along
his
toes
hitting
each
stair
as
they
descended
held
up
by
his
own
wand
which
was
being
pointed
at
him
by
Sirius
harry
and
Hermione
brought
up
the
rear
getting
back
into
the
tunnel
was
difficult
lupin
Pettigrew
and
Ron
had
to
turn
sideways
to
manage
it
Lupin
still
had
Pettigrew
covered
with
his
wand
harry
could
see
them
edging
awkwardly
along
the
tunnel
in
single
file
crookshanks
was
still
in
the
lead
harry
went
right
after
Black
who
was
still
making
Snape
drift
along
ahead
of
them
he
kept
bumping
his
lolling
head
on
the
low
ceiling
harry
had
the
impression
Black
was
making
no
effort
to
prevent
this
you
know
what
this
means
black
said
abruptly
to
Harry
as
they
made
their
slow
progress
along
the
tunnel
turning
Pettigrew
in
you
re
free
said
Harry
yes
said
Black
but
i'm
also
I
don't
know
if
anyone
ever
told
you
i'm
your
godfather
yeah
I
knew
that
said
Harry
well
your
parents
appointed
me
your
guardian
said
Black
stiffly
if
anything
happened
to
them
harry
waited
did
Black
mean
what
he
thought
he
meant
i'll
understand
of
course
if
you
want
to
stay
with
your
aunt
and
uncle
said
Black
but
well
think
about
it
once
my
name's
cleared
if
you
wanted
a
a
different
home
some
sort
of
explosion
took
place
in
the
pit
of
harry's
stomach
what
live
with
you
he
said
accidentally
cracking
his
head
on
a
bit
of
rock
protruding
from
the
ceiling
leave
the
Dursleys
of
course
I
thought
you
wouldn't
want
to
said
Black
quickly
i
understand
I
just
thought
i'd
are
you
insane
said
Harry
his
voice
easily
as
croaky
as
black's
of
course
I
want
to
leave
the
Dursleys
have
you
got
a
house
when
can
I
move
in
black
turned
right
around
to
look
at
him
snape's
head
was
scraping
the
ceiling
but
Black
didn't
seem
to
care
you
want
to
he
said
you
mean
it
yeah
I
mean
it
said
Harry
black's
gaunt
face
broke
into
the
first
true
smile
Harry
had
seen
upon
it
the
difference
it
made
was
startling
as
though
a
person
ten
years
younger
were
shining
through
the
starved
mask
for
a
moment
he
was
recognizable
as
the
man
who
had
laughed
at
harry's
parents
wedding
they
did
not
speak
again
until
they
had
reached
the
end
of
the
tunnel
crookshanks
darted
up
first
he
had
evidently
pressed
his
paw
to
the
knot
on
the
trunk
because
Lupin
Pettigrew
and
Ron
clambered
upward
without
any
sound
of
savaging
branches
black
saw
Snape
up
through
the
hole
then
stood
back
for
Harry
and
Hermione
to
pass
at
last
all
of
them
were
out
the
grounds
were
very
dark
now
the
only
light
came
from
the
distant
windows
of
the
castle
without
a
word
they
set
off
pettigrew
was
still
wheezing
and
occasionally
whimpering
harry's
mind
was
buzzing
he
was
going
to
leave
the
Dursleys
he
was
going
to
live
with
Sirius
Black
his
parents
best
friend
he
felt
dazed
what
would
happen
when
he
told
the
Dursleys
he
was
going
to
live
with
the
convict
they'd
seen
on
television
one
wrong
move
Peter
said
Lupin
threateningly
ahead
his
wand
was
still
pointed
sideways
at
pettigrew's
chest
silently
they
tramped
through
the
grounds
the
castle
lights
growing
slowly
larger
snape
was
still
drifting
weirdly
ahead
of
Black
his
chin
bumping
on
his
chest
and
then
A
cloud
shifted
there
were
suddenly
dim
shadows
on
the
ground
their
party
was
bathed
in
moonlight
snape
collided
with
Lupin
Pettigrew
and
Ron
who
had
stopped
abruptly
black
froze
he
flung
out
one
arm
to
make
Harry
and
Hermione
stop
harry
could
see
lupin's
silhouette
he
had
gone
rigid
then
his
limbs
began
to
shake
oh
my
Hermione
gasped
he
didn't
take
his
potion
tonight
he's
not
safe
run
Black
whispered
run
now
but
Harry
couldn't
run
ron
was
chained
to
Pettigrew
and
Lupin
he
leapt
forward
but
Black
caught
him
around
the
chest
and
threw
him
back
leave
it
to
me
run
there
was
a
terrible
snarling
noise
lupin's
head
was
lengthening
so
was
his
body
his
shoulders
were
hunching
hair
was
sprouting
visibly
on
his
face
and
hands
which
were
curling
into
clawed
paws
crookshanks's
hair
was
on
end
again
he
was
backing
away
As
the
werewolf
reared
snapping
its
long
jaws
Sirius
disappeared
from
harry's
side
he
had
transformed
the
enormous
bearlike
dog
bounded
forward
as
the
werewolf
wrenched
itself
free
of
the
manacle
binding
it
the
dog
seized
it
about
the
neck
and
pulled
it
backward
away
from
Ron
and
Pettigrew
they
were
locked
jaw
to
jaw
claws
ripping
at
each
other
harry
stood
transfixed
by
the
sight
too
intent
upon
the
battle
to
notice
anything
else
it
was
hermione's
scream
that
alerted
him
Pettigrew
had
dived
for
lupin's
dropped
wand
ron
unsteady
on
his
bandaged
leg
fell
there
was
a
bang
a
burst
of
light
and
Ron
lay
motionless
on
the
ground
another
bang
Crookshanks
flew
into
the
air
and
back
to
the
earth
in
a
heap
expelliarmus
harry
yelled
pointing
his
own
wand
at
Pettigrew
lupin's
wand
flew
high
into
the
air
and
out
of
sight
stay
where
you
are
harry
shouted
running
forward
too
late
pettigrew
had
transformed
harry
saw
his
bald
tail
whip
through
the
manacle
on
ron's
outstretched
arm
and
heard
a
scurrying
through
the
grass
there
was
a
howl
and
a
rumbling
growl
Harry
turned
to
see
the
werewolf
taking
flight
it
was
galloping
into
the
forest
Sirius
he's
gone
Pettigrew
transformed
harry
yelled
black
was
bleeding
there
were
gashes
across
his
muzzle
and
back
but
at
harry's
words
he
scrambled
up
again
and
in
an
instant
the
sound
of
his
paws
faded
to
silence
as
he
pounded
away
across
the
grounds
harry
and
Hermione
dashed
over
to
Ron
what
did
he
do
to
him
hermione
whispered
ron's
eyes
were
only
halfclosed
his
mouth
hung
open
he
was
definitely
alive
they
could
hear
him
breathing
but
he
didn't
seem
to
recognize
them
i
don't
know
harry
looked
desperately
around
black
and
Lupin
both
gone
they
had
no
one
but
Snape
for
company
still
hanging
unconscious
in
midair
we'd
better
get
them
up
to
the
castle
and
tell
someone
said
Harry
pushing
his
hair
out
of
his
eyes
trying
to
think
straight
come
but
then
from
beyond
the
range
of
their
vision
they
heard
a
yelping
a
whining
a
dog
in
pain
sirius
Harry
muttered
staring
into
the
darkness
he
had
a
moment's
indecision
but
there
was
nothing
they
could
do
for
Ron
at
the
moment
and
by
the
sound
of
it
Black
was
in
trouble
Harry
set
off
at
a
run
Hermione
right
behind
him
the
yelping
seemed
to
be
coming
from
the
ground
near
the
edge
of
the
lake
they
pelted
toward
it
and
Harry
running
flat
out
felt
the
cold
without
realizing
what
it
must
mean
The
yelping
stopped
abruptly
as
they
reached
the
lakeshore
they
saw
why
Sirius
had
turned
back
into
a
man
he
was
crouched
on
all
fours
his
hands
over
his
head
nooo
he
moaned
nooo
please
and
then
Harry
saw
them
dementors
at
least
a
hundred
of
them
gliding
in
a
black
mass
around
the
lake
toward
them
he
spun
around
the
familiar
icy
cold
penetrating
his
insides
fog
starting
to
obscure
his
vision
more
were
appearing
out
of
the
darkness
on
every
side
they
were
encircling
them
herrnione
think
of
something
happy
harry
yelled
raising
his
wand
blinking
furiously
to
try
and
clear
his
vision
shaking
his
head
to
rid
it
of
the
faint
screaming
that
had
started
inside
it
i'm
going
to
live
with
my
godfather
i'm
leaving
the
Dursleys
he
forced
himself
to
think
of
Black
and
only
Black
and
began
to
chant
expecto
patronum
expecto
patronum
black
gave
a
shudder
rolled
over
and
lay
motionless
on
the
ground
pale
as
death
he'll
be
all
right
i'm
going
to
go
and
live
with
him
expecto
patronum
hermione
help
me
expecto
patronum
expecto
Hermione
whispered
expecto
expecto
but
she
couldn't
do
it
the
dementors
were
closing
in
barely
ten
feet
from
them
they
formed
a
solid
wall
around
Harry
and
Hermione
and
were
getting
closer
expecto
patronum
harry
yelled
trying
to
blot
the
screaming
from
his
ears
expecto
patronum
a
thin
wisp
of
silver
escaped
his
wand
and
hovered
like
mist
before
him
at
the
same
moment
Harry
felt
Hermione
collapse
next
to
him
he
was
alone
completely
alone
expecto
expecto
patronum
harry
felt
his
knees
hit
the
cold
grass
fog
was
clouding
his
eyes
with
a
huge
effort
he
fought
to
remember
Sirius
was
innocent
innocent
we'll
be
okay
I
mgoing
to
live
with
him
Ex
ecto
patronum
he
gasped
by
the
feeble
light
of
his
formless
Patronus
He
saw
a
dementor
halt
very
close
to
him
it
couldn't
walk
through
the
cloud
of
silver
mist
Harry
had
conjured
a
dead
slimy
hand
slid
out
from
under
the
cloak
it
made
a
gesture
as
though
to
sweep
the
Patronus
aside
no
no
Harry
gasped
he's
innocent
expecto
expecto
patronum
he
could
feet
them
watching
him
hear
their
rattling
breath
like
an
evil
wind
around
him
the
nearest
dementor
seemed
to
be
considering
him
then
it
raised
both
its
rotting
hands
and
lowered
its
hood
where
there
should
have
been
eyes
there
was
only
thin
gray
scabbed
skin
stretched
blankly
over
empty
sockets
but
there
was
a
mouth
a
gaping
shapeless
hole
sucking
the
air
with
the
sound
of
a
death
rattle
a
paralyzing
terror
filled
Harry
so
that
he
couldn't
move
or
speak
his
Patronus
flickered
and
died
white
fog
was
blinding
him
he
had
to
fight
expecto
patronum
he
couldn't
see
and
in
the
distance
he
heard
the
familiar
screaming
expecto
patronum
he
groped
in
the
mist
for
Sirius
and
found
his
arm
they
weren't
going
to
take
him
but
a
pair
of
strong
clammy
hands
suddenly
attached
themselves
around
harry's
neck
they
were
forcing
his
face
upward
he
could
feel
its
breath
it
was
going
to
get
rid
of
him
first
he
could
feel
its
putrid
breath
his
mother
was
screaming
in
his
ears
she
was
going
to
be
the
last
thing
he
ever
heard
And
then
through
the
fog
that
was
drowning
him
he
thought
he
saw
a
silvery
light
growing
brighter
and
brighter
he
felt
himself
fall
forward
onto
the
grass
facedown
too
weak
to
move
sick
and
shaking
harry
opened
his
eyes
the
dementor
must
have
released
him
the
blinding
light
was
illuminating
the
grass
around
him
the
screaming
had
stopped
the
cold
was
ebbing
away
something
was
driving
the
dementors
back
it
was
circling
around
him
and
Black
and
Hermione
they
were
leaving
the
air
was
warm
again
with
every
ounce
of
strength
he
could
muster
Harry
raised
his
head
a
few
inches
and
saw
an
animal
amid
the
light
galloping
away
across
the
lake
eyes
blurred
with
sweat
Harry
tried
to
make
out
what
it
was
it
was
as
bright
as
a
unicorn
fighting
to
stay
conscious
harry
watched
it
canter
to
a
halt
as
it
reached
the
opposite
shore
for
a
moment
Harry
saw
by
its
brightness
somebody
welcoming
it
back
raising
his
hand
to
pat
it
someone
who
looked
strangely
familiar
but
it
couldn't
be
harry
didn't
understand
he
couldn't
think
anymore
he
felt
the
last
of
his
strength
leave
him
and
his
head
hit
the
ground
as
he
fainted
chapter
twentyone
hermione's
secret
shocking
business
shocking
miracle
none
of
them
died
never
heard
the
like
by
thunder
it
was
lucky
you
were
there
Snape
thank
you
Minister
order
of
Merlin
Second
Class
i'd
say
first
Class
if
I
can
wangle
it
thank
you
very
much
indeed
Minister
nasty
cut
you've
got
there
black's
work
I
suppose
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
Potter
Weasley
and
Granger
Minister
no
black
had
bewitched
them
I
saw
it
immediately
a
Confundus
Charm
to
judge
by
their
behavior
they
seemed
to
think
there
was
a
possibility
he
was
innocent
they
weren't
responsible
for
their
actions
on
the
other
hand
their
interference
might
have
permitted
Black
to
escape
they
obviously
thought
they
were
going
to
catch
Black
singlehanded
they've
got
away
with
a
great
deal
before
now
i'm
afraid
it's
given
them
a
rather
high
opinion
of
themselves
and
of
course
Potter
has
always
been
allowed
an
extraordinary
amount
of
license
by
the
headmaster
ah
well
Snape
harry
Potter
you
know
we've
all
got
a
bit
of
a
blind
spot
where
he's
concerned
and
yet
is
it
good
for
him
to
be
given
so
much
special
treatment
personally
I
try
and
treat
him
like
any
other
student
and
any
other
student
would
be
suspended
at
the
very
least
for
leading
his
friends
into
such
danger
consider
Minister
against
all
school
rules
after
all
the
precautions
put
in
place
for
his
protection
outofbounds
at
night
consorting
with
a
werewolf
and
a
murderer
and
I
have
reason
to
believe
he
has
been
visiting
Hogsmeade
illegally
too
well
well
we
shall
see
Snape
we
shall
see
the
boy
has
undoubtedly
been
foolish
harry
lay
listening
with
his
eyes
tight
shut
he
felt
very
groggy
the
words
he
was
hearing
seemed
to
be
traveling
very
slowly
from
his
ears
to
his
brain
so
that
it
was
difficult
to
understand
his
limbs
felt
like
lead
his
eyelids
too
heavy
to
lift
he
wanted
to
lie
here
on
this
comfortable
bed
forever
what
amazes
me
most
is
the
behavior
of
the
dementors
you've
really
no
idea
what
made
them
retreat
Snape
no
Minister
by
the
time
I
had
come
round
they
were
heading
back
to
their
positions
at
the
entrances
extraordinary
and
yet
Black
and
Harry
and
the
girl
all
unconscious
by
the
time
I
reached
them
i
bound
and
gagged
Black
naturally
conjured
stretchers
and
brought
them
all
straight
back
to
the
castle
there
was
a
pause
harry's
brain
seemed
to
be
moving
a
little
faster
and
as
it
did
a
gnawing
sensation
grew
in
the
pit
of
his
stomach
he
opened
his
eyes
everything
was
slightly
blurred
somebody
had
removed
his
glasses
he
was
lying
in
the
dark
hospital
wing
at
the
very
end
of
the
ward
he
could
make
out
Madam
Pomfrey
with
her
back
to
him
bending
over
a
bed
harry
squinted
ron's
red
hair
was
visible
beneath
Madam
pomfrey's
arm
harry
moved
his
head
over
on
the
pillow
in
the
bed
to
his
right
lay
Hermione
moonlight
was
falling
across
her
bed
her
eyes
were
open
too
she
looked
petrified
and
when
she
saw
that
Harry
was
awake
pressed
a
finger
to
her
lips
then
pointed
to
the
hospital
wing
door
it
was
ajar
and
the
voices
of
Cornelius
Fudge
and
Snape
were
coming
through
it
from
the
corridor
outside
madam
Pomfrey
now
came
walking
briskly
up
the
dark
ward
to
harry's
bed
he
turned
to
took
at
her
she
was
carrying
the
largest
block
of
chocolate
he
had
ever
seen
in
his
life
it
looked
like
a
small
boulder
ah
you're
awake
she
said
briskly
she
placed
the
chocolate
on
harry's
bedside
table
and
began
breaking
it
apart
with
a
small
hammer
how's
Ron
said
Harry
and
Hermione
together
he'll
live
said
Madam
Pomfrey
grimly
as
for
you
two
you'll
be
staying
here
until
i'm
satisfied
you're
Potter
what
do
you
think
you're
doing
harry
was
sitting
up
putting
his
glasses
back
on
and
picking
up
his
wand
i
need
to
see
the
headmaster
he
said
potter
said
Madam
Pomfrey
soothingly

all
right

Black

locked
away
upstairs
the
dementors
will
be
performing
the
kiss
any
moment
now
what
harry
jumped
up
out
of
bed
Hermione
had
done
the
same
but
his
shout
had
been
heard
in
the
corridor
outside
next
second
Cornelius
Fudge
and
Snape
had
entered
the
ward
harry
Harry

said
Fudge
looking
agitated

Fudge
was
shaking
his
head
with
a
small
smile
on
his
face
harry

Hermione
said
she
had
hurried
to
harry's
side
and
was
gazing
imploringly
into
fudge's
face
i
saw
him
too
it
was
ron's
rat

an
Animagus
Pettigrew

Snape

that
you
leave
potter
is
my
patient
and
he
should
not
be
distressed
i'm
not
distressed
i'm
trying
to
tell
them
what
happened
harry
said
furiously
if
they'd
just
listen
but
Madam
Pomfrey
suddenly
stuffed
a
large
chunk
of
chocolate
into
harry's
mouth
he
choked
and
she
seized
the
opportunity
to
force
him
back
onto
the
bed
now
please
Minister
these
children
need
care
please
leave
The
door
opened
again
it
was
Dumbledore
harry
swallowed
his
mouthful
of
chocolate
with
great
difficulty
and
got
up
again
professor
Dumbledore
Sirius
Black
for
heaven's
sake
said
Madam
Pomfrey
hysterically
is
this
a
hospital
wing
or
not
headmaster
I
must
insist
my
apologies
Poppy
but
I
need
a
word
with
mr.
Potter
and
Miss
Granger
said
Dumbledore
calmly
i
have
just
been
talking
to
Sirius
Black
i
suppose
he's
told
you
the
same
fairy
tale
he's
planted
in
potter's
mind
spat
Snape
something
about
a
rat
and
Pettigrew
being
alive
that
indeed
is
black's
story
said
Dumbledore
surveying
Snape
closely
through
his
halfmoon
spectacles
and
does
my
evidence
count
for
nothing
snarled
Snape
peter
Pettigrew
was
not
in
the
Shrieking
Shack
nor
did
I
see
any
sign
of
him
on
the
grounds
that
was
because
you
were
knocked
out
Professor
said
Hermione
earnestly
you
didn't
arrive
in
time
to
hear
Miss
Granger
hold
your
tongue
now
Snape
said
Fudge
startled
the
young
lady
is
disturbed
in
her
mind
we
must
make
allowances
i
would
like
to
speak
to
Harry
and
Hermione
alone
said
Dumbledore
abruptly
cornelius
Severus
Poppy
please
leave
us
headmaster
sputtered
Madam
Pomfrey
they
need
treatment
they
need
rest
this
cannot
wait
said
Dumbledore
i
must
insist
madam
Pomfrey
pursed
her
lips
and
strode
away
into
her
office
at
the
end
of
the
ward
slamming
the
door
behind
her
fudge
consulted
the
large
gold
pocket
watch
dangling
from
his
waistcoat
the
dementors
should
have
arrived
by
now
he
said
i'll
go
and
meet
them
dumbledore
i'll
see
you
upstairs
he
crossed
to
the
door
and
held
it
open
for
Snape
but
Snape
hadn't
moved
you
surely
don't
believe
a
word
of
black's
story
snape
whispered
his
eyes
fixed
on
dumbledore's
face
i
wish
to
speak
to
Harry
and
Hermione
alone
Dumbledore
repeated
snape
took
a
step
toward
Dumbledore
sirius
Black
showed
he
was
capable
of
murder
at
the
age
of
sixteen
he
breathed
you
haven't
forgotten
that
Headmaster
you
haven't
forgotten
that
he
once
tried
to
kill
me
my
memory
is
as
good
as
it
ever
was
Severus
said
Dumbledore
quietly
snape
turned
on
his
heel
and
marched
through
the
door
Fudge
was
still
holding
it
closed
behind
them
and
Dumbledore
turned
to
Harry
and
Hermione
they
both
burst
into
speech
at
the
same
time
professor
black's
telling
the
truth
we
saw
Pettigrew
he
escaped
when
Professor
Lupin
turned
into
a
werewolf
he's
a
rat
pettigrew's
front
paw
I
mean
finger
he
cut
it
off
pettigrew
attacked
Ron
it
wasn't
Sirius
but
Dumbledore
held
up
his
hand
to
stem
the
flood
of
explanations
it
is
your
turn
to
listen
and
I
beg
you
will
not
interrupt
me
because
there
is
very
little
time
he
said
quietly
there
is
not
a
shred
of
proof
to
support
black's
story
except
your
word
and
the
word
of
two
thirteenyearold
wizards
will
not
convince
anybody
a
street
full
of
eyewitnesses
swore
they
saw
Sirius
murder
Pettigrew
i
myself
gave
evidence
to
the
Ministry
that
Sirius
had
been
the
Potters
SecretKeeper
professor
Lupin
can
tell
you
Harry
said
unable
to
stop
himself
Professor
Lupin
is
currently
deep
in
the
forest
unable
to
tell
anyone
anything
by
the
time
he
is
human
again
it
will
be
too
late
Sirius
will
be
worse
than
dead
i
might
add
that
werewolves
are
so
mistrusted
by
most
of
our
kind
that
his
support
will
count
for
very
little
and
the
fact
that
he
and
Sirius
are
old
friends
but
listen
to
me
Harry
it
is
too
late
you
understand
me
you
must
see
that
Professor
snape's
version
of
events
is
far
more
convincing
than
yours
he
hates
Sirius
Hermione
said
desperately
all
because
of
some
stupid
trick
Sirius
played
on
him
sirius
has
not
acted
like
an
innocent
man
the
attack
on
the
Fat
Lady
entering
Gryffindor
Tower
with
a
knife
without
Pettigrew
alive
or
dead
we
have
no
chance
of
overturning
sirius's
sentence
but
you
believe
us
yes
I
do
said
Dumbledore
quietly
but
I
have
no
power
to
make
other
men
see
the
truth
or
to
overrule
the
Minister
of
Magic
harry
stared
up
into
the
grave
face
and
felt
as
though
the
ground
beneath
him
were
falling
sharply
away
he
had
grown
used
to
the
idea
that
Dumbledore
could
solve
anything
he
had
expected
Dumbledore
to
pull
some
amazing
solution
out
of
the
air
but
no
their
last
hope
was
gone
what
we
need
said
Dumbledore
slowly
and
his
light
blue
eyes
moved
from
Harry
to
Hermione
is
more
time
but
Hermione
began
and
then
her
eyes
became
very
round
oh
now
pay
attention
said
Dumbledore
speaking
very
low
and
very
clearly
sirius
is
locked
in
Professor
flitwick's
office
on
the
seventh
floor
thirteenth
window
from
the
right
of
the
West
Tower
if
all
goes
well
you
will
be
able
to
save
more
than
one
innocent
life
tonight
but
remember
this
both
of
you
you
must
not
be
seen
miss
Granger
you
know
the
law
you
know
what
is
at
stake
you
must
not
be
seen
harry
didn't
have
a
clue
what
was
going
on
dumbledore
had
turned
on
his
heel
and
looked
back
as
he
reached
the
door
i
am
going
to
lock
you
in
it
is
he
consulted
his
watch
five
minutes
to
midnight
miss
Granger
three
turns
should
do
it
good
luck
good
luck
harry
repeated
as
the
door
closed
behind
Dumbledore
three
turns
what's
he
talking
about
what
are
we
supposed
to
do
but
Hermione
was
fumbling
with
the
neck
of
her
robes
pulling
from
beneath
them
a
very
long
very
fine
gold
chain
harry
come
here
she
said
urgently
quick
harry
moved
toward
her
completely
bewildered
she
was
holding
the
chain
out
he
saw
a
tiny
sparkling
hourglass
hanging
from
it
here
she
had
thrown
the
chain
around
his
neck
too
ready
she
said
breathlessly
what
are
we
doing
harry
said
completely
lost
hermione
turned
the
hourglass
over
three
times
the
dark
ward
dissolved
harry
had
the
sensation
that
he
was
flying
very
fast
backward
a
blur
of
colors
and
shapes
rushed
past
him
his
ears
were
pounding
he
tried
to
yell
but
couldn't
hear
his
own
voice
And
then
he
felt
solid
ground
beneath
his
feet
and
everything
came
into
focus
again
He
was
standing
next
to
Hermione
in
the
deserted
entrance
hall
and
a
stream
of
golden
sunlight
was
falling
across
the
paved
floor
from
the
open
front
doors
he
looked
wildly
around
at
Hermione
the
chain
of
the
hourglass
cutting
into
his
neck
hermione
what
in
here
hermione
seized
harry's
arm
and
dragged
him
across
the
hall
to
the
door
of
a
broom
closet
she
opened
it
pushed
him
inside
among
the
buckets
and
mops
then
slammed
the
door
behind
them
what
how
Hermione
what
happened
we've
gone
back
in
time
Hermione
whispered
lifting
the
chain
off
harry's
neck
in
the
darkness
three
hours
back
harry
found
his
own
leg
and
gave
it
a
very
hard
pinch
it
hurt
a
lot
which
seemed
to
rule
out
the
possibility
that
he
was
having
a
very
bizarre
dream
but
shh
listen
someone's
coming
i
think
I
think
it
might
be
us
hermione
had
her
ear
pressed
against
the
cupboard
door
footsteps
across
the
hall
yes
I
think
it's
us
going
down
to
hagrid's
are
you
telling
me
Harry
whispered
that
we're
here
in
this
cupboard
and
we're
out
there
too
yes
said
Hermione
her
ear
still
glued
to
the
cupboard
door
i'm
sure
it's
us
it
doesn't
sound
like
more
than
three
people
and
we're
walking
slowly
because
we're
under
the
Invisibility
Cloak
she
broke
off
still
listening
intently
we've
gone
down
the
front
steps
hermione
sat
down
on
an
upturned
bucket
looking
desperately
anxious
but
Harry
wanted
a
few
questions
answered
where
did
you
get
that
hourglass
thing
it's
called
a
TimeTurner
Hermione
whispered
and
I
got
it
from
Professor
McGonagall
on
our
first
day
back
i've
been
using
it
all
year
to
get
to
all
my
lessons
professor
McGonagall
made
me
swear
I
wouldn't
tell
anyone
she
had
to
write
all
sorts
of
letters
to
the
Ministry
of
magic
so
I
could
have
one
she
had
to
tell
them
that
I
was
a
model
student
and
that
i'd
never
ever
use
it
for
anything
except
my
studies
i've
been
turning
it
back
so
I
could
do
hours
over
again
that's
how
i've
been
doing
several
lessons
at
once
see
but
harry
I
don't
understand
what
Dumbledore
wants
us
to
do
why
did
he
tell
us
to
go
back
three
hours
how's
that
going
to
help
Sirius
harry
stared
at
her
shadowy
face
there
must
be
something
that
happened
around
now
he
wants
us
to
change
he
said
slowly
what
happened
we
were
walking
down
to
hagrid's
three
hours
ago
this
is
three
hours
ago
and
we
are
walking
down
to
hagrid's
said
Hermione
we
just
heard
ourselves
leaving
harry
frowned
he
felt
as
though
he
were
screwing
up
his
whole
brain
in
concentration
dumbledore
just
said
just
said
we
could
save
more
than
one
innocent
life
and
then
it
hit
him
hermione
we're
going
to
save
Buckbeak
but
how
will
that
help
Sirius
dumbledore
said
he
just
told
us
where
the
window
is
the
window
of
flitwick's
office
where
they've
got
Sirius
locked
up
we've
got
to
fly
Buckbeak
up
to
the
window
and
rescue
Sirius
sirius
can
escape
on
Buckbeak
they
can
escape
together
from
what
Harry
could
see
of
hermione's
face
she
looked
terrified
if
we
manage
that
without
being
seen
it'll
be
a
miracle
well
we've
got
to
try
haven't
we
said
Harry
he
stood
up
and
pressed
his
ear
against
the
door
doesn't
sound
like
anyone's
there
come
on
let's
go
harry
pushed
open
the
closet
door
the
entrance
hall
was
deserted
as
quietly
and
quickly
as
they
could
they
darted
out
of
the
closet
and
down
the
stone
steps
the
shadows
were
already
lengthening
the
tops
of
the
trees
in
the
Forbidden
Forest
gilded
once
more
with
gold
if
anyone's
looking
out
of
the
window
Hermione
squeaked
looking
up
at
the
castle
behind
them
we'll
run
for
it
said
Harry
determinedly
straight
into
the
forest
all
right
we'll
have
to
hide
behind
a
tree
or
something
and
keep
a
lookout
okay
but
we'll
go
around
by
the
greenhouses
said
Hermione
breathlessly
we
need
to
keep
out
of
sight
of
hagrid's
front
door
or
we'll
see
us
we
must
be
nearly
at
hagrid's
by
now
still
working
out
what
she
meant
Harry
set
off
at
a
sprint
Hermione
behind
him
they
tore
across
the
vegetable
gardens
to
the
greenhouses
paused
for
a
moment
behind
them
then
set
off
again
fast
as
they
could
skirting
around
the
Whomping
Willow
tearing
toward
the
shelter
of
the
forest
safe
in
the
shadows
of
the
trees
Harry
turned
around
seconds
later
hermione
arrived
beside
him
panting
right
she
gasped
we
need
to
sneak
over
to
hagrid's
keep
out
of
sight
Harry
they
made
their
way
silently
through
the
trees
keeping
to
the
very
edge
of
the
forest
then
as
they
glimpsed
the
front
of
hagrid's
house
they
heard
a
knock
upon
his
door
they
moved
quickly
behind
a
wide
oak
trunk
and
peered
out
from
either
side
hagrid
had
appeared
in
his
doorway
shaking
and
white
looking
around
to
see
who
had
knocked
and
Harry
heard
his
own
voice
it's
us
we're
wearing
the
Invisibility
Cloak
let
us
in
and
we
can
take
it
off
yeh
shouldn've
come
hagrid
whispered
he
stood
back
then
shut
the
door
quickly
this
is
the
weirdest
thing
we've
ever
done
Harry
said
fervently
let's
move
along
a
bit
Hermione
whispered
we
need
to
get
nearer
to
Buckbeak
they
crept
through
the
trees
until
they
saw
the
nervous
hippogriff
tethered
to
the
fence
around
hagrid's
pumpkin
patch
now
harry
whispered
no
said
Hermione
if
we
steal
him
now
those
Committee
people
will
think
Hagrid
set
him
free
we've
got
to
wait
until
they've
seen
he's
tied
outside
that's
going
to
give
us
about
sixty
seconds
said
Harry
this
was
starting
to
seem
impossible
at
that
moment
there
was
a
crash
of
breaking
china
from
inside
hagrid's
cabin
that's
Hagrid
breaking
the
milk
jug
Hermione
whispered
i'm
going
to
find
Scabbers
in
a
moment
sure
enough
a
few
minutes
later
they
heard
hermione's
shriek
of
surprise
hermione
said
Harry
suddenly
what
if
we
we
just
run
in
there
and
grab
Pettigrew
no
said
Hermione
in
a
terrified
whisper
don't
you
understand
we're
breaking
one
of
the
most
important
wizarding
laws
nobody's
supposed
to
change
time
nobody
you
heard
Dumbledore
if
we're
seen
we'd
only
be
seen
by
ourselves
and
Hagrid
harry
what
do
you
think
you'd
do
if
you
saw
yourself
bursting
into
hagrid's
house
said
Hermione
i'd
i'd
think
i'd
gone
mad
said
Harry
or
i'd
think
there
was
some
Dark
Magic
going
on
exactly
you
wouldn't
understand
you
might
even
attack
yourself
don't
you
see
professor
McGonagall
told
me
what
awful
things
have
happened
when
wizards
have
meddled
with
time
loads
of
them
ended
up
killing
their
past
or
future
selves
by
mistake
okay
said
Harry
it
was
just
an
idea
I
just
thought
But
Hermione
nudged
him
and
pointed
toward
the
castle
harry
moved
his
head
a
few
inches
to
get
a
clear
view
of
the
distant
front
doors
dumbledore
Fudge
the
old
Committee
member
and
Macnair
the
executioner
were
coming
down
the
steps
we're
about
to
come
out
hermione
breathed
and
sure
enough
moments
later
hagrid's
back
door
opened
and
Harry
saw
himself
Ron
and
Hermione
walking
out
of
it
with
Hagrid
it
was
without
a
doubt
the
strangest
sensation
of
his
life
standing
behind
the
tree
and
watching
himself
in
the
pumpkin
patch
it's
Okay
Beaky
it's
okay
hagrid
said
to
Buckbeak
then
he
turned
to
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
go
on
get
goin
hagrid
we
can't
we'll
tell
them
what
really
happened
They
can't
kill
him
go
it's
bad
enough
without
you
lot
in
trouble
an
all
harry
watched
the
Hermione
in
the
pumpkin
patch
throw
the
Invisibility
Cloak
over
him
and
Ron
go
quick
don
listen
there
was
a
knock
on
hagrid's
front
door
the
execution
party
had
arrived
hagrid
turned
around
and
headed
back
into
his
cabin
leaving
the
back
door
ajar
harry
watched
the
grass
flatten
in
patches
all
around
the
cabin
and
heard
three
pairs
of
feet
retreating
he
Ron
and
Hermione
had
gone
but
the
Harry
and
Hermione
hidden
in
the
trees
could
now
hear
what
was
happening
inside
the
cabin
through
the
back
door
where
is
the
beast
came
the
cold
voice
of
Macnair
out
outside
Hagrid
croaked
harry
pulled
his
head
out
of
sight
as
macnair's
face
appeared
at
hagrid's
window
staring
out
at
Buckbeak
then
they
heard
Fudge
we
er
have
to
read
you
the
official
notice
of
execution
Hagrid
i'll
make
it
quick
and
then
you
and
Macnair
need
to
sign
it
macnair
you're
supposed
to
listen
too
that's
procedure
macnair's
face
vanished
from
the
window
it
was
now
or
never
wait
here
Harry
whispered
to
Hermione
i'll
do
it
as
fudge's
voice
started
again
Harry
darted
out
from
behind
his
tree
vaulted
the
fence
into
the
pumpkin
patch
and
approached
Buckbeak
it
is
the
decision
of
the
Committee
for
the
Disposal
of
Dangerous
Creatures
that
the
hippogriff
Buckbeak
hereafter
called
the
condemned
shall
he
executed
on
the
sixth
of
June
at
sundown
careful
not
to
blink
Harry
stared
up
into
buckbeak's
fierce
orange
eyes
once
more
and
bowed
buckbeak
sank
to
his
scaly
knees
and
then
stood
up
again
harry
began
to
fumble
with
the
knot
of
rope
tying
Buckbeak
to
the
fence
sentenced
to
execution
by
beheading
to
be
carried
out
by
the
committee's
appointed
executioner
Walden
Macnai
come
on
Buckbeak
Harry
murmured
come
on
we're
going
to
help
you
quietly
quietly
as
witnessed
below
hagrid
you
sign
here
harry
threw
all
his
weight
onto
the
rope
but
Buckbeak
had
dug
in
his
front
feet
well
let's
get
this
over
with
said
the
reedy
voice
of
the
Committee
member
from
inside
hagrid's
cabin
hagrid
perhaps
it
will
be
better
if
you
stay
inside
no
I
I
wan
ter
be
with
him
i
don
wan
him
ter
be
alone
footsteps
echoed
from
within
the
cabin
buckbeak
move
harry
hissed
harry
tugged
harder
on
the
rope
around
buckbeak's
neck
the
hippogriff
began
to
walk
rustling
its
wings
irritably
they
were
still
ten
feet
away
from
the
forest
in
plain
view
of
hagrid's
back
door
one
moment
please
Macnair
came
dumbledore's
voice
you
need
to
sign
too
the
footsteps
stopped
harry
heaved
on
the
rope
buckbeak
snapped
his
beak
and
walked
a
little
faster
hermione's
white
face
was
sticking
out
from
behind
a
tree
harry
hurry
she
mouthed
harry
could
still
hear
dumbledore's
voice
talking
from
within
the
cabin
he
gave
the
rope
another
wrench
buckbeak
broke
into
a
grudging
trot
they
had
reached
the
trees
quick
quick
hermione
moaned
darting
out
from
behind
her
tree
seizing
the
rope
too
and
adding
her
weight
to
make
Buckbeak
move
faster
harry
looked
over
his
shoulder
they
were
now
blocked
from
sight
they
couldn't
see
hagrid's
garden
at
all
stop
he
whispered
to
Hermione
they
might
hear
us
hagrid's
back
door
had
opened
with
a
bang
harry
Hermione
and
Buckbeak
stood
quite
still
even
the
hippogriff
seemed
to
be
listening
intently
silence
then
Where
is
it
said
the
reedy
voice
of
the
Committee
member
where
is
the
beast
it
was
tied
here
said
the
executioner
furiously
i
saw
it
just
here
how
extraordinary
said
Dumbledore
there
was
a
note
of
amusement
in
his
voice
beaky
said
Hagrid
huskily
there
was
a
swishing
noise
and
the
thud
of
an
axe
the
executioner
seemed
to
have
swung
it
into
the
fence
in
anger
and
then
came
the
howling
and
this
time
they
could
hear
hagrid's
words
through
his
sobs
gone
gone
bless
his
little
beak
he's
gone
musta
pulled
himself
free
beaky
yeh
clever
boy
buckbeak
started
to
strain
against
the
rope
trying
to
get
back
to
Hagrid
harry
and
Hermione
tightened
their
grip
and
dug
their
heels
into
the
forest
floor
to
stop
him
someone
untied
him
the
executioner
was
snarling
we
should
search
the
grounds
the
forest
macnair
if
Buckbeak
has
indeed
been
stolen
do
you
really
think
the
thief
will
have
led
him
away
on
foot
said
Dumbledore
still
sounding
amused
search
the
skies
if
you
will
hagrid
I
could
do
with
a
cup
of
tea
or
a
large
brandy
o
o
course
Professor
said
Hagrid
who
sounded
weak
with
happiness
come
in
come
in
harry
and
Hermione
listened
closely
they
heard
footsteps
the
soft
cursing
of
the
executioner
the
snap
of
the
door
and
then
silence
once
more
now
what
whispered
Harry
looking
around
we'll
have
to
hide
in
here
said
Hermione
who
looked
very
shaken
we
need
to
wait
until
they've
gone
back
to
the
castle
then
we
wait
until
it's
safe
to
fly
Buckbeak
up
to
sirius's
window
he
won't
be
there
for
another
couple
of
hours
oh
this
is
going
to
be
difficult
she
looked
nervously
over
her
shoulder
into
the
depths
of
the
forest
the
sun
was
setting
now
we're
going
to
have
to
move
said
Harry
thinking
hard
we've
got
to
be
able
to
see
the
Whomping
Willow
or
we
won't
know
what's
going
on
okay
said
Hermione
getting
a
firmer
grip
on
buckbeak's
rope
but
we've
got
to
keep
out
of
sight
Harry
remember
they
moved
around
the
edge
of
the
forest
darkness
falling
thickly
around
them
until
they
were
hidden
behind
a
clump
of
trees
through
which
they
could
make
out
the
Willow
there's
Ron
said
Harry
suddenly
a
dark
figure
was
sprinting
across
the
lawn
and
its
shout
echoed
through
the
still
night
air
get
away
from
him
get
away
Scabbers
come
here
and
then
they
saw
two
more
figures
materialize
out
of
nowhere
harry
watched
himself
and
Hermione
chasing
after
Ron
then
he
saw
Ron
dive
gotcha
get
off
you
stinking
cat
there's
Sirius
said
Harry
the
great
shape
of
the
dog
had
bounded
out
from
the
roots
of
the
Willow
they
saw
him
bowl
Harry
over
then
seize
Ron
looks
even
worse
from
here
doesn't
it
said
Harry
watching
the
dog
pulling
Ron
into
the
roots
ouch
look
I
just
got
walloped
by
the
tree
and
so
did
you
this
is
weird
the
Whomping
Willow
was
creaking
and
lashing
out
with
its
lower
branches
they
could
see
themselves
darting
here
and
there
trying
to
reach
the
trunk
and
then
the
tree
froze
that
was
Crookshanks
pressing
the
knot
said
Hermione
and
there
we
go
harry
muttered
we're
in
the
moment
they
disappeared
the
tree
began
to
move
again
seconds
later
they
heard
footsteps
quite
close
by
dumbledore
Macnair
Fudge
and
the
old
Committee
member
were
making
their
way
up
to
the
castle
right
after
we'd
gone
down
into
the
passage
said
Hermione
if
only
Dumbledore
had
come
with
us
macnair
and
Fudge
would've
come
too
said
Harry
bitterly
i
bet
you
anything
Fudge
would've
told
Macnair
to
murder
Sirius
on
the
spot
they
watched
the
four
men
climb
the
castle
steps
and
disappear
from
view
for
a
few
minutes
the
scene
was
deserted
then
Here
comes
Lupin
said
Harry
as
they
saw
another
figure
sprinting
down
the
stone
steps
and
hating
toward
the
Willow
harry
looked
up
at
the
sky
clouds
were
obscuring
the
moon
completely
they
watched
Lupin
seize
a
broken
branch
from
the
ground
and
prod
the
knot
on
the
trunk
the
tree
stopped
fighting
and
Lupin
too
disappeared
into
the
gap
in
its
roots
if
he'd
only
grabbed
the
cloak
said
Harry
it's
just
lying
there
he
turned
to
Hermione
if
I
just
dashed
out
now
and
grabbed
it
snape'd
never
be
able
to
get
it
and
harry
we
mustn't
be
seen
how
can
you
stand
this
he
asked
Hermione
fiercely
just
standing
here
and
watching
it
happen
he
hesitated
i'm
going
to
grab
the
cloak
harry
no
hermione
seized
the
back
of
harry's
robes
not
a
moment
too
soon
just
then
they
heard
a
burst
of
song
it
was
Hagrid
making
his
way
up
to
the
castle
singing
at
the
top
of
his
voice
and
weaving
slightly
as
he
walked
a
large
bottle
was
swinging
from
his
hands
see
hermione
whispered
see
what
would
have
happened
we've
got
to
keep
out
of
sight
no
Buckbeak
the
hippogriff
was
making
frantic
attempts
to
get
to
Hagrid
again
Harry
seized
his
rope
too
straining
to
hold
Buckbeak
back
they
watched
Hagrid
meander
tipsily
up
to
the
castle
he
was
gone
buckbeak
stopped
fighting
to
get
away
his
head
drooped
sadly
barely
two
minutes
later
the
castle
doors
flew
open
yet
again
and
Snape
came
charging
out
of
them
running
toward
the
Willow
harry's
fists
clenched
as
they
watched
Snape
skid
to
a
halt
next
to
the
tree
looking
around
he
grabbed
the
cloak
and
held
it
up
get
your
filthy
hands
off
it
Harry
snarled
under
his
breath
shh
snape
seized
the
branch
Lupin
had
used
to
freeze
the
tree
prodded
the
knot
and
vanished
from
view
as
he
put
on
the
cloak
so
that's
it
said
Hermione
quietly
we're
all
down
there
and
now
we've
just
got
to
wait
until
we
come
back
up
again
she
took
the
end
of
buckbeak's
rope
and
tied
it
securely
around
the
nearest
tree
then
sat
down
on
the
dry
ground
arms
around
her
knees
harry
there's
something
I
don't
understand
why
didn't
the
dementors
get
Sirius
i
remember
them
coming
and
then
I
think
I
passed
out
there
were
so
many
of
them
harry
sat
down
too
he
explained
what
he'd
seen
how
as
the
nearest
dementor
had
lowered
its
mouth
to
harry's
a
large
silver
something
had
come
galloping
across
the
lake
and
forced
the
dementors
to
retreat
hermione's
mouth
was
slightly
open
by
the
time
Harry
had
finished
but
what
was
it
there's
only
one
thing
it
could
have
been
to
make
the
dementors
go
said
Harry
a
real
Patronus
a
powerful
one
but
who
conjured
it
harry
didn't
say
anything
he
was
thinking
back
to
the
person
he'd
seen
on
the
other
bank
of
the
lake
he
knew
who
he
thought
it
had
been
but
how
could
it
have
been
didn't
you
see
what
they
looked
like
said
Hermione
eagerly
was
it
one
of
the
teachers
no
said
Harry
he
wasn't
a
teacher
but
it
must
have
been
a
really
powerful
wizard
to
drive
all
those
dementors
away
if
the
Patronus
was
shining
so
brightly
didn't
it
light
him
up
couldn't
you
see
yeah
I
saw
him
said
Harry
slowly
but
maybe
I
imagined
it
i
wasn't
thinking
straight
i
passed
out
right
afterward
who
did
you
think
it
was
i
think
Harry
swallowed
knowing
how
strange
this
was
going
to
sound
i
think
it
was
my
dad
harry
glanced
up
at
Hermione
and
saw
that
her
mouth
was
fully
open
now
she
was
gazing
at
him
with
a
mixture
of
alarm
and
pity
harry
your
dad's
well
dead
she
said
quietly
i
know
that
said
Harry
quickly
you
think
you
saw
his
ghost
i
don't
know
no
he
looked
solid
but
then
maybe
I
was
seeing
things
said
Harry
but
from
what
I
could
see
it
looked
like
him
i've
got
photos
of
him
hermione
was
still
looking
at
him
as
though
worried
about
his
sanity
i
know
it
sounds
crazy
said
Harry
flatly
he
turned
to
took
at
Buckbeak
who
was
digging
his
beak
into
the
ground
apparently
searching
for
worms
but
he
wasn't
really
watching
Buckbeak
he
was
thinking
about
his
father
and
about
his
father's
three
oldest
friends
moony
Wormtail
Padfoot
and
Prongs
had
all
four
of
them
been
out
on
the
grounds
tonight
wormtail
had
reappeared
this
evening
when
everyone
had
thought
he
was
dead
was
it
so
impossible
his
father
had
done
the
same
had
he
been
seeing
things
across
the
take
the
figure
had
been
too
far
away
to
see
distinctly
yet
he
had
felt
sure
for
a
moment
before
he'd
lost
consciousness
the
leaves
overhead
rustled
faintly
in
the
breeze
the
moon
drifted
in
and
out
of
sight
behind
the
shifting
clouds
hermione
sat
with
her
face
turned
toward
the
Willow
waiting
and
then
at
last
after
over
an
hour
here
we
come
hermione
whispered
she
and
Harry
got
to
their
feet
buckbeak
raised
his
head
they
saw
Lupin
Ron
and
Pettigrew
clambering
awkwardly
out
of
the
hole
in
the
roots
then
came
Hermione
then
the
unconscious
Snape
drifting
weirdly
upward
next
came
Harry
and
Black
they
all
began
to
walk
toward
the
castle
harry's
heart
was
starting
to
beat
very
fast
he
glanced
up
at
the
sky
any
moment
now
that
cloud
was
going
to
move
aside
and
show
the
moon
harry
Hermione
muttered
as
though
she
knew
exactly
what
he
was
thinking
we've
got
to
stay
put
we
mustn't
be
seen
there's
nothing
we
can
do
so
we're
just
going
to
let
Pettigrew
escape
all
over
again
said
Harry
quietly
how
do
you
expect
to
find
a
rat
in
the
dark
snapped
Hermione
there's
nothing
we
can
do
we
came
back
to
help
Sirius
we're
not
supposed
to
be
doing
anything
else
all
right
the
moon
slid
out
from
behind
its
cloud
they
saw
the
tiny
figures
across
the
grounds
stop
then
they
saw
movement
There
goes
Lupin
Hermione
whispered
he's
transforming
Hermione
said
Harry
suddenly
we've
got
to
move
we
mustn't
I
keep
telling
you
not
to
interfere
lupin's
going
to
run
into
the
forest
right
at
us
hermione
gasped
quick
she
moaned
dashing
to
untie
Buckbeak
quick
where
are
we
going
to
go
where
are
we
going
to
hide
the
dementors
wilt
be
coming
any
moment
back
to
hagrid's
harry
said
it's
empty
now
come
on
they
ran
as
fast
as
they
could
Buckbeak
cantering
along
behind
them
they
could
hear
the
werewolf
howling
behind
them
the
cabin
was
in
sight
Harry
skidded
to
the
door
wrenched
it
open
and
Hermione
and
Buckbeak
flashed
past
him
Harry
threw
himself
in
after
them
and
bolted
the
door
fang
the
boarhound
barked
loudly
shh
Fang
it's
us
said
Hermione
hurrying
over
and
scratching
his
ears
to
quieten
him
that
was
really
close
she
said
to
Harry
yeah
harry
was
looking
out
of
the
window
it
was
much
harder
to
see
what
was
going
on
from
here
buckbeak
seemed
very
happy
to
find
himself
back
inside
hagrid's
house
he
lay
down
in
front
of
the
fire
folded
his
wings
contentedly
and
seemed
ready
for
a
good
nap
i
think
i'd
better
go
outside
again
you
know
said
Harry
slowly
i
can't
see
what's
going
on
we
won't
know
when
it's
time
hermione
looked
up
her
expression
was
suspicious
i'm
not
going
to
try
and
interfere
said
Harry
quickly
but
if
we
don't
see
what's
going
on
how're
we
going
to
know
when
it's
time
to
rescue
Sirius
well
okay
then
i'll
wait
here
with
Buckbeak
but
Harry
be
careful
there's
a
werewolf
out
there
and
the
dementors
Harry
stepped
outside
again
and
edged
around
the
cabin
he
could
hear
yelping
in
the
distance
that
meant
the
dementors
were
closing
in
on
Sirius
he
and
Hermione
would
be
running
to
him
any
moment
harry
stared
out
toward
the
lake
his
heart
doing
a
kind
of
drumroll
in
his
chest
whoever
had
sent
that
Patronus
would
be
appearing
at
any
moment
for
a
fraction
of
a
second
he
stood
irresolute
in
front
of
hagrid's
door
you
must
not
be
seen
but
he
didn't
want
to
be
seen
he
wanted
to
do
the
seeing
he
had
to
know
and
there
were
the
dementors
they
were
emerging
out
of
the
darkness
from
every
direction
gliding
around
the
edges
of
the
lake
they
were
moving
away
from
where
Harry
stood
to
the
opposite
bank
he
wouldn't
have
to
get
near
them
harry
began
to
run
he
had
no
thought
in
his
head
except
his
father
if
it
was
him
if
it
really
was
him
he
had
to
know
had
to
find
out
the
lake
was
coming
nearer
and
nearer
but
there
was
no
sign
of
anybody
on
the
opposite
bank
he
could
see
tiny
glimmers
of
silver
his
own
attempts
at
a
Patronus
there
was
a
bush
at
the
very
edge
of
the
water
harry
threw
himself
behind
it
peering
desperately
through
the
leaves
on
the
opposite
bank
the
glimmers
of
silver
were
suddenly
extinguished
a
terrified
excitement
shot
through
him
any
moment
now
Come
on
he
muttered
staring
about
where
are
you
dad
come
on
but
no
one
came
harry
raised
his
head
to
look
at
the
circle
of
dementors
across
the
lake
one
of
them
was
lowering
its
hood
it
was
time
for
the
rescuer
to
appear
but
no
one
was
coming
to
help
this
time
And
then
it
hit
him
he
understood
he
hadn't
seen
his
father
he
had
seen
himself
Harry
flung
himself
out
from
behind
the
bush
and
pulled
out
his
wand
expecto
patronum
he
yelled
and
out
of
the
end
of
his
wand
burst
not
a
shapeless
cloud
of
mist
but
a
blinding
dazzling
silver
animal
he
screwed
up
his
eyes
trying
to
see
what
it
was
it
looked
like
a
horse
it
was
galloping
silently
away
from
him
across
the
black
surface
of
the
lake
he
saw
it
lower
its
head
and
charge
at
the
swarming
dementors
now
it
was
galloping
around
and
around
the
black
shapes
on
the
ground
and
the
dementors
were
falling
back
scattering
retreating
into
the
darkness
they
were
gone
the
Patronus
turned
it
was
cantering
back
toward
Harry
across
the
still
surface
of
the
water
it
wasn't
a
horse
it
wasn't
a
unicorn
either
it
was
a
stag
it
was
shining
brightly
as
the
moon
above
it
was
coming
back
to
him
it
stopped
on
the
bank
its
hooves
made
no
mark
on
the
soft
ground
as
it
stared
at
Harry
with
its
large
silver
eyes
slowly
it
bowed
its
antlered
head
and
Harry
realized
prongs
he
whispered
but
as
his
trembling
fingertips
stretched
toward
the
creature
it
vanished
harry
stood
there
hand
still
outstretched
then
with
a
great
leap
of
his
heart
he
heard
hooves
behind
him
he
whirled
around
and
saw
Hermione
dashing
toward
him
dragging
Buckbeak
behind
her
what
did
you
do
she
said
fiercely
you
said
you
were
only
going
to
keep
a
lookout
i
just
saved
all
our
lives
said
Harry
get
behind
here
behind
this
bush
i'll
explain
hermione
listened
to
what
had
just
happened
with
her
mouth
open
yet
again
did
anyone
see
you
yes
haven't
you
been
listening
i
saw
me
but
I
thought
I
was
my
dad
it's
okay
harry
I
can't
believe
it
you
conjured
up
a
Patronus
that
drove
away
all
those
dementors
that's
very
very
advanced
magic
i
knew
I
could
do
it
this
time
said
Harry
because
i'd
already
done
it
does
that
make
sense
i
don't
know
Harry
look
at
Snape
together
they
peered
around
the
bush
at
the
other
bank
snape
had
regained
consciousness
he
was
conjuring
stretchers
and
lifting
the
limp
forms
of
Harry
Hermione
and
Black
onto
them
a
fourth
stretcher
no
doubt
bearing
Ron
was
already
floating
at
his
side
then
wand
held
out
in
front
of
him
he
moved
them
away
toward
the
castle
right
it's
nearly
time
said
Hermione
tensely
looking
at
her
watch
we've
got
about
fortyfive
minutes
until
Dumbledore
locks
the
door
to
the
hospital
wing
we've
got
to
rescue
Sirius
and
get
back
into
the
ward
before
anybody
realizes
we're
missing
They
waited
watching
the
moving
clouds
reflected
in
the
lake
while
the
bush
next
to
them
whispered
in
the
breeze
buckbeak
bored
was
ferreting
for
worms
again
d
you
reckon
he's
up
there
yet
said
Harry
checking
his
watch
he
looked
up
at
the
castle
and
began
counting
the
windows
to
the
right
of
the
West
Tower
look
hermione
whispered
who's
that
someone's
coming
back
out
of
the
castle
harry
stared
through
the
darkness
the
man
was
hurrying
across
the
grounds
toward
one
of
the
entrances
something
shiny
glinted
in
his
belt
macnair
said
Harry
the
executioner
he's
gone
to
get
the
dementors
this
is
it
Hermione
hermione
put
her
hands
on
buckbeak's
back
and
Harry
gave
her
a
leg
up
then
he
placed
his
foot
on
one
of
the
lower
branches
of
the
bush
and
climbed
up
in
front
of
her
he
pulled
buckbeak's
rope
back
over
his
neck
and
tied
it
to
the
other
side
of
his
collar
like
reins
ready
he
whispered
to
Hermione
yotm
better
hold
on
to
me
He
nudged
buckbeak's
sides
with
his
heels
buckbeak
soared
straight
into
the
dark
air
harry
gripped
his
flanks
with
his
knees
feeling
the
great
wings
rising
powerfully
beneath
them
hermione
was
holding
Harry
very
tight
around
the
waist
he
could
hear
her
muttering
Oh
no
I
don't
like
this
oh
I
really
don't
like
this
harry
urged
Buckbeak
forward
they
were
gliding
quietly
toward
the
upper
floors
of
the
castle
harry
pulled
hard
on
the
lefthand
side
of
the
rope
and
Buckbeak
turned
harry
was
trying
to
count
the
windows
flashing
past
Whoa
he
said
pulling
backward
as
hard
as
he
could
buckbeak
slowed
down
and
they
found
themselves
at
a
stop
unless
you
counted
the
fact
that
they
kept
rising
up
and
down
several
feet
as
the
hippogriff
beat
his
wings
to
remain
airborne
he's
there
harry
said
spotting
Sirius
as
they
rose
up
beside
the
window
he
reached
out
and
as
buckbeak's
wings
fell
was
able
to
tap
sharply
on
the
glass
black
looked
up
harry
saw
his
jaw
drop
he
leapt
from
his
chair
hurried
to
the
window
and
tried
to
open
it
but
it
was
locked
stand
back
hermione
called
to
him
and
she
took
out
her
wand
still
gripping
the
back
of
harry's
robes
with
her
left
hand
alohomora
the
window
sprang
open
how
how
said
Black
weakly
staring
at
the
hippogriff
Get
on
there's
not
much
time
said
Harry
gripping
Buckbeak
firmly
on
either
side
of
his
sleek
neck
to
hold
him
steady
you've
got
to
get
out
of
here
the
dementors
are
coming
macnair's
gone
to
get
them
black
placed
a
hand
on
either
side
of
the
window
frame
and
heaved
his
head
and
shoulders
out
of
it
it
was
very
lucky
he
was
so
thin
in
seconds
he
had
managed
to
fling
one
leg
over
buckbeak's
back
and
pull
himself
onto
the
hippogriff
behind
Hermione
okay
Buckbeak
up
said
Harry
shaking
the
rope
up
to
the
tower
come
on
the
hippogriff
gave
one
sweep
of
its
mighty
wings
and
they
were
soaring
upward
again
high
as
the
top
of
the
West
Tower
buckbeak
landed
with
a
clatter
on
the
battlements
and
Harry
and
Hermione
slid
off
him
at
once
sirius
you'd
better
go
quick
Harry
panted
they'll
reach
flitwick's
office
any
moment
they'll
find
out
you're
gone
buckbeak
pawed
the
ground
tossing
his
sharp
head
what
happened
to
the
other
boy
ron
croaked
Sirius
he's
going
to
be
okay
he's
still
out
of
it
but
Madam
Pomfrey
says
she'll
be
able
to
make
him
better
quick
go
but
Black
was
still
staring
down
at
Harry
how
can
I
ever
thank
go
harry
and
Hermione
shouted
together
black
wheeled
Buckbeak
around
facing
the
open
sky
we'll
see
each
other
again
he
said
you
are
truly
your
father's
son
Harry
he
squeezed
buckbeak's
sides
with
his
heels
harry
and
Hermione
jumped
back
as
the
enormous
wings
rose
once
more
the
hippogriff
took
off
into
the
air
he
and
his
rider
became
smaller
and
smaller
as
Harry
gazed
after
them
then
a
cloud
drifted
across
the
moon
they
were
gone
chapter
twentytwo
owl
post
again
harry
hermione
was
tugging
at
his
sleeve
staring
at
her
watch
we've
got
exactly
ten
minutes
to
get
back
down
to
the
hospital
wing
without
anybody
seeing
us
before
Dumbledore
locks
the
door
okay
said
Harry
wrenching
his
gaze
from
the
sky
let's
go
they
slipped
through
the
doorway
behind
them
and
down
a
tightly
spiraling
stone
staircase
as
they
reached
the
bottom
of
it
they
heard
voices
they
flattened
themselves
against
the
wall
and
listened
it
sounded
like
Fudge
and
Snape
they
were
walking
quickly
along
the
corridor
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
only
hope
dumbledore's
not
going
to
make
difficulties
Snape
was
saying
the
Kiss
will
be
performed
immediately
as
soon
as
Macnair
returns
with
the
dementors
this
whole
Black
affair
has
been
highly
embarrassing
i
can't
tell
you
how
much
i'm
looking
forward
to
informing
the
Daily
Prophet
that
we've
got
him
at
last
i
daresay
they'll
want
to
interview
you
Snape
and
once
young
harry's
back
in
his
right
mind
I
expect
he'll
want
to
tell
the
Prophet
exactly
how
you
saved
him
harry
clenched
his
teeth
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
snape's
smirk
as
he
and
Fudge
passed
Harry
and
hermione's
hiding
place
their
footsteps
died
away
harry
and
Hermione
waited
a
few
moments
to
make
sure
they'd
really
gone
then
started
to
run
in
the
opposite
direction
down
one
staircase
then
another
along
a
new
corridor
then
they
heard
a
cackling
ahead
peeves
harry
muttered
grabbing
hermione's
wrist
in
here
they
tore
into
a
deserted
classroom
to
their
left
just
in
time
peeves
seemed
to
be
bouncing
along
the
corridor
in
boisterous
good
spirits
laughing
his
head
off
oh
he's
horrible
whispered
Hermione
her
ear
to
the
door
i
bet
he's
all
excited
because
the
dementors
are
going
to
finish
off
Sirius
she
checked
her
watch
three
minutes
Harry
they
waited
until
peeves's
gloating
voice
had
faded
into
the
distance
then
slid
back
out
of
the
room
and
broke
into
a
run
again
hermione
what'll
happen
if
we
don't
get
back
inside
before
Dumbledore
locks
the
door
harry
panted
i
don't
want
to
think
about
it
hermione
moaned
checking
her
watch
again
one
minute
they
had
reached
the
end
of
the
corridor
with
the
hospital
wing
entrance
okay
I
can
hear
Dumbledore
said
Hermione
tensely
come
on
Harry
they
crept
along
the
corridor
the
door
opened
dumbledore's
back
appeared
i
am
going
to
lock
you
in
they
heard
him
saying
it
is
five
minutes
to
midnight
miss
Granger
three
turns
should
do
it.
Good
luck
dumbledore
backed
out
of
the
room
closed
the
door
and
took
out
his
wand
to
magically
lock
it
panicking
Harry
and
Hermione
ran
forward
dumbledore
looked
up
and
a
wide
smile
appeared
under
the
long
silver
mustache
well
he
said
quietly
we
did
it
said
Harry
breathlessly
sirius
has
gone
on
Buckbeak
dumbledore
beamed
at
them
well
done
i
think
He
listened
intently
for
any
sound
within
the
hospital
wing
yes
I
think
you've
gone
too
get
inside
i'll
lock
you
in
harry
and
Hermione
slipped
back
inside
the
dormitory
it
was
empty
except
for
Ron
who
was
still
lying
motionless
in
the
end
bed
as
the
lock
clicked
behind
them
Harry
and
Hermione
crept
back
to
their
own
beds
Hermione
tucking
the
TimeTurner
back
under
her
robes
a
moment
later
Madam
Pomfrey
came
striding
back
out
of
her
office
did
I
hear
the
headmaster
leaving
am
I
allowed
to
look
after
my
patients
now
she
was
in
a
very
bad
mood
harry
and
Hermione
thought
it
best
to
accept
their
chocolate
quietly
madam
Pomfrey
stood
over
them
making
sure
they
ate
it
but
Harry
could
hardly
swallow
he
and
Hermione
were
waiting
listening
their
nerves
jangling
and
then
as
they
both
took
a
fourth
piece
of
chocolate
from
Madam
Pomfrey
they
heard
a
distant
roar
of
fury
echoing
from
somewhere
above
them
what
was
that
said
Madam
Pomfrey
in
alarm
now
they
could
hear
angry
voices
growing
louder
and
louder
madam
Pomfrey
was
staring
at
the
door
really
they'll
wake
everybody
up
what
do
they
think
they're
doing
harry
was
trying
to
hear
what
the
voices
were
saying
they
were
drawing
nearer
he
must
have
Disapparated
Severus
we
should
have
left
somebody
in
the
room
with
him
when
this
gets
out
he
didn't
disapparate
snape
roared
now
very
close
at
hand
you
can't
apparate
or
disapparate
inside
this
castle
this
has
something
to
do
with
potter
severus
be
reasonable
Harry
has
been
locked
up
bam
the
door
of
the
hospital
wing
burst
open
fudge
Snape
and
Dumbledore
came
striding
into
the
ward
dumbledore
alone
looked
calm
indeed
he
looked
as
though
he
was
quite
enjoying
himself
fudge
appeared
angry
but
Snape
was
beside
himself
out
with
it
potter
he
bellowed
what
did
you
do
professor
Snape
shrieked
Madam
Pomfrey
control
yourself
see
here
Snape
be
reasonable
said
Fudge
this
door's
been
locked
we
just
saw
they
helped
him
escape
I
know
it
snape
howled
pointing
at
Harry
and
Hermione
his
face
was
twisted
spit
was
flying
from
his
mouth
calm
down
man
fudge
barked
you're
talking
nonsense
you
don't
know
potter
shrieked
Snape
he
did
it
I
know
he
did
it
that
will
do
Severus
said
Dumbledore
quietly
think
about
what
you
are
saying
this
door
has
been
locked
since
I
left
the
ward
ten
minutes
ago
madam
Pomfrey
have
these
students
left
their
beds
of
course
not
said
Madam
Pomfrey
bristling
i
would
have
heard
them
well
there
you
have
it
Severus
said
Dumbledore
calmly
unless
you
are
suggesting
that
Harry
and
Hermione
are
able
to
be
in
two
places
at
once
i'm
afraid
I
don't
see
any
point
in
troubling
them
further
snape
stood
there
seething
staring
from
Fudge
who
looked
thoroughly
shocked
at
his
behavior
to
Dumbledore
whose
eyes
were
twinkling
behind
his
glasses
snape
whirled
about
robes
swishing
behind
him
and
stormed
out
of
the
ward
fellow
seems
quite
unbalanced
said
Fudge
staring
after
him
i'd
watch
out
for
him
if
I
were
you
Dumbledore
oh
he's
not
unbalanced
said
Dumbledore
quietly
he's
just
suffered
a
severe
disappointment
he's
not
the
only
one
puffed
Fudge
the
Daily
prophet's
going
to
have
a
field
day
we
had
Black
cornered
and
he
slipped
through
our
fingers
yet
again
all
it
needs
now
is
for
the
story
of
that
hippogriff's
escape
to
get
out
and
i'll
be
a
laughingstock
well
i'd
better
go
and
notify
the
Ministry
and
the
dementors
said
Dumbledore
they'll
be
removed
from
the
school
I
trust
oh
yes
they'll
have
to
go
said
Fudge
running
his
fingers
distractedly
through
his
hair
never
dreamed
they'd
attempt
to
administer
the
Kiss
on
an
innocent
boy
completely
out
of
control
no
i'll
have
them
packed
off
back
to
Azkaban
tonight
perhaps
we
should
think
about
dragons
at
the
school
entrance
hagrid
would
like
that
said
Dumbledore
smiling
at
Harry
and
Hermione
as
he
and
Fudge
left
the
dormitory
Madam
Pomfrey
hurried
to
the
door
and
locked
it
again
muttering
angrily
to
herself
she
headed
back
to
her
office
there
was
a
low
moan
from
the
other
end
of
the
ward
ron
had
woken
up
they
could
see
him
sitting
up
rubbing
his
head
looking
around
what
what
happened
he
groaned
harry
why
are
we
in
here
where's
Sirius
where's
Lupin
what's
going
on
harry
and
Hermione
looked
at
each
other
you
explain
said
Harry
helping
himself
to
some
more
chocolate
when
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
left
the
hospital
wing
at
noon
the
next
day
it
was
to
find
an
almost
deserted
castle
the
sweltering
heat
and
the
end
of
the
exams
meant
that
everyone
was
taking
full
advantage
of
another
Hogsmeade
visit
neither
Ron
nor
Hermione
felt
like
going
however
so
they
and
Harry
wandered
onto
the
grounds
still
talking
about
the
extraordinary
events
of
the
previous
night
and
wondering
where
Sirius
and
Buckbeak
were
now
sitting
near
the
lake
watching
the
giant
squid
waving
its
tentacles
lazily
above
the
water
Harry
lost
the
thread
of
the
conversation
as
he
looked
across
to
the
opposite
bank
the
stag
had
galloped
toward
him
from
there
just
last
night
a
shadow
fell
across
them
and
they
looked
tip
to
see
a
very
blearyeyed
Hagrid
mopping
his
sweaty
face
with
one
of
his
tableclothsized
handkerchiefs
and
beaming
down
at
them
know
I
shouldn
feel
happy
after
wha
happened
las
night
he
said
i
mean
Black
escapin
again
an
everythin
but
guess
what
what
they
said
pretending
to
look
curious
beaky
he
escaped
he's
free
bin
celebratin
all
night
that's
wonderful
said
Hermione
giving
Ron
a
reproving
look
because
he
looked
as
though
he
was
close
to
laughing
yeah
can't've
tied
him
up
properly
said
Hagrid
gazing
happily
out
over
the
grounds
i
was
worried
this
mornin
mind
thought
he
mighta
met
Professor
Lupin
on
the
grounds
but
Lupin
says
he
never
ate
anythin
las
night
what
said
Harry
quickly
blimey
haven
yeh
heard
said
Hagrid
his
smile
fading
a
little
he
lowered
his
voice
even
though
there
was
nobody
in
sight
er
Snape
told
all
the
Slytherins
this
mornin
thought
everyone'd
know
by
now
professor
lupin's
a
werewolf
see
an
he
was
loose
on
the
grounds
las
night
he's
packin
now
o
course
he's
packing
said
Harry
alarmed
why
leavin
isn
he
said
Hagrid
looking
surprised
that
Harry
had
to
ask
resigned
firs
thing
this
mornin
says
he
can't
risk
it
happenin
again
harry
scrambled
to
his
feet
i'm
going
to
see
him
he
said
to
Ron
and
Hermione
but
if
he's
resigned
doesn't
sound
like
there's
anything
we
can
do
i
don't
care
i
still
want
to
see
him
i'll
meet
you
back
here
lupin's
office
door
was
open
he
had
already
packed
most
of
his
things
the
grindylow's
empty
tank
stood
next
to
his
battered
old
suitcase
which
was
open
and
nearly
full
lupin
was
bending
over
something
on
his
desk
and
looked
up
only
when
Harry
knocked
on
the
door
i
saw
you
coming
said
Lupin
smiling
he
pointed
to
the
parchment
he
had
been
poring
over
it
was
the
marauder's
Map
i
just
saw
Hagrid
said
Harry
and
he
said
you'd
resigned
it's
not
true
is
it
i'm
afraid
it
is
said
Lupin
he
started
opening
his
desk
drawers
and
taking
out
the
contents
why
said
Harry
the
Ministry
of
Magic
don't
think
you
were
helping
Sirius
do
they
lupin
crossed
to
the
door
and
closed
it
behind
Harry
no.
Professor
Dumbledore
managed
to
convince
Fudge
that
I
was
trying
to
save
your
lives
he
sighed
that
was
the
final
straw
for
Severus
i
think
the
loss
of
the
Order
of
Merlin
hit
him
hard
so
he
er
accidentally
let
slip
that
I
am
a
werewolf
this
morning
at
breakfast
you're
not
leaving
just
because
of
that
said
Harry
lupin
smiled
wryly
this
time
tomorrow
the
owls
will
start
arriving
from
parents
they
will
not
want
a
werewolf
teaching
their
children
Harry
and
after
last
night
I
see
their
point
i
could
have
bitten
any
of
you
that
must
never
happen
again
you're
the
best
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
teacher
we've
ever
had
said
Harry
don't
go
lupin
shook
his
head
and
didn't
speak
he
carried
on
emptying
his
drawers
then
while
Harry
was
trying
to
think
of
a
good
argument
to
make
him
stay
Lupin
said
From
what
the
headmaster
told
me
this
morning
you
saved
a
lot
of
lives
last
night
Harry
if
i'm
proud
of
anything
i've
done
this
year
it's
how
much
you've
learned
tell
me
about
your
Patronus
how
d'you
know
about
that
said
Harry
distracted
what
else
could
have
driven
the
dementors
back
harry
told
Lupin
what
had
happened
when
he'd
finished
Lupin
was
smiling
again
yes
your
father
was
always
a
stag
when
he
transformed
he
said
you
guessed
right
that's
why
we
called
him
Prongs
lupin
threw
his
last
few
books
into
his
case
closed
the
desk
drawers
and
turned
to
look
at
Harry
here
I
brought
this
from
the
Shrieking
Shack
last
night
he
said
handing
Harry
back
the
Invisibility
Cloak
and
he
hesitated
then
held
out
the
marauder's
Map
too
i
am
no
longer
your
teacher
so
I
don't
feel
guilty
about
giving
you
back
this
as
well
it's
no
use
to
me
and
I
daresay
you
Ron
and
Hermione
will
find
uses
for
it
harry
took
the
map
and
grinned
you
told
me
Moony
Wormtail
Padfoot
and
Prongs
would've
wanted
to
lure
me
out
of
school
you
said
they'd
have
thought
it
was
funny
and
so
we
would
have
said
Lupin
now
reaching
down
to
close
his
case
i
have
no
hesitation
in
saying
that
James
would
have
been
highly
disappointed
if
his
son
had
never
found
any
of
the
secret
passages
out
of
the
castle
there
was
a
knock
on
the
door
harry
hastily
stuffed
the
marauder's
Map
and
the
Invisibility
Cloak
into
his
pocket
it
was
Professor
Dumbledore
he
didn't
look
surprised
to
see
Harry
there
your
carriage
is
at
the
gates
Remus
he
said
thank
You
Headmaster
lupin
picked
up
his
old
suitcase
and
the
empty
grindylow
tank
well
goodbye
Harry
he
said
smiling
it
has
been
a
real
pleasure
teaching
you
i
feel
sure
we'll
meet
again
sometime
headmaster
there
is
no
need
to
see
me
to
the
gates
I
can
manage
harry
had
the
impression
that
Lupin
wanted
to
leave
as
quickly
as
possible
goodbye
then
Remus
said
Dumbledore
soberly
lupin
shifted
the
grindylow
tank
slightly
so
that
he
and
Dumbledore
could
shake
hands
then
with
a
final
nod
to
Harry
and
a
swift
smile
Lupin
left
the
office
harry
sat
down
in
his
vacated
chair
staring
glumly
at
the
floor
he
heard
the
door
close
and
looked
up
dumbledore
was
still
there
why
so
miserable
Harry
he
said
quietly
you
should
be
very
proud
of
yourself
after
last
night
it
didn't
make
any
difference
said
Harry
bitterly
pettigrew
got
away
didn't
make
any
difference
said
Dumbledore
quietly
It
made
all
the
difference
in
the
world
Harry
you
helped
uncover
the
truth
you
saved
an
innocent
man
from
a
terrible
fate
terrible
something
stirred
in
harry's
memory
greater
and
more
terrible
than
ever
before
professor
trelawney's
prediction
professor
Dumbledore
yesterday
when
I
was
having
my
Divination
exam
Professor
Trelawney
went
very
very
strange
indeed
said
Dumbledore
er
stranger
than
usual
you
mean
yes
her
voice
went
all
deep
and
her
eyes
rolled
and
she
said
she
said
voldemort's
servant
was
going
to
set
out
to
return
to
him
before
midnight
she
said
the
servant
would
help
him
come
back
to
power
harry
stared
up
at
Dumbledore
and
then
she
sort
of
became
normal
again
and
she
couldn't
remember
anything
she'd
said
was
it
was
she
making
a
real
prediction
dumbledore
looked
mildly
impressed
do
you
know
Harry
I
think
she
might
have
been
he
said
thoughtfully
who'd
have
thought
it
that
brings
her
total
of
real
predictions
up
to
two
i
should
offer
her
a
pay
raise
but
Harry
looked
at
him
aghast
how
could
Dumbledore
take
this
so
calmly
but
I
stopped
Sirius
and
Professor
Lupin
from
killing
Pettigrew
that
makes
it
my
fault
if
Voldemort
comes
back
it
does
not
said
Dumbledore
quietly
hasn't
your
experience
with
the
timeTurner
taught
you
anything
Harry
the
consequences
of
our
actions
are
always
so
complicated
so
diverse
that
predicting
the
future
is
a
very
difficult
business
indeed
professor
Trelawney
bless
her
is
living
proof
of
that
you
did
a
very
noble
thing
in
saving
pettigrew's
life
but
if
he
helps
Voldemort
back
to
power
Pettigrew
owes
his
life
to
you
you
have
sent
Voldemort
a
deputy
who
is
in
your
debt
when
one
wizard
saves
another
wizard's
life
it
creates
a
certain
bond
between
them
and
i'm
much
mistaken
if
Voldemort
wants
his
servant
in
the
debt
of
Harry
Potter
i
don't
want
a
connection
with
Pettigrew
said
Harry
he
betrayed
my
parents
this
is
magic
at
its
deepest
its
most
impenetrable
Harry
but
trust
me
the
time
may
come
when
you
will
be
very
glad
you
saved
pettigrew's
life
harry
couldn't
imagine
when
that
would
be
dumbledore
looked
as
though
he
knew
what
Harry
was
thinking
i
knew
your
father
very
well
both
at
Hogwarts
and
later
Harry
he
said
gently
he
would
have
saved
Pettigrew
too
I
am
sure
of
it
harry
looked
up
at
him
dumbledore
wouldn't
laugh
he
could
tell
Dumbledore
i
thought
it
was
my
dad
who'd
conjured
my
Patronus
i
mean
when
I
saw
myself
across
the
lake
i
thought
I
was
seeing
him
an
easy
mistake
to
make
said
Dumbledore
softly
i
expect
you'll
tire
of
hearing
it
but
you
do
look
extraordinarily
like
James
except
for
the
eyes
you
have
your
mother's
eyes
harry
shook
his
head
it
was
stupid
thinking
it
was
him
he
muttered
i
mean
I
knew
he
was
dead
you
think
the
dead
we
loved
ever
truly
leave
us
you
think
that
we
don't
recall
them
more
clearly
than
ever
in
times
of
great
trouble
your
father
is
alive
in
you
Harry
and
shows
himself
most
plainly
when
you
have
need
of
him
how
else
could
you
produce
that
particular
Patronus
prongs
rode
again
last
night
it
took
a
moment
for
Harry
to
realize
what
Dumblefore
had
said
last
night
Sirius
told
me
all
about
how
they
became
Animagi
said
Dumbledore
smiling
an
extraordinary
achievement
not
least
keeping
it
quiet
from
me
and
then
I
remembered
the
most
unusual
form
your
Patronus
took
when
it
charged
mr.
Malfoy
down
at
your
Quidditch
match
against
Ravenclaw
you
know
Harry
in
a
way
you
did
see
your
father
last
night
you
found
him
inside
yourself
and
Dumbledore
left
the
office
leaving
Harry
to
his
very
confused
thoughts
nobody
at
Hogwarts
now
knew
the
truth
of
what
had
happened
the
night
that
Sirius
Buckbeak
and
Pettigrew
had
vanished
except
Harry
Ron
hermione
and
Professor
Dumbledore
as
the
end
of
term
approached
Harry
heard
many
different
theories
about
what
had
really
happened
but
none
of
them
came
close
to
the
truth
malfoy
was
furious
about
Buckbeak
he
was
convinced
that
Hagrid
had
found
a
way
of
smuggling
the
hippogriff
to
safety
and
seemed
outraged
that
he
and
his
father
had
been
outwitted
by
a
gamekeeper
percy
Weasley
meanwhile
had
much
to
say
on
the
subject
of
sirius's
escape
if
I
manage
to
get
into
the
Ministry
i'll
have
a
lot
of
proposals
to
make
about
Magical
Law
Enforcement
he
told
the
only
person
who
would
listen
his
girlfriend
Penelope
though
the
weather
was
perfect
though
the
atmosphere
was
so
cheerful
though
he
knew
they
had
achieved
the
near
impossible
in
helping
Sirius
to
freedom
Harry
had
never
approached
the
end
of
a
school
year
in
worse
spirits
he
certainly
wasn't
the
only
one
who
was
sorry
to
see
Professor
Lupin
go
the
whole
of
harry's
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
class
was
miserable
about
his
resignation
wonder
what
they'll
give
us
next
year
said
Seamus
Finnigan
gloomily
maybe
a
vampire
suggested
Dean
Thomas
hopefully
it
wasn't
only
Professor
lupin's
departure
that
was
weighing
on
harry's
mind
he
couldn't
help
thinking
a
lot
about
Professor
trelawney's
prediction
he
kept
wondering
where
Pettigrew
was
now
whether
he
had
sought
sanctuary
with
Voldemort
yet
but
the
thing
that
was
lowering
harry's
spirits
most
of
all
was
the
prospect
of
returning
to
the
Dursleys
for
maybe
half
an
hour
a
glorious
half
hour
he
had
believed
he
would
be
living
with
Sirius
from
now
on
his
parents
best
friend
it
would
have
been
the
next
best
thing
to
having
his
own
father
back
and
while
no
news
of
Sirius
was
definitely
good
news
because
it
meant
he
had
successfully
gone
into
hiding
Harry
couldn't
help
feeling
miserable
when
he
thought
of
the
home
he
might
have
had
and
the
fact
that
it
was
now
impossible
the
exam
results
came
out
on
the
last
day
of
term
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
had
passed
every
subject
harry
was
amazed
that
he
had
got
through
Potions
he
had
a
shrewd
suspicion
that
Dumbledore
might
have
stepped
in
to
stop
Snape
failing
him
on
purpose
snape's
behavior
toward
Harry
over
the
past
week
had
been
quite
alarming
harry
wouldn't
have
thought
it
possible
that
snape's
dislike
for
him
could
increase
but
it
certainly
had
a
muscle
twitched
unpleasantly
at
the
corner
of
snape's
thin
mouth
every
time
he
looked
at
Harry
and
he
was
constantly
flexing
his
fingers
as
though
itching
to
place
them
around
harry's
throat
percy
had
got
his
topgrade
N
e.w.t.s
Fred
and
George
had
scraped
a
handful
of
O
w.l.s
each
gryffindor
House
meanwhile
largely
thanks
to
their
spectacular
performance
in
the
Quidditch
Cup
had
won
the
House
championship
for
the
third
year
running
this
meant
that
the
end
of
term
feast
took
place
amid
decorations
of
scarlet
and
gold
and
that
the
Gryffindor
table
was
the
noisiest
of
the
lot
as
everybody
celebrated
even
Harry
managed
to
forget
about
the
journey
back
to
the
Dursleys
the
next
day
as
he
ate
drank
talked
and
laughed
with
the
rest
as
the
Hogwarts
Express
pulled
out
of
the
station
the
next
mornIng
hermione
gave
Harry
and
Ron
some
surprising
news
i
went
to
see
Professor
McGonagall
this
morning
just
before
breakfast
i've
decided
to
drop
Muggle
Studies
but
you
passed
your
exam
with
three
hundred
and
twenty
percent
said
Ron
i
know
sighed
Hermione
but
I
can't
stand
another
year
like
this
one
that
TimeTurner
it
was
driving
me
mad
i've
handed
it
in
without
Muggle
Studies
and
Divination
i'll
be
able
to
have
a
normal
schedule
again
i
still
can't
believe
you
didn't
tell
us
about
it
said
Ron
grumpily
we're
supposed
to
be
your
friends
i
promised
I
wouldn't
tell
anyone
said
Hermione
severely
she
looked
around
at
Harry
who
was
watching
Hogwarts
disappear
from
view
behind
a
mountain
two
whole
months
before
he'd
see
it
again
oh
cheer
up
Harry
said
Hermione
sadly
i'm
okay
said
Harry
quickly
just
thinking
about
the
holidays
yeah
i've
been
thinking
about
them
too
said
Ron
harry
you've
got
to
come
and
stay
with
us
i'll
fix
it
up
with
Mum
and
Dad
then
i'll
call
you
i
know
how
to
use
a
fellytone
now
a
telephone
Ron
said
Hermione
honestly
you
should
take
Muggle
Studies
next
year
ron
ignored
her
it's
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
this
summer
how
about
it
Harry
come
and
stay
and
we'll
go
and
see
it
dad
can
usually
get
tickets
from
work
this
proposal
had
the
effect
of
cheering
Harry
up
a
great
deal
yeah
i
bet
the
dursleys'd
be
pleased
to
let
me
come
especially
after
what
I
did
to
Aunt
Marge
feeling
considerably
more
cheerful
Harry
joined
Ron
and
Hermione
in
several
games
of
Exploding
Snap
and
when
the
witch
with
the
tea
cart
arrived
he
bought
himself
a
very
large
lunch
though
nothing
with
chocolate
in
it
but
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
before
the
thing
that
made
him
truly
happy
turned
up
harry
said
Hermione
suddenly
peering
over
his
shoulder
what's
that
thing
outside
your
window
harry
turned
to
look
outside
something
very
small
and
gray
was
bobbing
in
and
out
of
sight
beyond
the
glass
he
stood
up
for
a
better
look
and
saw
that
it
was
a
tiny
owl
carrying
a
letter
that
was
much
too
big
for
it
the
owl
was
so
small
in
fact
that
it
kept
tumbling
over
in
the
air
buffeted
this
way
and
that
in
the
train's
slipstream
harry
quickly
pulled
down
the
window
stretched
out
his
arm
and
caught
it
it
felt
like
a
very
fluffy
Snitch
he
brought
it
carefully
inside
the
owl
dropped
its
letter
onto
harry's
seat
and
began
zooming
around
their
compartment
apparently
very
pleased
with
itself
for
accomplishing
its
task
hedwig
clicked
her
beak
with
a
sort
of
dignified
disapproval
crookshanks
sat
up
in
his
seat
following
the
owl
with
his
great
yellow
eyes
ron
noticing
this
snatched
the
owl
safely
out
of
harm's
way
harry
picked
up
the
letter
it
was
addressed
to
him
he
ripped
open
the
letter
and
shouted
it's
from
Sirius
what
said
Ron
and
Hermione
excitedly
read
it
aloud
dear
Harry
i
hope
this
finds
you
before
you
reach
your
aunt
and
uncle
i
don't
know
whether
they're
used
to
owl
post
buckbeak
and
I
are
in
hiding
i
won't
tell
you
where
in
case
this
owl
falls
into
the
wrong
hands
i
have
some
doubt
about
his
reliability
but
he
is
the
best
I
could
find
and
he
did
seem
eager
for
the
job
i
believe
the
dementors
are
still
searching
for
me
but
they
haven't
a
hope
of
finding
me
here
i
am
planning
to
allow
some
Muggles
to
glimpse
me
soon
a
long
way
from
Hogwarts
so
that
the
security
on
the
castle
will
be
lifted
there
is
something
I
never
got
around
to
telling
you
during
our
brief
meeting
it
was
I
who
sent
you
the
Firebolt
Ha
said
Hermione
triumphantly
see
i
told
you
it
was
from
him
yes
but
he
hadn't
jinxed
it
had
he
said
Ron
ouch
the
tiny
owl
now
hooting
happily
in
his
hand
had
nibbled
one
of
his
fingers
in
what
it
seemed
to
think
was
an
affectionate
way
crookshanks
took
the
order
to
the
Owl
Office
for
me
i
used
your
name
but
told
them
to
take
the
gold
from
my
own
Gringotts
vault
please
consider
it
as
thirteen
birthdays
worth
of
presents
from
your
godfather
i
would
also
like
to
apologize
for
the
fright
I
think
I
gave
you
that
night
last
year
when
you
left
your
uncle's
house
i
had
only
hoped
to
get
a
glimpse
of
you
before
starting
my
journey
north
but
I
think
the
sight
of
me
alarmed
you
i
am
enclosing
something
else
for
you
which
I
think
will
make
your
next
year
at
Hogwarts
more
enjoyable
if
ever
you
need
me
send
word
your
owl
will
find
me
i'll
write
again
soon
sirius
Harry
looked
eagerly
inside
the
envelope
there
was
another
piece
of
parchment
in
there
he
read
it
through
quickly
and
felt
suddenly
as
warm
and
contented
as
though
he'd
swallowed
a
bottle
of
hot
butterbeer
in
one
gulp
i
Sirius
Black
Harry
potter's
godfather
hereby
give
him
permission
to
visit
Hogsmeade
on
weekends
that'll
be
good
enough
for
Dumbledore
said
Harry
happily
he
looked
back
at
sirius's
letter
hang
on
there's
a
rs
i
thought
your
ftiend
Ron
might
like
to
keep
this
owl
as
it's
my
fault
he
no
longer
has
a
rat
ron's
eyes
widened
the
minute
owl
was
still
hooting
excitedly
keep
him
he
said
uncertainly
he
looked
closely
at
the
owl
for
a
moment
then
to
harry's
and
hermione's
great
surprise
he
held
him
out
for
Crookshanks
to
sniff
what
do
you
reckon
ron
asked
the
cat
definitely
an
owl
crookshanks
purred
that's
good
enough
for
me
said
Ron
happily
he's
mine
harry
read
and
reread
the
letter
from
Sirius
all
the
way
back
into
king's
Cross
station
it
was
still
clutched
tightly
in
his
hand
as
he
ron
and
Hermione
stepped
back
through
the
barrier
of
platform
nine
an
threequarters
harry
spotted
Uncle
Vernon
at
once
he
was
standing
a
good
distance
from
mr.
and
Mrs
weasley
eyeing
them
suspiciously
and
when
Mrs
weasley
hugged
Harry
in
greeting
his
worst
suspicions
about
them
seemed
confirmed
i'll
call
about
the
World
Cup
ron
yelled
after
Harry
as
Harry
bid
him
and
Hermione
goodbye
then
wheeled
the
trolley
bearing
his
trunk
and
hedwig's
cage
toward
Uncle
Vernon
who
greeted
him
in
his
usual
fashion
what's
that
he
snarled
staring
at
the
envelope
Harry
was
still
clutching
in
his
hand
if
it's
another
form
for
me
to
sign
you've
got
another
it's
not
said
Harry
cheerfully
it's
a
letter
from
my
godfather
godfather
sputtered
Uncle
Vernon
you
haven't
got
a
godfather
yes
I
have
said
Harry
brightly
he
was
my
mum
and
dad's
best
friend
he's
a
convicted
murderer
but
he's
broken
out
of
wizard
prison
and
he's
on
the
run
he
likes
to
keep
in
touch
with
me
though
keep
up
with
my
news
check
if
i'm
happy
and
grinning
broadly
at
the
look
of
horror
on
Uncle
vernon's
face
harry
set
off
toward
the
station
exit
Hedwig
rattling
along
in
front
of
him
for
what
looked
like
a
much
better
summer
than
the
last
the
end
