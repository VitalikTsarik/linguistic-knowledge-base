harry
Potter
and
the
Order
of
the
Phoenix
by
J
k.
Rowling
chapter
one
dudley
Demented
the
hottest
day
of
the
summer
so
far
was
drawing
to
a
close
and
a
drowsy
silence
lay
over
the
large
square
houses
of
Privet
Drive
cars
that
were
usually
gleaming
stood
dusty
in
their
drives
and
lawns
that
were
once
emerald
green
lay
parched
and
yellowing
the
use
of
hosepipes
had
been
banned
due
to
drought
deprived
of
their
usual
car-washing
and
lawn-mowing
pursuits
the
inhabitants
of
Privet
Drive
had
retreated
into
the
shade
of
their
cool
houses
windows
thrown
wide
in
the
hope
of
tempting
in
a
nonexistent
breeze
the
only
person
left
outdoors
was
a
teenage
boy
who
was
lying
flat
on
his
back
in
a
flowerbed
outside
number
four
he
was
a
skinny
black-haired
bespectacled
boy
who
had
the
pinched
slightly
unhealthy
look
of
someone
who
has
grown
a
lot
in
a
short
space
of
time
his
jeans
were
torn
and
dirty
his
t-shirt
baggy
and
faded
and
the
soles
of
his
trainers
were
peeling
away
from
the
uppers
harry
Potters
appearance
did
not
endear
him
to
the
neighbors
who
were
the
sort
of
people
who
thought
scruffiness
ought
to
be
punishable
by
law
but
as
he
had
hidden
himself
behind
a
large
hydrangea
bush
this
evening
he
was
quite
invisible
to
passers-by
in
fact
the
only
way
he
would
be
spotted
was
if
his
Uncle
Vernon
or
Aunt
Petunia
stuck
their
heads
out
of
the
living-room
window
and
looked
straight
down
into
the
flowerbed
below
on
the
whole
Harry
thought
he
was
to
be
congratulated
on
his
idea
of
hiding
here
he
was
not
perhaps
very
comfortable
lying
on
the
hot
hard
earth
but
on
the
other
hand
nobody
was
glaring
at
him
grinding
their
teeth
so
loudly
that
he
could
not
hear
the
news
or
shooting
nasty
questions
at
him
as
had
happened
every
time
he
had
tried
sitting
down
in
the
living
room
to
watch
television
with
his
aunt
and
uncle
almost
as
though
this
thought
had
fluttered
through
the
open
window
Vernon
Dursley
Harrys
uncle
suddenly
spoke
glad
to
see
the
boys
stopped
trying
to
butt
in
where
is
he
anyway
i
dont
know
said
Aunt
Petunia
unconcerned
not
in
the
house
uncle
Vernon
grunted
watching
the
news
he
said
scathingly
id
like
to
know
what
hes
really
up
to
as
if
a
normal
boy
cares
whats
on
the
news
Dudley
hasnt
got
a
clue
whats
going
on
doubt
he
knows
who
the
Prime
Minister
is
anyway
its
not
as
if
thered
be
anything
about
his
lot
on
our
news
vernon
shh
said
Aunt
Petunia
the
windows
open
oh
yes
sorry
dear
the
Dursleys
fell
silent
harry
listened
to
a
jingle
about
Fruit
n
Bran
breakfast
cereal
while
he
watched
Mrs
figg
a
batty
cat-loving
old
lady
from
nearby
Wisteria
Walk
amble
slowly
past
she
was
frowning
and
muttering
to
herself
harry
was
very
pleased
he
was
concealed
behind
the
bush
as
Mrs
figg
had
recently
taken
to
asking
him
around
for
tea
whenever
she
met
him
in
the
street
she
had
rounded
the
corner
and
vanished
from
view
before
Uncle
Vernons
voice
floated
out
of
the
window
again
dudders
out
for
tea
at
the
Polkisses
said
Aunt
Petunia
fondly
hes
got
so
many
little
friends
hes
so
popular
harry
suppressed
a
snort
with
difficulty
the
Dursleys
really
were
astonishingly
stupid
about
their
son
Dudley
they
had
swallowed
all
his
dim-witted
lies
about
having
tea
with
a
different
member
of
his
gang
every
night
of
the
summer
holidays
harry
knew
perfectly
well
that
Dudley
had
not
been
to
tea
anywhere
he
and
his
gang
spent
every
evening
vandalizing
the
play
park
smoking
on
street
corners
and
throwing
stones
at
passing
cars
and
children
harry
had
seen
them
at
it
during
his
evening
walks
around
Little
Whinging
he
had
spent
most
of
the
holidays
wandering
the
streets
scavenging
newspapers
from
bins
along
the
way
the
opening
notes
of
the
music
that
heralded
the
seven
oclock
news
reached
Harrys
ears
and
his
stomach
turned
over
perhaps
tonight
after
a
month
of
waiting
would
be
the
night
record
numbers
of
stranded
holiday
makers
fill
air
ports
as
the
Spanish
baggage-handlers
strike
reaches
its
second
week
give
em
a
lifelong
siesta
I
would
snarled
Uncle
Vernon
over
the
end
of
the
newsreaders
sentence
but
no
matter
outside
in
the
flowerbed
Harrys
stomach
seemed
to
unclench
if
anything
had
happened
it
would
surely
have
been
the
first
item
on
the
news
death
and
destruction
were
more
important
than
stranded
holidaymakers
he
let
out
a
long
slow
breath
and
stared
up
at
the
brilliant
blue
sky
every
day
this
summer
had
been
the
same
the
tension
the
expectation
the
temporary
relief
and
then
mounting
tension
again
and
always
growing
more
insistent
all
the
time
the
question
of
why
nothing
had
happened
yet
he
kept
listening
just
in
case
there
was
some
small
clue
not
recognized
for
what
it
really
was
by
the
Muggles
an
unexplained
disappearance
perhaps
or
some
strange
accident
but
the
baggage-handlers
strike
was
followed
by
news
about
the
drought
in
the
Southeast
I
hope
hes
listening
next
door
bellowed
Uncle
Vernon
him
with
his
sprinklers
on
at
three
in
the
morning
then
a
helicopter
that
had
almost
crashed
in
a
field
in
Surrey
then
a
famous
actresss
divorce
from
her
famous
husband
As
if
were
interested
in
their
sordid
affairs
sniffed
Aunt
petunia
who
had
followed
the
case
obsessively
in
every
magazine
she
could
lay
her
bony
hands
on
harry
closed
his
eyes
against
the
now
blazing
evening
sky
as
the
newsreader
said
and
finally
bungy
the
budgie
has
found
a
novel
way
of
keeping
cool
this
summer
bungy
who
lives
at
the
five
Feathers
in
Barnsley
has
learned
to
water
ski
mary
Dorkins
went
to
find
out
more
harry
opened
his
eyes
if
they
had
reached
water-skiing
budgerigars
there
would
be
nothing
else
worth
hearing
he
rolled
cautiously
on
to
his
front
and
raised
himself
on
to
his
knees
and
elbows
preparing
to
crawl
out
from
under
the
window
he
had
moved
about
two
inches
when
several
things
happened
in
very
quick
succession
a
loud
echoing
crack
broke
the
sleepy
silence
like
a
gunshot
a
cat
streaked
out
from
under
a
parked
car
and
flew
out
of
sight
a
shriek
a
bellowed
oath
and
the
sound
of
breaking
china
came
from
the
Dursleys
living
room
and
as
though
this
was
the
signal
Harry
had
been
waiting
for
he
jumped
to
his
feet
at
the
same
time
pulling
from
the
waistband
of
his
jeans
a
thin
wooden
wand
as
if
he
were
unsheathing
a
sword
but
before
he
could
draw
himself
up
to
full
height
the
top
of
his
head
collided
with
the
Dursleys
open
window
the
resultant
crash
made
Aunt
Petunia
scream
even
louder
harry
felt
as
though
his
head
had
been
split
in
two
eyes
streaming
he
swayed
trying
to
focus
on
the
street
to
spot
the
source
of
the
noise
but
he
had
barely
staggered
upright
when
two
large
purple
hands
reached
through
the
open
window
and
closed
tightly
around
his
throat
put
it-away
uncle
Vernon
snarled
into
Harrys
ear
now
before
anyone
sees
get
off
me
harry
gasped
for
a
few
seconds
they
struggled
Harry
pulling
at
his
uncles
sausage-like
fingers
with
his
left
hand
his
right
maintaining
a
firm
grip
on
his
raised
wand
then
as
the
pain
in
the
top
of
Harrys
head
gave
a
particularly
nasty
throb
Uncle
Vernon
yelped
and
released
Harry
as
though
he
had
received
an
electric
shock
some
invisible
force
seemed
to
have
surged
through
his
nephew
making
him
impossible
to
hold
panting
Harry
fell
forwards
over
the
hydrangea
bush
straightened
up
and
stared
around
there
was
no
sign
of
what
had
caused
the
loud
cracking
noise
but
there
were
several
faces
peering
through
various
nearby
windows
harry
stuffed
his
wand
hastily
back
into
his
jeans
and
tried
to
look
innocent
lovely
evening
shouted
Uncle
Vernon
waving
at
Mrs
number
Seven
who
was
glaring
from
behind
her
net
curtains
did
you
hear
that
car
backfire
just
now
gave
Petunia
and
me
quite
a
turn
he
continued
to
grin
in
a
horrible
manic
way
until
all
the
curious
neighbors
had
disappeared
from
their
various
windows
then
the
grin
became
a
grimace
of
rage
as
he
beckoned
Harry
back
towards
him
harry
moved
a
few
steps
closer
taking
care
to
stop
just
short
of
the
point
at
which
Uncle
vernons
outstretched
hands
could
resume
their
strangling
what
the
devil
do
you
mean
by
it
boy
asked
Uncle
Vernon
in
a
croaky
voice
that
trembled
with
fury
what
do
I
mean
by
what
said
Harry
coldly
he
kept
looking
left
and
right
up
the
street
still
hoping
to
see
the
person
who
had
made
the
cracking
noise
making
a
racket
like
a
starting
pistol
right
outside
our
i
didnt
make
that
noise
said
Harry
firmly
aunt
Petunias
thin
horsy
face
now
appeared
beside
Uncle
Vernons
wide
purple
one
she
looked
livid
why
were
you
lurking
under
our
window
yes
yes
good
point
Petunia
what
were
you
doing
under
our
window
boy
listening
to
the
news
said
Harry
in
a
resigned
voice
his
aunt
and
uncle
exchanged
looks
of
outrage
listening
to
the
news
again
well
it
changes
every
day
you
see
said
Harry
dont
you
be
clever
with
me
boy
i
want
to
know
what
youre
really
up
to
and
dont
give
me
any
more
of
this
listening
to
the
news
tosh
you
know
perfectly
well
that
your
lot
careful
Vernon
breathed
Aunt
Petunia
and
Uncle
Vernon
lowered
his
voice
so
that
Harry
could
barely
hear
him
that
your
lot
dont
get
on
our
news
thats
all
you
know
said
Harry
the
Dursleys
goggled
at
him
for
a
few
seconds
then
Aunt
Petunia
said
Youre
a
nasty
little
liar
what
are
all
those
she
too
lowered
her
voice
so
that
Harry
had
to
lip-read
the
next
word
owls
doing
if
theyre
not
bringing
you
news
aha
said
Uncle
Vernon
in
a
triumphant
whisper
get
out
of
that
one
boy
as
if
we
didnt
know
you
get
all
your
news
from
those
pestilential
birds
harry
hesitated
for
a
moment
it
cost
him
something
to
tell
the
truth
this
time
even
though
his
aunt
and
uncle
could
not
possibly
know
how
bad
he
felt
at
admitting
it
the
owls
arent
bringing
me
news
he
said
tonelessly
i
dont
believe
it
said
Aunt
Petunia
at
once
no
more
do
I
said
Uncle
Vernon
forcefully
we
know
youre
up
to
something
funny
said
Aunt
Petunia
were
not
stupid
you
know
said
Uncle
Vernon
well
thats
news
to
me
said
Harry
his
temper
rising
and
before
the
Dursleys
could
call
him
back
he
had
wheeled
about
crossed
the
front
lawn
stepped
over
the
low
garden
wall
and
was
striding
off
up
the
street
he
was
in
trouble
now
and
he
knew
it
he
would
have
to
face
his
aunt
and
uncle
later
and
pay
the
price
for
his
rudeness
but
he
did
not
care
very
much
just
at
the
moment
he
had
much
more
pressing
matters
on
his
mind
harry
was
sure
the
cracking
noise
had
been
made
by
someone
Apparating
or
Disapparating
it
was
exactly
the
sound
Dobby
the
house-elf
made
when
he
vanished
into
thin
air
was
it
possible
that
Dobby
was
here
in
Privet
Drive
could
Dobby
be
following
him
right
at
this
very
moment
as
this
thought
occurred
he
wheeled
around
and
stared
back
down
Privet
Drive
but
it
appeared
to
be
completely
deserted
and
Harry
was
sure
that
Dobby
did
not
know
how
to
become
invisible
he
walked
on
hardly
aware
of
the
route
he
was
taking
for
he
had
pounded
these
streets
so
often
lately
that
his
feet
carried
him
to
his
favorite
haunts
automatically
every
few
steps
he
glanced
back
over
his
shoulder
someone
magical
had
been
near
him
as
he
lay
among
Aunt
Petunias
dying
begonias
he
was
sure
of
it
why
hadnt
they
spoken
to
him
why
hadnt
they
made
contact
why
were
they
hiding
now
and
then
as
his
feeling
of
frustration
peaked
his
certainty
leaked
away
perhaps
it
hadnt
been
a
magical
sound
after
all
perhaps
he
was
so
desperate
for
the
tiniest
sign
of
contact
from
the
world
to
which
he
belonged
that
he
was
simply
overreacting
to
perfectly
ordinary
noises
could
he
be
sure
it
hadnt
been
the
sound
of
something
breaking
inside
a
neighbors
house
harry
felt
a
dull
sinking
sensation
in
his
stomach
and
before
he
knew
it
the
feeling
of
hopelessness
that
had
plagued
him
all
summer
rolled
over
him
once
again
tomorrow
morning
he
would
be
woken
by
the
alarm
at
five
oclock
so
he
could
pay
the
owl
that
delivered
the
Daily
Prophet
but
was
there
any
point
continuing
to
take
it
harry
merely
glanced
at
the
front
page
before
throwing
it
aside
these
days
when
the
idiots
who
ran
the
paper
finally
realized
that
Voldemort
was
back
it
would
be
headline
news
and
that
was
the
only
kind
Harry
cared
about
if
he
was
lucky
there
would
also
be
owls
carrying
letters
from
his
best
friends
Ron
and
hermione
though
any
expectation
hed
had
that
their
letters
would
bring
him
news
had
long
since
been
dashed
we
cant
say
much
about
you-know-what
obviously
weve
been
told
not
to
say
anything
important
in
case
our
letters
go
astray
were
quite
busy
but
I
cant
give
you
details
here
theres
a
fair
amount
going
on
well
tell
you
everything
when
we
see
you
but
when
were
they
going
to
see
him
nobody
seemed
too
bothered
with
a
precise
date
hermione
had
scribbled
I
expect
well
be
seeing
you
quite
soon
inside
his
birthday
card
but
how
soon
was
soon
as
far
as
Harry
could
tell
from
the
vague
hints
in
their
letters
Hermione
and
ron
were
in
the
same
place
presumably
at
Rons
parents
house
he
could
hardly
bear
to
think
of
the
pair
of
them
having
fun
at
The
Burrow
when
he
was
stuck
in
Privet
Drive
in
fact
he
was
so
angry
with
them
he
had
thrown
away
unopened
the
two
boxes
of
Honeydukes
chocolates
theyd
sent
him
for
his
birthday
hed
regretted
it
later
after
the
wilted
salad
Aunt
Petunia
had
provided
for
dinner
that
night
and
what
were
Ron
and
Hermione
busy
with
why
wasnt
he
Harry
busy
hadnt
he
proved
himself
capable
of
handling
much
more
than
them
had
they
all
forgotten
what
he
had
done
hadnt
it
been
he
who
had
entered
that
graveyard
and
watched
Cedric
being
murdered
and
been
tied
to
that
tombstone
and
nearly
killed
dont
think
about
that
Harry
told
himself
sternly
for
the
hundredth
time
that
summer
it
was
bad
enough
that
he
kept
revisiting
the
graveyard
in
his
nightmares
without
dwelling
on
it
in
his
waking
moments
too
he
turned
a
corner
into
Magnolia
Crescent
halfway
along
he
passed
the
narrow
alleyway
down
the
side
of
a
garage
where
he
had
first
clapped
eyes
on
his
godfather
sirius
at
least
seemed
to
understand
how
Harry
was
feeling
admittedly
his
letters
were
just
as
empty
of
proper
news
as
ron
and
Hermiones
but
at
least
they
contained
words
of
caution
and
consolation
instead
of
tantalizing
hints
i
know
this
must
be
frustrating
for
you
keep
your
nose
clean
and
everything
will
be
okay
be
careful
and
dont
do
anything
rash
well
thought
Harry
as
he
crossed
Magnolia
Crescent
turned
into
Magnolia
Road
and
headed
towards
the
darkening
play
park
he
had
by
and
large
done
as
Sirius
advised
he
had
at
least
resisted
the
temptation
to
tie
his
trunk
to
his
broomstick
and
set
off
for
The
Burrow
by
himself
in
fact
Harry
thought
his
behavior
had
been
very
good
considering
how
frustrated
and
angry
he
felt
at
being
stuck
in
Privet
Drive
so
long
reduced
to
hiding
in
flowerbeds
in
the
hope
of
hearing
something
that
might
point
to
what
Lord
Voldemort
was
doing
nevertheless
it
was
quite
galling
to
be
told
not
to
be
rash
by
a
man
who
had
served
twelve
years
in
the
wizard
prison
Azkaban
escaped
attempted
to
commit
the
murder
he
had
been
convicted
for
in
the
first
place
then
gone
on
the
run
with
a
stolen
Hippogriff
harry
vaulted
over
the
locked
park
gate
and
set
off
across
the
parched
grass
the
park
was
as
empty
as
the
surrounding
streets
when
he
reached
the
swings
he
sank
on
to
the
only
one
that
dudley
and
his
friends
had
not
yet
managed
to
break
coiled
one
arm
around
the
chain
and
stared
moodily
at
the
ground
he
would
not
be
able
to
hide
in
the
Dursleys
flowerbed
again
tomorrow
he
would
have
to
think
of
some
fresh
way
of
listening
to
the
news
in
the
meantime
he
had
nothing
to
look
forward
to
but
another
restless
disturbed
night
because
even
when
he
escaped
the
nightmares
about
Cedric
he
had
unsettling
dreams
about
long
dark
corridors
all
finishing
in
dead
ends
and
locked
doors
which
he
supposed
had
something
to
do
with
the
trapped
feeling
he
had
when
he
was
awake
often
the
old
scar
on
his
forehead
prickled
uncomfortably
but
he
did
not
fool
himself
that
Ron
or
Hermione
or
Sirius
would
find
that
very
interesting
any
more
in
the
past
his
scar
hurting
had
warned
that
Voldemort
was
getting
stronger
again
but
now
that
Voldemort
was
back
they
would
probably
remind
him
that
its
regular
irritation
was
only
to
be
expected
nothing
to
worry
about
old
news
the
injustice
of
it
all
welled
up
inside
him
so
that
he
wanted
to
yell
with
fury
if
it
hadnt
been
for
him
nobody
would
even
have
known
Voldemort
was
back
and
his
reward
was
to
be
stuck
in
Little
Whinging
for
four
solid
weeks
completely
cut
off
from
the
magical
world
reduced
to
squatting
among
dying
begonias
so
that
he
could
hear
about
water-skiing
budgerigars
how
could
Dumbledore
have
forgotten
him
so
easily
why
had
Ron
and
Hermione
got
together
without
inviting
him
along
too
how
much
longer
was
he
supposed
to
endure
Sirius
telling
him
to
sit
tight
and
be
a
good
boy
or
resist
the
temptation
to
write
to
the
stupid
Daily
Prophet
and
point
out
that
Voldemort
had
returned
these
furious
thoughts
whirled
around
in
Harrys
head
and
his
insides
writhed
with
anger
as
a
sultry
velvety
night
fell
around
him
the
air
full
of
the
smell
of
warm
dry
grass
and
the
only
sound
that
of
the
low
grumble
of
traffic
on
the
road
beyond
the
park
railings
he
did
not
know
how
long
he
had
sat
on
the
swing
before
the
sound
of
voices
interrupted
his
musings
and
he
looked
up
the
streetlamps
from
the
surrounding
roads
were
casting
a
misty
glow
strong
enough
to
silhouette
a
group
of
people
making
their
way
across
the
park
one
of
them
was
singing
a
loud
crude
song
the
others
were
laughing
a
soft
ticking
noise
came
from
several
expensive
racing
bikes
that
they
were
wheeling
along
harry
knew
who
those
people
were
the
figure
in
front
was
unmistakeably
his
cousin
Dudley
dursley
wending
his
way
home
accompanied
by
his
faithful
gang
dudley
was
as
vast
as
ever
but
a
years
hard
dieting
and
the
discovery
of
a
new
talent
had
wrought
quite
a
change
in
his
physique
as
Uncle
Vernon
delightedly
told
anyone
who
would
listen
Dudley
had
recently
become
the
Junior
Heavyweight
Inter-School
Boxing
Champion
of
the
Southeast
the
noble
sport
as
Uncle
Vernon
called
it
had
made
Dudley
even
more
formidable
than
he
had
seemed
to
Harry
in
their
primary
school
days
when
he
had
served
as
dudleys
first
punching
bag
harry
was
not
remotely
afraid
of
his
cousin
any
more
but
he
still
didnt
think
that
Dudley
learning
to
punch
harder
and
more
accurately
was
cause
for
celebration
neighborhood
children
all
around
were
terrified
of
him
even
more
terrified
than
they
were
of
that
Potter
boy
who
they
had
been
warned
was
a
hardened
hooligan
and
attended
st.
Brutuss
secure
Center
for
Incurably
Criminal
Boys
harry
watched
the
dark
figures
crossing
the
grass
and
wondered
who
they
had
been
beating
up
tonight
look
round
Harry
found
himself
thinking
as
he
watched
them
come
on
look
round
im
sitting
here
all
alone
come
and
have
a
go
if
Dudleys
friends
saw
him
sitting
here
they
would
be
sure
to
make
a
beeline
for
him
and
what
would
Dudley
do
then
he
wouldnt
want
to
lose
face
in
front
of
the
gang
but
hed
be
terrified
of
provoking
Harry
it
would
be
really
fun
to
watch
Dudleys
dilemma
to
taunt
him
watch
him
with
him
powerless
to
respond
and
if
any
of
the
others
tried
hitting
Harry
he
was
ready
he
had
his
wand
let
them
try
hed
love
to
vent
some
of
his
frustration
on
the
boys
who
had
once
made
his
life
hell
but
they
didnt
turn
around
they
didnt
see
him
they
were
almost
at
the
railings
harry
mastered
the
impulse
to
call
after
them
seeking
a
fight
was
not
a
smart
move
he
must
not
use
magic
he
would
be
risking
expulsion
again
the
voices
of
Dudleys
gang
died
away
they
were
out
of
sight
heading
along
Magnolia
Road
there
you
go
Sirius
Harry
thought
dully
nothing
rash
kept
my
nose
clean
exactly
the
opposite
of
what
youd
have
done
he
got
to
his
feet
and
stretched
aunt
Petunia
and
Uncle
Vernon
seemed
to
feel
that
whenever
dudley
turned
up
was
the
right
time
to
be
home
and
any
time
after
that
was
much
too
late
uncle
Vernon
had
threatened
to
lock
Harry
in
the
shed
if
he
came
home
after
Dudley
ever
again
so
stifling
a
yawn
and
still
scowling
Harry
set
off
towards
the
park
gate
magnolia
Road
like
Privet
Drive
was
full
of
large
square
houses
with
perfectly
manicured
lawns
all
owned
by
large
square
owners
who
drove
very
clean
cars
similar
to
Uncle
Vernons
harry
preferred
Little
Whinging
by
night
when
the
curtained
windows
made
patches
of
jewel
bright
color
in
the
darkness
and
he
ran
no
danger
of
hearing
disapproving
mutters
about
his
delinquent
appearance
when
he
passed
the
householders
he
walked
quickly
so
that
halfway
along
Magnolia
Road
Dudleys
gang
came
into
view
again
they
were
saying
their
farewells
at
the
entrance
to
Magnolia
Crescent
harry
stepped
into
the
shadow
of
a
large
lilac
tree
and
waited
squealed
like
a
pig
didnt
he
malcolm
was
saying
to
guffaws
from
the
others
nice
right
hook
Big
D
said
Piers
same
time
tomorrow
said
Dudley
round
at
my
place
my
parents
will
be
out
said
Gordon
see
you
then
said
Dudley
bye
Dud
see
ya
Big
D
harry
waited
for
the
rest
of
the
gang
to
move
on
before
setting
off
again
when
their
voices
had
faded
once
more
he
headed
around
the
corner
into
Magnolia
Crescent
and
by
walking
very
quickly
he
soon
came
within
hailing
distance
of
Dudley
who
was
strolling
along
at
his
ease
humming
tunelessly
hey
Big
D
dudley
turned
oh
he
grunted
its
you
how
long
have
you
been
Big
D
then
said
Harry
shut
it
snarled
Dudley
turning
away
cool
name
said
Harry
grinning
and
falling
into
step
beside
his
cousin
but
youll
always
be
ickle
Diddykins
to
me
i
said
shut
it
said
Dudley
whose
ham-like
hands
had
curled
into
fists
dont
the
boys
know
thats
what
your
mum
calls
you
shut
your
face
you
dont
tell
her
to
shut
her
face
what
about
Popkin
and
Dinky
Diddydums
can
I
use
them
then
dudley
said
nothing
the
effort
of
keeping
himself
from
hitting
Harry
seemed
to
demand
all
his
self-control
so
whove
you
been
beating
up
tonight
harry
asked
his
grin
fading
another
ten-year-old
know
you
did
Mark
Evans
two
nights
ago
he
was
asking
for
it
snarled
Dudley
oh
yeah
he
cheeked
me
yeah
did
he
say
you
look
like
a
pig
thats
been
taught
to
walk
on
its
hind
legs
cause
thats
not
cheek
Dud
thats
true
a
muscle
was
twitching
in
Dudleys
jaw
it
gave
Harry
enormous
satisfaction
to
know
how
furious
he
was
making
Dudley
he
felt
as
though
he
was
siphoning
off
his
own
frustration
into
his
cousin
the
only
outlet
he
had
they
turned
right
down
the
narrow
alleyway
where
Harry
had
first
seen
Sirius
and
which
formed
a
short
cut
between
Magnolia
Crescent
and
Wisteria
Walk
it
was
empty
and
much
darker
than
the
streets
it
linked
because
there
were
no
streetlamps
their
footsteps
were
muffled
between
garage
walls
on
one
side
and
a
high
fence
on
the
other
think
youre
a
big
man
carrying
that
thing
dont
you
dudley
said
after
a
few
seconds
what
thing
that
that
thing
you
are
hiding
harry
grinned
again
not
as
stupid
as
you
look
are
you
Dud
but
I
spose
if
you
were
you
wouldnt
be
able
to
walk
and
talk
at
the
same
time
harry
pulled
out
his
wand
he
saw
Dudley
look
sideways
at
it
youre
not
allowed
Dudley
said
at
once
i
know
youre
not
youd
get
expelled
from
that
freak
school
you
go
to
how
dyou
know
they
havent
changed
the
rules
Big
D

said
Dudley
though
he
didnt
sound
completely
convinced
harry
laughed
softly
you
havent
got
the
guts
to
take
me
on
without
that
thing
have
you
dudley
snarled
whereas
you
just
need
four
mates
behind
you
before
you
can
beat
up
a
ten
year
old
you
know
that
boxing
title
you
keep
banging
on
about
how
old
was
your
opponent
seven
eight
he
was
sixteen
for
your
information
snarled
Dudley
and
he
was
out
cold
for
twenty
minutes
after
Id
finished
with
him
and
he
was
twice
as
heavy
as
you
you
just
wait
till

tell
Dad

all
dark

dudley
snarled
he
had
stopped
walking
harry
stopped
too
staring
at
his
cousin
from
the
little
he
could
see
of
Dudleys
large
face
he
was
wearing
a
strangely
triumphant
look
what
dyou
mean
Im
not
brave
when
Im
in

Harry
completely
nonplussed
what

I
supposed

pillows
or
something
i
heard

last
night
said
Dudley
breathlessly
talking
in
your
sleep
moaning
what
dyou
mean
harry
said
again
but
there
was
a
cold
plunging
sensation
in
his
stomach
he
had
revisited
the
graveyard
last
night
in
his
dreams
dudley
gave
a
harsh
bark
of
laughter
then
adopted
a
high-pitched
whimpering
voice
dont
kill
Cedric
dont
kill
Cedric
whos
Cedric

boyfriend

youre
lying
said
Harry
automatically
but
his
mouth
had
gone
dry
he
knew
Dudley
wasnt
lying
how
else
would
he
know
about
Cedric
dad
help

Dad

point
that
thing
at
me
dudley
backed
into
the
alley
wall
harry
was
pointing
the
wand
directly
at
Dudleys
heart
harry
could
feel
fourteen
years
hatred
of
Dudley
pounding
in
his
veins
what
wouldnt
he
give
to
strike
now
to
jinx
Dudley
so
thoroughly
hed
have
to
crawl
home
like
an
insect
struck
dumb
sprouting
feelers
dont
ever
talk
about
that
again
Harry
snarled
dyou

thing

i
said
do

understand
me
point
it
somewhere
else
do
you
understand
me
get
that
thing
away
from
dudley
gave
an
odd
shuddering
gasp
as
though
he
had
been
doused
in
icy
water
something
had
happened
to
the
night
the
star-strewn
indigo
sky
was
suddenly
pitch
black
and
lightless
the
stars
the
moon
the
misty
streetlamps
at
either
end
of
the
alley
had
vanished
the
distant
rumble
of
cars
and
the
whisper
of
trees
had
gone
the
balmy
evening
was
suddenly
piercingly
bitingly
cold
they
were
surrounded
by
total
impenetrable
silent
darkness
as
though
some
giant
hand
had
dropped
a
thick
icy
mantle
over
the
entire
alleyway
blinding
them
for
a
split
second
Harry
thought
he
had
done
magic
without
meaning
to
despite
the
fact
that
hed
been
resisting
as
hard
as
he
could
then
his
reason
caught
up
with
his
senses
he
didnt
have
the
power
to
turn
off
the
stars
he
turned
his
head
this
way
and
that
trying
to
see
something
but
the
darkness
pressed
on
his
eyes
like
a
weightless
veil
dudleys
terrified
voice
broke
in
Harrys
ear
w-what
are
you
d-doing
st-stop

not
doing
anything
shut
up
and
dont
move
i

blind
i
i
said
shut
up
harry
stood
stock
still
turning
his
sightless
eyes
left
and
right
the
cold
was
so
intense
he
was
shivering
all
over
goose
bumps
had
erupted
up
his
arms
and
the
hairs
on
the
back
of
his
neck
were
standing
up
he
opened
his
eyes
to
their
fullest
extent
staring
blankly
around
unseeing
it
was
impossible
they
couldnt
be
here
not
in
Little
Whinging
he
strained
his
ears
he
would
hear
them
before
he
saw
them
ill

dudley
whimpered
w-where

you
what

shut
up
harry
hissed
Im
trying
to
lis
but
he
fell
silent
he
had
heard
just
the
thing
he
had
been
dreading
there
was
something
in
the
alleyway
apart
from
themselves
something
that
was
drawing
long
hoarse
rattling
breaths
harry
felt
a
horrible
jolt
of
dread
as
he
stood
trembling
in
the
freezing
air
c-cut
it
out
stop
doing
it
ill
h-hit
you
I
swear
I
will
dudley
shut
wham
a
fist
made
contact
with
the
side
of
Harrys
head
lifting
him
off
his
feet
small
white
lights
popped
in
front
of
his
eyes
for
the
second
time
in
an
hour
Harry
felt
as
though
his
head
had
been
cleaved
in
two
next
moment
he
had
landed
hard
on
the
ground
and
his
wand
had
flown
out
of
his
hand
you
moron
Dudley
harry
yelled
his
eyes
watering
with
pain
as
he
scrambled
to
his
hands
and
knees
feeling
around
frantically
in
the
blackness
he
heard
Dudley
blundering
away
hitting
the
alley
fence
stumbling
dudley
come
back
youre
running
right
at
it
there
was
a
horrible
squealing
yell
and
Dudleys
footsteps
stopped
at
the
same
moment
Harry
felt
a
creeping
chill
behind
him
that
could
mean
only
one
thing
there
was
more
than
one
dudley
keep
your
mouth
shut
whatever
you
do
keep
your
mouth
shut
wand
harry
muttered
frantically
his
hands
flying
over
the
ground
like
spiders
wheres
wand
come
on
lumos
he
said
the
spell
automatically
desperate
for
light
to
help
him
in
his
search
and
to
his
disbelieving
relief
light
flared
inches
from
his
right
hand
the
wand
tip
had
ignited
harry
snatched
it
up
scrambled
to
his
feet
and
turned
around
his
stomach
turned
over
a
towering
hooded
figure
was
gliding
smoothly
towards
him
hovering
over
the
ground
no
feet
or
face
visible
beneath
its
robes
sucking
on
the
night
as
it
came
stumbling
backwards
Harry
raised
his
wand
expecto
patronum
a
silvery
wisp
of
vapour
shot
from
the
tip
of
the
wand
and
the
Dementor
slowed
but
the
spell
hadnt
worked
properly
tripping
over
his
own
feet
Harry
retreated
further
as
the
Dementor
bore
down
upon
him
panic
fogging
his
brain
concentrate
a
pair
of
grey
slimy
scabbed
hands
slid
from
inside
the
Dementors
robes
reaching
for
him
rushing
noise
filled
Harrys
ears
expecto
patronum
his
voice
sounded
dim
and
distant
another
wisp
of
silver
smoke
feebler
than
the
last
drifted
from
the
wand
he
couldnt
do
it
any
more
he
couldnt
work
the
spell
there
was
laughter
inside
his
own
head
shrill
high-pitched
laughter
he
could
smell
the
dementors
putrid
death-cold
breath
filling
his
own
lungs
drowning
him
think
something
happy
but
there
was
no
happiness
in
him
the
Dementors
icy
fingers
were
closing
on
his
throat
the
high-pitched
laughter
was
growing
louder
and
louder
and
a
voice
spoke
inside
his
head
Bow
to
death
Harry
it
might
even
be
painless
i
would
no
t
know
i
have
never
died
he
was
never
going
to
see
Ron
and
Hermione
again
and
their
faces
burst
clearly
into
his
mind
as
he
fought
for
breath
expecto
patronum
an
enormous
silver
stag
erupted
from
the
tip
of
Harrys
wand
its
antlers
caught
the
Dementor
in
the
place
where
the
heart
should
have
been
it
was
thrown
backwards
weightless
as
darkness
and
as
the
stag
charged
the
Dementor
swooped
away
bat-like
and
defeated
this
way
harry
shouted
at
the
stag
wheeling
around
he
sprinted
down
the
alleyway
holding
the
lit
wand
aloft
dudley
dudley
he
had
run
barely
a
dozen
steps
when
he
reached
them
Dudley
was
curled
up
on
the
ground
his
arms
clamped
over
his
face
a
second
Dementor
was
crouching
low
over
him
gripping
his
wrists
in
its
slimy
hands
prizing
them
slowly
almost
lovingly
apart
lowering
its
hooded
head
towards
Dudleys
face
as
though
about
to
kiss
him
get
it
harry
bellowed
and
with
a
rushing
roaring
sound
the
silver
stag
he
had
conjured
came
galloping
past
him
the
Dementors
eyeless
face
was
barely
an
inch
from
Dudleys
when
the
silver
antlers
caught
it
the
thing
was
thrown
up
into
the
air
and
like
its
fellow
it
soared
away
and
was
absorbed
into
the
darkness
the
stag
cantered
to
the
end
of
the
alleyway
and
dissolved
into
silver
mist
moon
stars
and
streetlamps
burst
back
into
life
a
warm
breeze
swept
the
alleyway
trees
rustled
in
neighboring
gardens
and
the
mundane
rumble
of
cars
in
Magnolia
Crescent
filled
the
air
again
harry
stood
quite
still
all
his
senses
vibrating
taking
in
the
abrupt
return
to
normality
after
a
moment
he
became
aware
that
his
t-shirt
was
sticking
to
him
he
was
drenched
in
sweat
he
could
not
believe
what
had
just
happened
dementors
here
in
Little
Whinging
dudley
lay
curled
up
on
the
ground
whimpering
and
shaking
harry
bent
down
to
see
whether
he
was
in
a
fit
state
to
stand
up
but
then
he
heard
loud
running
footsteps
behind
him
instinctively
raising
his
wand
again
he
span
on
his
heel
to
face
the
newcomer
mrs
figg
their
batty
old
neighbor
came
panting
into
sight
her
grizzled
grey
hair
was
escaping
from
its
hairnet
a
clanking
string
shopping
bag
was
swinging
from
her
wrist
and
her
feet
were
halfway
out
of
her
tartan
carpet
slippers
harry
made
to
stow
his
wand
hurriedly
out
of
sight
but
dont
put
it
away
idiot
boy
she
shrieked
what
if
there
are
more
of
them
around
oh
Im
going
to
kill
Mundungus
Fletcher
chapter
two
a
Peck
of
Owls
he
left
said
Mrs
figg
wringing
her
hands
left
to
see
someone
about
a
batch
of
cauldrons
that
fell
off
the
back
of
a
broom
i
told
him
Id
flay
him
alive
if
he
went
and
now
look
dementors
its
just
lucky
I
put
mr.
Tibbies
on
the
case
but
we
havent
got
time
to
stand
around
hurry
now
weve
got
to
get
you
back
oh
the
trouble
this
is
going
to
cause
i
will
kill
him
but
The
revelation
that
his
batty
old
cat-obsessed
neighbor
knew
what
Dementors
were
was
almost
as
big
a
shock
to
Harry
as
meeting
two
of
them
down
the
alleyway
youre
youre
a
witch
im
a
Squib
as
Mundungus
knows
full
well
so
how
on
earth
was
I
supposed
to
help
you
fight
off
Dementors
he
left
you
completely
without
cover
when
Id
warned
him
this
Mundungus
has
been
following
me
hang
on
it
was
him
he
Disapparated
from
the
front
of
my
house
yes
yes
yes
but
luckily
Id
stationed
mr.
Tibbies
under
a
car
just
in
case
and
mr.
Tibbies
came
and
warned
me
but
by
the
time
I
got
to
your
house
youd
gone
and
now
oh
whats
dumbledore
going
to
say
you
she
shrieked
at
Dudley
still
supine
on
the
alley
floor
get
your
fat
bottom
off
the
ground
quick
you
know
Dumbledore
said
Harry
staring
at
her
of
course
I
know
Dumbledore
who
doesnt
know
Dumbledore
but
come
on
Ill
be
no
help
if
they
come
back
Ive
never
so
much
as
transfigured
a
teabag
she
stooped
down
seized
one
of
Dudleys
massive
arms
in
her
wizened
hands
and
tugged
get
up
you
useless
lump
get
up
but
Dudley
either
could
not
or
would
not
move
he
remained
on
the
ground
trembling
and
ashen-faced
his
mouth
shut
very
tight
ill
do
it
harry
took
hold
of
Dudleys
arm
and
h
heaved
with
an
enormous
effort
he
managed
to
hoist
him
to
his
feet
dudley
seemed
to
be
on
the
point
of
fainting
his
small
eyes
were
rolling
in
their
sockets
and
sweat
was
beading
his
face
the
moment
Harry
let
go
of
him
he
swayed
dangerously
hurry
up
said
Mrs
figg
hysterically
harry
pulled
one
of
Dudleys
massive
arms
around
his
own
shoulders
and
dragged
him
towards
the
road
sagging
slightly
under
the
weight
mrs
figg
tottered
along
in
front
of
them
peering
anxiously
around
the
corner
keep
your
wand
out
she
told
Harry
as
they
entered
Wisteria
Walk
never
mind
the
Statute
of
Secrecy
now
theres
going
to
be
hell
to
pay
anyway
we
might
as
well
be
hanged
for
a
dragon
as
an
egg
talk
about
the
Reasonable
Restriction
of
Underage
Sorcery
this
was
exactly
what
dumbledore
was
afraid
of
Whats
that
at
the
end
of
the
street
oh
its
just
mr.
Prentice
dont
put
your
wand
away
boy
dont
I
keep
telling
you
Im
no
use
it
was
not
easy
to
hold
a
wand
steady
and
haul
Dudley
along
at
the
same
time
harry
gave
his
cousin
an
impatient
dig
in
the
ribs
but
Dudley
seemed
to
have
lost
all
desire
for
independent
movement
he
was
slumped
on
Harrys
shoulder
his
large
feet
dragging
along
the
ground
why
didnt
you
tell
me
youre
a
Squib
Mrs
figg
asked
Harry
panting
with
the
effort
to
keep
walking
all
those
times
I
came
round
your
house
why
didnt
you
say
anything
dumbledores
orders
i
was
to
keep
an
eye
on
you
but
not
say
anything
you
were
too
young
im
sorry
I
gave
you
such
a
miserable
time
Harry
but
the
Dursleys
would
never
have
let
you
come
if
theyd
thought
you
enjoyed
it
it
wasnt
easy
you
know
but
oh
my
word
she
said
tragically
wringing
her
hands
once
more
when
Dumbledore
hears
about
this
how
could
mundungus
have
left
he
was
supposed
to
be
on
duty
until
midnight
where
is
he
how
am
I
going
to
tell
Dumbledore
whats
happened
i
cant
Apparate
ive
got
an
owl
you
can
borrow
her
harry
groaned
wondering
whether
his
spine
was
going
to
snap
under
Dudleys
weight
harry
you
dont
understand
dumbledore
will
need
to
act
as
quickly
as
possible
the
Ministry
have
their
own
ways
of
detecting
underage
magic
theyll
know
already
you
mark
my
words
but
I
was
getting
rid
of
Dementors
I
had
to
use
magic
theyre
going
to
be
more
worried
about
what
Dementors
were
doing
floating
around
Wisteria
Walk
surely
oh
my
dear
I
wish
it
were
so
but
Im
afraid
mundungus
fletcher
I
am
going
to
kill
you
there
was
a
loud
crack
and
a
strong
smell
of
drink
mingled
with
stale
tobacco
filled
the
air
as
a
squat
unshaven
man
in
a
tattered
overcoat
materialized
right
in
front
of
them
he
had
short
bandy
legs
long
straggly
ginger
hair
and
bloodshot
baggy
eyes
that
gave
him
the
doleful
look
of
a
basset
hound
he
was
also
clutching
a
silvery
bundle
that
Harry
recognized
at
once
as
an
invisibility
Cloak
sup
Figgy
he
said
staring
from
Mrs
figg
to
Harry
and
Dudley
what
appened
to
staying
undercover
ill
give
you
undercover
cried
Mrs
figg
dementors

skiving
sneak
thief

repeated
Mundungus
aghast
dementors
ere

shrieked
Mrs
figg
dementors
attacking
the
boy
on
your
watch
blimey
said
Mundungus
weakly
looking
from
Mrs
figg
to
Harry
and
back
again
blimey
I
and
you
off
buying
stolen
cauldrons
didnt
I
tell
you

I
i
well
I
Mundungus
looked
deeply
uncomfortable
it
it
was
a
very
good
business
opportunity
see
mrs
figg
raised
the
arm
from
which
her
string
bag
dangled
and
whacked
Mundungus
around
the
face
and
neck
with
it
judging
by
the
clanking
noise
it
made
it
was
full
of
cat
food
ouch
gerroff
gerroff
you
mad
old
bat
someones
gotta
tell
Dumbledore
yes
they
have
yelled
Mrs
figg
swinging
the
bag
of
cat
food
at
every
bit
of
Mundungus
she
could
reach
and
it
had
better
be
you
and
you
can
tell
him
why

werent
there
to
help
keep
your
airnet
on
said
Mundungus
his
arms
over
his
head
cowering
im
going
Im
going
and
with
another
loud
crack
he
vanished
i
hope
Dumbledore
murders
him
said
Mrs
figg
furiously
now
come
on
Harry
what
are
you
waiting
for
harry
decided
not
to
waste
his
remaining
breath
on
pointing
out
that
he
could
barely
walk
under
dudleys
bulk
he
gave
the
semi-conscious
Dudley
a
heave
and
staggered
onwards
ill
take
you
to
the
door
said
Mrs
figg
as
they
turned
into
Privet
Drive
just
in
case
there
are
more
of
them
around
oh
my
word
what
a
catastrophe
and
you
had
to
fight
them
off
yourself
and
Dumbledore
said
we
were
to
keep
you
from
doing
magic
at
all
costs
well
its
no

crying
over

Harry

said
Mrs

staring
around
the
dark
street

in
the
house

harry
shouted
after
her
he
had
a
million
questions
to
ask
anyone
who
was
in
contact
with
Dumbledore
but
within
seconds
Mrs
figg
was
swallowed
by
the
darkness
scowling
harry
readjusted
Dudley
on
his
shoulder
and
made
his
slow
painful
way
up
number
fours
garden
path
the
hall
light
was
on
harry
stuck
his
wand
back
inside
the
waistband
of
his
jeans
rang
the
bell
and
watched
Aunt
Petunias
outline
grow
larger
and
larger
oddly
distorted
by
the
rippling
glass
in
the
front
door
diddy

sideways
at
Dudley
and
ducked
out
from
under
his
arm
just
in
time
dudley
swayed
on
the
spot
for
a
moment
his
face
pale
green
then
he
opened
his
mouth
and
vomited
all
over
the
doormat

hither
and
thither
as

did
when
he
was
agitated
he
hurried
forwards
to
help
Aunt

a
weak-kneed
Dudley
over

to
have
noticed
Harry
which
suited
him
perfectly
he
managed
to
slip
inside
just
before
Uncle
Vernon
slammed
the
door
and
while
the
Dursleys
made
their
noisy
progress
down
the
hall
towards
the
kitchen
Harry
moved
carefully
and
quietly
towards
the
stairs
who

found
his
voice
him
harry
froze
foot
on
the
stair
face
screwed
up
braced
for
the
explosion
boy
come
here
with
a
feeling
of
mingled
dread
and
anger
Harry
removed
his
foot
slowly
from
the
stair
and
turned
to
follow
the
Dursleys
the
scrupulously
clean
kitchen
had
an
oddly
unreal
glitter
after
the
darkness
outside
aunt
petunia
was
ushering
Dudley
into
a
chair
he
was
still
very
green
and
clammy-looking
uncle
vernon
standing
in
front
of
the
draining
board
glaring
at
Harry
through
tiny
narrowed
eyes
what
have
you
done
to
my
son
he
said
in
a
menacing
growl
nothing
said
Harry
knowing
perfectly
well
that
Uncle
Vernon
wouldnt
believe
him
what
did
he
do
to
you
Diddy
aunt
Petunia
said
in
a
quavering
voice
now
sponging
sick
from
the
front
of
Dudleys
leather
jacket
was
it
was
it
you-know-what
darling
did
he
use
his
thing
slowly
tremulously
Dudley
nodded
i
didnt
harry
said
sharply
as
Aunt
Petunia
let
out
a
wail
and
Uncle
Vernon
raised
his
fists
i
didnt
do
anything
to
him
it
wasnt
me
it
was
but
at
that
precise
moment
a
screech
owl
swooped
in
through
the
kitchen
window
narrowly
missing
the
top
of
Uncle
Vernons
head
it
soared
across
the
kitchen
dropped
the
large
parchment
envelope
it
was
carrying
in
its
beak
at
Harrys
feet
turned
gracefully
the
tips
of
its
wings
just
brushing
the
top
of
the
fridge
then
zoomed
outside
again
and
off
across
the
garden
owls
bellowed
Uncle
Vernon
the
well-worn
vein
in
his
temple
pulsing
angrily
as
he
slammed
the
kitchen
window
shut
owls
again
i
will
not
have
any
more
owls
in
my
house
but
Harry
was
already
ripping
open
the
envelope
and
pulling
out
the
letter
inside
his
heart
pounding
somewhere
in
the
region
of
his
Adams

at
your
place
of
residence
shortly
to
destroy
your
wand
there
was
only
one
thing
for
it
he
would
have
to
run
now
where
he
was
going
to
go
Harry
didnt
know
but
he
was
certain
of
one
thing
at
Hogwarts
or
outside
it
he
needed
his
wand
in
an
almost
dream
like
state
he
pulled
his
wand
out
and
turned
to
leave
the
kitchen
where
dyou
think
youre
going
yelled
Uncle
Vernon
when
Harry
didnt
reply
he
pounded
across
the
kitchen
to
block
the
doorway
into
the
hall
i
havent
finished
with
you
boy
get
out
of
the
way
said
Harry
quietly
youre
going
to
stay
here
and
explain
how
my
son
if
you
dont
get
out
of
the
way
Im
going
to
jinx
you
said
Harry
raising
the
wand
you
cant
pull
that
one
on
me
snarled
Uncle
Vernon
i
know
youre
not
allowed
to
use
it
outside
that
madhouse
you
call
a
school
the
madhouse
has
chucked
me
out
said
Harry
so
I
can
do
whatever
I
like
youve
got
three
seconds
one
two
a
resounding
crack
filled
the
kitchen
aunt
Petunia
screamed
Hide
uncle
Vernon
yelled
and
ducked
but
for
the
third
time
that
night
Harry
was
searching
for
the
source
of
a
disturbance
he
had
not
made
he
spotted
it
at
once
a
dazed
and
ruffled-looking
barn
owl
was
sitting
outside
on
the
kitchen
sill
having
just
collided
with
the
closed
window
ignoring
Uncle
Vernons
anguished
yell
of
owls
harry
crossed
the
room
at
a
run
and
wrenched
the
window
open
the
owl
stuck
out
its
leg
to
which
a
small
roll
of
parchment
was
tied
shook
its
leathers
and
took
off
the
moment
Harry
had
taken
the
letter
hands
shaking
harry
unfurled
the
second
message
which
was
written
very
hastily
and
blotchily
in
black
ink
harry
dumbledores
just
arrived
at
the
Ministry
and
hes
trying
to
sort
it
all
out
do
not
leave
your
aunt
and
uncles
house
do
not
do
any
more
magic
do
not
surrender
your
wand
arthur
Weasley
dumbledore
was
trying
to
sort
it
all
out
what
did
that
mean
how
much
power
did
dumbledore
have
to
override
the
Ministry
of
Magic
was
there
a
chance
that
he
might
be
allowed
back
to
Hogwarts
then
a
small
shoot
of
hope
burgeoned
in
Harrys
chest
almost
immediately
strangled
by
panic
how
was
he
supposed
to
refuse
to
surrender
his
wand
without
doing
magic
hed
have
to
duel
with
the
Ministry
representatives
and
if
he
did
that
hed
be
lucky
to
escape
Azkaban
let
alone
expulsion
his
mind
was
racing
he
could
run
for
it
and
risk
being
captured
by
the
Ministry
or
stay
put
and
wait
for
them
to
find
him
here
he
was
much
more
tempted
by
the
former
course
but
he
knew
mr.
Weasley
had
his
best
interests
at
heart
and
after
all
Dumbledore
had
sorted
out
much
worse
than
this
before
right
Harry
said
Ive
changed
my
mind
Im
staying
he
flung
himself
down
at
the
kitchen
table
and
faced
Dudley
and
Aunt
Petunia
the
Dursleys
appeared
taken
aback
at
his
abrupt
change
of
mind
aunt
Petunia
glanced
despairingly
at
Uncle
Vernon
the
vein
in
his
purple
temple
was
throbbing
worse
than
ever
who
are
all
these
ruddy
owls
from
he
growled
the
first
one
was
from
the
Ministry
of
Magic
expelling
me
said
Harry
calmly
he
was
straining
his
ears
to
catch
any
noises
outside
in
case
the
Ministry
representatives
were
approaching
and
it
was
easier
and
quieter
to
answer
Uncle
Vernons
questions
than
to
have
him
start
raging
and
bellowing
the
second
one
was
from
my
friend
Rons
dad
who
works
at
the
ministry
ministry
of
Magic
bellowed
Uncle
Vernon
people
like
you
in
government
oh
this
explains
everything
everything
no
wonder
the
countrys
going
to
the
dogs
when
Harry
did
not
respond
Uncle
Vernon
glared
at
him
then
spat
out
And
why
have
you
been
expelled
because
I
did
magic
aha
roared
Uncle
Vernon
slamming
his
fist
down
on
top
of
the
fridge
which
sprang
open
several
of
Dudleys
low-fat
snacks
toppled
out
and
burst
on
the
floor
so
you
admit
it
what
did
you
do
to
Dudley
nothing
said
Harry
slightly
less
calmly
that
wasnt
me
was
muttered
Dudley
unexpectedly
and
Uncle
Vernon
and
Aunt
Petunia
instantly
made
flapping
gestures
at
Harry
to
quieten
him
while
they
both
bent
low
over
Dudley
go
on
son
said
Uncle
Vernon
what
did
he
do
tell
us
darling
whispered
Aunt
Petunia
pointed
his
wand
at
me
Dudley
mumbled
yeah
I
did
but
I
didnt
use
Harry
began
angrily
but
shut
up
roared
Uncle
Vernon
and
Aunt
Petunia
in
unison
go
on
son
repeated
Uncle
Vernon
moustache
blowing
about
furiously
all
went
dark
Dudley
said
hoarsely
shuddering
everything
dark
and
then
I
h-heard
things
inside
m-my
head
uncle
Vernon
and
Aunt
Petunia
exchanged
looks
of
utter
horror
if
their
least
favorite
thing
in
the
world
was
magic
closely
followed
by
neighbors
who
cheated
more
than
they
did
on
the
hosepipe
ban
people
who
heard
voices
were
definitely
in
the
bottom
ten
they
obviously
thought
Dudley
was
losing
his
mind
what
sort
of
things
did
you
hear
Popkin
breathed
Aunt
Petunia
very
white-faced
and
with
tears
in
her
eyes
but
Dudley
seemed
incapable
of
saying
he
shuddered
again
and
shook
his
large
blond
head
and
despite
the
sense
of
numb
dread
that
had
settled
on
Harry
since
the
arrival
of
the
first
owl
he
felt
a
certain
curiosity
dementors
caused
a
person
to
relive
the
worst
moments
of
their
life
what
would
spoiled
pampered
bullying
Dudley
have
been
forced
to
hear
how
come
you
fell
over
son
said
Uncle
Vernon
in
an
unnaturally
quiet
voice
the
kind
of
voice
he
might
adopt
at
the
bedside
of
a
very
ill
person
t-tripped
said
Dudley
shakily
and
then
he
gestured
at
his
massive
chest
harry
understood
dudley
was
remembering
the
clammy
cold
that
filled
the
lungs
as
hope
and
happiness
were
sucked
out
of
you
horrible
croaked
Dudley
cold
really
cold
okay
said
Uncle
Vernon
in
a
voice
of
forced
calm
while
Aunt
Petunia
laid
an
anxious
hand
on
Dudleys
forehead
to
feel
his
temperature
what
happened
then
Dudders
felt
felt
felt
as
if
as
if
as
if
youd
never
be
happy
again
Harry
supplied
dully
yes
Dudley
whispered
still
trembling
so
said
Uncle
Vernon
voice
restored
to
full
and
considerable
volume
as
he
straightened
up
you
put
some
crackpot
spell
on
my
son
so
hed
hear
voices
and
believe
he
was
was
doomed
to
misery
or
something
did
you
how
many
times
do
I
have
to
tell
you
said
Harry
temper
and
voice
both
rising
it
wasnt
me
it
was
a
couple
of
Dementors
a
couple
of
whats
this
codswallop
de
men
tors
said
Harry
slowly
and
clearly
two
of
them
and
what
the
ruddy
hell
are
Dementors
they
guard
the
wizard
prison
Azkaban
said
Aunt
Petunia
two
seconds
of
ringing
silence
followed
these
words
before
Aunt
Petunia
clapped
her
hand
over
her
mouth
as
though
she
had
let
slip
a
disgusting
swear
word
uncle
Vernon
was
goggling
at
her
harrys
brain
reeled
mrs
figg
was
one
thing
but
Aunt
Petunia
how
dyou
know
that
he
asked
her
astonished
aunt
Petunia
looked
quite
appalled
with
herself
she
glanced
at
Uncle
Vernon
in
fearful
apology
then
lowered
her
hand
slightly
to
reveal
her
horsy
teeth
i
heard
that
awful
boy
telling
her
about
them
years
ago
she
said
jerkily
if
you
mean
my
mum
and
dad
why
dont
you
use
their
names
said
Harry
loudly
but
Aunt
petunia
ignored
him
she
seemed
horribly
flustered
harry
was
stunned
except
for
one
outburst
years
ago
in
the
course
of
which
Aunt
Petunia
had
screamed
that
Harrys
mother
had
been
a
freak
he
had
never
heard
her
mention
her
sister
he
was
astounded
that
she
had
remembered
this
scrap
of
information
about
the
magical
world
for
so
long
when
she
usually
put
all
her
energies
into
pretending
it
didnt
exist
uncle
Vernon
opened
his
mouth
closed
it
again
opened
it
once
more
shut
it
then
apparently
struggling
to
remember
how
to
talk
opened
it
for
a
third
time
and
croaked
So
so
they
er
they
er
they
actually
exist
do
they
er
dementy-whatsits
aunt
Petunia
nodded
uncle
Vernon
looked
from
Aunt
Petunia
to
Dudley
to
Harry
as
if
hoping
somebody
was
going
to
shout
April
Fool
when
nobody
did
he
opened
his
mouth
yet
again
but
was
spared
the
struggle
to
find
more
words
by
the
arrival
of
the
third
owl
of
the
evening
it
zoomed
through
the
still-open
window
like
a
feathery
cannon-ball
and
landed
with
a
clatter
on
the
kitchen
table
causing
all
three
of
the
Dursleys
to
jump
with
fright
harry
tore
a
second
official-looking
envelope
from
the
owls
beak
and
ripped
it
open
as
the
owl
swooped
back
out
into
the
night
enough
effing
owls
muttered
Uncle
Vernon
distractedly
stomping
over
to
the
window
and
slamming
it
shut
again
dear
mr.
Potter
further
to
our
letter
of
approximately
twenty-two
minutes
ago
the
Ministry
of
Magic
has
revised
its
decision

your
wand

on
the

of

and
Wizardry
the
ministry
has
agreed
that
the
question
of
your

harry
read
this
letter
through
three
times
in
quick
succession
the
miserable
knot
in
his
chest
loosened
slightly
with
the
relief
of
Knowing
he
was
not
yet
definitely
expelled
though
his
fears
were
by
no
means
banished
everything
seemed
to
hang
on
this
hearing
on
the
twelfth
of
August
well
said
Uncle
Vernon
recalling
Harry
to
his
surroundings
what
now
have
they
sentenced
you
to
anything
do
your
lot
have
the
death
penalty
he
added
as
a
hopeful
afterthought
ive
got
to
go
to
a
hearing
said
Harry
and
theyll
sentence
you
there
i
suppose
so
i
wont
give
up
hope
then
said
Uncle
Vernon
nastily
well
if
thats
all
said
Harry
getting
to
his
feet
he
was
desperate
to
be
alone
to
think
perhaps
to
send
a
letter
to
Ron
Hermione
or
Sirius
no
it
ruddy
well
is
not
all
bellowed
Uncle
Vernon
sit
back
down
what
now
said
Harry
impatiently
dudley
roared
Uncle
Vernon
i
want
to
know
exactly
what
happened
to
my
son
fine
yelled
Harry
and
in
his
temper
red
and
gold
sparks
shot
out
of
the
end
of
his
wand
still
clutched
in
his
hand
all
three
Dursleys
flinched
looking
terrified
dudley
and
I
were
in
the
alleyway
between
Magnolia
Crescent
and
Wisteria
Walk
said
Harry
speaking
fast
fighting
to
control
his
temper
dudley
thought
hed
be
smart
with
me
I
pulled
out
my
wand
but
didnt
use
it
then
two
Dementors
turned
up
but
what
are
Dementoids
asked
Uncle
Vernon
furiously
what
do
they
do
i
told
you
they
suck
all
the
happiness
out
of
you
said
Harry
and
if
they
get
the
chance
they
kiss
you
kiss
you
said
Uncle
Vernon
his
eyes
popping
slightly
kiss
you
its
what
they
call
it
when
they
suck
the
soul
out
of
your
mouth
aunt
Petunia
uttered
a
soft
scream
his
soul
they
didnt
take
hes
still
got
his
she
seized
Dudley
by
the
shoulders
and
shook
him
as
though
testing
to
see
whether
she
could
hear
his
soul
rattling
around
inside
him
of
course
they
didnt
get
his
soul
youd
know
if
they
had
said
Harry
exasperated
fought
em
off
did
you
son
said
Uncle
Vernon
loudly
with
the
appearance
of
a
man
struggling
to
bring
the
conversation
back
on
to
a
plane
he
understood
gave
em
the
old
one-two
did
you
you
cant
give
a
Dementor
the
old
one-two
said
Harry
through
clenched
teeth
whys
he
all
right
then
blustered
Uncle
Vernon
why
isnt
he
all
empty
then
because
I
used
the
Patronus
whoosh
with
a
clattering
a
whirring
of
wings
and
a
soft
fall
of
dust
a
fourth
owl
came
shooting
out
of
the
kitchen
fireplace
for
gods
sake
roared
Uncle
Vernon
pulling
great
clumps
of
hair
out
of
his
moustache
something
he
hadnt
been
driven
to
do
in
a
long
time
i
will
not
have
owls
here
I
will
not
tolerate
this
I
tell
you
but
Harry
was
already
pulling
a
roll
of
parchment
from
the
owls
leg
he
was
so
convinced
that
this
letter
had
to
be
from
Dumbledore
explaining
everything
the
Dementors
Mrs
figg
what
the
Ministry
was
up
to
how
he
Dumbledore
intended
to
sort
everything
out
that
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
was
disappointed
to
see
Siriuss
handwriting
ignoring
Uncle
Vernons
on
going
rant
about
owls
and
narrowing
his
eyes
against
a
second
cloud
of
dust
as
the
most
recent
owl
look
off
back
up
the
chimney
Harry
read
Siriuss
message
arthurs
just
told
us
whats
happened
dont
leave
the
house
again
whatever
you
do
harry
found
this
such
an
inadequate
response
to
everything
that
had
happened
tonight
that
he
turned
the
piece
of
parchment
over
looking
for
the
rest
of
the
letter
but
there
was
nothing
else
and
now
his
temper
was
rising
again
wasnt
anybody
going
to
say
well
done
for
fighting
off
two
Dementors
single-handed
both
mr.
Weasley
and
Sirius
were
acting
as
though
hed
misbehaved
and
were
saving
their
tellings-off
until
they
could
ascertain
how
much
damage
had
been
done
a
peck
I
mean
pack
of
owls
shooting
in
and
out
of
my
house
i
wont
have
it
boy
I
wont
i
cant
stop
the
owls
coming
Harry
snapped
crushing
Siriuss
letter
in
his
fist
i
want
the
truth
about
what
happened
tonight
bar
ked
Uncle
Vernon
if
it
was
Demenders
who
hurt
Dudley
how
come
youve
been
expelled
you
did
you-know-what
youve
admitted
it
harry
took
a
deep
steadying
breath
his
head
was
beginning
to
ache
again
he
wanted
more
than
anything
to
get
out
of
the
kitchen
and
away
from
the
Dursleys
i
did
the
Patronus
Charm
to
get
rid
of
the
Dementors
he
said
forcing
himself
to
remain
calm
its
the
only
thing
that
works
against
them
but
what
were
Dementoids
doing
in
Little
Whinging
said
Uncle
Vernon
in
an
outraged
tone
couldnt
tell
you
said
Harry
wearily
no
idea
his
head
was
pounding
in
the
glare
of
the
strip-lighting
now
his
anger
was
ebbing
away
he
felt
drained
exhausted
the
Dursleys
were
all
staring
at
him
its
you
said
Uncle
Vernon
forcefully
its
go
t
something
to
do
with
you
boy
I
know
it
why
else
would
they
turn
up
here
why
else
would
they
be
down
that
alleyway
youve
got
to
be
the
only
the
only
Evidently
he
couldnt
bring
himself
to
say
the
word
wizard
the
only
you
know-what
for
miles
i
dont
know
why
they
were
here
but
at
Uncle
Vernons
words
Harrys
exhausted
brain
had
ground
back
into
action
why
had
the
dementors
come
to
Little
Whinging
how
could
it
be
coincidence
that
they
had
arrived
in
the
alleyway
where
Harry
was
had
they
been
sent
had
the
Ministry
of
Magic
lost
control
of
the
dementors
had
they
deserted
Azkaban
and
joined
Voldemort
as
Dumbledore
had
predicted
they
would
these
Demembers
guard
some
weirdos
prison
asked
Uncle
Vernon
lumbering
along
in
the
wake
of
Harrys
train
of
thought
yes
said
Harry
if
only
his
head
would
stop
hurting
if
only
he
could
just
leave
the
kitchen
and
get
to
his
dark
bedroom
and
think
oho
they
were
coming
to
arrest
you
said
Uncle
Vernon
with
the
triumphant
air
of
a
man
reaching
an
unassailable
conclusion
thats
it
isnt
it
boy
youre
on
the
run
from
the
law
of
course
Im
not
said
Harry
shaking
his
head
as
though
to
scare
off
a
fly
his
mind
racing
now
then
why
he
must
have
sent
them
said
Harry
quietly
more
to
himself
than
to
Uncle
Vernon
whats
that
who
must
have
sent
them
lord
Voldemort
said
Harry
he
registered
dimly
how
strange
it
was
that
the
Dursleys
who
flinched
winced
and
squawked
if
they
heard
words
like
wizard
magic
or
wand
could
hear
the
name
of
the
most
evil
wizard
of
all
time
without
the
slightest
tremor
lord
hang
on
said
Uncle
Vernon
his
face
screwed
up
a
look
of
dawning
comprehension
coming
into
his
piggy
eyes
ive
heard
that
name
that
was
the
one
who
murdered
my
parents
yes
Harry
said
dully
but
hes
gone
said
Uncle
Vernon
impatiently
without
the
slightest
sign
that
the
murder
of
harrys
parents
might
be
a
painful
topic
that
giant
bloke
said
so
hes
gone
hes
back
said
Harry
heavily
it
felt
very
strange
to
be
standing
here
in
Aunt
Petunias
surgically
clean
kitchen
beside
the
top
of-the-range
fridge
and
the
wide-screen
television
talking
calmly
of
Lord
Voldemort
to
Uncle
vernon
the
arrival
of
the
Dementors
in
Little
Whinging
seemed
to
have
breached
the
great
invisible
wall
that
divided
the
relentlessly
non-magical
world
of
Privet
Drive
and
the
world
beyond
Harrys
two
lives
had
somehow
become
fused
and
everything
had
been
turned
upside-down
the
Dursleys
were
asking
for
details
about
the
magical
world
and
Mrs
figg
knew
Albus
Dumbledore
Dementors
were
soaring
around
Little
Whinging
and
he
might
never
return
to
Hogwarts
harrys
head
throbbed
more
painfully
back
whispered
Aunt
Petunia
she
was
looking
at
Harry
as
she
had
never
looked
at
him
before
and
all
of
a
sudden
for
the
very
first
time
in
his
life
Harry
fully
appreciated
that
Aunt
Petunia
was
his
mothers
sister
he
could
not
have
said
why
this
hit
him
so
very
powerfully
at
this
moment
all
he
knew
was
that
he
was
not
the
only
person
in
the
room
who
had
an
inkling
of
what
Lord
Voldemort
being
back
might
mean
aunt
Petunia
had
never
in
her
life
looked
at
him
like
that
before
her
large
pale
eyes
so
unlike
her
sisters
were
not
narrowed
in
dislike
or
anger
they
were
wide
and
fearful
the
furious
pretence
that
Aunt
Petunia
had
maintained
all
Harrys
life
that
there
was
no
magic
and
no
world
other
than
the
world
she
inhabited
with
Uncle
Vernon
seemed
to
have
fallen
away
yes
Harry
said
talking
directly
to
Aunt
Petunia
now
he
came
back
a
month
ago
i
saw
him
her
hands
found
Dudleys
massive
leather-clad
shoulders
and
clutched
them
hang
on
said
Uncle
Vernon
looking
from
his
wife
to
Harry
and
back
again
apparently
dazed
and
confused
by
the
unprecedented
understanding
that
seemed
to
have
sprung
up
between
them
hang
on
this
Lord
Voldythings
back
you
say
yes
the
one
who
murdered
your
parents
yes
and
now
hes
sending
Dismembers
after
you
looks
like
it
said
Harry
i
see
said
Uncle
Vernon
looking
from
his
white
faced
wife
to
Harry
and
hitching
up
his
trousers
he
seemed
to
be
swelling
his
great
purple
face
stretching
before
Harrys
eyes
well
that
settles
it
he
said
his
shirt
front
straining
as
he
inflated
himself
you
can
get
out
of
this
house
boy
what
said
Harry
you
heard
me
out
uncle
Vernon
bellowed
and
even
Aunt
Petunia
and
Dudley
jumped
out
out
i
shouldve
done
this
years
ago
owls
treating
the
place
like
a
rest
home
puddings
exploding
half
the
lounge
destroyed
Dudleys
tail
Marge
bobbing
around
on
the
ceiling
and
that
flying
Ford
Anglia
out
out
youve
had
it
youre
history
youre
not
staying
here
if
some
loonys
after
you
youre
not
endangering
my
wife
and
son
youre
not
bringing
trouble
down
on
us
if
youre
going
the
same
way
as
your
useless
parents
Ive
had
it
out
harry
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
the
letters
from
the
Ministry
mr.
Weasley
and
Sirius
were
all
crushed
in
his
left
hand
dont
leave
the
house
again
whatever
you
do
do
not
leave
your
aunt
and
uncles
house
you
heard
me
said
Uncle
Vernon
bending
forward
now
his
massive
purple
face
coming
so
close
to
Harrys
he
actually
felt
flecks
of
spit
hit
his
face
get
going
you
were
all
keen
to
leave
half
an
hour
ago
im
right
behind
you
get
out
and
never
darken
our
doorstep
again
why
we
ever
kept
you
in
the
first
place
I
dont
know
Marge
was
right
it
should
have
been
the
orphanage
we
were
too
damn
soft
for
our
own
good
thought
we
could
squash
it
out
of
you
thought
we
could
turn
you
normal
but
youve
been
rotten
from
the
beginning
and
Ive
had
enough
owls
the
fifth
owl
zoomed
down
the
chimney
so
fast
it
actually
hit
the
floor
before
zooming
into
the
air
again
with
a
loud
screech
harry
raised
his
hand
to
seize
the
letter
which
was
in
a
scarlet
envelope
but
it
soared
straight
over
his
head
flying
directly
at
Aunt
Petunia
who
let
out
a
scream
and
ducked
her
arms
over
her
face
the
owl
dropped
the
red
envelope
on
her
head
turned
and
flew
straight
back
up
the
chimney
harry
darted
forwards
to
pick
up
the
letter
but
Aunt
Petunia
beat
him
to
it
you
can
open
it
if
you
like
said
Harry
but
Ill
hear
what
it
says

a
Howler

go
of
it
Petunia
roared
Uncle
Vernon
dont
touch
it

could
be
dangerous
its
addressed
to

said
Aunt
Petunia
in
a
shaking
voice
its
addressed
to
me
Vernon

Dursley
The
Kitchen
Number
Four
Privet
Drive
she
caught
her
breath
horrified
the
red
envelope
had
begun
to
smoke
open
it
harry
urged
her
get
it
over
with
itll
happen
anyway
no
aunt
Petunias
hand
was
trembling
she
looked
wildly
around
the
kitchen
as
though
looking
for
an
escape
route
but
too
late
the
envelope
burst
into
flames
aunt
Petunia
screamed
and
dropped
it
an
awful
voice
filled
the
kitchen
echoing
in
the
confined
space
issuing
from
the
burning
letter
on
the
table
remember
my
last
Petunia
aunt
Petunia
looked
as
though
she
might
faint
she
sank
into
the
chair
beside
Dudley
her
face
in
her
hands
the
remains
of
the
envelope
smouldered
into
ash
in
the
silence
what
is
this
uncle
Vernon
said
hoarsely
what
I
dont
Petunia
aunt
Petunia
said
nothing
dudley
was
staring
stupidly
at
his
mother
his
mouth
hanging
open
the
silence
spiraled
horribly
harry
was
watching
his
aunt
utterly
bewildered
his
head
throbbing
fit
to
burst
petunia

said
Uncle
Vernon
timidly
p-Petunia
she
raised
her
head

trembling
she
swallowed
the
boy

boy

said
weakly

to
her
feet
again
he
but
Petunia

rapidly

her
usual
brisk
snappish
manner

she
was
still
very
pale
theyll
ask
awkward
questions
theyll
want
to
know
where

gone
well

uncle
Vernon
was
deflating
like
an
old
tire
but
Petunia

aunt
Petunia
ignored
him
she
turned
to
Harry

the
Advance
Guard
ive
just

attacked
by
Dementors
and
I
might
be
expelled
from
Hogwarts
i
want
to
know
whats
going
on
and
when
Im
going
to
get
out
of
here
harry
copied
these
words
on
to
three
separate
pieces
of
parchment
the
moment
he
reached
the
desk
in
his
dark
bedroom
he
addressed
the
first
to
Sirius
the
second
to
Ron
and
the
third
to
hermione
his
owl
Hedwig
was
off
hunting
her
cage
stood
empty
on
the
desk
harry
paced
the
bedroom
waiting
for
her
to
come
back
his
head
pounding
his
brain
too
busy
for
sleep
even
though
his
eyes
stung
and
itched
with
tiredness
his
back
ached
from
hauling
Dudley
home
and
the
two
lumps
on
his
head
where
the
window
and
Dudley
had
hit
him
were
throbbing
painfully
up
and
down
he
paced
consumed
with
anger
and
frustration
grinding
his
teeth
and
clenching
his
fists
casting
angry
looks
out
at
the
empty
star-strewn
sky
every
time
he
passed
the
window
dementors
sent
to
get
him
Mrs
figg
and
Mundungus
Fletcher
tailing
him
in
secret
then
suspension
from
Hogwarts
and
a
hearing
at
the
Ministry
of
Magic
and
still
no
one
was
telling
him
what
was
going
on
and
what
what
had
that
Howler
been
about
whose
voice
had
echoed
so
horribly
so
menacingly
through
the
kitchen
why
was
he
still
trapped
here
without
information
why
was
everyone
treating
him
like
some
naughty
kid
dont
do
any
more
magic
stay
in
the
house
he
kicked
his
school
trunk
as
he
passed
it
but
far
from
relieving
his
anger
he
felt
worse
as
he
now
had
a
sharp
pain
in
his
toe
to
deal
with
in
addition
to
the
pain
in
the
rest
of
his
body
just
as
he
limped
past
the
window
Hedwig
soared
through
it
with
a
soft
rustle
of
wings
like
a
small
ghost
about
time
harry
snarled
as
she
landed
lightly
on
top
of
her
cage
you
can
put
that
down
ive
got
work
for
you
hedwigs
large
round
amber
eyes
gazed
at
him
reproachfully
over
the
dead
frog
clamped
in
her
beak
come
here
said
Harry
picking
up
the
three
small
rolls
of
parchment
and
a
leather
thong
and
tying
the
scrolls
to
her
scaly
leg
take
these
straight
to
Sirius
Ron
and
Hermione
and
dont
come
back
here
without
good
long
replies
keep
pecking
them
till
theyve
written
decent-length
answers
if
youve
got
to
understand
hedwig
gave
a
muffled
hooting
noise
her
beak
still
full
of
frog
get
going
then
said
Harry
she
took
off
immediately
the
moment
shed
gone
Harry
threw
himself
down
on
his
bed
without
undressing
and
stared
at
the
dark
ceiling
in
addition
to
every
other
miserable
feeling
he
now
felt
guilty
that
hed
been
irritable
with
Hedwig
she
was
the
only
friend
he
had
at
number
four
Privet
Drive
but
hed
make
it
up
to
her
when
she
came
back
with
the
answers
from
Sirius
ron
and
Hermione
they
were
bound
to
write
back
quickly
they
couldnt
possibly
ignore
a
Dementor
attack
hed
probably
wake
up
tomorrow
to
three
fat
letters
full
of
sympathy
and
plans
for
his
immediate
removal
to
The
Burrow
and
with
that
comforting
idea
sleep
rolled
over
him
stifling
all
further
thought
but
Hedwig
didnt
return
next
morning
harry
spent
the
day
in
his
bedroom
leaving
it
only
to
go
to
the
bathroom
three
times
that
day
Aunt
Petunia
shoved
food
into
his
room
through
the
cat
flap
Uncle
Vernon
had
installed
three
summers
ago
every
time
Harry
heard
her
approaching
he
tried
to
question
her
about
the
Howler
but
he
might
as
well
have
interrogated
the
doorknob
for
all
the
answers
he
got
otherwise
the
Dursleys
kept
well
clear
of
his
bedroom
harry
couldnt
see
the
point
of
forcing
his
company
on
them
another
row
would
achieve
nothing
except
perhaps
make
him
so
angry
hed
perform
more
illegal
magic
so
it
went
on
for
three
whole
days
harry
was
alternately
filled
with
restless
energy
that
made
him
unable
to
settle
to
anything
during
which
time
he
paced
his
bedroom
furious
at
the
whole
lot
of
them
for
leaving
him
to
stew
in
this
mess
and
with
a
lethargy
so
complete
that
he
could
lie
on
his
bed
for
an
hour
at
a
time
staring
dazedly
into
space
aching
with
dread
at
the
thought
of
the
Ministry
hearing
what
if
they
ruled
against
him
what
if
he
was
expelled
and
his
wand
was
snapped
in
half
what
would
he
do
where
would
he
go
he
could
not
return
to
living
full-time
with
the
Dursleys
not
now
he
knew
the
other
world
the
one
to
which
he
really
belonged
might
he
be
able
to
move
into
Siriuss
house
as
Sirius
had
suggested
a
year
ago
before
he
had
been
forced
to
flee
from
the
ministry
would
Harry
be
allowed
to
live
there
alone
given
that
he
was
still
underage
or
would
the
matter
of
where
he
went
next
be
decided
for
him
had
his
breach
of
the
International
statute
of
Secrecy
been
severe
enough
to
land
him
in
a
cell
in
Azkaban
whenever
this
thought
occurred
Harry
invariably
slid
off
his
bed
and
began
pacing
again
on
the
fourth
night
after
Hedwigs
departure
Harry
was
lying
in
one
of
his
apathetic
phases
staring
at
the
ceiling
his
exhausted
mind
quite
blank
when
his
uncle
entered
his
bedroom
harry
looked
slowly
around
at
him
uncle
Vernon
was
wearing
his
best
suit
and
an
expression
of
enormous
smugness
were
going
out
he
said
sorry
we
that
is
to
say
your
aunt
Dudley
and
I
are
going
out
fine
said
Harry
dully
looking
back
at
the
ceiling
you
are
not
to
leave
your
bedroom
while
we
are
away
okay
you
are
not
to
touch
the
television
the
stereo
or
any
of
our
possessions
right
you
are
not
to
steal
food
from
the
fridge
okay
i
am
going
to
lock
your
door
you
do
that
uncle
Vernon
glared
at
Harry
clearly
suspicious
of
this
lack
of
argument
then
stomped
out
of
the
room
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
harry
heard
the
key
turn
in
the
lock
and
Uncle
vernons
footsteps
walking
heavily
down
the
stairs
a
few
minutes
later
he
heard
the
slamming
of
car
doors
the
rumble
of
an
engine
and
the
unmistakable
sound
of
the
car
sweeping
out
of
the
drive
harry
had
no
particular
feeling
about
the
Dursleys
leaving
it
made
no
difference
to
him
whether
they
were
in
the
house
or
not
he
could
not
even
summon
the
energy
to
get
up
and
turn
on
his
bedroom
light
the
room
grew
steadily
darker
around
him
as
he
lay
listening
to
the
night
sounds
through
the
window
he
kept
open
all
the
time
waiting
for
the
blessed
moment
when
Hedwig
returned
the
empty
house
creaked
around
him
the
pipes
gurgled
harry
lay
there
in
a
kind
of
stupor
thinking
of
nothing
suspended
in
misery
then
quite
distinctly
he
heard
a
crash
in
the
kitchen
below
he
sat
bolt
upright
listening
intently
the
Dursleys
couldnt
be
back
it
was
much
too
soon
and
in
any
case
he
hadnt
heard
their
car
there
was
silence
for
a
few
seconds
then
voices
burglars
he
thought
sliding
off
the
bed
on
to
his
feet
but
a
split
second
later
it
occurred
to
him
that
burglars
would
keep
their
voices
down
and
whoever
was
moving
around
in
the
kitchen
was
certainly
not
troubling
to
do
so
he
snatched
up
his
wand
from
the
bedside
table
and
stood
facing
his
bedroom
door
listening
with
all
his
might
next
moment
he
jumped
as
the
lock
gave
a
loud
click
and
his
door
swung
open
harry
stood
motionless
staring
through
the
open
doorway
at
the
dark
upstairs
landing
straining
his
ears
for
further
sounds
but
none
came
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
then
moved
swiftly
and
silently
out
of
his
room
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
his
heart
shot
upwards
into
his
throat
there
were
people
standing
in
the
shadowy
hall
below
silhouetted
against
the
streetlight
glowing
through
the
glass
door
eight
or
nine
of
them
all
as
far
as
he
could
see
looking
up
at
him
lower
your
wand
boy
before
you
take
someones
eye
out
said
a
low
growling
voice
harrys
heart
was
thumping
uncontrollably
he
knew
that
voice
but
he
did
not
lower
his
wand
professor
Moody
he
said
uncertainly
i
dont
know
so
much
about
Professor
growled
the
voice
never
got
round
to
much
teaching
did
I
get
down
here
we
want
to
see
you
properly
harry
lowered
his
wand
slightly
but
did
not
relax
his
grip
on
it
nor
did
he
move
he
had
very
good
reason
to
be
suspicious
he
had
recently
spent
nine
months
in
what
he
had
thought
was
mad-Eye
Moodys
company
only
to
find
out
that
it
wasnt
Moody
at
all
but
an
impostor
an
impostor
moreover
who
had
tried
to
kill
Harry
before
being
unmasked
but
before
he
could
make
a
decision
about
what
to
do
next
a
second
slightly
hoarse
voice
floated
upstairs
its
all
right
Harry
weve
come
to
take
you
away
harrys
heart
leapt
he
knew
that
voice
too
though
he
hadnt
heard
it
for
over
a
year
p-Professor
Lupin
he
said
disbelievingly
is
that
you
why
are
we
all
standing
in
the
dark
said
a
third
voice
this
one
completely
unfamiliar
a
womans
lumos
a
wand-tip
flared
illuminating
the
hall
with
magical
light
harry
blinked
the
people
below
were
crowded
around
the
foot
of
the
stairs
gazing
up
at
him
intently
some
craning
their
heads
for
a
better
look
remus
Lupin
stood
nearest
to
him
though
still
quite
young
Lupin
looked
tired
and
rather
ill
he
had
more
grey
hairs
than
when
Harry
had
last
said
goodbye
to
him
and
his
robes
were
more
patched
and
shabbier
than
ever
nevertheless
he
was
smiling
broadly
at
Harry
who
tried
to
smile
back
despite
his
state
of
shock
oooh
he
looks
just
like
I
thought
he
would
said
the
witch
who
was
holding
her
lit
wand
aloft
she
looked
the
youngest
there
she
had
a
pale
heart-shaped
face
dark
twinkling
eyes
and
short
spiky
hair
that
was
a
violent
shade
of
violet
wotcher
Harry
yeah
I
see
what
you
mean
Remus
said
a
bald
black
wizard
standing
furthest
back
he
had
a
deep
slow
voice
and
wore
a
single
gold
hoop
in
his
ear
he
looks
exactly
like
James
except
the
eyes
said
a
wheezy-voiced
silver-haired
wizard
at
the
back
lilys
eyes
mad-Eye
Moody
who
had
long
grizzled
grey
hair
and
a
large
chunk
missing
from
his
nose
was
squinting
suspiciously
at
Harry
through
his
mismatched
eyes
one
eye
was
small
dark
and
beady
the
other
large
round
and
electric
blue
the
magical
eye
that
could
see
through
walls
doors
and
the
back
of
Moodys
own
head
are
you
quite
sure
its
him
Lupin
he
growled
itd
be
a
nice
lookout
if
we
bring
back
some
Death
Eater
impersonating
him
we
ought
to
ask
him
something
only
the
real
Potter
would
know
unless
anyone
brought
any
Veritaserum
harry
what
form
does
your
Patronus
take
lupin
asked
a
stag
said
Harry
nervously
thats
him
Mad-Eye
said
Lupin
very
conscious
of
everybody
still
staring
at
him
Harry
descended
the
stairs
stowing
his
wand
in
the
back
pocket
of
his
jeans
as
he
came
dont
put
your
wand
there
boy
roared
Moody
what
if
it
ignited
better
wizards
than
you
have
lost
buttocks
you
know
who
dyou
know
whos
lost
a
buttock
the
violet-haired
woman
asked
Mad-Eye
interestedly
never
you
mind
you
just
keep
your
wand
out
of
your
back
pocket
growled
Mad-Eye
elementary
wand-safety
nobody
bothers
about
it
any
more
he
stumped
off
towards
the
kitchen
and
I
saw
that
he
added
irritably
as
t
he
woman
rolled
her
eyes
towards
the
ceiling
lupin
held
out
his
hand
and
shook
Harrys
how
are
you
he
asked
looking
closely
at
Harry
f-fine
harry
could
hardly
believe
this
was
real
four
weeks
with
nothing
not
the
tiniest
hint
of
a
plan
to
remove
him
from
Privet
Drive
and
suddenly
a
whole
bunch
of
wizards
was
standing
matter-of
factly
in
the
house
as
though
this
was
a
long-standing
arrangement
he
glanced
at
the
people
surrounding
Lupin
they
were
still
gazing
avidly
at
him
he
felt
very
conscious
of
the
fact
that
he
had
not
combed
his
hair
for
four
days
im
youre
really
lucky
the
Dursleys
are
out
he
mumbled
lucky
ha
said
the
violet-haired
woman
it
was
me
who
lured
them
out
of
the
way
sent
a
letter
by
Muggle
post
telling
them
theyd
been
short-listed
for
the
All-England
Best
Kept
suburban
Lawn
Competition
theyre
heading
off
to
the
prize-giving
right
now
or
they
think
they
are
harry
had
a
fleeting
vision
of
Uncle
Vernons
face
when
he
realized
there
was
no
All-England
best
Kept
Suburban
Lawn
Competition
we
are
leaving
arent
we
he
asked
soon
almost
at
once
said
Lupin
were
just
waiting
for
the
all-clear
where
are
we
going
the
Burrow
harry
asked
hopefully
not
The
Burrow
no
said
Lupin
motioning
Harry
towards
the
kitchen
the
little
knot
of
wizards
followed
all
still
eyeing
Harry
curiously
too
risky
weve
set
up
Headquarters
somewhere
undetectable
its
taken
a
while
mad-Eye
Moody
was
now
sitting
at
the
kitchen
table
swigging
from
a
hip
flask
his
magical
eye
spinning
in
all
directions
taking
in
the
Dursleys
many
labor-saving
appliances
this
is
Alastor
Moody
Harry
Lupin
continued
pointing
towards
Moody
yeah
I
know
said
Harry
uncomfortably
it
felt
odd
to
be
introduced
to
somebody
hed
thought
hed
known
for
a
year
and
this
is
Nymphadora
dont
call
me
Nymphadora
Remus
said
the
young
witch
with
a
shudder
its
Tonks
nymphadora
Tonks
who
prefers
to
be
known
by
her
surname
only
finished
Lupin
so
would
you
if
your
fool
of
a
mother
had
called
you
Nymphadora
muttered
Tonks
and
this
is
Kingsley
Shacklebolt
he
indicated
the
tall
black
wizard
who
bowed
elphias
doge
the
wheezy-voiced
wizard
nodded
dedalus
Diggle
weve
met
before
squeaked
the
excitable
Diggle
dropping
his
violet-colored
top
hat
emmeline
Vance
a
stately-looking
witch
in
an
emerald
green
shawl
inclined
her
head
sturgis
Podmore
a
square-jawed
wizard
with
thick
straw-colored
hair
winked
and
Hestia
jones
a
pink-cheeked
black-haired
witch
waved
form
next
to
the
toaster
harry
inclined
his
head
awkwardly
at
each
of
them
as
they
were
introduced
he
wished
they
would
look
at
something
other
than
him
it
was
as
though
he
had
suddenly
been
ushered
onstage
he
also
wondered
why
so
many
of
them
were
there
a
surprising
number
of
people
volunteered
to
come
and
get
you
said
Lupin
as
though
he
had
read
Harrys
mind
the
corners
of
his
mouth
twitched
slightly
yeah
well
the
more
the
better
said
Moody
darkly
were
your
guard
Potter
were
just
waiting
for
the
signal
to
tell
us
its
safe
to
set
off
said
Lupin
glancing
out
of
the
kitchen
window
weve
got
about
fifteen
minutes
very
clean
arent
they
these
Muggles
said
the
witch
called
Tonks
who
was
looking
around
the
kitchen
with
great
interest
my
dads
muggle-born
and
hes
a
right
old
slob
i
suppose
it
varies
just
as
it
does
with
wizards
er
yeah
said
Harry
look
he
turned
back
to
Lupin
whats
going
on
I
havent
heard
anything
from
anyone
whats
Vol
several
of
the
witches
and
wizards
made
odd
hissing
noises
Dedalus
Diggle
dropped
his
hat
again
and
Moody
growled
Shut
up
what
said
Harry
were
not
discussing
anything
here
its
too
risky
said
Moody
turning
his
normal
eye
on
harry
his
magical
eye
remained
focused
on
the
ceiling
damn
it
he
added
angrily
putting
a
hand
up
to
the
magical
eye
it
keeps
getting
stuck
ever
since
that
scum
wore
it
and
with
a
nasty
squelching
sound
much
like
a
plunger
being
pulled
from
a
sink
he
popped
out
his
eye
mad-Eye
you
do
know
thats
disgusting
dont
you
said
Tonks
conversationally
get
me
a
glass
of
water
would
you
Harry
requested
Moody
harry
crossed
to
the
dishwasher
took
out
a
clean
glass
and
filled
it
with
water
at
the
sink
still
watched
eagerly
by
the
band
of
wizards
their
relentless
staring
was
starting
to
annoy
him
cheers
said
Moody
when
Harry
handed
him
the
glass
he
dropped
the
magical
eyeball
into
the
water
and
prodded
it
up
and
down
the
eye
whizzed
around
staring
at
them
all
in
turn
want
three
hundred
and
sixty
degrees
visibility
on
the
return
journey
howre
we
getting
wherever
were
going
harry
asked
brooms
said
Lupin
only
way
youre
too
young
to
Apparate
theyll
be
watching
the
Floo
network
and
its
more
than
our
lifes
worth
to
set
up
an
unauthorized
Portkey
remus
says
youre
a
good
flier
said
Kingsley
Shacklebolt
in
his
deep
voice
hes
excellent
said
Lupin
who
was
checking
his
watch
anyway
youd
better
go
and
get
packed
Harry
we
want
to
be
ready
to
go
when
the
signal
comes
ill
come
and
help
you
said
Tonks
brightly
she
followed
Harry
back
into
the
hall
and
up
the
stairs
looking
around
with
much
curiosity
and
interest
funny
place
she
said
its
a
bit
too
clean
dyou
know
what
I
mean
bit
unnatural
oh
this
is
better
she
added
as
they
entered
Harrys
bedroom
and
he
turned
on
the
light
his
room
was
certainly
much
messier
than
the
rest
of
the
house
confined
to
it
for
four
days
in
a
very
bad
mood
Harry
had
not
bothered
tidying
up
after
himself
most
of
the
books
he
owned
were
strewn
over
the
floor
where
hed
tried
to
distract
himself
with
each
in
turn
and
thrown
it
aside
Hedwigs
cage
needed
cleaning
out
and
was
starting
to
smell
and
his
trunk
lay
open
revealing
a
jumbled
mixture
of
Muggle
clothes
and
wizards
robes
that
had
spilled
on
to
the
floor
around
it
harry
started
picking
up
books
and
throwing
them
hastily
into
his
trunk
tonks
paused
at
his
open
wardrobe
to
look
critically
at
her
reflection
in
the
mirror
on
the
inside
of
the
door
you
know
I
dont
think
violets
really
my
color
she
said
pensively
tugging
at
a
lock
of
spiky
hair
dyou
think
it
makes
me
look
a
bit
peaky
er
said
Harry
looking
up
at
her
over
the
top
of
Quidditch
Teams
of
Britain
and
Ireland
yeah
it
does
said
Tonks
decisively
she
screwed
up
her
eyes
in
a
strained
expression
as
though
she
was
struggling
to
remember
something
a
second
later
her
hair
had
turned
bubblegum
pink
how
did
you
do
that
said
Harry
gaping
at
her
as
she
opened
her
eyes
again
im
a
Metamorphmagus
she
said
looking
back
at
her
reflection
and
turning
her
head
so
that
she
could
see
her
hair
from
all
directions
it
means
I
can
change
my
appearance
at
will
she
added
spotting
Harrys
puzzled
expression
in
the
mirror
behind
her
i
was
born
one
i
got
top
marks
in
Concealment
and
Disguise
during
Auror
training
without
any
study
at
all
it
was
great
youre
an
Auror
said
Harry
impressed
being
a
dark-wizard-catcher
was
the
only
career
hed
ever
considered
after
Hogwarts
yeah
said
Tonks
looking
proud
kingsley
is
as
well
hes
a
bit
higher
up
than
me
though
only
qualified
a
year
ago
nearly
failed
on
Stealth
and
Tracking
im
dead
clumsy
did
you
hear
me
break
that
plate
when
we
arrived
downstairs
can
you
learn
how
to
be
a
Metamorphmagus
harry
asked
her
straightening
up
completely
forgetting
about
packing
tonks
chuckled
bet
you
wouldnt
mind
hiding
that
scar
sometimes
eh
her
eyes
found
the
lightning-shaped
scar
on
Harrys
forehead
no
I
wouldnt
mind
Harry
mumbled
turning
away
he
did
not
like
people
staring
at
his
scar
well
youll
have
to
learn
the
hard
way
Im
afraid
said
Tonks
metamorphmagi
are
really
rare
theyre
born
not
made
most
wizards
need
to
use
a
wand
or
potions
to
change
their
appearance
but
weve
got
to
get
going
Harry
were
supposed
to
be
packing
she
added
guiltily
looking
around
at
all
the
mess
on
the
floor
oh
yeah
said
Harry
grabbing
a
few
more
books
dont
be
stupid
itll
be
much
quicker
if
I
pack
cried
Tonks
waving
her
wand
in
a
long
sweeping
movement
over
the
floor
books
clothes
telescope
and
scales
all
soared
into
the
air
and
flew
pell-mell
into
the
trunk
its
not
very
neat
said
Tonks
walking
over
to
t
he
trunk
and
looking
down
at
the
jumble
inside
my
mums
got
this
knack
of
getting
stuff
to
fit
itself
in
neatly
she
even
gets
the
socks
to
fold
themselves
but
Ive
never
mastered
how
she
does
it
its
a
kind
of
flick
She
flicked
her
wand
hopefully
one
of
Harrys
socks
gave
a
feeble
sort
of
wiggle
and
flopped
back
on
top
of
the
mess
in
the
trunk
ah
well
said
Tonks
slamming
the
trunks
lid
shut
at
least
its
all
in
that
could
do
with
a
bit
of
cleaning
too
she
pointed
her
wand
at
Hedwigs
cage
scourgify
a
few
feathers
and
droppings
vanished
well
thats
a
bit
better
Ive
never
quite
got
the
hang
of
these
householdy
sort
of
spells
right
got
everything
cauldron
broom
wow
A
Firebolt
her
eyes
widened
as
they
fell
on
the
broomstick
in
Harrys
right
hand
it
was
his
pride
and
joy
a
gift
from
Sirius
an
international-standard
broomstick
and
Im
still
riding
a
Comet
Two
Sixty
said
Tonks
enviously
ah
well
wand
still
in
your
jeans
both
buttocks
still
on
okay
lets
go
locomotor
trunk
harrys
trunk
rose
a
few
inches
into
the
air
holding
her
wand
like
a
conductors
baton
Tonks
made
the
trunk
hover
across
the
room
and
out
of
the
door
ahead
of
them
Hedwigs
cage
in
her
left
hand
harry
followed
her
down
the
stairs
carrying
his
broomstick
back
in
the
kitchen
Moody
had
replaced
his
eye
which
was
spinning
so
fast
after
its
cleaning
it
made
Harry
feel
sick
to
look
at
it
kingsley
Shacklebolt
and
Sturgis
Podmore
were
examining
the
microwave
and
Hestia
Jones
was
laughing
at
a
potato
peeler
she
had
come
across
while
rummaging
in
the
drawers
lupin
was
sealing
a
letter
addressed
to
the
Dursleys
excellent
said
Lupin
looking
up
as
Tonks
and
Harry
entered
weve
got
about
a
minute
I
think
we
should
probably
get
out
into
the
garden
so
were
ready
harry
Ive
left
a
letter
telling
your
aunt
and
uncle
not
to
worry

wont
said
Harry
that
youre
safe
thatll
just
depress
them
and
youll
see
them
next
summer
do
I
have
to
lupin
smiled
but
made
no
answer
come
here
boy
said
Moody
gruffly
beckoning
Harry
towards
him
with
his
wand
i
need
to
disillusion
you
you
need
to
what
said
Harry
nervously
disillusionment
Charm
said
Moody
raising
his
wand
lupin
says
youve
got
an
Invisibility
cloak
but
it
wont
stay
on
while
were
flying
thisll
disguise
you
better
here
you
go
he
rapped
him
hard
on
the
top
of
the
head
and
Harry
felt
a
curious
sensation
as
though
Moody
had
just
smashed
an
egg
there
cold
trickles
seemed
to
be
running
down
his
body
from
the
point
the
wand
had
struck
nice
one
Mad-Eye
said
Tonks
appreciatively
staring
at
Harrys
midriff
harry
looked
down
at
his
body
or
rather
what
had
been
his
body
for
it
didnt
look
anything
like
his
any
more
it
was
not
invisible
it
had
simply
taken
on
the
exact
color
and
texture
of
the
kitchen
unit
behind
him
he
seemed
to
have
become
a
human
chameleon
come
on
said
Moody
unlocking
the
back
door
with
his
wand
they
all
stepped
outside
on
to
Uncle
Vernons
beautifully
kept
lawn
clear
night
grunted
Moody
his
magical
eye
scanning
the
heavens
couldve
done
with
a
bit
more
cloud

barked
at
Harry

harry
asked
apprehensively
but
Moody
ignored
him
the
others
keep
flying
dont
stop
dont
break
ranks
if
they
take
out
all
of
us
and
you

harry

being
so
cheerful
Mad-Eye
hell
think
were
not
taking
this
seriously
said
Tonks
as
she
strapped
Harrys
trunk
and
Hedwigs
cage
into
a
harness
hanging
from
her
broom
im
just
telling
the
boy
the
plan
growled
Moody
our
jobs
to
deliver
him
safely
to
headquarters
and
if
we
die
in
the
attempt
no
ones
going
to
die
said
Kingsley
Shacklebolt
in
his
deep
calming
voice
mount
your
brooms
thats
the
first
signal
said
Lupin
sharply
pointing
into
the
sky
far
far
above
them
a
shower
of
bright
red
sparks
had
flared
among
the
stars
Harry
recognized
them
at
once
as
wand
sparks
he
swung
his
right
leg
over
his
Firebolt
gripped
its
handle
tightly
and
felt
it
vibrating
very
slightly
as
though
it
was
as
keen
as
he
was
to
be
up
in
the
air
once
more
second
signal
lets
go
said
Lupin
loudly
as
more
sparks
green
this
time
exploded
high
above
them
harry
kicked
off
hard
from
the
ground
the
cool
night
air
rushed
through
his
hair
as
the
neat
square
gardens
of
Privet
Drive
fell
away
shrinking
rapidly
into
a
patchwork
of
dark
greens
and
blacks
and
every
thought
of
the
Ministry
hearing
was
swept
from
his
mind
as
though
the
rush
of
air
had
blown
it
out
of
his
head
he
felt
as
though
his
heart
was
going
to
explode
with
pleasure
he
was
flying
again
flying
away
from
Privet
Drive
as
hed
been
fantasizing
about
all
summer
he
was
going
home
for
a
few
glorious
moments
all
his
problems
seemed
to
recede
to
nothing
insignificant
in
the
vast
starry
sky
hard
left
hard
left
theres
a
Muggle
looking
up
shouted
Moody
from
behind
him
tonks
swerved
and
Harry
followed
her
watching
his
trunk
swinging
wildly
beneath
her
broom
we
need
more
height
give
it
another
quarter
of
a
mile
harrys
eyes
watered
in
the
chill
as
they
soared
upwards
he
could
see
nothing
below
now
but
tiny
pinpricks
of
light
that
were
car
headlights
and
streetlamps
two
of
those
tiny
lights
might
belong
to
Uncle
Vernons
car
the
Dursleys
would
be
heading
back
to
their
empty
house
right
now
full
of
rage
about
the
non-existent
Lawn
Competition
and
Harry
laughed
aloud
at
the
thought
though
his
voice
was
drowned
by
the
flapping
robes
of
the
others
the
creaking
of
the
harness
holding
his
trunk
and
the
cage
and
the
whoosh
of
the
wind
in
their
ears
as
they
sped
through
the
air
he
had
not
felt
this
alive
in
a
month
or
this
happy
bearing
south
shouted
Mad-Eye
town
ahead
they
soared
right
to
avoid
passing
directly
over
the
glittering
spiders
web
of
lights
below
bear
southeast
and
keep
climbing
theres
some
low
cloud
ahead
we
can
lose
ourselves
in
called
Moody
were
not
going
through
clouds
shouted
Tonks
angrily
well
get
soaked
Mad-Eye
harry
was
relieved
to
hear
her
say
this
his
hands
were
growing
numb
on
the
Firebolts
handle
he
wished
he
had
thought
to
put
on
a
coat
he
was
starting
to
shiver
they
altered
their
course
every
now
and
then
according
to
Mad-Eyes
instructions
harrys
eyes
were
screwed
up
against
the
rush
of
icy
wind
that
was
starting
to
make
his
ears
ache
he
could
remember
being
this
cold
on
a
broom
only
once
before
during
the
Quidditch
match
against
hufflepuff
in
his
third
year
which
had
taken
place
in
a
storm
the
guard
around
him
was
circling
continuously
like
giant
birds
of
prey
harry
lost
track
of
time
he
wondered
how
long
they
had
been
flying
it
felt
like
an
hour
at
least
turning
southwest
yelled
Moody
We
want
to
avoid
the
motorway
harry
was
now
so
chilled
he
thought
longingly
of
the
snug
dry
interiors
of
the
cars
streaming
along
below
then
even
more
longingly
of
traveling
by
Floo
powder
it
might
be
uncomfortable
to
spin
around
in
fireplaces
but
it
was
at
least
warm
in
the
flames
kingsley
Shacklebolt
swooped
around
him
bald
pate
and
earring
gleaming
slightly
in
the
moonlight
now
Emmeline
vance
was
on
his
right
her
wand
out
her
head
turning
left
and
right
then
she
too
swooped
over
him
to
be
replaced
by
Sturgis
Podmore
we
ought
to
double
back
for
a
bit
just
to
make
sure
were
not
being
followed
moody
shouted
are
you
mad
mad-eye
Tonks
screamed
from
the
front
were
all
frozen
to
our
brooms
if
we
keep
going
off-course
were
not
going
to
get
there
until
next
week
besides
were
nearly
there
now
time
to
start
the
descent
came
Lupins
voice
follow
Tonks
Harry
harry
followed
Tonks
into
a
dive
they
were
heading
for
the
largest
collection
of
lights
he
had
yet
seen
a
huge
sprawling
crisscrossing
mass
glittering
in
lines
and
grids
interspersed
with
patches
of
deepest
black
lower
and
lower
they
flew
until
Harry
could
see
individual
headlights
and
streetlamps
chimneys
and
television
aerials
he
wanted
to
reach
the
ground
very
much
though
he
felt
sure
someone
would
have
to
unfreeze
him
from
his
broom
here
we
go
called
Tonks
and
a
few
seconds
later
she
had
landed
harry
touched
down
right
behind
her
and
dismounted
on
a
patch
of
unkempt
grass
in
the
middle
of
a
small
square
tonks
was
already
unbuckling
Harrys
trunk
shivering
Harry
looked
around
the
grimy
fronts
of
the
surrounding
houses
were
not
welcoming
some
of
them
had
broken
windows
glimmering
dully
in
the
light
fro
the
streetlamps
paint
was
peeling
from
many
of
the
doors
and
heaps
of
rubbish
lay
outside
several
sets
of
front
steps
where
are
we
harry
asked
but
Lupin
said
quietly
In
a
minute
moody
was
rummaging
in
his
cloak
his
gnarled
hands
clumsy
with
cold
got
it
he
muttered
raising
what
looked
like
a
silver
cigarette
lighter
into
the
air
and
clicking
it
the
nearest
streetlamp
went
out
with
a
pop
he
clicked
the
unlighter
again
the
next
lamp
went
out
he
kept
clicking
until
every
lamp
in
the
square
was
extinguished
and
the
only
remaining
light
came
from
curtained
windows
and
the
sickle
moon
overhead
borrowed
it
from
Dumbledore
growled
Moody
pocketing
the
Put-Outer
thatll
take
care
of
any
Muggles
looking
out
of
the
window
see
now
come
on
quick
he
took
Harry
by
the
arm
and
led
him
from
the
patch
of
grass
across
the
road
and
on
to
the
pavement
Lupin
and
Tonks
followed
carrying
Harrys
trunk
between
them
the
rest
of
the
guard
all
with
their
wands
out
flanking
them
the
muffled
pounding
of
a
stereo
was
coming
from
an
upper
window
in
the
nearest
house
pungent
smell
of
rotting
rubbish
came
from
the
pile
of
bulging
bin-bags
just
inside
the
broken
gate
here
Moody
muttered
thrusting
a
piece
of
parchment
towards
Harrys
Disillusioned
hand
and
holding
his
lit
wand
close
to
it
so
as
to
illuminate
the
writing
read
quickly
and
memories
harry
looked
down
at
the
piece
of
paper
the
narrow
handwriting
was
vaguely
familiar
it
said
the
Headquarters
of
the
Order
of
the
Phoenix
may
be
found
at
number
twelve
Grimmauld
place
London
chapter
four
number
Twelve
Grimmauld
Place
whats
the
Order
of
the
harry
began
not
here
boy
snarled
Moody
wait
till
were
inside
he
pulled
the
piece
of
parchment
out
of
Harrys
hand
and
set
fire
to
it
with
his
wand-tip
as
the
message
curled
into
flames
and
floated
to
the
ground
Harry
looked
around
at
the
houses
again
they
were
standing
outside
number
eleven
he
looked
to
the
left
and
saw
number
ten
to
the
right
however
was
number
thirteen
but
wheres
think
about
what
youve
just
memorized
said
Lupin
quietly
harry
thought
and
no
sooner
had
he
reached
the
part
about
number
twelve
Grimmauld
Place
than
a
battered
door
emerged
out
of
nowhere
between
numbers
eleven
and
thirteen
followed
swiftly
by
dirty
walls
and
grimy
windows
it
was
as
though
an
extra
house
had
inflated
pushing
those
on
either
side
out
of
its
way
harry
gaped
at
it
the
stereo
in
number
eleven
thudded
on
apparently
the
Muggles
inside
hadnt
felt
anything
come
on
hurry
growled
Moody
prodding
Harry
in
the
back
harry
walked
up
the
worn
stone
steps
staring
at
the
newly
materialized
door
its
black
paint
was
shabby
and
scratched
the
silver
doorknocker
was
in
the
form
of
a
twisted
serpent
there
was
no
keyhole
or
letterbox
lupin
pulled
out
his
wand
and
tapped
the
door
once
harry
heard
many
loud
metallic
clicks
and
what
sounded
like
the
clatter
of
a
chain
the
door
creaked
open
get
in
quick
Harry
Lupin
whispered
but
dont
go
far
inside
and
dont
touch
anything
harry
stepped
over
the
threshold
into
the
almost
total
darkness
of
the
hall
he
could
smell
damp
dust
and
a
sweetish
rotting
smell
the
place
had
the
feeling
of
a
derelict
building
he
looked
over
his
shoulder
and
saw
the
others
filing
in
behind
him
Lupin
and
Tonks
carrying
his
trunk
and
hedwigs
cage
moody
was
standing
on
the
top
step
releasing
the
balls
of
light
the
Put-Outer
had
stolen
from
the
streetlamps
they
flew
back
to
their
bulbs
and
the
square
glowed
momentarily
with
orange
light
before
Moody
limped
inside
and
closed
the
front
door
so
that
the
darkness
in
the
hall
became
complete
here
he
rapped
Harry
hard
over
the
head
with
his
wand
Harry
felt
as
though
something
hot
was
trickling
down
his
back
this
time
and
knew
that
the
Disillusionment
Charm
must
have
lifted
now
stay
still
everyone
while
I
give
us
a
bit
of
light
in
here
Moody
whispered
the
others
hushed
voices
were
giving
Harry
an
odd
feeling
of
foreboding
it
was
as
though
they
had
just
entered
the
house
of
a
dying
person
he
heard
a
soft
hissing
noise
and
then
old-fashioned
gas
lamps
sputtered
into
life
all
along
the
walls
casting
a
flickering
insubstantial
light
over
the
peeling
wallpaper
and
threadbare
carpet
of
a
long
gloomy
hallway
where
a
cobwebby
chandelier
glimmered
overhead
and
age-blackened
portraits
hung
crooked
on
the
walls
harry
heard
something
scuttling
behind
the
baseboard
both
the
chandelier
and
the
candelabra
on
a
rickety
table
nearby
were
shaped
like
serpents
there
were
hurried
footsteps
and
Rons
mother
Mrs
weasley
emerged
from
a
door
at
the
far
end
of
the
hall
she
was
beaming
in
welcome
as
she
hurried
towards
them
though
Harry
noticed
that
she
was
rather
thinner
and
paler
than
she
had
been
last
time
he
had
seen
her
oh
Harry
its
lovely
to
see
you
she
whispered
pulling
him
into
a
rib-cracking
hug
before
holding
him
at
arms
length
and
examining
him
critically
youre
looking
peaky
you
need
feeding
up
but
youll
have
to
wait
a
bit
for
dinner
Im
afraid
she
turned
to
the
gang
of
wizards
behind
him
and
whispered
urgently
Hes
just
arrived
the
meetings
started
the
wizards
behind
Harry
all
made
noises
of
interest
and
excitement
and
began
filing
past
him
towards
the
door
through
which
Mrs
weasley
had
just
come
harry
made
to
follow
Lupin
but
mrs
weasley
held
him
back
no
Harry
the
meetings
only
for
members
of
the
Order
ron
and
Hermione
are
upstairs
you
can
wait
with
them
until
the
meetings
over
then
well
have
dinner
and
keep
your
voice
down
in
the
hall
she
added
in
an
urgent
whisper
why
i
dont
want
anything
to
wake
up
what
dyou
ill
explain
later
Ive
got
to
hurry
Im
supposed
to
be
at
the
meeting
Ill
just
show
you
where
youre
sleeping
pressing
her
finger
to
her
lips
she
led
him
on
tiptoe
past
a
pair
of
long
moth-eaten
curtains
behind
which
Harry
supposed
there
must
be
another
door
and
after
skirting
a
large
umbrella
stand
that
looked
as
though
it
had
been
made
from
a
severed
trolls
leg
they
started
up
the
dark
staircase
passing
a
row
of
shrunken
heads
mounted
on
plaques
on
the
wall
a
closer
look
showed
Harry
that
the
heads
belonged
to
house-elves
all
of
them
had
the
same
rather
snout-like
nose
harrys
bewilderment
deepened
with
every
step
he
took
what
on
earth
were
they
doing
in
a
house
that
looked
as
though
it
belonged
to
the
darkest
of
wizards
mrs
weasley
why
ron
and
Hermione
will
explain
everything
dear
Ive
really
got
to
dash
Mrs
weasley
whispered
distractedly
there
they
had
reached
the
second
landing
youre
the
door
on
the
right
ill
call
you
when
its
over
and
she
hurried
off
downstairs
again
harry
crossed
the
dingy
landing
turned
the
bedroom
doorknob
which
was
shaped
like
a
serpents
head
and
opened
the
door
he
caught
a
brief
glimpse
of
a
gloomy
high-ceilinged
twin-bedded
room
then
there
was
a
loud
twittering
noise
followed
by
an
even
louder
shriek
and
his
vision
was
completely
obscured
by
a
large
quantity
of
very
bushy
hair
hermione
had
thrown
herself
on
to
him
in
a
hug
that
nearly
knocked
him
flat
while
Rons
tiny
owl
Pigwidgeon
zoomed
excitedly
round
and
round
their
heads
harry
ron
hes
here
Harrys
here
we
didnt
hear
you
arrive
oh
how
are
you
are
you
all
right
have
you
been
furious
with
us
i
bet
you
have
I
know
our
letters
were
useless
but
we
couldnt
tell
you
anything
Dumbledore
made
us
swear
we
wouldnt
oh
weve
got
so
much
to
tell
you
and
youve
got
things
to
tell
us
the
Dementors
when
we
heard
and
that
Ministry
hearing
its
just
outrageous
Ive
looked
it
all
up
they
cant
expel
you
they
just
cant
theres
provision
in
the
Decree
for
the
Reasonable
Restriction
of
Underage
Sorcery
for
the
use
of
magic
in
life-threatening
situations
let
him
breathe
Hermione
said
Ron
grinning
as
he
closed
the
door
behind
Harry
he
seemed
to
have
grown
several
more
inches
during
their
month
apart
making
him
taller
and
more
gangly
looking
than
ever
though
the
long
nose
bright
red
hair
and
freckles
were
the
same
still
beaming
Hermione
let
go
of
Harry
but
before
she
could
say
another
word
there
was
a
soft
whooshing
sound
and
something
white
soared
from
the
top
of
a
dark
wardrobe
and
landed
gently
on
Harrys
shoulder
hedwig
the
snowy
owl
clicked
her
beak
and
nibbled
his
ear
affectionately
as
Harry
stroked
her
feathers
shes
been
in
a
right
state
said
Ron
pecked
us
half
to
death
when
she
brought
your
last
letters
look
at
this
he
showed
Harry
the
index
finger
of
his
right
hand
which
sported
a
half-healed
but
clearly
deep
cut
oh
yeah
Harry
said
sorry
about
that
but
I
wanted
answers
you
know
we
wanted
to
give
them
to
you
mate
said
Ron
hermione
was
going
spare
she
kept
saying
youd
do
something
stupid
if
you
were
stuck
all
on
your
own
without
news
but
Dumbledore
made
us
swear
not
to
tell
me
said
Harry
yeah
Hermiones
already
said
the
warm
glow
that
had
flared
inside
him
at
the
sight
of
his
two
best
friends
was
extinguished
as
something
icy
flooded
the
pit
of
his
stomach
all
of
a
sudden
after
yearning
to
see
them
for
a
solid
month
he
felt
he
would
rather
Ron
and
Hermione
left
him
alone
there
was
a
strained
silence
in
which
Harry
stroked
Hedwig
automatically
not
looking
at
either
of
the
others
he
seemed
to
think
it
was
best
said
Hermione
rather
breathlessly
dumbledore
I
mean
right
said
Harry
he
noticed
that
her
hands
too
bore
the
marks
of
Hedwigs
beak
and
found
that
he
was
not
at
all
sorry
i
think
he
thought
you
were
safest
with
the
Muggles
Ron
began
yeah
said
Harry
raising
his
eyebrows
have
either
of
you
been
attacked
by
Dementors
this
summer
well
no-but
thats
why
hes
had
people
from
the
Order
of
the
Phoenix
tailing
you
all
the
time
harry
felt
a
great
jolt
in
his
guts
as
though
he
had
just
missed
a
step
going
downstairs
so
everyone
had
known
he
was
being
followed
except
him
didnt
work
that
well
though
did
it
said
Harry
doing
his
utmost
to
keep
his
voice
even
had
to
look
after
myself
after
all
didnt
I
he
was
so
angry
said
Hermione
in
an
almost
awestruck
voice
dumbledore
we
saw
him
when
he
found
out
Mundungus
had
left
before
his
shift
had
ended
he
was
scary
well
Im
glad
he
left
Harry
said
coldly
if
he
hadnt
I
wouldnt
have
done
magic
and
dumbledore
would
probably
have
left
me
at
Privet
Drive
all
summer
arent
you
arent
you
worried
about
the
Ministry
of
Magic
hearing
said
Hermione
quietly
no
Harry
lied
defiantly
he
walked
away
from
them
looking
around
with
Hedwig
nestled
contentedly
on
his
shoulder
but
this
room
was
not
likely
to
raise
his
spirits
it
was
dank
and
dark
a
blank
stretch
of
canvas
in
an
ornate
picture
frame
was
all
that
relieved
the
bareness
of
the
peeling
walls
and
as
Harry
passed
it
he
thought
he
heard
someone
who
was
lurking
out
of
sight
snigger
so
whys
Dumbledore
been
so
keen
to
keep
me
in
the
dark
harry
asked
still
trying
hard
to
keep
his
voice
casual
did
you
er
bother
to
ask
him
at
all
he
glanced
up
just
in
time
to
see
them
exchanging
a
look
that
told
him
he
was
behaving
just
as
they
had
feared
he
would
it
did
nothing
to
improve
his
temper
we
told
Dumbledore
we
wanted
to
tell
you
what
was
going
on
said
Ron
we
did
mate
but
hes
really
busy
now
weve
only
seen
him
twice
since
we
came
here
and
he
didnt
have
much
time
he
just
made
us
swear
not
to
tell
you
important
stuff
when
we
wrote
he
said
the
owls
might
be
intercepted
he
could
stillve
kept
me
informed
if
hed
wanted
to
Harry
said
shortly
youre
not
telling
me
he
doesnt
know
ways
to
send
messages
without
owls
hermione
glanced
at
Ron
and
then
said
I
thought
that
too
but
he
didnt
want
you
to
know
anything
maybe
he
thinks
I
cant
be
trusted
said
Harry
watching
their
expressions
dont
be
thick
said
Ron
looking
highly
disconcerted
or
that
I
cant
take
care
of
myself
of
course
he
doesnt
think
that
said
Hermione
anxiously
so
how
come
I
have
to
stay
at
the
Dursleys
while
you
two
get
to
join
in
everything
thats
going
on
here
said
Harry
the
words
tumbling
over
one
another
in
a
rush
his
voice
growing
louder
with
every
word
how
come
you
two
are
allowed
to
know
everything
thats
going
on
were
not
ron
interrupted
mum
wont
let
us
near
the
meetings
she
says
were
too
young
but
before
he
knew
it
Harry
was
shouting
so
you
havent
been
in
the
meetings
big
deal
youve
still
been
here
havent
you
youve
still
been
together
me
ive
been
stuck
at
the
dursleys
for
A
month
and
ive
handled
more
than
you
twove
ever
managed
and
dumbledore
knows
it
who
saved
the
sorcerers
stone
who
got
rid
of
riddle
who
saved
both
your
skins
from
the
dementors
every
bitter
and
resentful
thought
Harry
had
had
in
the
past
month
was
pouring
out
of
him
his
frustration
at
the
lack
of
news
the
hurt
that
they
had
all
been
together
without
him
his
fury
at
being
followed
and
not
told
about
it
all
the
feelings
he
was
half-ashamed
of
finally
burst
their
boundaries
hedwig
took
fright
at
the
noise
and
soared
off
to
the
top
of
the
wardrobe
again
pigwidgeon
twittered
in
alarm
and
zoomed
even
faster
around
their
heads
who
had
to
get
past
dragons
and
sphinxes
and
every
other
foul
thing
last
year
who
saw
him
come
back
who
had
to
escape
from
him
me
ron
was
standing
there
with
his
mouth
half-open
clearly
stunned
and
at
a
loss
for
anything
to
say
while
Hermione
looked
on
the
verge
of
tears
but
why
should
I
know
whats
going
on
why
should
anyone
bother
to
tell
me
whats
been
happening
harry
we
wanted
to
tell
you
we
really
did
Hermione
began
cantve
wanted
to
that
much
can
you
or
youd
have
sent
me
an
owl
but
dumbledore
madeyou
swear
well
he
did
four
weeks
ive
been
stuck
in
privet
drive
nicking
papers
out
of
bins
to
try
and
find
out
whats
been
going
on
we
wanted
to
i
suppose
youve
been
having
A
real
laugh
havent
you
all
holed
up
here
together
no
honest
harry
were
really
sorry
said
Hermione
desperately
her
eyes
now
sparkling
with
tears
youre
absolutely
right
Harry
Id
be
furious
if
it
was
me
harry
glared
at
her
still
breathing
deeply
then
turned
away
from
them
again
pacing
up
and
down
hedwig
hooted
glumly
from
the
top
of
the
wardrobe
there
was
a
long
pause
broken
only
by
the
mournful
creak
of
the
floorboards
below
Harrys
feet
what
is
this
place
anyway
he
shot
at
Ron
and
Hermione
headquarters
of
the
Order
of
the
Phoenix
said
Ron
at
once
is
anyone
going
to
bother
telling
me
what
the
Order
of
the
Phoenix
its
a
secret
society
said
Hermione
quickly
dumbledores
in
charge
he
founded
it
its
the
people
who
fought
against
You-Know-Who
last
time
whos
in
it
said
Harry
coming
to
a
halt
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
quite
a
few
people
weve
met
about
twenty
of
them
said
Ron
but
we
think
there
are
more
harry
glared
at
them
well
he
demanded
looking
from
one
to
the
other
er
said
Ron
well
what
voldemort
said
Harry
furiously
and
both
Ron
and
Hermione
winced
whats
happening
whats
he
up
to
where
is
he
what
are
we
doing
to
stop
him
weve
told
you
the
Order
dont
let
us
in
on
their
meetings
said
Hermione
nervously
so
we
dont
know
the
details
but
weve
got
a
general
idea
she
added
hastily
seeing
the
look
on
harrys
face
fred
and
George
have
invented
Extendable
Ears
see
said
Ron
theyre
really
useful
extendable
ears
yeah
only
weve
had
to
stop
using
them
lately
because
Mum
found
out
and
went
berserk
fred
and
George
had
to
hide
them
all
to
stop
Mum
binning
them
but
we
got
a
good
bit
of
use
out
of
them
before
Mum
realized
what
was
going
on
we
know
some
of
the
Order
are
following
known
Death
Eaters
keeping
tabs
on
them
you
know
some
of
them
are
working
on
recruiting
more
people
to
the
Order
said
Hermione
and
some
of
them
are
standing
guard
over
something
said
Ron
theyre
always
talking
about
guard
duty
couldnt
have
been
me
could
it
said
Harry
sarcastically
oh
yeah
said
Ron
with
a
look
of
dawning
comprehension
harry
snorted
he
walked
around
the
room
again
looking
anywhere
but
at
Ron
and
Hermione
so
what
have
you
two
been
doing
if
youre
not
allowed
in
meetings
he
demanded
you
said
youd
been
busy
we
have
said
Hermione
quickly
weve
been
decontaminating
this
house
its
been
empty
for
ages
and
stuffs
been
breeding
in
here
weve
managed
to
clean
out
the
kitchen
most
of
the
bedrooms
and
I
think
were
doing
the
drawing
room
tomo
with
two
loud
cracks
Fred
and
George
Rons
elder
twin
brothers
had
materialized
out
of
thin
air
in
the
middle
of
the
room
pigwidgeon
twittered
more
wildly
than
ever
and
zoomed
off
to
join
hedwig
on
top
of
the
wardrobe
stop
doing
that
hermione
said
weakly
to
the
twins
who
were
as
vividly
red-haired
as
Ron
though
stockier
and
slightly
shorter
hello
Harry
said
George
beaming
at
him
we
thought
we
heard
your
dulcet
tones
you
dont
want
to
bottle
up
your
anger
like
that
Harry
let
it
all
out
said
Fred
also
beaming
there
might
be
a
couple
of
people
fifty
miles
away
who
didnt
hear
you
you
two
passed
your
Apparation
tests
then
asked
Harry
grumpily
with
distinction
said
Fred
who
was
holding
what
looked
like
a
piece
of
very
long
flesh
colored
string
it
would
have
taken
you
about
thirty
seconds
longer
to
walk
down
the
stairs
said
Ron
time
is
Galleons
little
brother
said
Fred
anyway
Harry
youre
interfering
with
reception
extendable
Ears
he
added
in
response
to
Harrys
raised
eyebrows
and
held
up
the
string
which
harry
now
saw
was
trailing
out
on
to
the
landing
were
trying
to
hear
whats
going
on
downstairs
you
want
to
be
careful
said
Ron
staring
at
the
Ear
if
Mum
sees
one
of
them
again
its
worth
the
risk
thats
a
major
meeting
theyre
having
said
Fred
the
door
opened
and
a
long
mane
of
red
hair
appeared
oh
hello
Harry
said
Rons
younger
sister
Ginny
brightly
i
thought
I
heard
your
voice
turning
to
Fred
and
George
she
said
Its
no-go
with
the
Extendable
Ears
shes
gone
and
put
an
Imperturbable
Charm
on
the
kitchen
door
how
dyou
know
said
George
looking
crestfallen
tonks
told
me
how
to
find
out
said
Ginny
you
just
chuck
stuff
at
the
door
and
if
it
cant
make
contact
the
doors
been
Imperturbed
ive
been
flicking
Dungbombs
at
it
from
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
they
just
soar
away
from
it
so
theres
no
way
the
Extendable
Ears
will
be
able
to
get
under
the
gap
fred
heaved
a
deep
sigh
shame
i
really
fancied
finding
out
what
old
Snapes
been
up
to
snape
said
Harry
quickly
is
he
here
yeah
said
George
carefully
closing
the
door
and
sitting
down
on
one
of
the
beds
Fred
and
ginny
followed
giving
a
report
top
secret
git
said
Fred
idly
hes
on
our
side
now
said
Hermione
reprovingly
ron
snorted
doesnt
stop
him
being
a
git
the
way
he
looks
at
us
when
he
sees
us
bill
doesnt
like
him
either
said
Ginny
as
though
that
settled
the
matter
harry
was
not
sure
his
anger
had
abated
yet
but
his
thirst
for
information
was
now
overcoming
his
urge
to
keep
shouting
he
sank
on
to
the
bed
opposite
the
others
is
Bill
here
he
asked
i
thought
he
was
working
in
Egypt
he
applied
for
a
desk
job
so
he
could
come
home
and
work
for
the
Order
said
Fred
he
says
he
misses
the
tombs
but
he
smirked
there
are
compensations
what
dyou
mean
remember
old
Fleur
Delacour
said
George
shes
got
a
job
at
Gringotts
to
eempwve
er
eeenglish
and
Bills
been
giving
her
a
lot
of
private
lessons
sniggered
Fred
charlies
in
the
Order
too
said
George
but
hes
still
in
Romania
dumbledore
wants
as
many
foreign
wizards
brought
in
as
possible
so
Charlies
trying
to
make
contacts
on
his
days
off
couldnt
Percy
do
that
harry
asked
the
last
he
had
heard
the
third
Weasley
brother
was
working
in
the
Department
of
International
Magical
co-operation
at
the
Ministry
of
Magic
at
Harrys
words
all
the
Weasleys
and
Hermione
exchanged
darkly
significant
looks
whatever
you
do
dont
mention
Percy
in
front
of
Mum
and
Dad
Ron
told
Harry
in
a
tense
voice
why
not
because
every
time
Percys
names
mentioned
Dad
breaks
whatever
hes
holding
and
Mum
starts
crying
Fred
said
its
been
awful
said
Ginny
sadly
i
think
were
well
shut
of
him
said
George
with
an
uncharacteristically
ugly
look
on
his
face
whats
happened
harry
said
percy
and
Dad
had
a
row
said
Fred
ive
never
seen
Dad
row
with
anyone
like
that
its
normally
Mum
who
shouts
it
was
the
first
week
back
after
term
ended
said
Ron
we
were
about
to
come
and
join
the
order
percy
came
home
and
told
us
hed
been
promoted
youre
kidding
said
Harry
though
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
Percy
was
highly
ambitious
Harrys
impression
was
that
percy
had
not
made
a
great
success
of
his
first
job
at
the
Ministry
of
Magic
percy
had
committed
the
fairly
large
oversight
of
failing
to
notice
that
his
boss
was
being
controlled
by
lord
Voldemort
not
that
the
Ministry
had
believed
it
they
all
thought
mr.
Crouch
had
gone
mad
yeah
we
were
all
surprised
said
George
because
Percy
got
into
a
load
of
trouble
about
crouch
there
was
an
inquiry
and
everything
they
said
Percy
ought
to
have
realized
Crouch
was
off
his
rocker
and
informed
a
superior
but
you
know
Percy
Crouch
left
him
in
charge
he
wasnt
going
to
complain
so
how
come
they
promoted
him
thats
exactly
what
we
wondered
said
Ron
who
see
med
very
keen
to
keep
normal
conversation
going
now
that
Harry
had
stopped
yelling
he
came
home
really
pleased
with
himself
even
more
pleased
than
usual
if
you
can
imagine
that
and
told
Dad
hed
been
offered
a
position
in
Fudges
own
office
a
really
good
one
for
someone
only
a
year
out
of
Hogwarts
junior
Assistant
to
the
Minister
he
expected
Dad
to
be
all
impressed
I
think
only
Dad
wasnt
said
Fred
grimly
why
not
said
Harry
well
apparently
Fudge
has
been
storming
round
the
Ministry
checking
that
nobodys
having
any
contact
with
Dumbledore
said
George
dumbledores
name
is
mud
with
the
Ministry
these
days
see
said
Fred
they
all
think
hes
just
making
trouble
saying
You-Know-Whos
back
dad
says
Fudge
has
made
it
clear
that
anyone
whos
in
league
with
Dumbledore
can
clear
out
their
desks
said
George
trouble
is
Fudge
suspects
Dad
he
knows
hes
friendly
with
Dumbledore
and
hes
always
thought
Dads
a
bit
of
a
weirdo
because
of
his
Muggle
obsession
but
whats
that
got
to
do
with
Percy
asked
Harry
confused
im
coming
to
that
dad
reckons
Fudge
only
wants
Percy
in
his
office
because
he
wants
to
use
him
to
spy
on
the
family
and
Dumbledore
harry
let
out
a
low
whistle
bet
Percy
loved
that
ron
laughed
in
a
hollow
sort
of
way
he
went
completely
berserk
he
said
well
he
said
loads
of
terrible
stuff
he
said
hes
been
having
to
struggle
against
Dads
lousy
reputation
ever
since
he
joined
the
Ministry
and
that
dads
got
no
ambition
and
thats
why
weve
always
been
you
know
not
had
a
lot
of
money
I
mean
what
said
Harry
in
disbelief
as
Ginny
made
a
noise
like
an
angry
cat
i
know
said
Ron
in
a
low
voice
and
it
got
worse
he
said
Dad
was
an
idiot
to
run
around
with
Dumbledore
that
Dumbledore
was
heading
for
big
trouble
and
Dad
was
going
to
go
down
with
him
and
that
he
Percy
knew
where
his
loyalty
lay
and
it
was
with
the
Ministry
and
if
mum
and
Dad
were
going
to
become
traitors
to
the
Ministry
he
was
going
to
make
sure
everyone
knew
he
didnt
belong
to
our
family
any
more
and
he
packed
his
bags
the
same
night
and
left
hes
living
here
in
London
now
harry
swore
under
his
breath
he
had
always
liked
Percy
least
of
Rons
brothers
but
he
had
never
imagined
he
would
say
such
things
to
mr.
Weasley
mums
been
in
a
right
state
said
Ron
dully
you
know
crying
and
stuff
she
came
up
to
london
to
try
and
talk
to
Percy
but
he
slammed
the
door
in
her
face
i
dunno
what
he
does
if
he
meets
Dad
at
work
ignores
him
I
spose
but
Percy
must
know
Voldemorts
back
said
Harry
s
lowly
hes
not
stupid
he
must
know
your
mum
and
dad
wouldnt
risk
everything
without
proof
yeah
well
your
name
got
dragged
into
the
row
said
Ron
shooting
Harry
a
furtive
look
percy
said
the
only
evidence
was
your
word
and
i
dunno
he
didnt
think
it
was
good
enough
percy
takes
the
Daily
Prophet
seriously
said
Hermione
tartly
and
the
others
all
nodded
what
are
you
talking
about
harry
asked
looking
around
at
them
all
they
were
all
regarding
him
warily
havent
havent
you
been
getting
the
Daily
Prophet
hermione
asked
nervously
yeah
I
have
said
Harry
have
you
er
been
reading
it
thoroughly
hermione
asked
still
more
anxiously
not
cover
to
cover
said
Harry
defensively
if
they
were
going
to
report
anything
about
voldemort
it
would
be
headline
news
wouldnt
it
the
others
flinched
at
the
sound
of
the
name
hermione
hurried
on
Well
youd
need
to
read
it
cover
to
cover
to
pick
it
up
but
they
um
they
mention
you
a
couple
of
times
a
week
but
Id
have
seen
not
if
youve
only
been
reading
the
front
page
you
wouldnt
said
Hermione
shaking
her
head
im
not
talking
about
big
articles
they
just
slip
you
in
like
youre
a
standing
joke
what
dyou
its
quite
nasty
actually
said
Hermione
in
a
voice
of
forced
calm
theyre
just
building
on
ritas
stuff
but
shes
not
writing
for
them
any
more
is
she
oh
no
shes
kept
her
promise
not
that
shes
got
any
choice
Hermione
added
with
satisfaction
but
she
laid
the
foundation
for
what
theyre
trying
to
do
now
which
is
what
said
Harry
impatiently
okay
you
know
she
wrote
that
you
were
collapsing
all
over
the
place
and
saying
your
scar
was
hurting
and
all
that
yeah
said
Harry
who
was
not
likely
to
forget
Rita
Skeeters
stories
about
him
in
a
hurry
well
theyre
writing
about
you
as
though
youre
this
deluded
attention-seeking
person
who
thinks
hes
a
great
tragic
hero
or
something
said
Hermione
very
fast
as
though
it
would
be
less
unpleasant
for
Harry
to
hear
these
facts
quickly
they
keep
slipping
in
snide
comments
about
you
if
some
far-fetched
story
appears
they
say
something
like
tale
worthy
of
Harry
Potter
and
if
anyone
has
a
funny
accident
or
anything
its
lets
hope
he
hasnt
got
a
scar
on
his
forehead
or
well
be
asked
to
worship
him
next
i
dont
want
anyone
to
worship
Harry
began
hotly
i
know
you
dont
said
Hermione
quickly
looking
frightened
i
know
Harry
but
you
see
what
theyre
doing
they
want
to
turn
you
into
someone
nobody
will
believe
fudge
is
behind
it
Ill
bet
anything
they
want
wizards
on
the
street
to
think
youre
just
some
stupid
boy
whos
a
bit
of
a
joke
who
tells
ridiculous
tall
stories
because
he
loves
being
famous
and
wants
to
keep
it
going
i
didnt
ask
I
didnt
want
Voldemort
killed
my
parents
harry
spluttered
i
got
famous
because
he
murdered
my
family
but
couldnt
kill
me
who
wants
to
be
famous
for
that
dont
they
think
Id
rather
itd
never
we
know
Harry
said
Ginny
earnestly
and
of
course
they
didnt
report
a
word
about
the
Dementors
attacking
you
said
Hermione
someones
told
them
to
keep
that
quiet
that
shouldve
been
a
really
big
story
out-of-control
dementors
they
havent
even
reported
that
you
broke
the
International
Statute
of
Secrecy
we
thought
they
would
it
would
tie
in
so
well
with
this
image
of
you
as
some
stupid
show-off
we
think
theyre
biding
their
time
until
youre
expelled
then
theyre
really
going
to
go
to
town
I
mean
if
youre
expelled
obviously
she
went
on
hastily
you
really
shouldnt
be
not
if
they
abide
by
their
own
laws
theres
no
case
against
you
they
were
back
on
the
hearing
and
Harry
did
not
want
to
think
about
that
he
cast
around
for
another
change
of
subject
but
was
saved
the
necessity
of
finding
one
by
the
sound
of
footsteps
coming
up
the
stairs
uh
oh
fred
gave
the
Extendable
Ear
a
hearty
tug
there
was
another
loud
crack
and
he
and
George
vanished
seconds
later
Mrs
weasley
appeared
in
the
bedroom
doorway
the
meetings
over
you
can
come
down
and
have
dinner
now
everyones
dying
to
see
you
harry
and
whos
left
all
those
Dungbombs
outside
the
kitchen
door
crookshanks
said
Ginny
unblushingly
he
loves
playing
with
them
oh
said
Mrs
weasley
I
thought
it
might
have
been
Kreacher
he
keeps
doing
odd
things
like
that
now
dont
forget
to
keep
your
voices
down
in
the
hall
ginny
your
hands
are
filthy
what
have
you
been
doing
go
and
wash
them
before
dinner
please
ginny
grimaced
at
the
others
and
followed
her
mother
out
of
the
room
leaving
Harry
alone
with
ron
and
Hermione
both
of
them
were
watching
him
apprehensively
as
though
they
feared
he
would
start
shouting
again
now
that
everyone
else
had
gone
the
sight
of
them
looking
so
nervous
made
him
feel
slightly
ashamed
look
he
muttered
but
Ron
shook
his
head
and
Hermione
said
quietly
We
knew
youd
be
angry
Harry
we
really
dont
blame
you
but
youve
got
to
understand
we
did
try
to
persuade
dumbledore
yeah
I
know
said
Harry
shortly
he
cast
around
for
a
topic
that
didnt
involve
his
headmaster
because
the
very
thought
of
dumbledore
made
Harrys
insides
burn
with
anger
again
whos
Kreacher
he
asked
the
house-elf
who
lives
here
said
Ron
nutter
never
met
one
like
him
hermione
frowned
at
Ron
hes
not
a
nutter
Ron
his
lifes
ambition
is
to
have
his
head
cut
off
and
stuck
up
on
a
plaque
just
like
his
mother
said
Ron
irritably
is
that
normal
Hermione
well
well
if
he
is
a
bit
strange
its
not
his
fault
ron
rolled
his
eyes
at
Harry
hermione
still
hasnt
given
up
on
spew
its
not
spew
said
Hermione
heatedly
its
the
Society
for
the
Promotion
of
Elfish
Welfare
and
its
not
just
me
Dumbledore
says
we
should
be
kind
to
Kreacher
too
yeah
yeah
said
Ron
cmon
Im
starving
he
led
the
way
out
of
the
door
and
on
to
the
landing
but
before
they
could
descend
the
stairs
hold
it
ron
breathed
flinging
out
an
arm
to
stop
Harry
and
Hermione
walking
any
further
theyre
still
in
the
hall
we
might
be
able
to
hear
something
the
three
of
them
looked
cautiously
over
the
banisters
the
gloomy
hallway
below
was
packed
with
witches
and
wizards
including
all
of
Harrys
guard
they
were
whispering
excitedly
together
in
the
very
center
of
the
group
Harry
saw
the
dark
greasy-haired
head
and
prominent
nose
of
his
least
favorite
teacher
at
Hogwarts
Professor
Snape
harry
leaned
further
over
the
banisters
he
was
very
interested
in
what
Snape
was
doing
for
the
Order
of
the
Phoenix
a
thin
piece
of
flesh-colored
string
descended
in
front
of
Harrys
eyes
looking
up
he
saw
Fred
and
George
on
the
landing
above
cautiously
lowering
the
Extendable
Ear
towards
the
dark
knot
of
people
below
a
moment
later
however
they
all
began
to
move
towards
the
front
door
and
out
of
sight
damnit
Harry
heard
Fred
whisper
as
he
hoisted
t
he
Extendable
Ear
back
up
again
they
heard
the
front
door
open
then
close
snape
never
eats
here
Ron
told
Harry
quietly
thank
God
cmon
and
dont
forget
to
keep
your
voice
down
in
the
hall
Harry
Hermione
whispered
as
they
passed
the
row
of
house-elf
heads
on
the
wall
they
saw
Lupin
Mrs
weasley
and
Tonks
at
the
front
door
magically
sealing
its
many
locks
and
bolts
behind
those
who
had
just
left
were
eating
down
in
the
kitchen
Mrs
weasley
whispered
meeting
them
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
harry
dear
if
youll
just
tiptoe
across
the
hall
its
through
this
door
here
crash
tonks
cried
Mrs
weasley
in
exasperation
turning
to
look
behind
her
im
sorry
wailed
Tonks
who
was
lying
flat
on
the
floor
its
that
stupid
umbrella
stand
thats
the
second
time
Ive
tripped
over
but
the
rest
of
her
words
were
drowned
by
a
horrible
ear-splitting
blood-curdling
screech
the
moth-eaten
velvet
curtains
Harry
had
passed
earlier
had
flown
apart
but
there
was
no
door
behind
them
for
a
split
second
Harry
thought
he
was
looking
through
a
window
a
window
behind
which
an
old
woman
in
a
black
cap
was
screaming
and
screaming
as
though
she
were
being
tortured
then
he
realized
it
was
simply
a
life-size
portrait
but
the
most
realiztic
and
the
most
unpleasant
he
had
ever
seen
in
his
life
the
old
woman
was
drooling
her
eyes
were
rolling
the
yellowing
skin
of
her
face
stretched
taut
as
she
screamed
and
all
along
the
hall
behind
them
the
other
portraits
awoke
and
began
to
yell
too
so
that
Harry
actually
screwed
up
his
eyes
at
the
noise
and
clapped
his
hands
over
his
ears
lupin
and
Mrs
weasley
darted
forward
and
tried
to
tug
the
curtains
shut
over
the
old
woman
but
they
would
not
close
and
she
screeched
louder
than
ever
brandishing
clawed
hands
as
though
trying
to
tear
at
their
faces
filth
scum
by-products
of
dirt
and
vileness
half-breeds
mutants
freaks
begone
from
this
place
how
dare
you
befoul
the
house
of
my
fathers
tonks
apologized
over
and
over
again
dragging
the
huge
heavy
trolls
leg
back
off
the
floor
mrs
weasley
abandoned
the
attempt
to
close
the
curtains
and
hurried
up
and
down
the
hall
stunning
all
the
other
portraits
with
her
wand
and
a
man
with
long
black
hair
came
charging
out
of
a
door
facing
Harry
shut
up
you
horrible
old
hag
shut
up
he
roared
seizing
the
curtain
Mrs
weasley
had
abandoned
the
old
womans
face
blanched
yoooou
she
howled
her
eyes
popping
at
the
sight
of
the
man
blood
traitor
abomination
shame
of
my
flesh
i
said
shut
up
roared
the
man
and
with
a
stupendous
effort
he
and
Lupin
managed
to
force
the
curtains
closed
again
the
old
womans
screeches
died
and
an
echoing
silence
fell
panting
slightly
and
sweeping
his
long
dark
hair
out
of
his
eyes
Harrys
godfather
Sirius
turned
to
face
him
hello
Harry
he
said
grimly
I
see
youve
met
my
mother
chapter
five
the
Order
of
the
Phoenix
your
my
dear
old
mum
yeah
said
Sirius
weve
been
trying
to
get
her
down
for
a
month
but
we
think
she
put
a
Permanent
Sticking
Charm
on
the
back
of
the
canvas
lets
get
downstairs
quick
before
they
all
wake
up
again
but
whats
a
portrait
of
your
mother
doing
here
harry
asked
bewildered
as
they
went
through
the
door
from
the
hall
and
led
the
way
down
a
flight
of
narrow
stone
steps
the
others
just
behind
them
hasnt
anyone
told
you
this
was
my
parents
house
said
Sirius
but
Im
the
last
Black
left
so
its
mine
now
i
offered
it
to
Dumbledore
for
Headquarters
about
the
only
useful
thing
Ive
been
able
to
do
harry
who
had
expected
a
better
welcome
noted
how
hard
and
bitter
Siriuss
voice
sounded
he
followed
his
godfather
to
the
bottom
of
the
steps
and
through
a
door
leading
into
the
basement
kitchen
it
was
scarcely
less
gloomy
than
the
hall
above
a
cavernous
room
with
rough
stone
walls
most
of
the
light
was
coming
from
a
large
fire
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
a
haze
of
pipe
smoke
hung
in
the
air
like
battle
fumes
through
which
loomed
the
menacing
shapes
of
heavy
iron
pots
and
pans
hanging
from
the
dark
ceiling
many
chairs
had
been
crammed
into
the
room
for
the
meeting
and
a
long
wooden
table
stood
in
the
middle
of
them
littered
with
rolls
of
parchment
goblets
empty
wine
bottles
and
a
heap
of
what
appeared
to
be
rags
mr.
Weasley
and
his
eldest
son
Bill
were
talking
quietly
with
their
heads
together
at
the
end
of
the
table
mrs
weasley
cleared
her
throat
her
husband
a
thin
balding
red-haired
man
who
wore
horn-rimmed
glasses
looked
around
and
jumped
to
his
feet
harry
mr.
Weasley
said
hurrying
forward
to
greet
him
and
shaking
his
hand
vigorously
good
to
see
you
over
his
shoulder
Harry
saw
Bill
who
still
wore
his
long
hair
in
a
ponytail
hastily
rolling
up
the
lengths
of
parchment
left
on
the
table
journey
all
right
Harry
bill
called
trying
to
gather
up
twelve
scrolls
at
once
mad-Eye
didnt
make
you
come
via
Greenland
then
he
tried
said
Tonks
striding
over
to
help
Bill
and
immediately
toppling
a
candle
on
to
the
last
piece
of
parchment
oh
no
sorry
here
dear
said
Mrs
weasley
sounding
exasperated
and
she
repaired
the
parchment
with
a
wave
of
her
wand
in
the
flash
of
light
caused
by
Mrs
weasleys
charm
Harry
caught
a
glimpse
of
what
looked
like
the
plan
of
a
building
mrs
weasley
had
seen
him
looking
she
snatched
the
plan
off
the
table
and
stuffed
it
into
Bills
already
overladen
arms
this
sort
of
thing
ought
to
be
cleared
away
promptly
at
the
end
of
meetings
she
snapped
before
sweeping
off
towards
an
ancient
dresser
from
which
she
started
unloading
dinner
plates
bill
took
out
his
wand
muttered
Evanesco
and
the
scrolls
vanished
sit
down
Harry
said
Sirius
youve
met
Mundungus
havent
you
the
thing
Harry
had
taken
to
be
a
pile
of
rags
gave
a
prolonged
grunting
snore
then
jerked
awake
somen
say
mname
mundungus
mumbled
sleepily
i
gree
with
Sirius
he
raised
a
very
grubby
hand
in
the
air
as
though
voting
his
droopy
bloodshot
eyes
unfocused
ginny
giggled
the
meetings
over
Dung
said
Sirius
as
they
all
sat
down
around
him
at
the
table
harrys
arrived

said
Mundungus
peering
balefully
at
Harry
through
his
matted
ginger
hair
blimey
so
e
as
yeah
you
all
right
Arry
yeah
said
Harry
mundungus
fumbled
nervously
in
his
pockets
still
staring
at
Harry
and
pulled
out
a
grimy
black
pipe
he
stuck
it
in
his
mouth
ignited
the
end
of
it
with
his
wand
and
took
a
deep
pull
on
it
great
billowing
clouds
of
greenish
smoke
obscured
him
within
seconds
owe
you
a
pology
grunted
a
voice
from
the
middle
of
the
smelly
cloud
for
the
last
time
Mundungus
called
Mrs
weasley
will
you
please
not
smoke
that
thing
in
the
kitchen
especially
not
when
were
about
to
eat
ah
said
Mundungus
right
sorry
Molly
the
cloud
of
smoke
vanished
as
Mundungus
stowed
his
pipe
back
in
his
pocket
but
an
acrid
smell
of
burning
socks
lingered
and
if
you
want
dinner
before
midnight
Ill
need
a
hand
Mrs
weasley
said
to
the
room
at
large
no
you
can
stay
where
you
are
Harry
dear
youve
had
a
long
journey
what
can
I
do
Molly
said
Tonks
enthusiastically
bounding
forwards
mrs
weasley
hesitated
looking
apprehensive
er
no
its
all
right
Tonks
you
have
a
rest
too
youve
done
enough
today
no
no
I
want
to
help
said
Tonks
brightly
knocking
over
a
chair
as
she
hurried
towards
the
dresser
from
which
Ginny
was
collecting
cutlery
soon
a
series
of
heavy
knives
were
chopping
meat
and
vegetables
of
their
own
accord
supervised
by
mr.
Weasley
while
Mrs
weasley
stirred
a
cauldron
dangling
over
the
fire
and
the
others
took
out
plates
more
goblets
and
food
from
the
pantry
harry
was
left
at
the
table
with
sirius
and
Mundungus
who
was
still
blinking
at
him
mournfully
seen
old
Figgy
since
he
asked
no
said
Harry
I
havent
seen
anyone
see
I
wouldnt
ave
left
said
Mundungus
leaning
forward
a
pleading
note
in
his
voice
but
I
ad
a
business
opportunity
harry
felt
something
brush
against
his
knees
and
started
but
it
was
only
Crookshanks
hermiones
bandy-legged
ginger
cat
who
wound
himself
once
around
Harrys
legs
purring
then
jumped
on
to
Siriuss
lap
and
curled
up
sirius
scratched
him
absent-mindedly
behind
the
ears
as
he
turned
still
grim-faced
to
Harry
had
a
good
summer
so
far
no
its
been
lousy
said
Harry
for
the
first
time
something
like
a
grin
flitted
across
Siriuss
face
dont
know
what
youre
complaining
about
myself
what
said
Harry
incredulously
personally
Id
have
welcomed
a
Dementor
attack
a
deadly
struggle
for
my
soul
would
have
broken
the
monotony
nicely
you
think
youve
had
it
bad
at
least
youve
been
able
to
get
out
and
about
stretch
your
legs
get
into
a
few
fights
ive
been
stuck
inside
for
a
month
how
come
asked
Harry
frowning
because
the
Ministry
of
Magics
still
after
me
and
Voldemort
will
know
all
about
me
being
an
animagus
by
now
Wormtail
will
have
told
him
so
my
big
disguise
is
useless
theres
not
much
i
can
do
for
the
Order
of
the
Phoenix
or
so
Dumbledore
feels
there
was
something
about
the
slightly
flattened
tone
of
voice
in
which
Sirius
uttered
dumbledores
name
that
told
Harry
that
Sirius
too
was
not
very
happy
with
the
Headmaster
harry
felt
a
sudden
upsurge
of
affection
for
his
godfather
at
least
youve
known
whats
been
going
on
he
said
bracingly
oh
yeah
said
Sirius
sarcastically
listening
to
Snapes
reports
having
to
take
all
his
snide
hints
that
hes
out
there
risking
his
life
while
Im
sat
on
my
backside
here
having
a
nice
comfortable
time
asking
me
how
the
cleanings
going
what
cleaning
asked
Harry
trying
to
make
this
place
fit
for
human
habitation
said
Sirius
waving
a
hand
around
the
dismal
kitchen
no
ones
lived
here
for
ten
years
not
since
my
dear
mother
died
unless
you
count
her
old
house-elf
and
hes
gone
round
the
twist
hasnt
cleaned
anything
in
ages
sirius
said
Mundungus
who
did
not
appear
to
have
paid
any
attention
to
the
conversation
but
had
been
closely
examining
an
empty
goblet
this
solid
silver
mate
yes
said
Sirius
surveying
it
with
distaste
finest
fifteenth-century
goblin-wrought
silver
embossed
with
the
Black
family
crest
thatd
come
off
though
muttered
Mundungus
polishing
it
with
his
cuff
fred
George
no
just
carry
them
mrs
weasley
shrieked
harry
Sirius
and
Mundungus
looked
round
and
a
split
second
later
they
had
dived
away
from
the
table
fred
and
George
had
bewitched
a
large
cauldron
of
stew
an
iron
flagon
of
Butterbeer
and
a
heavy
wooden
breadboard
complete
with
knife
to
hurtle
through
the
air
towards
them
the
stew
skidded
the
length
of
the
table
and
came
to
a
halt
just
before
the
end
leaving
a
long
black
burn
on
the
wooden
surface
the
flagon
of
Butterbeer
fell
with
a
crash
spilling
its
contents
everywhere
the
bread
knife
slipped
off
the
board
and
landed
point
down
and
quivering
ominously
exactly
where
Siriuss
right
hand
had
been
seconds
before
for
heavens
sake
screamed
Mrs
weasley
there
was
no
need
ive
had
enough
of
this
just
because
youre
allowed
to
use
magic
now
you
dont
have
to
whip
your
wands
out
for
every
tiny
little
thing
we
were
just
trying
to
save
a
bit
of
time
said
Fred
hurrying
forward
to
wrench
the
bread
knife
out
of
the
table
sorry
Sirius
mate
didnt
mean
to
harry
and
Sirius
were
both
laughing
Mundungus
who
had
toppled
backwards
off
his
chair
was
swearing
as
he
got
to
his
feet
Crookshanks
had
given
an
angry
hiss
and
shot
off
under
the
dresser
from
where
his
large
yellow
eyes
glowed
in
the
darkness
boys
mr.
Weasley
said
lifting
the
stew
back
into
the
middle
of
the
table
your
mothers
right
youre
supposed
to
show
a
sense
of
responsibility
now
youve
come
of
age
none
of
your
brothers
caused
this
sort
of
trouble
mrs
weasley
raged
at
the
twins
as
she
slammed
a
fresh
flagon
of
Butterbeer
on
to
the
table
and
spilling
almost
as
much
again
bill
didnt
feel
the
need
to
Apparate
every
few
feet
charlie
didnt
charm
everything
he
met
percy
she
stopped
dead
catching
her
breath
with
a
frightened
look
at
her
husband
whose
expression
was
suddenly
wooden
lets
eat
said
Bill
quickly
it
looks
wonderful
Molly
said
Lupin
ladling
stew
on
to
a
plate
for
her
and
handing
it
across
the
table
for
a
few
minutes
there
was
silence
but
for
the
chink
of
plates
and
cutlery
and
the
scraping
of
chairs
as
everyone
settled
down
to
their
food
then
Mrs
weasley
turned
to
Sirius
ive
been
meaning
to
tell
you
Sirius
theres
something
trapped
in
that
writing
desk
in
the
drawing
room
it
keeps
rattling
and
shaking
of
course
it
could
just
be
a
Boggart
but
I
thought
we
ought
to
ask
Alastor
to
have
a
look
at
it
before
we
let
it
out
whatever
you
like
said
Sirius
indifferently
the
curtains
in
there
are
full
of
Doxys
too
Mrs
weasley
went
on
i
thought
we
might
try
and
tackle
them
tomorrow
i
look
forward
to
it
said
Sirius
harry
heard
the
sarcasm
in
his
voice
but
he
was
not
sure
that
anyone
else
did
opposite
Harry
Tonks
was
entertaining
Hermione
and
Ginny
by
transforming
her
nose
between
mouthfuls
screwing
up
her
eyes
each
time
with
the
same
pained
expression
she
had
worn
back
in
Harrys
bedroom
her
nose
swelled
to
a
beak-like
protuberance
that
resembled
Snapes
shrank
to
the
size
of
a
button
mushroom
and
then
sprouted
a
great
deal
of
hair
from
each
nostril
apparently
this
was
a
regular
mealtime
entertainment
because
Hermione
and
Ginny
were
soon
requesting
their
favorite
noses
do
that
one
like
a
pig
snout
Tonks
tonks
obliged
and
Harry
looking
up
had
the
fleeting
impression
that
a
female
Dudley
was
grinning
at
him
from
across
the
table
mr.
Weasley
Bill
and
Lupin
were
having
an
intense
discussion
about
goblins
theyre
not
giving
anything
away
yet
said
Bill
i
still
cant
work
out
whether
or
not
they
believe
hes
back
course
they
might
prefer
not
to
take
sides
at
all
keep
out
of
it
im
sure
theyd
never
go
over
to
You-Know-Who
said
mr.
Weasley
shaking
his
head
theyve
suffered
losses
too
remember
that
goblin
family
he
murdered
last
time
somewhere
near
Nottingham
i
think
it
depends
what
theyre
offered
said
Lupin
and
Im
not
talking
about
gold
if
theyre
offered
the
freedoms
weve
been
denying
them
for
centuries
theyre
going
to
be
tempted
have
you
still
not
had
any
luck
with
Ragnok
Bill
hes
feeling
pretty
anti-wizard
at
the
moment
said
Bill
he
hasnt
stopped
raging
about
the
bagman
business
he
reckons
the
Ministry
did
a
cover-up
those
goblins
never
got
their
gold
from
him
you
know
a
gale
of
laughter
from
the
middle
of
the
table
drowned
the
rest
of
Bills
words
fred
George
ron
and
Mundungus
were
rolling
around
in
their
seats
and
then
choked
Mundungus
tears
running
down
his
face
and
then
if
youll
believe
it
e
says
to
me
e
says
Ere
Dung
where
did
ya
get
all
them
toads
from
cos
some
son
of
a
bludgers
gone
and
nicked
all
mine
and
I
says
Nicked
all
your
toads
Will
what
next
so
youll
be
wanting
some
more
then
and
if
youll
believe
me
lads
the
gormless
gargoyle
buys
all
is
own
toads
back
orf
me
for
a
lot
moren
what
e
paid
in
the
first
place
i
dont
think
we
need
to
hear
any
more
of
your
business
dealings
thank
you
very
much
mundungus
said
Mrs
weasley
sharply
as
Ron
slumped
forwards
on
to
the
table
howling
with
laughter
beg
pardon
Molly
said
Mundungus
at
once
wiping
his
eyes
and
winking
at
Harry
but
you
know
Will
nicked
em
orf
Warty
Harris
in
the
first
place
so
I
wasnt
really
doing
nothing
wrong
i
dont
know
where
you
learned
about
right
and
wrong
Mundungus
but
you
seem
to
have
missed
a
few
crucial
lessons
said
Mrs
weasley
coldly
fred
and
George
buried
their
faces
in
their
goblets
of
Butterbeer
George
was
hiccoughing
for
some
reason
Mrs
weasley
threw
a
very
nasty
look
at
Sirius
before
getting
to
her
feet
and
going
to
fetch
a
large
rhubarb
crumble
for
pudding
harry
looked
round
at
his
godfather
molly
doesnt
approve
of
Mundungus
said
Sirius
in
an
undertone
how
come
hes
in
the
Order
harry
said
very
quietly
hes
useful
Sirius
muttered
knows
all
the
crooks
well
he
would
seeing
as
hes
one
himself
but
hes
also
very
loyal
to
Dumbledore
who
helped
him
out
of
a
tight
spot
once
it
pays
to
have
someone
like
Dung
around
he
hears
things
we
dont
but
Molly
thinks
inviting
him
to
stay
for
dinner
is
going
too
far
she
hasnt
forgiven
him
for
slipping
off
duty
when
he
was
supposed
to
be
tailing
you
three
helpings
of
rhubarb
crumble
and
custard
later
and
the
waistband
on
Harrys
jeans
was
feeling
uncomfortably
tight
which
was
saying
something
as
the
jeans
had
once
been
Dudleys
as
he
laid
down
his
spoon
there
was
a
lull
in
the
general
conversation
mr.
Weasley
was
leaning
back
in
his
chair
looking
replete
and
relaxed
Tonks
was
yawning
widely
her
nose
now
back
to
normal
and
Ginny
who
had
lured
Crookshanks
out
from
under
the
dresser
was
sitting
cross-legged
on
the
floor
rolling
Butterbeer
corks
for
him
to
chase
nearly
time
for
bed
I
think
said
Mrs
weasley
with
a
yawn
not
just
yet
Molly
said
Sirius
pushing
away
his
empty
plate
and
turning
to
look
at
Harry
you
know
Im
surprised
at
you
i
thought
the
first
thing
youd
do
when
you
got
here
would
be
to
start
asking
questions
about
Voldemort
the
atmosphere
in
the
room
changed
with
the
rapidity
Harry
associated
with
the
arrival
of
dementors
where
seconds
before
it
had
been
sleepily
relaxed
it
was
now
alert
even
tense
frisson
had
gone
around
the
table
at
the
mention
of
Voldemorts
name
lupin
who
had
been
about
to
take
a
sip
of
wine
lowered
his
goblet
slowly
looking
wary
i
did
said
Harry
indignantly
i
asked
Ron
and
Hermione
but
they
said
were
not
allowed
in
the
Order
so
and
theyre
quite
right
said
Mrs
weasley
youre
too
young
she
was
sitting
bolt
upright
in
her
chair
her
fists
clenched
on
its
arms
every
trace
of
drowsiness
gone
since
when
did
someone
have
to
be
in
the
Order
of
the
Phoenix
to
ask
questions
asked
Sirius
harrys
been
trapped
in
that
Muggle
house
for
a
month
hes
got
the
right
to
know
whats
been
happen
hang
on
interrupted
George
loudly
how
come
Harry
gets
his
questions
answered
said
Fred
angrily
weve
been
trying
to
get
stuff
out
of
you
for
a
month
and
you
havent
told
us
a
single
stinking
thing
said
George
youre
too
young
youre
not
in
the
Order
said
Fred
in
a
high-pitched
voice
that
sounded
uncannily
like
his
mothers
harrys
not
even
of
age
its
not
my
fault
you
havent
been
told
what
the
Orders
doing
said
Sirius
calmly
thats
your
parents
decision
harry
on
the
other
hand
its
not
down
to
you
to
decide
whats
good
for
Harry
said
Mrs
weasley
sharply
the
expression
on
her
normally
kind
face
looked
dangerous
you
havent
forgotten
what
dumbledore
said
I
suppose
which
bit
sirius
asked
politely
but
with
the
air
of
a
man
readying
himself
for
a
fight
the
bit
about
not
telling
Harry
more
than
he
needs
to
know
said
Mrs
weasley
placing
a
heavy
emphasis
on
the
last
three
words
ron
Hermione
Fred
and
Georges
heads
swiveled
from
Sirius
to
Mrs
weasley
as
though
they
were
following
a
tennis
rally
ginny
was
kneeling
amid
a
pile
of
abandoned
Butterbeer
corks
watching
the
conversation
with
her
mouth
slightly
open
lupins
eyes
were
fixed
on
Sirius
i
dont
intend
to
tell
him
more
than
he
needs
to
know
Molly
said
Sirius
but
as
he
was
the
one
who
saw
Voldemort
come
back
again
there
was
a
collective
shudder
around
the
table
at
the
name
he
has
more
right
than
most
to
hes
not
a
member
of
the
Order
of
the
Phoenix
said
Mrs
weasley
hes
only
fifteen
and
and
hes
dealt
with
as
much
as
most
in
the
Order
said
Sirius
and
more
than
some
no
ones
denying
what
hes
done
said
Mrs
weasley
her
voice
rising
her
fists
trembling
on
the
arms
of
her
chair
but
hes
still
hes
not
a
child
said
Sirius
impatiently
hes
not
an
adult
either
said
Mrs
weasley
the
color
rising
in
her
cheeks
hes
not
James
sirius
im
perfectly
clear
who
he
is
thanks
Molly
said
Sirius
coldly
im
not
sure
you
are
said
Mrs
weasley
sometimes
the
way
you
talk
about
him
its
as
though
you
think
youve
got
your
best
friend
back
whats
wrong
with
that
said
Harry
whats
wrong
Harry
is
that
you
are
not
your
father
however
much
you
might
look
like
him
said
Mrs
weasley
her
eyes
still
boring
into
Sirius
you
are
still
at
school
and
adults
responsible
for
you
should
not
forget
it
meaning
Im
an
irresponsible
godfather
demanded
Sirius
his
voice
rising
meaning
you
have
been
known
to
act
rashly
Sirius
which
is
why
Dumbledore
keeps
reminding
you
to
stay
at
home
and
well
leave
my
instructions
from
Dumbledore
out
of
this
if
you
please
said
Sirius
loudly
arthur
said
Mrs
weasley
rounding
on
her
husband
arthur
back
me
up
mr.
Weasley
did
not
speak
at
once
he
took
off
his
glasses
and
cleaned
them
slowly
on
his
robes
not
looking
at
his
wife
only
when
he
had
replaced
them
carefully
on
his
nose
did
he
reply
dumbledore
knows
the
position
has
changed
Molly
he
accepts
that
Harry
will
have
to
be
filled
in
to
a
certain
extent
now
that
he
is
staying
at
Headquarters
yes
but
theres
a
difference
between
that
and
inviting
him
to
ask
whatever
he
likes
personally
said
Lupin
quietly
looking
away
from
Sirius
at
last
as
Mrs
weasley
turned
quickly
to
him
hopeful
that
finally
she
was
about
to
get
an
ally
I
think
it
better
that
Harry
gets
the
facts
not
all
the
facts
Molly
but
the
general
picture
from
us
rather
than
a
garbled
version
from
others
his
expression
was
mild
but
Harry
felt
sure
Lupin
at
least
knew
that
some
Extendable
Ears
had
survived
Mrs
weasleys
purge
well
said
Mrs
weasley
breathing
deeply
and
looking
around
the
table
for
support
that
did
not
come
well
i
can
see
Im
going
to
be
overruled
ill
just
say
this
Dumbledore
must
have
had
his
reasons
for
not
wanting
Harry
to
know
too
much
and
speaking
as
someone
who
has
Harrys
best
interests
at
heart
hes
not
your
son
said
Sirius
quietly
hes
as
good
as
said
Mrs
weasley
fiercely
who
else
has
he
got
hes
got
me
yes
said
Mrs
weasley
her
lip
curling
the
thing
is
its
been
rather
difficult
for
you
to
look
after
him
while
youve
been
locked
up
in
Azkaban
hasnt
it
sirius
started
to
rise
from
his
chair
molly
youre
not
the
only
person
at
this
table
who
cares
about
Harry
said
Lupin
sharply
sirius
sit
down
mrs
weasleys
lower
lip
was
trembling
sirius
sank
slowly
back
into
his
chair
his
face
white
i
think
Harry
ought
to
be
allowed
a
say
in
this
Lupin
continued
hes
old
enough
to
decide
for
himself
i
want
to
know
whats
been
going
on
Harry
said
at
once
he
did
not
look
at
Mrs
weasley
he
had
been
touched
by
what
she
had
said
about
his
being
as
good
as
a
son
but
he
was
also
impatient
with
her
mollycoddling
sirius
was
right
he
was
not
a
child
very
well
said
Mrs
weasley
her
voice
cracking
ginny
Ron
Hermione
Fred
George
I
want
you
out
of
this
kitchen
now
there
was
instant
uproar
were
of
age
fred
and
George
bellowed
together
if
Harrys
allowed
why
cant
I
shouted
Ron
mum
I
want
to
hear
wailed
Ginny
no
shouted
Mrs
weasley
standing
up
her
eyes
over
bright
i
absolutely
forbid
molly
you
cant
stop
Fred
and
George
said
mr.
Weasley
wearily
they
are
of
age
theyre
still
at
school
but
theyre
legally
adults
now
said
mr.
Weasley
in
the
same
tired
voice
mrs
weasley
was
now
scarlet
in
the
face
i
oh
all
right
then
Fred
and
George
can
stay
but
Ron
harryll
tell
me
and
Hermione
everything
you
say
anyway
said
Ron
hotly
wont
wont
you
he
added
uncertainly
meeting
Harrys
eyes
for
a
split
second
Harry
considered
telling
Ron
that
he
wouldnt
tell
him
a
single
word
that
he
could
try
a
taste
of
being
kept
in
the
dark
and
see
how
he
liked
it
but
the
nasty
impulse
vanished
as
they
looked
at
each
other
course
I
will
Harry
said
ron
and
Hermione
beamed
fine
shouted
Mrs
weasley
fine
ginny
bed
ginny
did
not
go
quietly
they
could
hear
her
raging
and
storming
at
her
mother
all
the
way
up
the
stairs
and
when
she
reached
the
hall
Mrs
blacks
ear-splitting
shrieks
were
added
to
the
din
lupin
hurried
off
to
the
portrait
to
restore
calm
it
was
only
after
he
had
returned
closing
the
kitchen
door
behind
him
and
taking
his
seat
at
the
table
again
that
Sirius
spoke
okay
Harry
what
do
you
want
to
know
harry
took
a
deep
breath
and
asked
the
question
that
had
obsessed
him
for
the
last
month
wheres
Voldemort
he
said
ignoring
the
renewed
shudders
and
winces
at
the
name
whats
he
doing
ive
been
trying
to
watch
the
Muggle
news
and
there
hasnt
been
anything
that
looks
like
him
yet
no
funny
deaths
or
anything
thats
because
there
havent
been
any
funny
deaths
yet
said
Sirius
not
as
far
as
we
know
anyway
and
we
know
quite
a
lot
more
than
he
thinks
we
do
anyway
said
Lupin
how
come
hes
stopped
killing
people
harry
asked
he
knew
Voldemort
had
murdered
more
than
once
in
the
last
year
alone
because
he
doesnt
want
to
draw
attention
to
himself
said
Sirius
it
would
be
dangerous
for
him
his
comeback
didnt
come
off
quite
the
way
he
wanted
it
to
you
see
he
messed
it
up
or
rather
you
messed
it
up
for
him
said
Lupin
with
a
satisfied
smile
how
harry
asked
perplexed
you
werent
supposed
to
survive
said
Sirius
nobody
apart
from
his
Death
Eaters
was
supposed
to
know
hed
come
back
but
you
survived
to
bear
witness
and
the
very
last
person
he
wanted
alerted
to
his
return
the
moment
he
got
back
was
dumbledore
said
Lupin
and
you
made
sure
Dumbledore
knew
at
once
how
has
that
helped
harry
asked
are
you
kidding
said
Bill
incredulously
dumbledore
was
the
only
one
You-Know-Who
was
ever
scared
of
thanks
to
you
Dumbledore
was
able
to
recall
the
Order
of
the
Phoenix
about
an
hour
after
voldemort
returned
said
Sirius
so
whats
the
Order
been
doing
said
Harry
looking
around
at
them
all
working
as
hard
as
we
can
to
make
sure
Voldemort
cant
carry
out
his
plans
said
Sirius
how
dyou
know
what
his
plans
are
harry
asked
quickly
dumbledores
got
a
shrewd
idea
said
Lupin
and
Dumbledores
shrewd
ideas
normally
turn
out
to
be
accurate
so
what
does
Dumbledore
reckon
hes
planning
well
firstly
he
wants
to
build
up
his
army
again
said
Sirius
in
the
old
days
he
had
huge
numbers
at
his
command
witches
and
wizards
hed
bullied
or
bewitched
into
following
him
his
faithful
Death
Eaters
a
great
variety
of
Dark
creatures
you
heard
him
planning
to
recruit
the
giants
well
theyll
be
just
one
of
the
groups
hes
after
hes
certainly
not
going
to
try
and
take
on
the
Ministry
of
Magic
with
only
a
dozen
Death
Eaters
so
youre
trying
to
stop
him
getting
more
followers
were
doing
our
best
said
Lupin
how
well
the
main
thing
is
to
try
and
convince
as
many
people
as
possible
that
You-Know-Who
really
has
returned
to
put
them
on
their
guard
said
Bill
its
proving
tricky
though
why
because
of
the
Ministrys
attitude
said
Tonks
you
saw
Cornelius
Fudge
after
You-Know
who
came
back
Harry
well
he
hasnt
shifted
his
position
at
all
hes
absolutely
refusing
to
believe
its
happened
but
why
said
Harry
desperately
whys
he
being
so
stupid
if
Dumbledore
ah
well
youve
put
your
finger
on
the
problem
said
mr.
Weasley
with
a
wry
smile
dumbledore
fudge
is
frightened
of
him
you
see
said
Tonks
sadly
frightened
of
Dumbledore
said
Harry
incredulously
frightened
of
what
hes
up
to
said
mr.
Weasley
fudge
thinks
Dumbledores
plotting
to
overthrow
him
he
thinks
Dumbledore
wants
to
be
Minister
for
Magic
but
Dumbledore
doesnt
want
of
course
he
doesnt
said
mr.
Weasley
hes
never
wanted
the
Ministers
job
even
though
a
lot
of
people
wanted
him
to
take
it
when
Millicent
Bagnold
retired
fudge
came
to
power
instead
but
hes
never
quite
forgotten
how
much
popular
support
Dumbledore
had
even
though
dumbledore
never
applied
for
the
job
deep
down
Fudge
knows
Dumbledores
much
cleverer
than
he
is
a
much
more
powerful
wizard
and
in
the
early
days
of
his
Ministry
he
was
forever
asking
Dumbledore
for
help
and
advice
said
Lupin
but
it
seems
hes
become
fond
of
power
and
much
more
confident
he
loves
being
Minister
for
Magic
and
hes
managed
to
convince
himself
that
hes
the
clever
one
and
Dumbledores
simply
stirring
up
trouble
for
the
sake
of
it
how
can
he
think
that
said
Harry
angrily
how
can
he
think
Dumbledore
would
just
make
it
all
up
that
Id
make
it
all
up
because
accepting
that
Voldemorts
back
would
mean
trouble
like
the
Ministry
hasnt
had
to
cope
with
for
nearly
fourteen
years
said
Sirius
bitterly
fudge
just
cant
bring
himself
to
face
it
its
so
much
more
comfortable
to
convince
himself
Dumbledores
lying
to
destabilize
him
you
see
the
problem
said
Lupin
while
the
Ministry
insists
there
is
nothing
to
fear
from
voldemort
its
hard
to
convince
people
hes
back
especially
as
they
really
dont
want
to
believe
it
in
the
first
place
whats
more
the
Ministrys
leaning
heavily
on
the
Daily
Prophet
not
to
report
any
of
what
theyre
calling
Dumbledores
rumor-mongering
so
most
of
the
wizarding
community
are
completely
unaware
any
things
happened
and
that
makes
them
easy
targets
for
the
Death
Eaters
if
theyre
using
the
Imperius
Curse
but
youre
telling
people
arent
you
said
Harry
looking
around
at
mr.
Weasley
Sirius
Bill
mundungus
Lupin
and
Tonks
youre
letting
people
know
hes
back
they
all
smiled
humorlessly
well
as
everyone
thinks
Im
a
mad
mass-murderer
and
the
Ministrys
put
a
ten
thousand
galleon
price
on
my
head
I
can
hardly
stroll
up
the
street
and
start
handing
out
leaflets
can
I
said
Sirius
restlessly
and
Im
not
a
very
popular
dinner
guest
with
most
of
the
community
said
Lupin
its
an
occupational
hazard
of
being
a
werewolf
tonks
and
Arthur
would
lose
their
jobs
at
the
Ministry
if
they
started
shooting
their
mouths
off
said
Sirius
and
its
very
important
for
us
to
have
spies
inside
the
Ministry
because
you
can
bet
Voldemort
will
have
them
weve
managed
to
convince
a
couple
of
people
though
said
mr.
Weasley
Tonks
here
for
one
shes
too
young
to
have
been
in
the
Order
of
the
Phoenix
last
time
and
having
Aurors
on
our
side
is
a
huge
advantage
Kingsley
Shacklebolts
been
a
real
asset
too
hes
in
charge
of
the
hunt
for
Sirius
so
hes
been
feeding
the
Ministry
information
that
Sirius
is
in
Tibet
but
if
none
of
you
are
putting
the
news
out
that
Voldemorts
back
Harry
began
who
said
none
of
us
are
putting
the
news
out
said
Sirius
why
dyou
think
Dumbledores
in
such
trouble
what
dyou
mean
harry
asked
theyre
trying
to
discredit
him
said
Lupin
didnt
you
see
the
Daily
Prophet
last
week
they
reported
that
hed
been
voted
out
of
the
Chairmanship
of
the
International
Confederation
of
wizards
because
hes
getting
old
and
losing
his
grip
but
its
not
true
he
was
voted
out
by
ministry
wizards
after
he
made
a
speech
announcing
Voldemorts
return
theyve
demoted
him
from
Chief
Warlock
on
the
Wizengamot
thats
the
Wizard
High
Court
and
theyre
talking
about
taking
away
his
Order
of
Merlin
First
Class
too
but
Dumbledore
says
he
doesnt
care
what
they
do
as
long
as
they
dont
take
him
off
the
chocolate
Frog
Cards
said
Bill
grinning
its
no
laughing
matter
said
mr.
Weasley
sharply
if
he
carries
on
defying
the
Ministry
like
this
he
could
end
up
in
Azkaban
and
the
last
thing
we
want
is
to
have
Dumbledore
locked
up
while
You-Know-Who
knows
Dumbledores
out
there
and
wise
to
what
hes
up
to
hes
going
to
go
cautiously
if
Dumbledores
out
of
the
way
well
You-Know-Who
will
have
a
clear
field
but
if
Voldemorts
trying
to
recruit
more
Death
Eaters
its
bound
to
get
out
that
hes
come
back
isnt
it
asked
Harry
desperately
voldemort
doesnt
march
up
to
peoples
houses
and
bang
on
their
front
doors
Harry
said
sirius
he
tricks
jinxes
and
blackmails
them
hes
well-practiced
at
operating
in
secret
in
any
case
gathering
followers
is
only
one
thing
hes
interested
in
hes
got
other
plans
too
plans
he
can
put
into
operation
very
quietly
indeed
and
hes
concentrating
on
those
for
the
moment
whats
he
after
apart
from
followers
harry
asked
swiftly
he
thought
he
saw
Sirius
and
Lupin
exchange
the
most
fleeting
of
looks
before
Sirius
answered
stuff
he
can
only
get
by
stealth
when
Harry
continued
to
look
puzzled
Sirius
said
Like
a
weapon
something
he
didnt
have
last
time
when
he
was
powerful
before
yes
like
what
kind
of
weapon
said
Harry
something
worse
than
the
Avada
Kedavra
thats
enough
mrs
weasley
spoke
from
the
shadows
beside
the
door
harry
hadnt
noticed
her
return
from
taking
Ginny
upstairs
her
arms
were
crossed
and
she
looked
furious
i
want
you
in
bed
now
all
of
you
she
added
looking
around
at
Fred
George
Ron
and
hermione
you
cant
boss
us
Fred
began
watch
me
snarled
Mrs
weasley
she
was
trembling
slightly
as
she
looked
at
Sirius
youve
given
Harry
plenty
of
information
any
more
and
you
might
just
as
well
induct
him
into
the
order
straightaway
why
not
said
Harry
quickly
ill
join
I
want
to
join
I
want
to
fight
no
it
was
not
Mrs
weasley
who
spoke
this
time
but
Lupin
the
Order
is
comprised
only
of
overage
wizards
he
said
wizards
who
have
left
school
he
added
as
Fred
and
George
opened
their
mouths
there
are
dangers
involved
of
which
you
can
have
no
idea
any
of
you
i
think
Mollys
right
Sirius
weve
said
enough
sirius
half-shrugged
but
did
not
argue
mrs
weasley
beckoned
imperiously
to
her
sons
and
hermione
one
by
one
they
stood
up
and
Harry
recognizing
defeat
followed
suit
chapter
six
the
Noble
and
Most
Ancient
House
of
Black
mrs
weasley
followed
them
upstairs
looking
grim
i
want
you
all
to
go
straight
to
bed
no
talking
she
said
as
they
reached
the
first
landing
weve
got
a
busy
day
tomorrow
i
expect
Ginnys
asleep
she
added
to
Hermione
so
try
not
to
wake
her
up
asleep
yeah
right
said
Fred
in
an
undertone
after
Hermione
bade
them
goodnight
and
they
were
climbing
to
the
next
floor
if
Ginnys
not
lying
awake
waiting
for
Hermione
to
tell
her
everything
they
said
downstairs
then
Im
a
Flobberworm
all
right
Ron
Harry
said
Mrs
weasley
on
the
second
landing
pointing
them
into
their
bedroom
off
to
bed
with
you
night
Harry
and
Ron
said
to
the
twins
sleep
tight
said
Fred
winking
mrs
weasley
closed
the
door
behind
Harry
with
a
sharp
snap
the
bedroom
looked
if
anything
even
danker
and
gloomier
than
it
had
on
first
sight
the
blank
picture
on
the
wall
was
now
breathing
very
slowly
and
deeply
as
though
its
invisible
occupant
was
asleep
harry
put
on
his
pajamas
took
off
his
glasses
and
climbed
into
his
chilly
bed
while
Ron
threw
Owl
Treats
up
on
top
of
the
wardrobe
to
pacify
Hedwig
and
Pigwidgeon
who
were
clattering
around
and
rustling
their
wings
restlessly
we
cant
let
them
out
to
hunt
every
night
Ron
explained
as
he
pulled
on
his
maroon
pajamas
dumbledore
doesnt
want
too
many
owls
swooping
around
the
square
thinks
itll
look
suspicious
oh
yeah
i
forgot
he
crossed
to
the
door
and
bolted
it
whatre
you
doing
that
for
kreacher
said
Ron
as
he
turned
off
the
light
first
night
I
was
here
he
came
wandering
in
at
three
in
the
morning
trust
me
you
dont
want
to
wake
up
and
find
him
prowling
around
your
room
anyway
he
got
into
his
bed
settled
down
under
the
covers
then
turned
to
look
at
Harry
in
the
darkness
Harry
could
see
his
outline
by
the
moonlight
filtering
in
through
the
grimy
window
what
dyou
reckon
harry
didnt
need
to
ask
what
Ron
meant
well
they
didnt
tell
us
much
we
couldnt
have
guessed
did
they
he
said
thinking
of
all
that
had
been
said
downstairs
i
mean
all
theyve
really
said
is
that
the
Orders
trying
to
stop
people
joining
Vol
there
was
a
sharp
intake
of
breath
from
Ron
demort
said
Harry
firmly
when
are
you
going
to
start
using
his
name
sirius
and
Lupin
do
ron
ignored
this
last
comment
yeah
youre
right
he
said
we
already
knew
nearly
everything
they
told
us
from
using
the
extendable
Ears
the
only
new
bit
was
crack
ouch
keep
your
voice
down
Ron
or
Mumll
be
back
up
he
re
you
two
just
Apparated
on
my
knees
yeah
well
its
harder
in
the
dark
harry
saw
the
blurred
outlines
of
Fred
and
George
leaping
down
from
Rons
bed
there
was
a
groan
of
bedsprings
and
Harrys
mattress
descended
a
few
inches
as
George
sat
down
near
his
feet
so
got
there
yet
said
George
eagerly
the
weapon
Sirius
mentioned
said
Harry
let
slip
more
like
said
Fred
with
relish
now
sitting
next
to
Ron
we
didnt
hear
about
that
on
the
old
Extendables
did
we
what
dyou
reckon
it
is
said
Harry
could
be
anything
said
Fred
but
there
cant
be
anything
worse
than
the
Avada
Kedavra
Curse
can
there
said
Ron
whats
worse
than
death
maybe
its
something
that
can
kill
loads
of
people
at
once
suggested
George
maybe
its
some
particularly
painful
way
of
killing
people
said
Ron
fearfully
hes
got
the
Cruciatus
Curse
for
causing
pain
said
Harry
he
doesnt
need
anything
more
efficient
than
that
there
was
a
pause
and
Harry
knew
that
the
others
like
him
were
wondering
what
horrors
this
weapon
could
perpetrate
so
who
dyou
thinks
got
it
now
asked
George
i
hope
its
our
side
said
Ron
sounding
slightly
nervous
if
it
is
Dumbledores
probably
keeping
it
said
Fred
where
said
Ron
quickly
hogwarts
bet
it
is
said
George
thats
where
he
hid
the
Sorcerers
Stone
a
weapons
going
to
be
a
lot
bigger
than
the
Stone
though
said
Ron
not
necessarily
said
Fred
yeah
size
is
no
guarantee
of
power
said
George
look
at
Ginny
what
dyou
mean
said
Harry
youve
never
been
on
the
receiving
end
of
one
of
her
Bat-Bogey
Hexes
have
you
shh
said
Fred
half-rising
from
the
bed
listen
they
fell
silent
footsteps
were
coming
up
the
stairs
mum
said
George
and
without
further
ado
there
was
a
loud
crack
and
Harry
felt
the
weight
vanish
from
the
end
of
his
bed
a
few
seconds
later
they
heard
the
floorboard
creak
outside
their
door
Mrs
weasley
was
plainly
listening
to
check
whether
or
not
they
were
talking
hedwig
and
Pigwidgeon
hooted
dolefully
the
floorboard
creaked
again
and
they
heard
her
heading
upstairs
to
check
on
Fred
and
George
she
doesnt
trust
us
at
all
you
know
said
Ron
regretfully
harry
was
sure
he
would
not
be
able
to
fall
asleep
the
evening
had
been
so
packed
with
things
to
think
about
that
he
fully
expected
to
lie
awake
for
hours
mulling
it
all
over
he
wanted
to
continue
talking
to
Ron
but
Mrs
weasley
was
now
creaking
back
downstairs
again
and
once
she
had
gone
he
distinctly
heard
others
making
their
way
upstairs
in
fact
many-legged
creatures
were
cantering
softly
up
and
down
outside
the
bedroom
door
and
Hagrid
the
Care
of
magical
Creatures
teacher
was
saying
Beauties
arn
they
eh
Harry
well
be
studyin
weapons
this
term
and
Harry
saw
that
the
creatures
had
cannons
for
heads
and
were
wheeling
to
face
him
he
ducked
the
next
thing
he
knew
he
was
curled
into
a
warm
ball
under
his
bedclothes
and
Georges
loud
voice
was
filling
the
room
mum
says
get
up
your
breakfast
is
in
the
kitchen
and
then
she
needs
you
in
the
drawing
room
there
are
loads
more
Doxys
than
she
thought
and
shes
found
a
nest
of
dead
Puffskeins
under
the
sofa
half
an
hour
later
Harry
and
Ron
who
had
dressed
and
breakfasted
quickly
entered
the
drawing
room
a
long
high-ceilinged
room
on
the
first
floor
with
olive
green
walls
covered
in
dirty
tapestries
the
carpet
exhaled
little
clouds
of
dust
every
time
someone
put
their
foot
on
it
and
the
long
moss
green
velvet
curtains
were
buzzing
as
though
swarming
with
invisible
bees
it
was
around
these
that
Mrs
weasley
Hermione
Ginny
Fred
and
George
were
grouped
all
looking
rather
peculiar
as
they
had
each
tied
a
cloth
over
their
nose
and
mouth
each
of
them
was
also
holding
a
large
bottle
of
black
liquid
with
anozzle
at
the
end
cover
your
faces
and
take
a
spray
Mrs
weasley
said
to
Harry
and
Ron
the
moment
she
saw
them
pointing
to
two
more
bottles
of
black
liquid
standing
on
a
spindle-legged
table
its
doxycide
ive
never
seen
an
infestation
this
bad
what
that
house-elfs
been
doing
for
the
last
ten
years
hermiones
face
was
half
concealed
by
a
tea
towel
but
Harry
distinctly
saw
her
throw
a
reproachful
look
at
Mrs
weasley
kreachers
really
old
he
probably
couldnt
manage
youd
be
surprised
what
Kreacher
can
manage
when
he
wants
to
Hermione
said
Sirius
who
had
just
entered
the
room
carrying
a
bloodstained
bag
of
what
appeared
to
be
dead
rats
ive
just
been
feeding
Buckbeak
he
added
in
reply
to
Harry
s
enquiring
look
i
keep
him
upstairs
in
my
mothers
bedroom
anyway
this
writing
desk
he
dropped
the
bag
of
rats
into
an
armchair
then
bent
over
to
examine
the
locked
cabinet
which
harry
now
noticed
for
the
first
time
was
shaking
slightly
well
Molly
Im
pretty
sure
this
is
a
Boggart
said
Sirius
peering
through
the
keyhole
but
perhaps
we
ought
to
let
Mad-Eye
have
a
shifty
at
it
before
we
let
it
out
knowing
my
mother
it
could
be
something
much
worse
right
you
are
Sirius
said
Mrs
weasley
they
were
both
speaking
in
carefully
light
polite
voices
that
told
Harry
quite
plainly
that
neither
had
forgotten
their
disagreement
of
the
night
before
a
loud
clanging
bell
sounded
from
downstairs
followed
at
once
by
the
cacophony
of
screams
and
wails
that
had
been
triggered
the
previous
night
by
Tonks
knocking
over
the
umbrella
stand
i
keep
telling
them
not
to
ring
the
doorbell
said
Sirius
exasperatedly
hurrying
out
of
the
room
they
heard
him
thundering
down
the
stairs
as
Mrs
blacks
screeches
echoed
up
through
the
house
once
more
stains
of
dishonor
filthy
half-breeds
blood
traitors
children
of
filth
close
the
door
please
Harry
said
Mrs
weasley
harry
took
as
much
time
as
he
dared
to
close
the
drawing-room
door
he
wanted
to
listen
to
what
was
going
on
downstairs
sirius
had
obviously
managed
to
shut
the
curtains
over
his
mothers
portrait
because
she
had
stopped
screaming
he
heard
Sirius
walking
down
the
hall
then
the
clattering
of
the
chain
on
the
front
door
and
then
a
deep
voice
he
recognized
as
Kingsley
shacklebolts
saying
Hestias
just
relieved
me
so
shes
got
Moodys
Cloak
now
thought
Id
leave
a
report
for
Dumbledore
feeling
Mrs
weasleys
eyes
on
the
back
of
his
head
Harry
regretfully
closed
the
drawing-room
door
and
rejoined
the
Doxy
party
mrs
weasley
was
bending
over
to
check
the
page
on
Doxys
in
Gilderoy
Lockharts
Guide
to
household
Pests
which
was
lying
open
on
the
sofa
right
you
lot
you
need
to
be
careful
because
Doxys
bite
and
their
teeth
are
poisonous
ive
got
a
bottle
of
antidote
here
but
Id
rather
nobody
needed
it
she
straightened
up
positioned
herself
squarely
in
front
of
the
curtains
and
beckoned
them
all
forward
when
I
say
the
word
start
spraying
immediately
she
said
theyll
come
flying
out
at
us
I
expect
but
it
says
on
the
sprays
one
good
squirt
will
paralyze
them
when
theyre
immobilized
just
throw
them
in
this
bucket
she
stepped
carefully
out
of
their
line
of
fire
and
raised
her
own
spray
all
right
squirt
harry
had
been
spraying
only
a
few
seconds
when
a
fully-grown
Doxy
came
soaring
out
of
a
fold
in
the
material
shiny
beetle-like
wings
whirring
tiny
needle-sharp
teeth
bared
its
fairy-like
body
covered
with
thick
black
hair
and
its
four
tiny
fists
clenched
with
fury
harry
caught
it
full
in
the
face
with
a
blast
of
Doxycide
it
froze
in
midair
and
fell
with
a
surprisingly
loud
hunk
on
to
the
worn
carpet
below
harry
picked
it
up
and
threw
it
in
the
bucket
fred
what
are
you
doing
said
Mrs
weasley
sharply
spray
that
at
once
and
throw
it
away
harry
looked
round
fred
was
holding
a
struggling
Doxy
between
his
forefinger
and
thumb
right-o
Fred
said
brightly
spraying
the
Doxy
quickly
in
the
face
so
that
it
fainted
but
the
moment
Mrs
weasleys
back
was
turned
he
pocketed
it
with
a
wink
we
want
to
experiment
with
Doxy
venom
for
our
Skiving
Snackboxes
George
told
Harry
under
his
breath
deftly
spraying
two
Doxys
at
once
as
they
soared
straight
for
his
nose
Harry
moved
closer
to
george
and
muttered
out
of
the
corner
of
his
mouth
What
are
Skiving
Snackboxes
range
of
sweets
to
make
you
ill
George
whispered
keeping
a
wary
eye
on
Mrs
weasleys
back
not
seriously
ill
mind
just
ill
enough
to
get
you
out
of
a
class
when
you
feel
like
it
fred
and
I
have
been
developing
them
this
summer
theyre
double-ended
color-coded
chews
if
you
eat
the
orange
half
of
the
Puking
Pastilles
you
throw
up
moment
youve
been
rushed
out
of
the
lesson
for
the
hospital
wing
you
swallow
the
purple
half
which
restores
you
to
full
fitness
enabling
you
to
pursue
the
leisure
activity
of
your
own
choice
during
an
hour
that
would
otherwise
have
been
devoted
to
unprofitable
boredom
thats
what
were
putting
in
the
adverts
anyway
whispered
Fred
who
had
edged
over
out
of
Mrs
weasleys
line
of
vision
and
was
now
sweeping
a
few
stray
Doxys
from
the
floor
and
adding
them
to
his
pocket
but
they
still
need
a
bit
of
work
at
the
moment
our
testers
are
having
a
bit
of
trouble
stopping
puking
long
enough
to
swallow
the
purple
end
testers
us
said
Fred
we
take
it
in
turns
george
did
the
Fainting
Fancies
we
both
tried
the
nosebleed
Nougat
mum
thought
wed
been
dueling
said
George
joke
shop
still
on
then
harry
muttered
pretending
to
be
adjusting
the
nozzle
on
his
spray
well
we
havent
had
a
chance
to
get
premises
yet
said
Fred
dropping
his
voice
even
lower
as
mrs
weasley
mopped
her
brow
with
her
scarf
before
returning
to
the
attack
so
were
running
it
as
a
mail-order
service
at
the
moment
we
put
advertisements
in
the
Daily
Prophet
last
week
all
thanks
to
you
mate
said
George
but
dont
worry
mum
hasnt
got
a
clue
she
wont
read
the
Daily
Prophet
any
more
cause
of
it
telling
lies
about
you
and
Dumbledore
harry
grinned
he
had
forced
the
Weasley
twins
to
take
the
thousand
Galleons
prize
money
he
had
won
in
the
Triwizard
Tournament
to
help
them
realize
their
ambition
to
open
a
joke
shop
but
he
was
still
glad
to
know
that
his
part
in
furthering
their
plans
was
unknown
to
Mrs
weasley
she
did
not
think
running
a
joke
shop
was
a
suitable
career
for
two
of
her
sons
the
de-Doxying
of
the
curtains
took
most
of
the
morning
it
was
past
midday
when
Mrs
weasley
finally
removed
her
protective
scarf
sank
into
a
sagging
armchair
and
sprang
up
again
with
a
cry
of
disgust
having
sat
on
the
bag
of
dead
rats
the
curtains
were
no
longer
buzzing
they
hung
limp
and
damp
from
the
intensive
spraying
at
the
foot
of
them
unconscious
Doxys
lay
crammed
in
the
bucket
beside
a
bowl
of
their
black
eggs
at
which
Crookshanks
was
now
sniffing
and
Fred
and
George
were
shooting
covetous
looks
i
think
well
tackle
those
after
lunch
mrs
weasley
pointed
at
the
dusty
glass-fronted
cabinets
standing
on
either
side
of
the
mantelpiece
they
were
crammed
with
an
odd
assortment
of
objects
a
selection
of
rusty
daggers
claws
a
coiled
snakeskin
a
number
of
tarnished
silver
boxes
inscribed
with
languages
Harry
could
not
understand
and
least
pleasant
of
all
an
ornate
crystal
bottle
with
a
large
opal
set
into
the
stopper
full
of
what
Harry
was
quite
sure
was
blood
the
clanging
doorbell
rang
again
everyone
looked
at
Mrs
weasley
stay
here
she
said
firmly
snatching
up
the
bag
of
rats
as
Mrs
blacks
screeches
started
up
again
from
down
below
ill
bring
up
some
sandwiches
she
left
the
room
closing
the
door
carefully
behind
her
at
once
everyone
dashed
over
to
the
window
to
look
down
on
the
doorstep
they
could
see
the
top
of
an
unkempt
gingery
head
and
a
stack
of
precariously
balanced
cauldrons
mundungus
said
Hermione
whats
he
brought
all
those
cauldrons
for
probably
looking
for
a
safe
place
to
keep
them
said
Harry
isnt
that
what
he
was
doing
the
night
he
was
supposed
to
be
tailing
me
picking
up
dodgy
cauldrons
yeah
youre
right
said
Fred
as
the
front
door
opened
Mundungus
heaved
his
cauldrons
through
it
and
disappeared
from
view
blimey
Mum
wont
like
that
he
and
George
crossed
to
the
door
and
stood
beside
it
listening
closely
mrs
blacks
screaming
had
stopped
mundungus
is
talking
to
Sirius
and
Kingsley
Fred
muttered
frowning
with
concentration
cant
hear
properly
dyou
reckon
we
can
risk
the
Extendable
Ears
might
be
worth
it
said
George
i
could
sneak
up
stairs
and
get
a
pair
but
at
that
precise
moment
there
was
an
explosion
of
sound
from
downstairs
that
rendered
extendable
Ears
quite
unnecessary
all
of
them
could
hear
exactly
what
Mrs
weasley
was
shouting
at
the
top
of
her
voice
we
are
not
running
A
hideout
for
stolen
goods
i
love
hearing
Mum
shouting
at
someone
else
said
Fred
with
a
satisfied
smile
on
his
face
as
he
opened
the
door
an
inch
or
so
to
allow
Mrs
weasleys
voice
to
permeate
the
room
better
it
makes
such
a
nice
change
completely
irresponsible
as
if
we
havent
got
enough
to
worry
about
without
you
dragging
stolen
cauldrons
into
the
house
the
idiots
are
letting
her
get
into
her
stride
said
George
shaking
his
head
youve
got
to
head
her
off
early
otherwise
she
builds
up
a
head
of
steam
and
goes
on
for
hours
and
shes
been
dying
to
have
a
go
at
Mundungus
ever
since
he
sneaked
off
when
he
was
supposed
to
be
following
you
Harry
and
there
goes
Siriuss
mum
again
mrs
weasleys
voice
was
lost
amid
fresh
shrieks
and
screams
from
the
portraits
in
the
hall
george
made
to
shut
the
door
to
drown
the
noise
but
before
he
could
do
so
a
house-elf
edged
into
the
room
except
for
the
filthy
rag
tied
like
a
loincloth
around
its
middle
it
was
completely
naked
it
looked
very
old
its
skin
seemed
to
be
several
times
too
big
for
it
and
though
it
was
bald
like
all
house-elves
there
was
a
quantity
of
white
hair
growing
out
of
its
large
batlike
ears
its
eyes
were
a
bloodshot
and
watery
grey
and
its
fleshy
nose
was
large
and
rather
snoutlike
the
elf
took
absolutely
no
notice
of
Harry
and
the
rest
acting
as
though
it
could
not
see
them
it
shuffled
hunchbacked
slowly
and
doggedly
towards
the
far
end
of
the
room
all
the
while
muttering
under
its
breath
in
a
hoarse
deep
voice
like
a
bullfrogs
smells
like
a
drain
and
a
criminal
to
boot
but
shes
no
better
nasty
old
blood
traitor
with
her
brats
messing
up
my
mistresss
house
oh
my
poor
mistress
if
she
knew
if
she
knew
the
scum
theyve
let
into
her
house
what
would
she
say
to
old
Kreacher
oh
the
shame
of
it
Mudbloods
and
werewolves
and
traitors
and
thieves
poor
old
Kreacher
what
can
he
do
hello
Kreacher
said
Fred
very
loudly
closing
the
door
with
a
snap
the
house-elf
froze
in
his
tracks
stopped
muttering
and
gave
a
very
pronounced
and
very
unconvincing
start
of
surprise
kreacher
did
not
see
young
master
he
said
turning
around
and
bowing
to
Fred
still
facing
the
carpet
he
added
perfectly
audibly
Nasty
little
brat
of
a
blood
traitor
it
is
sorry
said
George
didnt
catch
that
last
bit
kreacher
said
nothing
said
the
elf
with
a
second
bow
to
George
adding
in
a
clear
undertone
and
theres
its
twin
unnatural
little
beasts
they
are
harry
didnt
know
whether
to
laugh
or
not
the
elf
straightened
up
eyeing
them
all
malevolently
and
apparently
convinced
that
they
could
not
hear
him
as
he
continued
to
mutter
and
theres
the
Mudblood
standing
there
bold
as
brass
oh
if
my
mistress
knew
oh
how
shed
cry
and
theres
a
new
boy
Kreacher
doesnt
know
his
name
what
is
he
doing
here
kreacher
doesnt
know
this
is
Harry
Kreacher
said
Hermione
tentatively
harry
Potter
kreachers
pale
eyes
widened
and
he
muttered
faster
and
more
furiously
than
ever
the
Mudblood
is
talking
to
Kreacher
as
though
she
is
my
friend
if
Kreachers
mistress
saw
him
in
such
company
oh
what
would
she
say
dont
call
her
a
Mudblood
said
Ron
and
Ginny
together
very
angrily
it
doesnt
matter
Hermione
whispered
hes
not
in
his
right
mind
he
doesnt
know
what
hes
dont
kid
yourself
Hermione
he
knows
exactly
what
hes
saying
said
Fred
eyeing
Kreacher
with
great
dislike
kreacher
was
still
muttering
his
eyes
on
Harry
is
it
true
is
it
Harry
Potter
kreacher
can
see
t
he
scar
it
must
be
true
thats
the
boy
who
stopped
the
Dark
Lord
Kreacher
wonders
how
he
did
it
dont
we
all
Kreacher
said
Fred
what
do
you
want
anyway
george
asked
kreachers
huge
eyes
darted
towards
George
kreacher
is
cleaning
he
said
evasively
a
likely
story
said
a
voice
behind
Harry
sirius
had
come
back
he
was
glowering
at
the
elf
from
the
doorway
the
noise
in
the
hall
had
abated
perhaps
Mrs
weasley
and
Mundungus
had
moved
their
argument
down
into
the
kitchen
at
the
sight
of
Sirius
Kreacher
flung
himself
into
a
ridiculously
low
bow
that
flattened
his
snoutlike
nose
on
the
floor
stand
up
straight
said
Sirius
impatiently
now
what
are
you
up
to
kreacher
is
cleaning
the
elf
repeated
kreacher
lives
to
serve
the
Noble
House
of
Black
and
its
getting
blacker
every
day
its
filthy
said
Sirius
master
always
liked
his
little
joke
said
Kreacher
bowing
again
and
continuing
in
an
undertone
Master
was
a
nasty
ungrateful
swine
who
broke
his
mothers
heart
my
mother
didnt
have
a
heart
Kreacher
snapped
Sirius
she
kept
herself
alive
out
of
pure
spite
kreacher
bowed
again
as
he
spoke
whatever
Master
says
he
muttered
furiously
master
is
not
fit
to
wipe
slime
from
his
mothers
boots
oh
my
poor
mistress
what
would
she
say
if
she
saw
Kreacher
serving
him
how
she
hated
him
what
a
disappointment
he
was
i
asked
you
what
you
were
up
to
said
Sirius
coldly
every
time
you
show
up
pretending
to
be
cleaning
you
sneak
something
off
to
your
room
so
we
cant
throw
it
out
kreacher
would
never
move
anything
from
its
proper
place
in
Masters
house
said
the
elf
then
muttered
very
fast
Mistress
would
never
forgive
Kreacher
if
the
tapestry
was
thrown
out
seven
centuries
its
been
in
the
family
Kreacher
must
save
it
Kreacher
will
not
let
Master
and
the
blood
traitors
and
the
brats
destroy
it
i
thought
it
might
be
that
said
Sirius
casting
a
disdainful
look
at
the
opposite
wall
shell
have
put
another
Permanent
Sticking
Charm
on
the
back
of
it
I
dont
doubt
but
if
I
can
get
rid
of
it
I
certainly
will
now
go
away
Kreacher
it
seemed
that
Kreacher
did
not
dare
disobey
a
direct
order
nevertheless
the
look
he
gave
Sirius
as
he
shuffled
out
past
him
was
full
of
deepest
loathing
and
he
muttered
all
the
way
out
of
the
room
comes
back
from
Azkaban
ordering
Kreacher
around
oh
my
poor
mistress
what
would
she
say
if
she
saw
the
house
now
scum
living
in
it
her
treasures
thrown
out
she
swore
he
was
no
son
of
hers
and
hes
back
they
say
hes
a
murderer
too
keep
muttering
and
I
will
be
a
murderer
said
Sirius
irritably
as
he
slammed
the
door
shut
on
the
elf
sirius
hes
not
right
in
the
head
Hermione
pleaded
I
dont
think
he
realizes
we
can
hear
him
hes
been
alone
too
long
said
Sirius
taking
mad
orders
from
my
mothers
portrait
and
talking
to
himself
but
he
was
always
a
foul
little
if
you
could
just
set
him
free
said
Hermione
hopefully
maybe
we
cant
set
him
free
he
knows
too
much
about
the
Order
said
Sirius
curtly
and
anyway
the
shock
would
kill
him
you
suggest
to
him
that
he
leaves
this
house
see
how
he
takes
it
sirius
walked
across
the
room
to
where
the
tapestry
Kreacher
had
been
trying
to
protect
hung
the
length
of
the
wall
harry
and
the
others
followed
the
tapestry
looked
immensely
old
it
was
faded
and
looked
as
though
Doxys
had
gnawed
it
in
places
nevertheless
the
golden
thread
with
which
it
was
embroidered
still
glinted
brightly
enough
to
show
them
a
sprawling
family
tree
dating
back
as
far
as
Harry
could
tell
to
the
middle
Ages
large
words
at
the
very
top
of
the
tapestry
read
the
Noble
and
Most
Ancient
House
of
Black
Toujours
pur
youre
not
on
here
said
Harry
after
scanning
the
bottom
of
the
tree
closely
i
used
to
be
there
said
Sirius
pointing
at
a
small
round
charred
hole
in
the
tapestry
rather
like
a
cigarette
burn
my
sweet
old
mother
blasted
me
off
after
I
ran
away
from
home
Kreachers
quite
fond
of
muttering
the
story
under
his
breath
you
ran
away
from
home
when
I
was
about
sixteen
said
Sirius
id
had
enough
where
did
you
go
asked
Harry
staring
at
him
your
dads
place
said
Sirius
your
grandparents
were
really
good
about
it
they
sort
of
adopted
me
as
a
second
son
yeah
I
camped
out
at
your
dads
in
the
school
holidays
and
when
I
was
seventeen
I
got
a
place
of
my
own
my
Uncle
Alphard
had
left
me
a
decent
bit
of
gold
hes
been
wiped
off
here
too
thats
probably
why
anyway
after
that
I
looked
after
myself
i
was
always
welcome
at
mr.
and
Mrs
potters
for
Sunday
lunch
though
but
why
did
you
leave
sirius
smiled
bitterly
and
ran
his
fingers
through
his
long
unkempt
hair
because
I
hated
the
whole
lot
of
them
my
parents
with
their
pure-blood
mania
convinced
that
to
be
a
black
made
you
practically
royal
my
idiot
brother
soft
enough
to
believe
them
thats
him
sirius
jabbed
a
finger
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
tree
at
the
name
Regulus
Black
a
date
of
death
some
fifteen
years
previously
followed
the
date
of
birth
he
was
younger
than
me
said
Sirius
and
a
much
better
son
as
I
was
constantly
reminded
but
he
died
said
Harry
yeah
said
Sirius
stupid
idiot
he
joined
the
Death
Eaters
youre
kidding
come
on
Harry
havent
you
seen
enough
of
this
house
to
tell
what
kind
of
wizards
my
family
were
said
Sirius
testily
were
were
your
parents
Death
Eaters
as
well
no
no
but
believe
me
they
thought
Voldemort
had
the
right
idea
they
were
all
for
the
purification
of
the
wizarding
race
getting
rid
of
muggle-borns
and
having
pure-bloods
in
charge
they
werent
alone
either
there
were
quite
a
few
people
before
Voldemort
showed
his
true
colors
who
thought
he
had
the
right
idea
about
things
they
got
cold
feet
when
they
saw
what
he
was
prepared
to
do
to
get
power
though
but
I
bet
my
parents
thought
Regulus
was
a
right
little
hero
for
joining
up
at
first
was
he
killed
by
an
Auror
harry
asked
tentatively
oh
no
said
Sirius
no
he
was
murdered
by
Voldemort
or
on
Voldemorts
orders
more
likely
I
doubt
Regulus
was
ever
important
enough
to
be
killed
by
Voldemort
in
person
from
what
I
found
out
after
he
died
he
got
in
so
far
then
panicked
about
what
he
was
being
asked
to
do
and
tried
to
back
out
well
you
dont
just
hand
in
your
resignation
to
Voldemort
its
a
lifetime
of
service
or
death
lunch
said
Mrs
weasleys
voice
she
was
holding
her
wand
high
in
front
of
her
balancing
a
huge
tray
loaded
with
sandwiches
and
cake
on
its
tip
she
was
very
red
in
the
face
and
still
looked
angry
the
others
moved
over
to
her
eager
for
some
food
but
Harry
remained
with
Sirius
who
had
bent
closer
to
the
tapestry
i
havent
looked
at
this
for
years
theres
Phineas
Nigellus
my
great-great-grandfather
see
least
popular
Headmaster
Hogwarts
ever
had
and
Araminta
Mehflua
cousin
of
my
mothers
tried
to
force
through
a
Ministry
Bill
to
make
muggle-hunting
legal
and
dear
Aunt
elladora
she
started
the
family
tradition
of
beheading
house-elves
when
they
got
too
old
to
carry
tea
trays
of
course
any
time
the
family
produced
someone
halfway
decent
they
were
disowned
i
see
Tonks
isnt
on
here
maybe
thats
why
Kreacher
wont
take
orders
from
her
hes
supposed
to
do
whatever
anyone
in
the
family
asks
him
you
and
Tonks
are
related
harry
asked
surprised
oh
yeah
her
mother
Andromeda
was
my
favorite
cousin
said
Sirius
examining
the
tapestry
closely
no
Andromedas
not
on
here
either
look
he
pointed
to
another
small
round
burn
mark
between
two
names
Bellatrix
and
Narcissa
andromedas
sisters
are
still
here
because
they
made
lovely
respectable
pure-blood
marriages
but
Andromeda
married
a
muggle-born
Ted
Tonks
so
sirius
mimed
blasting
the
tapestry
with
a
wand
and
laughed
sourly
harry
however
did
not
laugh
he
was
too
busy
staring
at
the
names
to
the
right
of
Andromedas
burn
mark
a
double
line
of
gold
embroidery
linked
Narcissa
Black
with
Lucius
Malfoy
and
a
single
vertical
gold
line
from
their
names
led
to
the
name
Draco
youre
related
to
the
Malfoys
the
pure-blood
families
are
all
interrelated
said
Sirius
if
youre
only
going
to
let
your
sons
and
daughters
marry
pure-bloods
your
choice
is
very
limited
there
are
hardly
any
of
us
left
molly
and
I
are
cousins
by
marriage
and
Arthurs
something
like
my
second
cousin
once
removed
but
theres
no
point
looking
for
them
on
here
if
ever
a
family
was
a
bunch
of
blood
traitors
its
the
Weasleys
but
Harry
was
now
looking
at
the
name
to
the
left
of
Andromedas
burn
Bellatrix
Black
which
was
connected
by
a
double
line
to
Rodolphus
Lestrange
lestrange
harry
said
aloud
the
name
had
stirred
something
in
his
memory
he
knew
it
from
somewhere
but
for
a
moment
he
couldnt
think
where
though
it
gave
him
an
odd
creeping
sensation
in
the
pit
of
his
stomach
theyre
in
Azkaban
said
Sirius
shortly
harry
looked
at
him
curiously
bellatrix
and
her
husband
Rodolphus
came
in
with
Barty
Crouch
junior
said
Sirius
in
the
same
brusque
voice
rodolphuss
brother
Rabastan
was
with
them
too
then
Harry
remembered
he
had
seen
Bellatrix
Lestrange
inside
Dumbledores
Pensieve
the
strange
device
in
which
thoughts
and
memories
could
be
stored
a
tall
dark
woman
with
heavylidded
eyes
who
had
stood
at
her
trial
and
proclaimed
her
continuing
allegiance
to
Lord
voldemort
her
pride
that
she
had
tried
to
find
him
after
his
downfall
and
her
conviction
that
she
would
one
day
be
rewarded
for
her
loyalty
you
never
said
she
was
your
does
it
matter
if
shes
my
cousin
snapped
Sirius
as
far
as
Im
concerned
theyre
not
my
family
shes
certainly
not
my
family
i
havent
seen
her
since
I
was
your
age
unless
you
count
a
glimpse
of
her
coming
into
Azkaban
dyou
think
Im
proud
of
having
a
relative
like
her
sorry
said
Harry
quickly
I
didnt
mean
I
was
just
surprised
thats
all
it
doesnt
matter
dont
apologize
Sirius
mumbled
he
turned
away
from
the
tapestry
his
hands
deep
in
his
pockets
i
dont
like
being
back
here
he
said
staring
across
the
drawing
room
i
never
thought
Id
be
stuck
in
this
house
again
harry
understood
completely
he
knew
how
he
would
feel
when
he
was
grown
up
and
thought
he
was
free
of
the
place
for
ever
to
return
and
live
at
number
four
Privet
Drive
its
ideal
for
Headquarters
of
course
Sirius
said
my
father
put
every
security
measure
known
to
wizard
kind
on
it
when
he
lived
here
its
unplottable
so
Muggles
could
never
come
and
call
as
if
theyd
ever
have
wanted
to
and
now
Dumbledores
added
his
protection
youd
be
hard
put
to
find
a
safer
house
anywhere
dumbledore
is
Secret
Keeper
for
the
Order
you
know
nobody
can
find
Headquarters
unless
he
tells
them
personally
where
it
is
that
note
Moody
showed
you
last
night
that
was
from
Dumbledore
sirius
gave
a
short
bark-like
laugh
if
my
parents
could
see
the
use
their
house
was
being
put
to
now
well
my
mothers
portrait
should
give
you
some
idea
he
scowled
for
a
moment
then
sighed
i
wouldnt
mind
if
I
could
just
get
out
occasionally
and
do
something
useful
ive
asked
dumbledore
whether
I
can
escort
you
to
your
hearing
as
Snuffles
obviously
so
I
can
give
you
a
bit
of
moral
support
what
dyou
think
harry
felt
as
though
his
stomach
had
sunk
through
the
dusty
carpet
he
had
not
thought
about
the
hearing
once
since
dinner
the
previous
evening
in
the
excitement
of
being
back
with
the
people
he
liked
best
and
hearing
everything
that
was
going
on
it
had
completely
flown
his
mind
at
siriuss
words
however
the
crushing
sense
of
dread
returned
to
him
he
stared
at
Hermione
and
the
Weasleys
all
tucking
into
their
sandwiches
and
thought
how
he
would
feel
if
they
went
back
to
Hogwarts
without
him
dont
worry
Sirius
said
harry
looked
up
and
realized
that
Sirius
had
been
watching
him
im
sure
theyll
clear
you
theres
definitely
something
in
the
International
Statute
of
Secrecy
about
being
allowed
to
use
magic
to
save
your
own
life
but
if
they
do
expel
me
said
Harry
quietly
can
I
come
back
here
and
live
with
you
sirius
smiled
sadly
well
see
id
feel
a
lot
better
about
the
hearing
if
I
knew
I
didnt
have
to
go
back
to
the
Dursleys
Harry
pressed
him
they
must
be
bad
if
you
prefer
this
place
said
Sirius
gloomily
hurry
up
you
two
or
there
wont
be
any
food
left
Mrs
weasley
called
sirius
heaved
another
great
sigh
cast
a
dark
look
at
the
tapestry
then
he
and
Harry
went
to
join
the
others
harry
tried
his
best
not
to
think
about
the
hearing
while
they
emptied
the
glass-fronted
cabinets
that
afternoon
fortunately
for
him
it
was
a
job
that
required
a
lot
of
concentration
as
many
of
the
objects
in
there
seemed
very
reluctant
to
leave
their
dusty
shelves
sirius
sustained
a
bad
bite
from
a
silver
snuffbox
within
seconds
his
bitten
hand
had
developed
an
unpleasant
crusty
covering
like
a
tough
brown
glove
its
okay
he
said
examining
the
hand
with
interest
before
tapping
it
lightly
with
his
wand
and
restoring
its
skin
to
normal
must
be
Wartcap
powder
in
there
he
threw
the
box
aside
into
the
sack
where
they
were
depositing
the
debris
from
the
cabinets
harry
saw
George
wrap
his
own
hand
carefully
in
a
cloth
moments
later
and
sneak
the
box
into
his
already
doxy-filled
pocket
they
found
an
unpleasant-looking
silver
instrument
something
like
a
many-legged
pair
of
tweezers
which
scuttled
up
Harrys
arm
like
a
spider
when
he
picked
it
up
and
attempted
to
puncture
his
skin
sirius
seized
it
and
smashed
it
with
a
heavy
book
entitled
Natures
Nobility
A
wizarding
Genealogy
there
was
a
musical
box
that
emitted
a
faintly
sinister
tinkling
tune
when
wound
and
they
all
found
themselves
becoming
curiously
weak
and
sleepy
until
Ginny
had
the
sense
to
slam
the
lid
shut
a
heavy
locket
that
none
of
them
could
open
a
number
of
ancient
seals
and
in
a
dusty
box
an
Order
of
Merlin
First
Class
that
had
been
awarded
to
siriuss
grandfather
for
services
to
the
Ministry
it
means
he
gave
them
a
load
of
gold
said
Sirius
contemptuously
throwing
the
medal
into
the
rubbish
sack
several
times
Kreacher
sidled
into
the
room
and
attempted
to
smuggle
things
away
under
his
loincloth
muttering
horrible
curses
every
time
they
caught
him
at
it
when
Sirius
wrested
a
large
golden
ring
bearing
the
Black
crest
from
his
grip
Kreacher
actually
burst
into
furious
tears
and
left
the
room
sobbing
under
his
breath
and
calling
Sirius
names
Harry
had
never
heard
before
it
was
my
fathers
said
Sirius
throwing
the
ring
into
the
sack
kreacher
wasnt
quite
as
devoted
to
him
as
to
my
mother
but
I
still
caught
him
snogging
a
pair
of
my
fathers
old
trousers
last
week
mrs
weasley
kept
them
all
working
very
hard
over
the
next
few
days
the
drawing
room
took
three
days
to
decontaminate
finally
the
only
undesirable
things
left
in
it
were
the
tapestry
of
the
black
family
tree
which
resisted
all
their
attempts
to
remove
it
from
the
wall
and
the
rattling
writing
desk
moody
had
not
dropped
by
Headquarters
yet
so
they
could
not
be
sure
what
was
inside
it
they
moved
from
the
drawing
room
to
a
dining
room
on
the
ground
floor
where
they
found
spiders
as
large
as
saucers
lurking
in
the
dresser
Ron
left
the
room
hurriedly
to
make
a
cup
of
tea
and
did
not
return
for
an
hour
and
a
half
the
china
which
bore
the
Black
crest
and
motto
was
all
thrown
unceremoniously
into
a
sack
by
Sirius
and
the
same
fate
met
a
set
of
old
photographs
in
tarnished
silver
frames
all
of
whose
occupants
squealed
shrilly
as
the
glass
covering
them
smashed
snape
might
refer
to
their
work
as
cleaning
but
in
Harrys
opinion
they
were
really
waging
war
on
the
house
which
was
putting
up
a
very
good
fight
aided
and
abetted
by
Kreacher
the
house-elf
kept
appearing
wherever
they
were
congregated
his
muttering
becoming
more
and
more
offensive
as
he
attempted
to
remove
anything
he
could
from
the
rubbish
sacks
sirius
went
as
far
as
to
threaten
him
with
clothes
but
Kreacher
fixed
him
with
a
watery
stare
and
said
Master
must
do
as
Master
wishes
before
turning
away
and
muttering
very
loudly
but
Master
will
not
turn
Kreacher
away
no
because
Kreacher
knows
what
they
are
up
to
oh
yes
he
is
plotting
against
the
Dark
Lord
yes
with
these
Mudbloods
and
traitors
and
scum
at
which
Sirius
ignoring
Hermiones
protests
seized
Kreacher
by
the
back
of
his
loincloth
and
threw
him
bodily
from
the
room
the
doorbell
rang
several
times
a
day
which
was
the
cue
for
Siriuss
mother
to
start
shrieking
again
and
for
Harry
and
the
others
to
attempt
to
eavesdrop
on
the
visitor
though
they
gleaned
very
little
from
the
brief
glimpses
and
snatches
of
conversation
they
were
able
to
sneak
before
mrs
weasley
recalled
them
to
their
tasks
snape
flitted
in
and
out
of
the
house
several
times
more
though
to
Harrys
relief
they
never
came
face
to
face
Harry
also
caught
sight
of
his
transfiguration
teacher
Professor
McGonagall
looking
very
odd
in
a
Muggle
dress
and
coat
and
she
also
seemed
too
busy
to
linger
sometimes
however
the
visitors
stayed
to
help
tonks
joined
them
for
a
memorable
afternoon
in
which
they
found
a
murderous
old
ghoul
lurking
in
an
upstairs
toilet
and
Lupin
who
was
staying
in
the
house
with
Sirius
but
who
left
it
for
long
periods
to
do
mysterious
work
for
the
Order
helped
them
repair
a
grandfather
clock
that
had
developed
the
unpleasant
habit
of
shooting
heavy
bolts
at
passers-by
mundungus
redeemed
himself
slightly
in
Mrs
weasleys
eyes
by
rescuing
Ron
from
an
ancient
set
of
purple
robes
that
had
tried
to
strangle
him
when
he
removed
them
from
their
wardrobe
despite
the
fact
that
he
was
still
sleeping
badly
still
having
dreams
about
corridors
and
locked
doors
that
made
his
scar
prickle
Harry
was
managing
to
have
fun
for
the
first
time
all
summer
as
long
as
he
was
busy
he
was
happy
when
the
action
abated
however
whenever
he
dropped
his
guard
or
lay
exhausted
in
bed
watching
blurred
shadows
move
across
the
ceiling
the
thought
of
the
looming
Ministry
hearing
returned
to
him
fear
jabbed
at
his
insides
like
needles
as
he
wondered
what
was
going
to
happen
to
him
if
he
was
expelled
the
idea
was
so
terrible
that
he
did
not
dare
voice
it
aloud
not
even
to
Ron
and
Hermione
who
though
he
often
saw
them
whispering
together
and
casting
anxious
looks
in
his
direction
followed
his
lead
in
not
mentioning
it
sometimes
he
could
not
prevent
his
imagination
showing
him
a
faceless
Ministry
official
who
was
snapping
his
wand
in
two
and
ordering
him
back
to
the
Dursleys
but
he
would
not
go
he
was
determined
on
that
he
would
come
back
here
to
Grimmauld
Place
and
live
with
Sirius
he
felt
as
though
a
brick
had
dropped
into
his
stomach
when
Mrs
weasley
turned
to
him
during
dinner
on
Wednesday
evening
and
said
quietly
Ive
ironed
your
best
clothes
for
tomorrow
morning
Harry
and
I
want
you
to
wash
your
hair
tonight
too
a
good
first
impression
can
work
wonders
ron
Hermione
Fred
George
and
Ginny
all
stopped
talking
and
looked
over
at
him
harry
nodded
and
tried
to
keep
eating
his
chops
but
his
mouth
had
become
so
dry
he
could
not
chew
how
am
I
getting
there
he
asked
Mrs
weasley
trying
to
sound
unconcerned
arthurs
taking
you
to
work
with
him
said
Mrs
weasley
gently
mr.
Weasley
smiled
encouragingly
at
Harry
across
the
table
you
can
wait
in
my
office
until
its
time
for
the
hearing
he
said
harry
looked
over
at
Sirius
but
before
he
could
ask
the
question
Mrs
weasley
had
answered
it
professor
Dumbledore
doesnt
think
its
a
good
idea
for
Sirius
to
go
with
you
and
I
must
say
I
think
hes
quite
right
said
Sirius
through
clenched
teeth
mrs
weasley
pursed
her
lips
when
did
Dumbledore
tell
you
that
harry
said
staring
at
Sirius
he
came
last
night
when
you
were
in
bed
said
mr.
Weasley
sirius
stabbed
moodily
at
a
potato
with
his
fork
harry
lowered
his
own
eyes
to
his
plate
the
thought
that
Dumbledore
had
been
in
the
house
on
the
eve
of
his
hearing
and
not
asked
to
see
him
made
him
feel
if
it
were
possible
even
worse
chapter
seven
the
Ministry
of
Magic
harry
awoke
at
half
past
five
the
next
morning
as
abruptly
and
completely
as
if
somebody
had
yelled
in
his
ear
for
a
few
moments
he
lay
immobile
as
the
prospect
of
the
disciplinary
hearing
filled
every
tiny
particle
of
his
brain
then
unable
to
bear
it
he
leapt
out
of
bed
and
put
on
his
glasses
mrs
weasley
had
laid
out
his
freshly
laundered
jeans
and
t-shirt
at
the
foot
of
his
bed
harry
scrambled
into
them
the
blank
picture
on
the
wall
sniggered
ron
was
lying
sprawled
on
his
back
with
his
mouth
wide
open
fast
asleep
he
did
not
stir
as
harry
crossed
the
room
stepped
out
on
to
the
landing
and
closed
the
door
softly
behind
him
trying
not
to
think
of
the
next
time
he
would
see
Ron
when
they
might
no
longer
be
fellow
students
at
Hogwarts
Harry
walked
quietly
down
the
stairs
past
the
heads
of
Kreachers
ancestors
and
down
into
the
kitchen
he
had
expected
it
to
be
empty
but
when
he
reached
the
door
he
heard
the
soft
rumble
of
voices
on
the
other
side
he
pushed
it
open
and
saw
mr.
and
Mrs
weasley
Sirius
Lupin
and
Tonks
sitting
there
almost
as
though
they
were
waiting
for
him
all
were
fully
dressed
except
Mrs
weasley
who
was
wearing
a
quilted
purple
dressing
gown
she
leapt
to
her
feet
the
moment
harry
entered
breakfast
she
said
as
she
pulled
out
her
wand
and
hurried
over
to
the
fire
m
m
morning
Harry
yawned
Tonks
her
hair
was
blonde
and
curly
this
morning
sleep
all
right
yeah
said
Harry
ive
b
b
been
up
all
night
she
said
with
another
shuddering
yawn
come
and
sit
down
she
drew
out
a
chair
knocking
over
the
one
beside
it
in
the
process
what
do
you
want
Harry
mrs
weasley
called
porridge
muffins
kippers
bacon
and
eggs
toast
just
just
toast

said
Harry
lupin
glanced
at
Harry
then
said
to
Tonks
What
were
you
saying
about
Scrimgeour
oh
yeah
well
we
need
to
be
a
bit
more
careful
hes
been
asking
Kingsley
and
me
funny
questions
harry
felt
vaguely
grateful
that
he
was
not
required
to
join
in
the
conversation
his
insides
were
squirming
mrs
weasley
placed
a
couple
of
pieces
of
toast
and
marmalade
in
front
of
him
he
tried
to
eat
but
it
was
like
chewing
carpet
mrs
weasley
sat
down
on
his
other
side
and
started
fussing
with
his
t-shirt
tucking
in
the
label
and
smoothing
out
the
creases
across
his
shoulders
he
wished
she
wouldnt
and
Ill
have
to
tell
Dumbledore
I
cant
do
night
duty
tomorrow
Im
just
too
tired
Tonks
finished
yawning
hugely
again
ill
cover
for
you
said
mr.
Weasley
im
okay
Ive
got
a
report
to
finish
anyway
mr.
Weasley
was
not
wearing
wizards
robes
but
a
pair
of
pinstriped
trousers
and
an
old
bomber
jacket
he
turned
from
Tonks
to
Harry
how
are
you
feeling
harry
shrugged
itll
all
be
over
soon
mr.
Weasley
said
bracingly
in
a
few
hours
time
youll
be
cleared
harry
said
nothing
the
hearings
on
my
floor
in
Amelia
Boness
office
shes
Head
of
the
Department
of
Magical
law
Enforcement
and
the
one
wholl
be
questioning
you
amelia
Bones
is
okay
Harry
said
Tonks
earnestly
shes
fair
shell
hear
you
out
harry
nodded
still
unable
to
think
of
anything
to
say
dont
lose
your
temper
said
Sirius
abruptly
be
polite
and
stick
to
the
facts
harry
nodded
again
the
laws
on
your
side
said
Lupin
quietly
even
underage
wizards
are
allowed
to
use
magic
in
life-threatening
situations
something
very
cold
trickled
down
the
back
of
Harrys
neck
for
a
moment
he
thought
someone
was
putting
a
Disillusionment
Charm
on
him
then
he
realized
that
Mrs
weasley
was
attacking
his
hair
with
a
wet
comb
she
pressed
hard
on
the
top
of
his
head
doesnt
it
ever
lie
flat
she
said
desperately
harry
shook
his
head
mr.
Weasley
checked
his
watch
and
looked
up
at
Harry
i
think
well
go
now
he
said
were
a
bit
early
but
I
think
youll
be
better
off
at
the
Ministry
than
hanging
around
here
okay
said
Harry
automatically
dropping
his
toast
and
getting
to
his
feet
youll
be
all
right
Harry
said
Tonks
patting
him
on
the
arm
good
luck
said
Lupin
im
sure
it
will
be
fine
and
if
its
not
said
Sirius
grimly
Ill
see
to
Amelia
Bones
for
you
harry
smiled
weakly
mrs
weasley
hugged
him
weve
all
got
our
fingers
crossed
she
said
right
said
Harry
well
see
you
later
then
he
followed
mr.
Weasley
upstairs
and
along
the
hall
he
could
hear
Siriuss
mother
grunting
in
her
sleep
behind
her
curtains
mr.
Weasley
unbolted
the
door
and
they
stepped
out
into
the
cold
grey
dawn
you
dont
normally
walk
to
work
do
you
harry
asked
him
as
they
set
off
briskly
around
the
square
no
I
usually
Apparate
said
mr.
Weasley
but
obviously
you
cant
and
I
think
its
best
we
arrive
in
a
thoroughly
non-magical
fashion
makes
a
better
impression
given
what
youre
being
disciplined
for
mr.
Weasley
kept
his
hand
inside
his
jacket
as
they
walked
harry
knew
it
was
clenched
around
his
wand
the
run-down
streets
were
almost
deserted
but
when
they
arrived
at
the
miserable
little
underground
station
they
found
it
already
full
of
early-morning
commuters
as
ever
when
he
found
himself
in
close
proximity
to
Muggles
going
about
their
daily
business
mr.
Weasley
was
hard
put
to
contain
his
enthusiasm
simply
fabulous
he
whispered
indicating
the
automatic
ticket
machines
wonderfully
ingenious
theyre
out
of
order
said
Harry
pointing
at
the
sign
yes
but
even
so
said
mr.
Weasley
beaming
at
them
fondly
they
bought
their
tickets
instead
from
a
sleepy-looking
guard
Harry
handled
the
transaction
as
mr.
Weasley
was
not
very
good
with
Muggle
money
and
five
minutes
later
they
were
boarding
an
underground
train
that
rattled
them
off
towards
the
center
of
London
mr.
Weasley
kept
anxiously
checking
and
re-checking
the
Underground
Map
above
the
windows
four
more
stops
Harry
three
stops
left
now
two
stops
to
go
Harry
they
got
off
at
a
station
in
the
very
heart
of
London
and
were
swept
from
the
train
in
a
tide
of
besuited
men
and
women
carrying
briefcases
up
the
escalator
they
went
through
the
ticket
barrier
mr.
Weasley
delighted
with
the
way
the
stile
swallowed
his
ticket
and
emerged
on
to
a
broad
street
lined
with
imposing-looking
buildings
and
already
full
of
traffic
where
are
we
said
mr.
Weasley
blankly
and
for
one
heart-stopping
moment
Harry
thought
they
had
got
off
at
the
wrong
station
despite
mr.
Weasleys
continual
references
to
the
map
but
a
second
later
he
said
Ah
yes
this
way
Harry
and
led
him
down
a
side
road
sorry
he
said
but
I
never
come
by
train
and
it
all
looks
rather
different
from
a
Muggle
perspective
as
a
matter
of
fact
Ive
never
even
used
the
visitors
entrance
before
the
further
they
walked
the
smaller
and
less
imposing
the
buildings
became
until
finally
they
reached
a
street
that
contained
several
rather
shabby-looking
offices
a
pub
and
an
overflowing
dumpster
harry
had
expected
a
rather
more
impressive
location
for
the
Ministry
of
Magic
here
we
are
said
mr.
Weasley
brightly
pointing
at
an
old
red
telephone
box
which
was
missing
several
panes
of
glass
and
stood
before
a
heavily
graffitied
wall
after
you
Harry
he
opened
the
telephone-box
door
harry
stepped
inside
wondering
what
on
earth
this
was
about
mr.
Weasley
folded
himself
in
beside
Harry
and
closed
the
door
it
was
a
tight
fit
Harry
was
jammed
against
the
telephone
apparatus
which
was
hanging
crookedly
from
the
wall
as
though
a
vandal
had
tried
to
rip
it
off
mr.
Weasley
reached
past
Harry
for
the
receiver
mr.
Weasley
I
think
this
might
be
out
of
order
too
Harry
said
no
no
Im
sure
its
fine
said
mr.
Weasley
holding
the
receiver
above
his
head
and
peering
at
the
dial
lets
see
six
he
dialed
the
number
two
four
and
another
four
and
another
two
as
the
dial
whirred
smoothly
back
into
place
a
cool
female
voice
sounded
inside
the
telephone
box
not
from
the
receiver
in
mr.
Weasleys
hand
but
as
loudly
and
plainly
as
though
an
invisible
woman
were
standing
right
beside
them
welcome
to
the
Ministry
of
Magic
please
state
your
name
and
business
er
said
mr.
Weasley
clearly
uncertain
whether
or
not
he
should
talk
into
the
receiver
he
compromised
by
holding
the
mouthpiece
to
his
ear
Arthur
Weasley
Misuse
of
Muggle
artifacts
Office
here
to
escort
Harry
Potter
who
has
been
asked
to
attend
a
disciplinary
hearing
thank
you
said
the
cool
female
voice
visitor
please
take
the
badge
and
attach
it
to
the
front
of
your
robes
there
was
a
click
and
a
rattle
and
Harry
saw
something
slide
out
of
the
metal
chute
where
returned
coins
usually
appeared
he
picked
it
up
it
was
a
square
silver
badge
with
Harry
Potter
disciplinary
Hearing
on
it
he
pinned
it
to
the
front
of
his
t-shirt
as
the
female
voice
spoke
again
visitor
to
the
Ministry
you
are
required
to
submit
to
a
search
and
present
your
wand
for
registration
at
the
security
desk
which
is
located
at
the
far
end
of
the
Atrium
the
floor
of
the
telephone
box
shuddered
they
were
sinking
slowly
into
the
ground
harry
watched
apprehensively
as
the
pavement
seemed
to
rise
up
past
the
glass
windows
of
the
telephone
box
until
darkness
closed
over
their
heads
then
he
could
see
nothing
at
all
he
could
hear
only
a
dull
grinding
noise
as
the
telephone
box
made
its
way
down
through
the
earth
after
about
a
minute
though
it
felt
much
longer
to
Harry
a
chink
of
golden
light
illuminated
his
feet
and
widening
rose
up
his
body
until
it
hit
him
in
the
face
and
he
had
to
blink
to
stop
his
eyes
from
watering
the
Ministry
of
Magic
wishes
you
a
pleasant
day
said
the
womans
voice
the
door
of
the
telephone
box
sprang
open
and
mr.
Weasley
stepped
out
of
it
followed
by
harry
whose
mouth
had
fallen
open
they
were
standing
at
one
end
of
a
very
long
and
splendid
hall
with
a
highly
polished
dark
wood
floor
the
peacock
blue
ceiling
was
inlaid
with
gleaming
golden
symbols
that
kept
moving
and
changing
like
some
enormous
heavenly
notice
board
the
walls
on
each
side
were
paneled
in
shiny
dark
wood
and
had
many
gilded
fireplaces
set
into
them
every
few
seconds
a
witch
or
wizard
would
emerge
from
one
of
the
left-hand
fireplaces
with
a
soft
whoosh
on
the
right-hand
side
short
queues
of
wizards
were
forming
before
each
fireplace
waiting
to
depart
halfway
down
the
hall
was
a
fountain
a
group
of
golden
statues
larger
than
life-size
stood
in
the
middle
of
a
circular
pool
tallest
of
them
all
was
a
noble-looking
wizard
with
his
wand
pointing
straight
up
in
the
air
grouped
around
him
were
a
beautiful
witch
a
centaur
a
goblin
and
a
house-elf
the
last
three
were
all
looking
adoringly
up
at
the
witch
and
wizard
glittering
jets
of
water
were
flying
from
the
ends
of
their
wands
the
point
of
the
centaurs
arrow
the
tip
of
the
goblins
hat
and
each
of
the
house-elfs
ears
so
that
the
tinkling
hiss
of
falling
water
was
added
to
the
pops
and
cracks
of
the
Apparators
and
the
clatter
of
footsteps
as
hundreds
of
witches
and
wizards
most
of
whom
were
wearing
glum
early-morning
looks
strode
towards
a
set
of
golden
gates
at
the
far
end
of
the
hall
this
way
said
mr.
Weasley
they
joined
the
throng
wending
their
way
between
the
Ministry
workers
some
of
whom
were
carrying
tottering
piles
of
parchment
others
battered
briefcases
still
others
were
reading
the
daily
Prophet
while
they
walked
as
they
passed
the
fountain
Harry
saw
silver
Sickles
and
bronze
Knuts
glinting
up
at
him
from
the
bottom
of
the
pool
a
small
smudged
sign
beside
it
read
all
proceeds
from
the
fountain
of
magical
brethren
will
be
given
to
st
mungos
hospital
for
magical
maladies
and
injuries
if
Im
not
expelled
from
Hogwarts
Ill
put
in
ten
Galleons
Harry
found
himself
thinking
desperately
over
here
Harry
said
mr.
Weasley
and
they
stepped
out
of
the
stream
of
Ministry
employees
heading
for
the
golden
gates
seated
at
a
desk
to
the
left
beneath
a
sign
saying
Security
a
badly
shaven
wizard
in
peacock
blue
robes
looked
up
as
they
approached
and
put
down
his
Daily
prophet
im
escorting
a
visitor
said
mr.
Weasley
gesturing
towards
Harry
step
over
here
said
the
wizard
in
a
bored
voice
harry
walked
closer
to
him
and
the
wizard
held
up
a
long
golden
rod
thin
and
flexible
as
a
car
aerial
and
passed
it
up
and
down
Harrys
front
and
back
wand
grunted
the
security
wizard
at
Harry
putting
down
the
golden
instrument
and
holding
out
his
hand
harry
produced
his
wand
the
wizard
dropped
it
on
to
a
strange
brass
instrument
which
looked
something
like
a
set
of
scales
with
only
one
dish
it
began
to
vibrate
a
narrow
strip
of
parchment
came
speeding
out
of
a
slit
in
the
base
the
wizard
tore
this
off
and
read
the
writing
on
it
eleven
inches
phoenix-feather
core

in

added

on

to

thank
you
Eric
said
mr.
Weasley
firmly
and
grasping
Harry
by
the
shoulder
he
steered
him
away
from
the
desk
and
back
into
the
stream
of
wizards
and
witches
walking
through
the
golden
gates
jostled
slightly
by
the

Harry
followed
mr.
Weasley
through

gates
into

beyond
where
at

twenty
lifts
stood
behind

golden

harry
and
mr.
Weasley
joined
the
crowd
around

of

nearby
stood
a
big
bearded
wizard
holding
a
large
cardboard
box
which
was
emitting

noises

said
the

at

Harry

through

looked

through

from

a
scarlet-robed
man
with
a
ponytail
longer
than
Bills
was
sitting
with
his
boots
up
on
his
desk
dictating
a
report
to
his
quill
a
little
further
along
a
witch
with
a
patch
over
one
eye
was
talking
over
the

Shacklebolt

said
Kingsley
carelessly
as
they
drew
nearer
ive
been
wanting
a
word
with
you
have
you
got
a
second
yes
if
it
really
is
a
second
said
mr.
Weasley
Im
in
rather
a
hurry
they
were
talking
as
though
they
hardly
knew
each
other
and
when
Harry
opened
his
mouth
to
say
hello
to
Kingsley
mr.
Weasley
stood
on
his
foot
they
followed
Kingsley
along
the
row
and
into
the
very
last
cubicle
harry
received
a
slight
shock
blinking
down
at
him
from
every
direction
was

the
one

was

were
glowing

said
Kingsley
brusquely
to
mr.

of

hand

as

tipped
Harry
an

wink
and
added
in

whisper
Give
him

might
find

then
he
said
in

And
dont
take

long

the

on

held

up

had

you
would

mr.

coolly
and
Im
afraid
youll
have
to
wait
for
information

were
extremely
busy
at
the
moment
he
dropped
his
voice
and
said
If
you
can
get
away
before
seven
Mollys
making
meatballs
he
beckoned
to
Harry
and
led
him
out
of
Kingsleys
cubicle
through
a
second
set
of
oak
doors
into
another
passage
turned
left
marched
along
another
corridor
turned
right
into
a
dimly
lit
and
distinctly
shabby
corridor
and
finally
reached
a
dead
end
where
a
door
on
the
left
stood
ajar
revealing
a
broom
cupboard
and
a
door
on
the
right
bore
a
tarnished
brass
plaque

of

mr.
Weasleys
dingy
office
seemed
to
be
slightly
smaller
than
the
broom
cupboard
two
desks
had
been
crammed
inside
it
and
there
was
barely
space
to
move
around
them
because
of
all
the
overflowing
filing
cabinets
lining
the
walls
on
top
of
which
were
tottering
piles
of
files
the
little
wall
space
available
bore
witness
to
mr.
Weasleys
obsessions
several
posters
of
cars
including
one
of
a
dismantled
engine
two
illustrations
of
postboxes
he
seemed
to
have
cut
out
of
muggle
childrens
books
and
a
diagram
showing
how
to
wire
a
plug
sitting
on
top
of
mr.
Weasleys
overflowing
in-tray
was
an
old
toaster
that
was
hiccoughing
in
a
disconsolate
way
and
a
pair
of
empty
leather
gloves
that
were
twiddling
their
thumbs
photograph
of
the
Weasley
family
stood
beside
the
in-tray
harry
noticed
that
Percy
appeared
to
have
walked
out
of
it
we
havent
got
a
window
said
mr.
Weasley
apologetically
taking
off
his
bomber
jacket
and
placing
it
on
the
back
of
his
chair
weve
asked
but
they
dont
seem
to
think
we
need
one
have
a
seat
Harry
doesnt
look
as
if
Perkins
is
in
yet
harry
squeezed
himself
into
the
chair
behind
Perkinss
desk
while
mr.
Weasley
riffled
through
the
sheaf
of
parchment
Kingsley
Shacklebolt
had
given
him
ah
he
said
grinning
as
he
extracted
a
copy
of
a
magazine
entitled
The
Quibbler
from
its
midst
yes
he
flicked
through
it
yes
hes
right
Im
sure
Sirus
will
find
that
very
amusing
oh
dear
whats
this
now
a
memo
had
just
zoomed
in
through
the
open
door
and
fluttered
to
rest
on
top
of
the
hiccoughing
toaster
mr.
Weasley
unfolded
it
and
read
it
aloud

toilet

Green
kindly

immediately
this
is
getting
ridiculous

mr.

frowning

Castle
muggles

pulling

and
instead

hope

it
be

who
catch

Perkins

stooped
timid-looking
old

with

white
hair
had
just
entered

panting
oh
Arthur
he
said
desperately
without
looking
at
Harry
thank
goodness
I
didnt
know
what
to
do
for
the
best
whether
to
wait
here
for
you
or
not
ive
just
sent
an
owl
to
your
home
but
youve
obviously
missed
it
an
urgent
message
came
ten
minutes
ago
i
know
about
the
regurgitating
toilet
said
mr.
Weasley
no
no
its
not
the
toilet
its
the
Potter

hearing
theyve
changed
the
time
and
venue
it
starts
at
eight
oclock
now
and
its
down
in

down
in

told
me

mr.
Weasley
looked
at
his
watch
let
out
a
yelp
and
leapt
from
his
chair
quick
Harry
we
should
have
been
there
five
minutes
ago
perkins
flattened
himself
against
the
filing
cabinets
as
mr.
Weasley
left
the
office
at
a
run
Harry
close
on
his
heels
why
have
they
changed
the
time
harry
said
breathlessly
as
they
hurtled
past
the
Auror
cubicles
people
poked
out
their
heads
and
stared
as
they
streaked
past
harry
felt
as
though
hed
left
all
his
insides
back
at
Perkinss
desk
ive
no
idea
but
thank
goodness
we
got
here
so
early
if
youd
missed
it
it
would
have
been
catastrophic
mr.
Weasley
skidded
to
a
halt
beside
the
lifts
and
jabbed
impatiently
at
the
down
button
come
on
the
lift
clattered
into
view
and
they
hurried
inside
every
time
it
stopped
mr.
Weasley
cursed
furiously
and
pummeled
the
number
nine
button
those
courtrooms
havent
been
used

years
said
mr.
Weasley
angrily
i
cant
think
why
theyre
doing
it
down
there
unless
but
no
a
plump
witch
carrying
a
smoking
goblet
entered
the
lift
at
that
moment
and
mr.
Weasley
did
not
elaborate

said
the
cool
female
voice
and
the
golden
grilles
slid
open
showing
Harry
a
distant
glimpse
of
the
golden
statues
in
the
fountain
the
plump
witch
got
out
and
a
sallow
skinned
wizard
with
a
very
mournful
face
got
in
morning
Arthur
he
said
in
a
sepulchral
voice
as
the
lift
began
to
descend
dont
often
see
you
down
here

Bode
said
mr.
Weasley
who
was
bouncing
on
the
balls
of
his
feet
and
throwing
anxious
looks
over
at
Harry
ah
yes
said
Bode
surveying
Harry
unblinkingly
of
course
harry

had
emotion
to
spare
for
Bode
but

unfaltering
gaze
did
not
make
him
feel
any
more
comfortable
department
of
Mysteries
said
the
cool
female
voice
and
left
it
at
that
quick
Harry
said
mr.
Weasley
as
the
lift
doors
rattled
open
and
they
sped
up
a
corridor
that
was
quite
different
from
those
above
the
walls
were
bare
there
were
no
windows
and
no
doors
apart
from
a
plain
black
one
set
at
the
very
end
of
the
corridor
harry
expected
them
to
go
through
it
but
instead
mr.
Weasley
seized
him
by
the
arm
and
dragged
him
to
the
left
where
there
was
an
opening
leading
to
a
flight
of
steps
down
here
down
here
panted
mr.
Weasley
taking
two
steps
at
a
time
the
lift
doesnt
even
come
down
this
far
why
theyre
doing
it
down
there
I
they
reached
the
bottom
of
the
steps
and
ran
along
yet
another
corridor
which
bore
a
great
resemblance
to
the
one
that
led
to
Snapes
dungeon
at
Hogwarts
with
rough
stone
walls
and
torches
in
brackets
the
doors
they
passed
here
were
heavy
wooden
ones
with
iron
bolts
and
keyholes
courtroom
ten
i
think
were
nearly
yes
mr.
Weasley
stumbled
to
a
halt
outside
a
grimy
dark
door
with
an
immense
iron
lock
and
slumped
against
the
wall
clutching
at
a
stitch
in
his
chest
go

panted
pointing
his
thumb
at
the
door

in
there

arent
you
coming
with
no
no
Im
not
allowed
good
luck
harrys
heart
was
beating
a
violent
tattoo
against
his
Adams
apple
he
swallowed
hard
turned
the
heavy
iron
door
handle
and
stepped
inside
the
courtroom
chapter
eight
the
Hearing
harry
gasped
he
could
not
help
himself
the
large
dungeon
he
had
entered
was
horribly
familiar
he
had
not
only
seen
it
before
he
had
been
here
before
this
was
the
place
he
had
visited
inside
Dumbledores
Pensieve
the
place
where
he
had
watched
the
Lestranges
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment
in
Azkaban
the
walls
were
made
of
dark
stone
dimly
lit
by
torches
empty
benches
rose
on
either
side
of
him
but
ahead
in
the
highest
benches
of
all
were
many
shadowy
figures
they
had
been
talking
in
low
voices
but
as
the
heavy
door
swung
closed
behind
Harry
an
ominous
silence
fell
a
cold
male
voice
rang
across
the
courtroom
youre
late
sorry
said
Harry
nervously
I
I
didnt
know
the
time
had
been
changed
that
is
not
the
Wizengamots
fault
said
the
voice
an
owl
was
sent
to
you
this
morning
take
your
seat
harry
dropped
his
gaze
to
the
chair
in
the
center
of
the
room
the
arms
of
which
were
covered
in
chains
he
had
seen
those
chains
spring
to
life
and
bind
whoever
sat
between
them
his
footsteps
echoed
loudly
as
he
walked
across
the
stone
floor
when
he
sat
gingerly
on
the
edge
of
the
chair
the
chains
clinked
threateningly
but
did
not
bind
him
feeling
rather
sick
he
looked
up
at
the
people
seated
at
the
bench
above
there
were
about
fifty
of
them
all
as
far
as
he
could
see
wearing
plum-colored
robes
with
an
elaborately
worked
silver
W
on
the
left-hand
side
of
the
chest
and
all
staring
down
their
noses
at
him
some
with
very
austere
expressions
others
looks
of
frank
curiosity
in
the
very
middle
of
the
front
row
sat
Cornelius
Fudge
the
Minister
for
Magic
fudge
was
a
portly
man
who
often
sported
a
lime-green
bowler
hat
though
today
he
had
dispensed
with
it
he
had
dispensed
too
with
the
indulgent
smile
he
had
once
worn
when
he
spoke
to
Harry
a
broad
square-jawed
witch
with
very
short
grey
hair
sat
on
Fudges
left
she
wore
a
monocle
and
looked
forbidding
on
Fudges
right
was
another
witch
but
she
was
sitting
so
far
back
on
the
bench
that
her
face
was
in
shadow
very
well
said
Fudge
the
accused
being
present
finally
let
us
begin
are
you
ready
he
called
down
the
row
yes
sir
said
an
eager
voice
Harry
knew
rons
brother
Percy
was
sitting
at
the
very
end
of
the
front
bench
harry
looked
at
Percy
expecting
some
sign
of
recognition
from
him
but
none
came
percys
eyes
behind
his
horn-rimmed
glasses
were
fixed
on
his
parchment
a
quill
poised
in
his
hand
disciplinary
hearing
of
the
twelfth
of
August
said
Fudge
in
a
ringing
voice
and
Percy
began
taking
notes
at
once
into
offences
committed
under
the
Decree
for
the
Reasonable
Restriction
of
Underage
Sorcery
and
the
International
Statute
of

Albus
Percival
Wulfric
Brian
Dumbledore
said
a
quiet
voice
from
behind
Harry
who
turned
his
head
so
fast
he
cricked
his
neck
dumbledore
was
striding
serenely
across
the
room
wearing
long
midnight-blue
robes
and
a
perfectly
calm
expression
his
long
silver
beard
and
hair
gleamed
in
the
torchlight
as
he
drew
level
with
Harry
and
looked
up
at
Fudge
through
the
half-moon
spectacles
that
rested
halfway
down
his
very
crooked
nose
the
members
of
the
Wizengamot
were
muttering
all
eyes
were
now
on
Dumbledore
some
looked
annoyed
others
slightly
frightened
two
elderly
witches
in
the
back
row
however
raised
their
hands
and
waved
in
welcome
a
powerful
emotion
had
risen
in
Harrys
chest
at
the
sight
of
Dumbledore
a
fortified
hopeful
feeling
rather
like
that
which
phoenix
song
gave
him
he
wanted
to
catch
Dumbledores
eye
but
dumbledore
was
not
looking
his
way
he
was
continuing
to
look
up
at
the
obviously
flustered
fudge
ah
said
Fudge
who
looked
thoroughly
disconcerted
dumbledore
yes
you
er
got
our
er
message
that
the
time
and
er
place
of
the
hearing
had
been
changed
then
i
must
have
missed
it
said
Dumbledore
cheerfully
however
due
to
a
lucky
mistake
I
arrived
at
the
Ministry
three
hours
early
so
no
harm
done
yes
well
I
suppose
well
need
another
chair
I
Weasley
could
you
not
to
worry
not
to
worry
said
Dumbledore
pleasantly
he
took
out
his
wand
gave
it
a
little
flick
and
a
squashy
chintz
armchair
appeared
out
of
nowhere
next
to
Harry
dumbledore
sat
down
put
the
tips
of
his
long
fingers
together
and
surveyed
Fudge
over
them
with
an
expression
of
polite
interest
the
Wizengamot
was
still
muttering
and
fidgeting
restlessly
only
when
Fudge
spoke
again
did
they
settle
down
yes
said
Fudge
again
shuffling
his
notes
well
then
so.
The
charges
yes
he
extricated
a
piece
of
parchment
from
the
pile
before
him
took
a
deep
breath
and
read
out
the
charges
against
the
accused
are
as
follows
That
he
did
knowingly
deliberately
and
in
full
awareness
of
the
illegality
of
his
actions
having
received
a
previous
written
warning
from
the
ministry
of
Magic
on
a
similar
charge
produce
a
Patronus
Charm
in
a
muggle-inhabited
area
in
the
presence
of
a
Muggle
on
the
second
of
August
at
twenty-three
minutes
past
nine
which
constitutes
an
offence
under
Paragraph
C
of
the
Decree
for
the
Reasonable
Restriction
of
underage
Sorcery
and
also
under
Section
of
the
International
Confederation
of
warlocks
Statute
of
Secrecy
you
are
Harry
James
Potter

number
four
Privet
Drive

Whinging
Surrey
fudge
said
glaring
at
Harry
over
the
top
of
his
parchment
yes
Harry
said
you
received
an
official
warning
from
the
Ministry
for
using
illegal
magic
three
years
ago
did
you
not
yes
but
and
yet
you
conjured
a
Patronus
on
the
night
of
the
second
of
August
said
Fudge
yes
said
Harry
but
knowing
that
you
are
not
permitted
to
use
magic
outside
school
while
you
are
under
the
age
of
seventeen
yes
but
knowing
that
you
were
in
an
area
full
of
Muggles
yes
but
fully
aware
that
you
were
in
close
proximity
to
a
Muggle
at
the
time
yes
said
Harry
angrily
but
I
only
used
it
because
we
were
the
witch
with
the
monocle
cut
across
him
in
a
booming
voice
you
produced
a
fully-fledged
Patronus
yes
said
Harry
because
a
corporeal
Patronus
a
what
said
Harry
your
Patronus
had
a
clearly
defined
form
i
mean
t
o
say
it
was
more
than
vapour
or
smoke
yes
said
Harry
feeling
both
impatient
and
slightly
desperate
its
a
stag
its
always
a
stag
always
boomed
Madam
Bones
you
have
produced
a
Patronus
before
now
yes
said
Harry
Ive
been
doing
it
for
over
a
year
and
you
are
fifteen
years
old
yes
and
you
learned
this
at
school
yes
Professor
Lupin
taught
me
in
my
third
year
because
of
the
impressive
said
Madam
Bones
staring
down
at
him
a
true
Patronus
at
his
age
very
impressive
indeed
some
of
the
wizards
and
witches
around
her
were
muttering
again
a
few
nodded
but
others
were
frowning
and
shaking
their
heads
its
not
a
question
of
how
impressive
the
magic
was
said
Fudge
in
a
testy
voice
in
fact
the
more
impressive
the
worse
it
is
I
would
have
thought
given
that
the
boy
did
it
in
plain
view
of
a
muggle
those
who
had
been
frowning
now
murmured
in
agreement
but
it
was
the
sight
of
Percys
sanctimonious
little
nod
that
goaded
Harry
into
speech
i
did
it
because
of
the
Dementors
he
said
loudly
before
anyone
could
interrupt
him
again
he
had
expected
more
muttering
but
the
silence
that
fell
seemed
to
be
somehow
denser
than
before
dementors
said
Madam
Bones
after
a
moment
her
thick
eyebrows
rising
until
her
monocle
looked
in
danger
of
falling
out
what
do
you
mean
boy
i
mean
there
were
two
Dementors
down
that
alleyway
and
they
went
for
me
and
my
cousin
ah
said
Fudge
again
smirking
unpleasantly
as
he
looked
around
at
the
Wizengamot
as
though
inviting
them
to
share
the
joke
yes
yes
I
thought
wed
be
hearing
something
like
this
dementors
in
Little
Whinging
madam
Bones
said
in
a
tone
of
great
surprise
i
dont
understand
dont
you
Amelia
said
Fudge
still
smirking
let
me
explain
hes
been
thinking
it
through
and
decided
Dementors
would
make
a
very
nice
little
cover
story
very
nice
indeed
muggles
cant
see
Dementors
can
they
boy
highly
convenient
highly
convenient
so
its
just
your
word
and
no
witnesses
im
not
lying
said
Harry
loudly
over
another
outbreak
of
muttering
from
the
court
there
were
two
of
them
coming
from
opposite
ends
of
the
alley
everything
went
dark
and
cold
and
my
cousin
felt
them
and
ran
for
it
enough
enough
said
Fudge
with
a
very
supercilious
look
on
his
face
im
sorry
to
interrupt
what
Im
sure
would
have
been
a
very
well-rehearsed
story
dumbledore
cleared
his
throat
the
Wizengamot
fell
silent
again
we
do
in
fact
have
a
witness
to
the
presence
of
Dementors
in
that
alleyway
he
said
other
than
Dudley
Dursley
I
mean
fudges
plump
face
seemed
to
slacken
as
though
somebody
had
let
air
out
of
it
he
stared
down
at
Dumbledore
for
a
moment
or
two
then
with
the
appearance
of
a
man
pulling
himself
back
together
said
We
havent
got
time
to
listen
to
more
tarradiddles
Im
afraid
Dumbledore
i
want
this
dealt
with
quickly
i
may
be
wrong
said
Dumbledore
pleasantly
but
I
am
sure
that
under
the
Wizengamot
Charter
of
Rights
the
accused
has
the
right
to
present
witnesses
for
his
or
her
case
isnt
that
the
policy
of
the
Department
of
Magical
Law
Enforcement
Madam
Bones
he
continued
addressing
the
witch
in
the
monocle
true
said
Madam
Bones
perfectly
true
oh
very
well
very
well
snapped
Fudge
where
is
this
person
i
brought
her
with
me
said
Dumbledore
shes
just
outside
the
door
should
I
no
Weasley
you
go
Fudge
barked
at
Percy
who
got
up
at
once
ran
down
the
stone
steps
from
the
judges
balcony
and
hurried
past
Dumbledore
and
Harry
without
glancing
at
them
a
moment
later
Percy
returned
followed
by
Mrs
figg
she
looked
scared
and
more
batty
than
ever
harry
wished
she
had
thought
to
change
out
of
her
carpet
slippers
dumbledore
stood
up
and
gave
Mrs
figg
his
chair
conjuring
a
second
one
for
himself
full
name
said
Fudge
loudly
when
Mrs
figg
had
perched
herself
nervously
on
the
very
edge
of
her
seal
arabella
Doreen
Figg
said
Mrs
figg
in
her
quavery
voice
and
who
exactly
are
you
said
Fudge
in
a
bored
and
lofty
voice
im
a
resident
of
Little
Whinging
close
to
where
Harry
Potter
lives
said
Mrs
figg
we
have
no
record
of
any
witch
or
wizard
living
in
Little
Whinging
other
than
Harry
Potter
said
Madam
Bones
at
once
that
situation
has
always
been
closely
monitored
given
given
past
events
im
a
Squib
said
Mrs
figg
so
you
wouldnt
have
me
registered
would
you
a
Squib
eh
said
Fudge
eyeing
her
closely
well
be
checking
that
youll
leave
details
of
your
parentage
with
my
assistant
Weasley
incidentally
can
Squibs
see
Dementors
he
added
looking
left
and
right
along
the
bench
yes
we
can
said
Mrs
figg
indignantly
fudge
looked
back
down
at
her
his
eyebrows
raised
very
well
he
said
aloofly
what
is
your
story
i
had
gone
out
to
buy
cat
food
from
the
corner
shop
at
the
end
of
Wisteria
Walk
around
about
nine
oclock
on
the
evening
of
the
second
of
August
gabbled
Mrs
figg
at
once
as
though
she
had
learned
what
she
was
saying
by
heart
when
I
heard
a
disturbance
down
the
alleyway
between
Magnolia
Crescent
and
Wisteria
Walk
on
approaching
the
mouth
of
the
alleyway
I
saw
dementors
running
running
said
Madam
Bones
sharply
dementors
dont
run
they
glide
thats
what
I
meant
to
say
said
Mrs
figg
quickly
patches
of
pink
appearing
in
her
withered
cheeks
gliding
along
the
alley
towards
what
looked
like
two
boys
what
did
they
look
like
said
Madam
Bones
narrowing
her
eyes
so
that
the
edge
of
the
monocle
disappeared
into
her
flesh
well
one
was
very
large
and
the
other
one
rather
skinny
no
no
said
Madam
Bones
impatiently
the
Dementors
describe
them
oh
said
Mrs
figg
the
pink
flush
creeping
up
her
neck
now
they
were
big
big
and
wearing
cloaks
harry
felt
a
horrible
sinking
in
the
pit
of
his
stomach
whatever
Mrs
figg
might
say
it
sounded
to
him
as
though
the
most
she
had
ever
seen
was
a
picture
of
a
Dementor
and
a
picture
could
never
convey
the
truth
of
what
these
beings
were
like
the
eerie
way
they
moved
hovering
inches
over
the
ground
or
the
rotting
smell
of
them
or
that
terrible
rattling
noise
they
made
as
they
sucked
on
the
surrounding
air
in
the
second
row
a
dumpy
wizard
with
a
large
black
moustache
leaned
close
to
whisper
in
the
ear
of
his
neighbor
a
frizzy-haired
witch
she
smirked
and
nodded
big
and
wearing
cloaks
repeated
Madam
Bones
coolly
while
Fudge
snorted
derisively
i
see
anything
else
yes
said
Mrs
figg
i
felt
them
everything
went
cold
and
this
was
a
very
warm
summers
night
mark
you
and
I
felt
as
though
all
happiness
had
gone
from
the
world
and
I
remembered
dreadful
things
her
voice
shook
and
died
madam
Boness
eyes
widened
slightly
harry
could
see
red
marks
under
her
eyebrow
where
the
monocle
had
dug
into
it
what
did
the
Dementors
do
she
asked
and
Harry
felt
a
rush
of
hope
they
went
for
the
boys
said
Mrs
figg
her
voice
stronger
and
more
confident
now
the
pink
flush
ebbing
away
from
her
face
one
of
them
had
fallen
the
other
was
backing
away
trying
to
repel
the
Dementor
that
was
Harry
he
tried
twice
and
produced
only
silver
vapour
on
the
third
attempt
he
produced
a
Patronus
which
charged
down
the
first
Dementor
and
then
with
his
encouragement
chased
the
second
one
away
from
his
cousin
and
that
that
is
what
happened
mrs
figg
finished
somewhat
lamely
madam
Bones
looked
down
at
Mrs
figg
in
silence
fudge
was
not
looking
at
her
at
all
but
fidgeting
with
his
papers
finally
he
raised
his
eyes
and
said
rather
aggressively
thats
what
you
saw
is
it
that
is
what
happened
Mrs
figg
repeated
very
well
said
Fudge
you
may
go
mrs
figg
cast
a
frightened
look
from
Fudge
to
Dumbledore
then
got
up
and
shuffled
off
towards
the
door
harry
heard
it
thud
shut
behind
her
not
a
very
convincing
witness
said
Fudge
loftily
oh
I
dont
know
said
Madam
Bones
in
her
booming
voice
she
certainly
described
the
effects
of
a
Dementor
attack
very
accurately
and
I
cant
imagine
why
she
would
say
they
were
there
if
they
werent
but
Dementors
wandering
into
a
Muggle
suburb
and
just
happening
to
come
across
a
wizard
snorted
Fudge
the
odds
on
that
must
be
very
very
long
even
Bagman
wouldnt
have
bet
oh
I
dont
think
any
of
us
believe
the
Dementors
were
there
by
coincidence
said
Dumbledore
lightly
the
witch
sitting
to
the
right
of
Fudge
with
her
face
in
shadow
moved
slightly
but
everyone
else
was
quite
still
and
silent
and
what
is
that
supposed
to
mean
fudge
asked
icily
it
means
that
I
think
they
were
ordered
there
said
Dumbledore
i
think
we
might
have
a
record
of
it
if
someone
had
ordered
a
pair
of
Dementors
to
go
strolling
through
Little
Whanging
barked
Fudge
not
if
the
Dementors
are
taking
orders
from
someone
other
than
the
Ministry
of
Magic
these
days
said
Dumbledore
calmly
i
have
already
given
you
my
views
on
this
matter
Cornelius
yes
you
have
said
Fudge
forcefully
and
I
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
your
views
are
anything
other
than
bilge
Dumbledore
the
Dementors
remain
in
place
in
Azkaban
and
are
doing
everything
we
ask
them
to
then
said
Dumbledore
quietly
but
clearly
we
must
ask
ourselves
why
somebody
within
the
ministry
ordered
a
pair
of
Dementors
into
that
alleyway
on
the
second
of
August
in
the
complete
silence
that
greeted
these
words
the
witch
to
the
right
of
Fudge
leaned
forwards
so
that
Harry
saw
her
for
the
first
time
he
thought
she
looked
just
like
a
large
pale
toad
she
was
rather
squat
with
a
broad
flabby
face
as
little
neck
as
Uncle
Vernon
and
a
very
wide
slack
mouth
her
eyes
were
large
round
and
slightly
bulging
even
the
little
black
velvet
bow
perched
on
top
of
her
short
curly
hair
put
him
in
mind
of
a
large
fly
she
was
about
to
catch
on
a
long
sticky
tongue
the
Chair
recognizes
Dolores
Jane
Umbridge
Senior
Undersecretary
to
the
Minister
said
fudge
the
witch
spoke
in
a
fluttery
girlish
high-pitched
voice
that
took
Harry
aback
he
had
been
expecting
a
croak
im
sure
I
must
have
misunderstood
you
Professor
Dumbledore
she
said
with
a
simper
that
left
her
big
round
eyes
as
cold
as
ever
so
silly
of
me
but
it
sounded
for
a
teensy
moment
as
though
you
were
suggesting
that
the
Ministry
of
Magic
had
ordered
an
attack
on
this
boy
she
gave
a
silvery
laugh
that
made
the
hairs
on
the
back
of
Harrys
neck
stand
up
a
few
other
members
of
the
Wizengamot
laughed
with
her
it
could
not
have
been
plainer
that
not
one
of
them
was
really
amused
if
it
is
true
that
the
Dementors
are
taking
orders
only
from
the
Ministry
of
Magic
and
it
is
also
true
that
two
Dementors
attacked
Harry
and
his
cousin
a
week
ago
then
it
follows
logically
that
somebody
at
the
Ministry
might
have
ordered
the
attacks
said
Dumbledore
politely
of
course
these
particular
Dementors
may
have
been
outside
Ministry
control
there
are
no
Dementors
outside
Ministry
control
snapped
Fudge
who
had
turned
brick
red
dumbledore
inclined
his
head
in
a
little
bow
then
undoubtedly
the
Ministry
will
be
making
a
full
inquiry
into
why
two
Dementors
were
so
very
far
from
Azkaban
and
why
they
attacked
without
authorization
it
is
not
for
you
to
decide
what
the
Ministry
of
Magic
does
or
does
not
do
Dumbledore
snapped
Fudge
now
a
shade
of
magenta
of
which
Uncle
Vernon
would
have
been
proud
of
course
it
isnt
said
Dumbledore
mildly
i
was
merely
expressing
my
confidence
that
this
matter
will
not
go
uninvestigated
he
glanced
at
Madam
Bones
who
readjusted
her
monocle
and
stared
back
at
him
frowning
slightly
i
would
remind
everybody
that
the
behavior
of
these
Dementors
if
indeed
they
are
not
figments
of
this
boys
imagination
is
not
the
subject
of
this
hearing
said
Fudge
we
are
here
to
examine
Harry
Potters
offences
under
the
Decree
for
the
Reasonable
Restriction
of
Underage
sorcery
of
course
we
are
said
Dumbledore
but
the
presence
of
Dementors
in
that
alleyway
is
highly
relevant
clause
Seven
of
the
Decree
states
that
magic
may
be
used
before
Muggles
in
exceptional
circumstances
and
as
those
exceptional
circumstances
include
situations
which
threaten
the
life
of
the
wizard
or
witch
him
or
herself
or
any
witches
wizards
or
Muggles
present
at
the
time
of
the
we
are
familiar
with
Clause
Seven
thank
you
very
much
snarled
Fudge
of
course
you
are
said
Dumbledore
courteously
then
we
are
in
agreement
that
Harrys
use
of
the
Patronus
Charm
in
these
circumstances
falls
precisely
into
the
category
of
exceptional
circumstances
the
clause
describes
if
there
were
Dementors
which
I
doubt
you
have
heard
it
from
an
eyewitness
Dumbledore
interrupted
if
you
still
doubt
her
truthfulness
call
her
back
question
her
again
i
am
sure
she
would
not
object
i
that
not
blustered
Fudge
fiddling
with
the
papers
before
him
its
I
want
this
over
with
today
Dumbledore
but
naturally
you
would
not
care
how
many
times
you
heard
from
a
witness
if
the
alternative
was
a
serious
miscarriage
of
justice
said
Dumbledore
serious
miscarriage
my
hat
said
Fudge
at
the
top
of
his
voice
have
you
ever
bothered
to
tot
up
the
number
of
cock-and-bull
stories
this
boy
has
come
out
with
Dumbledore
while
trying
to
cover
up
his
flagrant
misuse
of
magic
out
of
school
i
suppose
youve
forgotten
the
Hover
charm
he
used
three
years
ago
that
wasnt
me
it
was
a
house-elf
said
Harry
you
see
roared
Fudge
gesturing
flamboyantly
in
Harrys
direction
a
house-elf
in
a
muggle
house
i
ask
you
the
house-elf
in
question
is
currently
in
the
employ
of
Hogwarts
School
said
Dumbledore
can
summon
him
here
in
an
instant
to
give
evidence
if
you
wish
i
not
I
havent
got
time
to
listen
to
house-elves
anyway
thats
not
the
only
he
blew
up
his
aunt
for
Gods
sake
fudge
shouted
banging
his
fist
on
the
judges
bench
and
upsetting
a
bottle
of
ink
and
you
very
kindly
did
not
press
charges
on
that
occasion
accepting
I
presume
that
even
the
best
wizards
cannot
always
control
their
emotions
said
Dumbledore
calmly
as
Fudge
attempted
to
scrub
the
ink
off
his
notes
and
I
havent
even
started
on
what
he
gets
up
to
at
school
but
as
the
Ministry
has
no
authority
to
punish
Hogwarts
students
for
misdemeanors
at
school
harrys
behavior
there
is
not
relevant
to
this
hearing
said
Dumbledore
as
politely
as
ever
but
now
with
a
suggestion
of
coolness
behind
his
words
oho
said
Fudge
not
our
business
what
he
does
at
school
eh
you
think
so
the
Ministry
does
not
have
the
power
to
expel
Hogwarts
students
Cornelius
as
I
reminded
you
on
the
night
of
the
second
of
August
said
Dumbledore
nor
does
it
have
the
right
to
confiscate
wands
until
charges
have
been
successfully
proven
again
as
I
reminded
you
on
the
night
of
the
second
of
August
in
your
admirable
haste
to
ensure
that
the
law
is
upheld
you
appear
inadvertently
I
am
sure
to
have
overlooked
a
few
laws
yourself
laws
can
be
changed
said
Fudge
savagely
of
course
they
can
said
Dumbledore
inclining
his
head
and
you
certainly
seem
to
be
making
many
changes
Cornelius
why
in
the
few
short
weeks
since
I
was
asked
to
leave
the
wizengamot
it
has
already
become
the
practice
to
hold
a
full
criminal
trial
to
deal
with
a
simple
matter
of
underage
magic
a
few
of
the
wizards
above
them
shifted
uncomfortably
in
their
seats
fudge
turned
a
slightly
deeper
shade
of
puce
the
toadlike
witch
on
his
right
however
merely
gazed
at
Dumbledore
her
face
quite
expressionless
as
far
as
I
am
aware
Dumbledore
continued
there
is
no
law
yet
in
place
that
says
this
courts
job
is
to
punish
Harry
for
every
bit
of
magic
he
has
ever
performed
he
has
been
charged
with
a
specific
offence
and
he
has
presented
his
defense
all
he
and
I
can
do
now
is
to
await
your
verdict
dumbledore
put
his
fingertips
together
again
and
said
no
more
fudge
glared
at
him
evidently
incensed
harry
glanced
sideways
at
Dumbledore
seeking
reassurance
he
was
not
at
all
sure
that
dumbledore
was
right
in
telling
the
Wizengamot
in
effect
that
it
was
about
time
they
made
a
decision
again
however
Dumbledore
seemed
oblivious
to
Harrys
attempt
to
catch
his
eye
he
continued
to
look
up
at
the
benches
where
the
entire
Wizengamot
had
fallen
into
urgent
whispered
conversations
harry
looked
at
his
feet
his
heart
which
seemed
to
have
swollen
to
an
unnatural
size
was
thumping
loudly
under
his
ribs
he
had
expected
the
hearing
to
last
longer
than
this
he
was
not
at
all
sure
that
he
had
made
a
good
impression
he
had
not
really
said
very
much
he
ought
to
have
explained
more
fully
about
the
Dementors
about
how
he
had
fallen
over
about
how
both
he
and
Dudley
had
nearly
been
kissed
twice
he
looked
up
at
Fudge
and
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
but
his
swollen
heart
was
now
constricting
his
air
passages
and
both
times
he
merely
took
a
deep
breath
and
looked
back
down
at
his
shoes
then
the
whispering
stopped
harry
wanted
to
look
up
at
the
judges
but
found
that
it
was
really
much
much
easier
to
keep
examining
his
laces
those
in
favor
of
clearing
the
witness
of
all
charges
said
Madam
Boness
booming
voice
harrys
head
jerked
upwards
there
were
hands
in
the
air
many
of
them
more
than
half
breathing
very
fast
he
tried
to
count
but
before
he
could
finish
Madam
Bones
had
said
And
those
in
favor
of
conviction
fudge
raised
his
hand
so
did
half
a
dozen
others
including
the
witch
on
his
right
and
the
heavily-moustached
wizard
and
the
frizzy-haired
witch
in
the
second
row
fudge
glanced
around
at
them
all
looking
as
though
there
was
something
large
stuck
in
his
throat
then
lowered
his
own
hand
he
took
two
deep
breaths
and
said
in
a
voice
distorted
by
suppressed
rage
Very
well
very
well
cleared
of
all
charges
excellent
said
Dumbledore
briskly
springing
to
his
feet
pulling
out
his
wand
and
causing
the
two
chintz
armchairs
to
vanish
well
I
must
be
getting
along
good-day
to
you
all
and
without
looking
once
at
Harry
he
swept
from
the
dungeon
chapter
nine
the
Woes
of
Mrs
weasley
dumbledores
abrupt
departure
took
Harry
completely
by
surprise
he
remained
sitting
where
he
was
in
the
chained
chair
struggling
with
his
feelings
of
shock
and
relief
the
Wizengamot
were
all
getting
to
their
feet
talking
gathering
up
their
papers
and
packing
them
away
harry
stood
up
nobody
seemed
to
be
paying
him
the
slightest
bit
of
attention
except
the
toadlike
witch
on
fudges
right
who
was
now
gazing
down
at
him
instead
of
at
Dumbledore
ignoring
her
he
tried
to
catch
Fudges
eye
or
Madam
Boness
wanting
to
ask
whether
he
was
free
to
go
but
Fudge
seemed
quite
determined
not
to
notice
Harry
and
Madam
Bones
was
busy
with
her
briefcase
so
he
took
a
few
tentative
steps
towards
the
exit
and
when
nobody
called
him
back
broke
into
a
very
fast
walk
he
took
the
last
few
steps
at
a
run
wrenched
open
the
door
and
almost
collided
with
Mr
weasley
who
was
standing
right
outside
looking
pale
and
apprehensive
dumbledore
didnt
say
cleared
Harry
said
pulling
the
door
closed
behind
him
of
all
charges
beaming
mr.
Weasley
seized
Harry
by
the
shoulders
harry
thats
wonderful
well
of
course
they
couldnt
have
found
you
guilty
not
on
the
evidence
but
even
so
I
cant
pretend
I
wasnt
but
mr.
Weasley
broke
off
because
the
courtroom
door
had
just
opened
again
the
Wizengamot
were
filing
out
merlins
beard
exclaimed
mr.
Weasley
wonderingly
pulling
Harry
aside
to
let
them
all
pass
you
were
tried
by
the
full
court
i
think
so
said
Harry
quietly
one
or
two
of
the
wizards
nodded
to
Harry
as
they
passed
and
a
few
including
Madam
Bones
said
Morning
Arthur
to
mr.
Weasley
but
most
averted
their
eyes
cornelius
Fudge
and
the
toadlike
witch
were
almost
the
last
to
leave
the
dungeon
fudge
acted
as
though
mr.
Weasley
and
Harry
were
part
of
the
wall
but
again
the
witch
looked
almost
appraisingly
at
Harry
as
she
passed
last
of
all
to
pass
was
Percy
like
Fudge
he
completely
ignored
his
father
and
Harry
he
marched
past
clutching
a
large
roll
of
parchment
and
a
handful
of
spare
quills
his
back
rigid
and
his
nose
in
the
air
the
lines
around
mr.
Weasleys
mouth
tightened
slightly
but
other
than
this
he
gave
no
sign
that
he
had
seen
his
third
son
im
going
to
take
you
straight
back
so
you
can
tell
the
others
the
good
news
he
said
beckoning
Harry
forwards
as
Percys
heels
disappeared
up
the
steps
to
Level
Nine
ill
drop
you
off
on
the
way
to
that
toilet
in
Bethnal
Green
come
on
so
what
will
you
have
to
do
about
the
toilet
harry
asked
grinning
everything
suddenly
seemed
five
times
funnier
than
usual
it
was
starting
to
sink
in
he
was
cleared
he
was
going
back
to
Hogwarts
oh
its
a
simple
enough
anti-jinx
said
mr.
Weasley
as
they
mounted
the
stairs
but
its
not
so
much
having
to
repair
the
damage
its
more
the
attitude
behind
the
vandalism
Harry
mugglebaiting
might
strike
some
wizards
as
funny
but
its
an
expression
of
something
much
deeper
and
nastier
and
I
for
one
mr.
Weasley
broke
off
in
mid-sentence
they
had
just
reached
the
ninth-level
corridor
and
cornelius
Fudge
was
standing
a
few
feet
away
from
them
talking
quietly
to
a
tall
man
with
sleek
blond
hair
and
a
pointed
pale
face
the
second
man
turned
at
the
sound
of
their
footsteps
he
too
broke
off
in
mid-conversation
his
cold
grey
eyes
narrowed
and
fixed
upon
Harrys
face
well
well
well
patronus
Potter
said
Lucius
Malfoy
coolly
harry
felt
winded
as
though
he
had
just
walked
into
something
solid
he
had
last
seen
those
cold
grey
eyes
through
slits
in
a
Death
Eaters
hood
and
last
heard
that
mans
voice
jeering
in
a
dark
graveyard
while
Lord
Voldemort
tortured
him
harry
could
not
believe
that
Lucius
Malfoy
dared
look
him
in
the
face
he
could
not
believe
that
he
was
here
in
the
Ministry
of
Magic
or
that
cornelius
Fudge
was
talking
to
him
when
Harry
had
told
Fudge
mere
weeks
ago
that
Malfoy
was
a
Death
Eater
the
Minister
was
just
telling
me
about
your
lucky
escape
Potter
drawled
mr.
Malfoy
quite
astonishing
the
way
you
continue
to
wriggle
out
of
very
tight
holes
snakelike
in
fact
mr.
Weasley
gripped
Harrys
shoulder
in
warning
yeah
said
Harry
yeah
Im
good
at
escaping
lucius
Malfoy
raised
his
eyes
to
mr.
Weasleys
face
and
Arthur
Weasley
too
what
are
you
doing
here
Arthur
i
work
here
said
mr.
Weasley
curtly
not
here
surely
said
mr.
Malfoy
raising
his
eye
brows
and
glancing
towards
the
door
over
mr.
Weasleys
shoulder
i
thought
you
were
up
on
the
second
floor
dont
you
do
something
that
involves
sneaking
Muggle
artifacts
home
and
bewitching
them
no
mr.
Weasley
snapped
his
fingers
now
biting
into
Harrys
shoulder
what
are
you
doing
here
anyway
harry
asked
Lucius
Malfoy
i
dont
think
private
matters
between
myself
and
the
Minister
are
any
concern
of
yours
Potter
said
Malfoy
smoothing
the
front
of
his
robes
harry
distinctly
heard
the
gentle
clinking
of
what
sounded
like
a
full
pocket
of
gold
really
just
because
you
are
Dumbledores
favorite
boy
you
must
not
expect
the
same
indulgence
from
the
rest
of
us
shall
we
go
up
to
your
office
then
Minister
certainly
said
Fudge
turning
his
back
on
Harry
and
mr.
Weasley
this
way
Lucius
they
strode
off
together
talking
in
low
voices
mr.
Weasley
did
not
let
go
of
Harrys
shoulder
until
they
had
disappeared
into
the
lift
why
wasnt
he
waiting
outside
Fudges
office
if
theyve
got
business
to
do
together
harry
burst
out
furiously
what
was
he
doing
down
here
trying
to
sneak
down
to
the
courtroom
if
you
ask
me
said
mr.
Weasley
looking
extremely
agitated
and
glancing
over
his
shoulder
as
though
making
sure
they
could
not
be
overheard
trying
to
find
out
whether
youd
been
expelled
or
not
ill
leave
a
note
for
Dumbledore
when
I
drop
you
off
he
ought
to
know
Malfoys
been
talking
to
Fudge
again
what
private
business
have
they
got
together
anyway
gold
I
expect
said
mr.
Weasley
angrily
malfoys
been
giving
generously
to
all
sorts
of
things
for
years
gets
him
in
with
the
right
people
then
he
can
ask
favors
delay
laws
he
doesnt
want
passed
oh
hes
very
well-connected
Lucius
Malfoy
the
lift
arrived
it
was
empty
except
for
a
flock
of
memos
that
flapped
around
mr.
Weasleys
head
as
he
pressed
the
button
for
the
Atrium
and
the
doors
clanged
shut
he
waved
them
away
irritably
mr.
Weasley
said
Harry
slowly
if
Fudge
is
meeting
Death
Eaters
like
Malfoy
if
hes
seeing
them
alone
how
do
we
know
they
havent
put
the
Imperius
Curse
on
him
dont
think
it
hasnt
occurred
to
us
Harry
said
mr.
Weasley
quietly
but
Dumbledore
thinks
fudge
is
acting
of
his
own
accord
at
the
moment
which
as
Dumbledore
says
is
not
a
lot
of
comfort
best
not
talk
about
it
any
more
just
now
Harry
the
doors
slid
open
and
they
stepped
out
into
the
now
almost-deserted
Atrium
eric
the
watchwizard
was
hidden
behind
his
Daily
Prophet
again
they
had
walked
straight
past
the
golden
fountain
before
Harry
remembered
wait
he
told
mr.
Weasley
and
pulling
his
moneybag
from
his
pocket
he
turned
back
to
the
fountain
he
looked
up
into
the
handsome
wizards
face
but
up
close
Harry
thought
he
looked
rather
weak
and
foolish
the
witch
was
wearing
a
vapid
smile
like
a
beauty
contestant
and
from
what
Harry
knew
of
goblins
and
centaurs
they
were
most
unlikely
to
be
caught
staring
so
soppily
at
humans
of
any
description
only
the
house-elfs
attitude
of
creeping
servility
looked
convincing
with
a
grin
at
the
thought
of
what
Hermione
would
say
if
she
could
see
the
statue
of
the
elf
Harry
turned
his
moneybag
upside-down
and
emptied
not
just
ten
Galleons
but
the
whole
contents
into
the
pool
i
knew
it
yelled
Ron
punching
the
air
you
always
get
away
with
stuff
they
were
bound
to
clear
you
said
Hermione
who
had
looked
positively
faint
with
anxiety
when
Harry
had
entered
the
kitchen
and
was
now
holding
a
shaking
hand
over
her
eyes
there
was

quite
relieved
though

said
Harry
smiling
mrs
weasley
was
wiping
her
face
on
her
apron
and
Fred
George
and
Ginny
were
doing
a
kind
of
war
dance
to
a
chant
that
went
He

shouted
mr.
Weasley
though
he

was
smiling

the
Ministry

Sirius
sharply

Sirius

Fred
George
Ginny
said
Mrs
weasley
as
mr.
Weasley
left
the
kitchen
harry
dear
come
and
sit
down
have
some
lunch
you
hardly
ate
breakfast
ron
and
Hermione
sat
themselves
down
opposite
him
looking
happier
than
they
had
done
since
he
had
first
arrived
at
Grimmauld
Place
and
Harrys
feeling
of
giddy
relief
which
had
been
somewhat
dented
by
his
encounter
with
Lucius
Malfoy
swelled
again
the
gloomy
house
seemed
warmer
and
more
welcoming
all
of
a
sudden
even
Kreacher
looked
less
ugly
as
he
poked
his
snoutlike
nose
into
the
kitchen
to
investigate
the
source
of
all
the
noise
course
once
Dumbledore
turned
up
on
your
side
there
was
no
way
they
were
going
to
convict
you
said
Ron
happily
now
dishing
great
mounds
of
mashed
potatoes
on
to
everyones
plates
yeah
he
swung
it
for
me
said
Harry
he
felt
it
would
sound
highly
ungrateful
not
to
mention
childish
to
say
I
wish
hed
talked
to
me
though
or
even
looked
at
me
and
as
he
thought
this
the
scar
on
his
forehead
burned
so
badly
that
he
clapped
his
hand
to
it
whats
up
said
Hermione
looking
alarmed
scar
Harry
mumbled
but
its
nothing
it
happens
all
the
time
now
none
of
the
others
had
noticed
a
thing
all
of
them
were
now
helping
themselves
to
food
while
gloating
over
Harrys
narrow
escape
Fred
George
and
Ginny
were
still
singing
hermione
looked
rather
anxious
but
before
she
could
say
anything
Ron
had
said
happily
I
bet
dumbledore
turns
up
this
evening
to
celebrate
with
us
you
know
i
dont
think
hell
be
able
to
Ron
said
Mrs
weasley
setting
a
huge
plate
of
roast
chicken
down
in
front
of
Harry
hes
really
very
busy
at
the
moment
he
got
off
he
got
off
he
got
off
shut
up
roared
Mrs
weasley
over
the
next
few
days
Harry
could
not
help
noticing
that
there
was
one
person
within
number
twelve
Grimmauld
Place
who
did
not
seem
wholly
overjoyed
that
he
would
be
returning
to
hogwarts
sirius
had
put
up
a
very
good
show
of
happiness
on
first
hearing
the
news
wringing
harrys
hand
and
beaming
just
like
the
rest
of
them
soon
however
he
was
moodier
and
surlier
than
before
talking
less
to
everybody
even
Harry
and
spending
increasing
amounts
of
time
shut
up
in
his
mothers
room
with
Buckbeak
dont
you
go
feeling
guilty
said
Hermione
sternly
after
Harry
had
confided
some
of
his
feelings
to
her
and
Ron
while
they
scrubbed
out
a
mouldy
cupboard
on
the
third
floor
a
few
days
later
you
belong
at
Hogwarts
and
Sirius
knows
it
personally
I
think
hes
being
selfish
thats
a
bit
harsh
Hermione
said
Ron
frowning
as
he
attempted
to
prize
off
a
bit
of
mould
that
had
attached
itself
firmly
to
his
finger
you
wouldnt
want
to
be
stuck
inside
this
house
without
any
company
hell
have
company
said
Hermione
its
Headquarters
to
the
Order
of
the
Phoenix
isnt
it
he
just
got
his
hopes
up
that
Harry
would
be
coming
to
live
here
with
him
i
dont
think
thats
true
said
Harry
wringing
out
his
cloth
he
wouldnt
give
me
a
straight
answer
when
I
asked
him
if
I
could
he
just
didnt
want
to
get
his
own
hopes
up
even
more
said
Hermione
wisely
and
he
probably
felt
a
bit
guilty
himself
because
I
think
a
part
of
him
was
really
hoping
youd
be
expelled
then
youd
both
be
outcasts
together
come
off
it
said
Harry
and
Ron
together
but
Hermione
merely
shrugged
suit
yourselves
but
I
sometimes
think
Rons
mums
right
and
Sirius
gets
confused
about
whether
youre
you
or
your
father
Harry
so
you
think
hes
touched
in
the
head
said
Harry
heatedly
no
I
just
think
hes
been
very
lonely
for
a
long
time
said
Hermione
simply
at
this
point
Mrs
weasley
entered
the
bedroom
behind
them
still
not
finished
she
said
poking
her
head
into
the
cupboard
i
thought
you
might
be
here
to
tell
us
to
have
a
break
said
Ron
bitterly
dyou
know
how
much
mould
weve
got
rid
of
since
we
arrived
here
you
were
so
keen
to
help
the
Order
said
Mrs
weasley
you
can
do
your
bit
by
making
headquarters
fit
to
live
in
i
feel
like
a
house-elf
grumbled
Ron
well
now
you
understand
what
dreadful
lives
they
lead
perhaps
youll
be
a
bit
more
active
in
spew
said
Hermione
hopefully
as
Mrs
weasley
left
them
to
it
you
know
maybe
it
wouldnt
be
a
bad
idea
to
show
people
exactly
how
horrible
it
is
to
clean
all
the
time
we
could
do
a
sponsored
scrub
of
Gryffindor
common
room
all
proceeds
to
spew
it
would
raise
awareness
as
well
as
funds
ill
sponsor
you
to
shut
up
about
spew
Ron
muttered
irritably
but
only
so
Harry
could
hear
him
harry
found
himself
daydreaming
about
Hogwarts
more
and
more
as
the
end
of
the
holidays
approached
he
could
not
wait
to
see
Hagrid
again
to
play
Quidditch
even
to
stroll
across
the
vegetable
patches
to
the
Herbology
greenhouses
it
would
be
a
treat
just
to
leave
this
dusty
musty
house
where
half
of
the
cupboards
were
still
bolted
shut
and
Kreacher
wheezed
insults
out
of
the
shadows
as
you
passed
though
Harry
was
careful
not
to
say
any
of
this
within
earshot
of
Sirius
the
fact
was
that
living
at
the
Headquarters
of
the
anti-Voldemort
movement
was
not
nearly
as
interesting
or
exciting
as
Harry
would
have
expected
before
hed
experienced
it
though
members
of
the
Order
of
the
Phoenix
came
and
went
regularly
sometimes
staying
for
meals
sometimes
only
for
a
few
minutes
of
whispered
conversation
Mrs
weasley
made
sure
that
harry
and
the
others
were
kept
well
out
of
earshot
whether
Extendable
or
normal
and
nobody
not
even
Sirius
seemed
to
feel
that
Harry
needed
to
know
anything
more
than
he
had
heard
on
the
night
of
his
arrival
on
the
very
last
day
of
the
holidays
Harry
was
sweeping
up
Hedwigs
owl
droppings
from
the
top
of
the
wardrobe
when
Ron
entered
their
bedroom
carrying
a
couple
of
envelopes
booklists
have
arrived
he
said
throwing
one
of
the
envelopes
up
to
Harry
who
was
standing
on
a
chair
about
time
I
thought
theyd
forgotten
they
usually
come
much
earlier
than
this
harry
swept
the
last
of
the
droppings
into
a
rubbish
bag
and
threw
the
bag
over
Rons
head
into
the
wastepaper
basket
in
the
corner
which
swallowed
it
and
belched
loudly
he
then
opened
his
letter
it
contained
two
pieces
of
parchment
one
the
usual
reminder
that
term
started
on
the
first
of
September
the
other
telling
him
which
books
he
would
need
for
the
coming
year
only
two
new
ones
he
said
reading
the
list
The
Standard
Book
of
Spells
Grade
by
miranda
Goshawk
and
Defensive
Magical
Theory
by
Wilbert
Slinkhard
crack
fred
and
George
Apparated
right
beside
Harry
he
was
so
used
to
them
doing
this
by
now
that
he
didnt
even
fall
off
his
chair
we
were
just
wondering
who
assigned
the
Slinkhard
book
said
Fred
conversationally
because
it
means
Dumbledores
found
a
new
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
teacher
said
george
and
about
time
too
said
Fred
what
dyou
mean
harry
asked
jumping
down
beside
them
well
we
overheard
Mum
and
Dad
talking
on
the
Extendable
Ears
a
few
weeks
back
Fred
told
harry
and
from
what
they
were
saying
Dumbledore
was
having
real
trouble
finding
anyone
to
do
the
job
this
year
not
surprising
is
it
when
you
look
at
whats
happened
to
the
last
four
said
George
one
sacked
one
dead
ones
memory
removed
and
one
locked
in
a
trunk
for
nine
months
said
harry
counting
them
off
on
his
fingers
yeah
I
see
what
you
mean
whats
up
with
you
Ron
asked
Fred
ron
did
not
answer
harry
looked
round
ron
was
standing
very
still
with
his
mouth
slightly
open
gaping
at
his
letter
from
Hogwarts
whats
the
matter
said
Fred
impatiently
moving
around
Ron
to
look
over
his
shoulder
at
the
parchment
freds
mouth
fell
open
too
prefect
he
said
staring
incredulously
at
the
letter
prefect
george
leapt
forwards
seized
the
envelope
in
Rons
other
hand
and
turned
it
upside-down
harry
saw
something
scarlet
and
gold
fall
into
Georges
palm
no
way
said
George
in
a
hushed
voice
theres
been
a
mistake
said
Fred
snatching
the
letter
out
of
Rons
grasp
and
holding
it
up
to
the
light
as
though
checking
for
a
watermark
no
one
in
their
right
mind
would
make
Ron
a
prefect
the
twins
heads
turned
in
unison
and
both
of
them
stared
at
Harry
we
thought
you
were
a
cert
said
Fred
in
a
tone
that
suggested
Harry
had
tricked
them
in
some
way
we
thought
Dumbledore
was
bound
to
pick
you
said
George
indignantly
winning
the
Triwizard
and
everything
said
Fred
i
suppose
all
the
mad
stuff
mustve
counted
against
him
said
George
to
Fred
yeah
said
Fred
slowly
yeah
youve
caused
too
much
trouble
mate
well
at
least
one
of
yous
got
their
priorities
right
he
strode
over
to
Harry
and
clapped
him
on
the
back
while
giving
Ron
a
scathing
look
prefect
ickle
Ronnie
the
Prefect
oh
Mums
going
to
be
revolting
groaned
George
thrusting
the
prefect
badge
back
at
Ron
as
though
it
might
contaminate
him
ron
who
still
had
not
said
a
word
took
the
badge
stared
at
it
for
a
moment
then
held
it
out
to
harry
as
though
asking
mutely
for
confirmation
that
it
was
genuine
harry
took
it
a
large
P
was
superimposed
on
the
Gryffindor
lion
he
had
seen
a
badge
just
like
this
on
Percys
chest
on
his
very
first
day
at
Hogwarts
the
door
banged
open
hermione
came
tearing
into
the
room
her
cheeks
flushed
and
her
hair
flying
there
was
an
envelope
in
her
hand
did
you
did
you
get
she
spotted
the
badge
in
Harrys
hand
and
let
out
a
shriek
i
knew
it
she
said
excitedly
brandishing
her
letter
me
too
Harry
me
too
no
said
Harry
quickly
pushing
the
badge
back
into
Rons
hand
its
Ron
not
me
it
what
rons
prefect
not
me
Harry
said
ron
said
Hermione
her
jaw
dropping
but
are
you
sure
i
mean
she
turned
red
as
Ron
looked
round
at
her
with
a
defiant
expression
on
his
face
its
my
name
on
the
letter
he
said
said
Hermione
looking
thoroughly
bewildered
well
wow
well
done
Ron
thats
really
unexpected
said
George
nodding
no
said
Hermione
blushing
harder
than
ever
no
its
not
rons
done
loads
of
hes
really
the
door
behind
her
opened
a
little
wider
and
Mrs
weasley
backed
into
the
room
carrying
a
pile
of
freshly
laundered
robes
ginny
said
the
booklists
had
come
at
last
she
said
glancing
around
at
all
the
envelopes
as
she
made
her
way
over
to
the
bed
and
started
sorting
the
robes
into
two
piles
if
you
give
them
to
me
Ill
take
them
over
to
Diagon
Alley
this
afternoon
and
get
your
books
while
youre
packing
ron
Ill
have
to
get
you
more
pajamas

at
least
six
inches
too
short
I
cant
believe
how
fast
youre
growing
what
color
would
you
like
get
him
red
and
gold
to
match
his
badge
said
George
smirking
match
his
what
said
Mrs
weasley
absently
rolling
up
a
pair
of
maroon
socks
and
placing
them
on
Rons
pile
his
badge
said
Fred
with
the
air
of
getting
the
worst
over
quickly
his
lovely
shiny
new
prefects
badge
freds
words
took
a
moment
to
penetrate
Mrs
weasleys
preoccupation
with
pajamas
his
but
ron
youre
not
ron
held
up
his
badge
mrs
weasley
let
out
a
shriek
just
like
Hermiones
i
dont
believe

i
dont
believe
it
oh
Ron
how
wonderful
a
prefect

everyone
in
the
family

Fred
and
I
next-door
neighbors
said
George
indignantly
as
his
mother
pushed
him
aside
and
flung
her
arms
around
her
youngest
son
wait
until
your
father
hears
ron
Im
so
proud
of
you
what

news

Boy
just
like
Bill
and
Percy
its

first
step
oh
what
a
thing
to
happen
in
the
middle
of
all
this
worry
Im
just
thrilled
oh
Ronnie
fred
and
George
were
both
making
loud
retching
noises
behind
her
back
but
Mrs
weasley
did
not
notice
arms
tight
around
Rons
neck
she
was
kissing
him
all
over
his
face
which
had
turned
a
brighter
scarlet
than
his
badge
mum
dont
mum
get
a
grip
he
muttered
trying
to
push
her
away
she
let
go
of
him
and
said
breathlessly
Well
what
will
it
be
we
gave
Percy
an
owl
but
youve
already
got
one
of
course
w-what
do
you
mean
said
Ron
looking
as
though
he
did
not
dare
believe
his
ears
youve
got
to
have
a
reward
for
this
said
Mrs
weasley
fondly
how
about
a
nice
new
set
of
dress
robes
weve
already
bought
him
some
said
Fred
sourly
who
looked
as
though
he
sincerely
regretted
this
generosity
or
a
new
cauldron
Charlies
old
ones
rusting
through
or
a
new
rat
you
always
liked
Scabbers
mum
said
Ron
hopefully
can
I
have
a
new
broom
mrs
weasleys
face
fell
slightly
broomsticks
were
expensive
not
a
really
good
one
ron
hastened
to
add
just
just
a
new
one
for
a
change
mrs
weasley
hesitated
then
smiled
of
course
you
can
well
Id
better
get
going
if
Ive
got
a
broom
to
buy
too
ill
see
you
all
later
little
Ronnie

prefect
and

to
pack
your
trunks
a
prefect
oh
Im
all
of
a
dither
she
gave
Ron
yet
another
kiss
on
the
cheek
sniffed
loudly
and
bustled
from
the
room
fred
and
George
exchanged
looks
you
dont
mind
if
we
dont
kiss
you
do
you
Ron
said
Fred
in
a
falsely
anxious
voice
we
could
curtsey
if
you
like
said
George
oh
shut
up
said
Ron
scowling
at
them
or
what
said
Fred
an
evil
grin
spreading
across
his
face
going
to
put
us
in
detention
id
love
to
see
him
try
sniggered
George
he
could
if
you
dont
watch

said
Hermione
angrily
fred
and
George
burst
out
laughing
and
Ron
muttered
Drop

Hermione

going
to
have
to
watch
our
step
George
said
Fred
pretending
to
tremble
with
these
two
on
our
case
yeah
it
looks
like
our
law-breaking
days
are
finally
over
said
George
shaking
his
head
and
with
another
loud
crack
the
twins
Disapparated
those
two
said
Hermione
furiously
staring
up
at
the
ceiling
through
which
they
could
now
hear
Fred
and
George
roaring
with
laughter
in
the
room
upstairs
dont
pay
any
attention
to
them
Ron
theyre
only
jealous
i
dont
think
they
are
said
Ron
doubtfully
also
looking
up
at
the
ceiling
theyve
always
said
only
prats
become
prefects
still
he
added
on
a
happier
note
theyve
never
had
new
brooms
i
wish
I
could
go
with
Mum
and
choose
shell
never
be
able
to
afford
a
Nimbus
but
theres
the
new
Cleansweep
out
thatd
be
great
yeah
I
think
Ill
go
and
tell
her
I
like
the
Cleansweep
just
so
she
knows
he
dashed
from
the
room
leaving
Harry
and
Hermione
alone
for
some
reason
Harry
found
he
did
not
want
to
look
at
Hermione
he
turned
to
his
bed
picked
up
the
pile
of
clean
robes
Mrs
weasley
had
laid
on
it
and
crossed
the
room
to
his
trunk
harry
said
Hermione
tentatively
well
done
Hermione
said
Harry
so
heartily
it
did
not
sound
like
his
voice
at
all
and
still
not
looking
at
her
brilliant
prefect
great
thanks
said
Hermione
erm
Harry
could
I
borrow
Hedwig
so
I
can
tell
Mum
and
Dad
theyll
be
really
pleased
I
mean
prefect
is
something
they
can
understand
yeah
no
problem
said
Harry
still
in
the
horrible
hearty
voice
that
did
not
belong
to
him
take
her
he
leaned
over
his
trunk
laid
the
robes
on
the
bottom
of
it
and
pretended
to
be
rummaging
for
something
while
Hermione
crossed
to
the
wardrobe
and
called
Hedwig
down
a
few
moments
passed
Harry
heard
the
door
close
but
remained
bent
double
listening
the
only
sounds
he
could
hear
were
the
blank
picture
on
the
wall
sniggering
again
and
the
wastepaper
basket
in
the
corner
coughing
up
the
owl
droppings
he
straightened
up
and
looked
behind
him
hermione
had
left
and
Hedwig
had
gone
harry
hurried
across
the
room
closed
the
door
then
returned
slowly
to
his
bed
and
sank
on
to
it
gazing
unseeingly
at
the
foot
of
the
wardrobe
he
had
forgotten
completely
about
prefects
being
chosen
in
the
fifth
year
he
had
been
too
anxious
about
the
possibility
of
being
expelled
to
spare
a
thought
for
the
fact
that
badges
must
be
winging
their
way
towards
certain
people
but
if
he
had
remembered
if
he
had
thought
about
it
what
would
he
have
expected
not
this
said
a
small
and
truthful
voice
inside
his
head
harry
screwed
up
his
face
and
buried
it
in
his
hands
he
could
not
lie
to
himself
if
he
had
known
the
prefect
badge
was
on
its
way
he
would
have
expected
it
to
come
to
him
not
Ron
did
this
make
him
as
arrogant
as
Draco
Malfoy
did
he
think
himself
superior
to
everyone
else
did
he
really
believe
he
was
better
than
Ron
no
said
the
small
voice
defiantly
was
that
true
harry
wondered
anxiously
probing
his
own
feelings
im
better
at
Quidditch
said
the
voice
but
Im
not
better
at
anything
else
that
was
definitely
true
Harry
thought
he
was
no
better
than
Ron
in
lessons
but
what
about
outside
lessons
what
about
those
adventures
he
Ron
and
Hermione
had
had
together
since
starting
at
Hogwarts
often
risking
much
worse
than
expulsion
well
Ron
and
Hermione
were
with
me
most
of
the
time
said
the
voice
in
Harrys
head
not
all
the
time
though
Harry
argued
with
himself
they
didnt
fight
Quirrell
with
me
they
didnt
take
on
Riddle
and
the
Basilisk
they
didnt
get
rid
of
all
those
Dementors
the
night
Sirius
escaped
they
werent
in
that
graveyard
with
me
the
night
Voldemort
returned
and
the
same
feeling
of
ill-usage
that
had
overwhelmed
him
on
the
night
he
had
arrived
rose
again
ive
definitely
done
more
Harry
thought
indignantly
ive
done
more
than
either
of
them
but
maybe
said
the
small
voice
fairly
maybe
Dumbledore
doesnt
choose
prefects
because
theyve
got
themselves
into
a
load
of
dangerous
situations
maybe
he
chooses
them
for
other
reasons
ron
must
have
something
you
dont
harry
opened
his
eyes
and
stared
through
his
fingers
at
the
wardrobes
clawed
feet
remembering
what
Fred
had
said
No
one
in
their
right
mind
would
make
Ron
a
prefect
harry
gave
a
small
snort
of
laughter
a
second
later
he
felt
sickened
with
himself
ron
had
not
asked
Dumbledore
to
give
him
the
prefect
badge
this
was
not
Rons
fault
was
he
harry
Rons
best
friend
in
the
world
going
to
sulk
because
he
didnt
have
a
badge
laugh
with
the
twins
behind
Rons
back
ruin
this
for
Ron
when
for
the
first
time
he
had
beaten
Harry
at
something
at
this
point
Harry
heard
Rons
footsteps
on
the
stairs
again
he
stood
up
straightened
his
glasses
and
hitched
a
grin
on
to
his
face
as
Ron
bounded
back
through
the
door
just
caught
her
he
said
happily
she
says
shell
get
the
Cleansweep
if
she
can
cool
Harry
said
and
he
was
relieved
to
hear
that
his
voice
had
stopped
sounding
hearty
listen
Ron
well
done
mate
the
smile
faded
off
Rons
face
i
never
thought
it
would
be
me
he
said
shaking
his
head
i
thought
it
would
be
you
nah
Ive
caused
too
much
trouble
Harry
said
echoing
Fred
yeah
said
Ron
yeah
I
suppose
well
wed
better
get
our
trunks
packed
hadnt
we
it
was
odd
how
widely
their
possessions
seemed
to
have
scattered
themselves
since
they
had
arrived
it
took
them
most
of
the
afternoon
to
retrieve
their
books
and
belongings
from
all
over
the
house
and
stow
them
back
inside
their
school
trunks
harry
noticed
that
Ron
kept
moving
his
prefects
badge
around
first
placing
it
on
his
bedside
table
then
putting
it
into
his
jeans
pocket
then
taking
it
out
and
lying
it
on
his
folded
robes
as
though
to
see
the
effect
of
the
red
on
the
black
only
when
Fred
and
George
dropped
in
and
offered
to
attach
it
to
his
forehead
with
a
permanent
Sticking
Charm
did
he
wrap
it
tenderly
in
his
maroon
socks
and
lock
it
in
his
trunk
mrs
weasley
returned
from
Diagon
Alley
around
six
oclock
laden
with
books
and
carrying
a
long
package
wrapped
in
thick
brown
paper
that
Ron
took
from
her
with
a
moan
of
longing
never
mind
unwrapping
it
now
people
are
arriving
for
dinner
I
want
you
all
downstairs
she
said
but
the
moment
she
was
out
of
sight
Ron
ripped
off
the
paper
in
a
frenzy
and
examined
every
inch
of
his
new
broom
an
ecstatic
expression
on
his
face
down
in
the
basement
Mrs
weasley
had
hung
a
scarlet
banner
over
the
heavily
laden
dinner
table
which
read
congratulations
ron
and
hermione
new
prefects
she
looked
in
a
better
mood
than
Harry
had
seen
her
all
holiday
i
thought
wed
have
a
little
party
not
a
sit-down
dinner
she
told
Harry
Ron
Hermione
Fred
george
and
Ginny
as
they
entered
the
room
your
father
and
Bill
are
on
their
way
Ron
ive
sent
them
both
owls
and
theyre
thrilled
she
added
beaming
fred
rolled
his
eyes
sirius
Lupin
Tonks
and
Kingsley
Shacklebolt
were
already
there
and
Mad-Eye
Moody
stumped
in
shortly
after
Harry
had
got
himself
a
Butterbeer
oh
Alastor
I
am
glad
youre
here
said
Mrs
weasley
brightly
as
Mad-Eye
shrugged
off
his
traveling
cloak
weve
been
wanting
to
ask
you
for
ages
could
you
have
a
look
in
the
writing
desk
in
the
drawing
room
and
tell
us
whats
inside
it
we
havent
wanted
to
open
it
just
in
case
its
something
really
nasty
no
problem
Molly
moodys
electric-blue
eye
swiveled
upwards
and
stared
fixedly
through
the
ceiling
of
the
kitchen
drawing
room
he
growled
as
the
pupil
contracted
desk
in
the
corner
yeah
I
see
it
yeah
its
a
Boggart
want
me
to
go
up
and
get
rid
of
it
Molly
no
no
Ill
do
it
myself
later
beamed
Mrs
weasley
you
have
your
drink
were
having
a
little
bit
of
a
celebration
actually
she
gesture
d
at
the
scarlet
banner
fourth
prefect
in
the
family
she
said
fondly
ruffling
Rons
hair
prefect
eh
growled
Moody
his
normal
eye
on
Ron
and
his
magical
eye
swiveling
around
to
gaze
into
the
side
of
his
head
harry
had
the
very
uncomfortable
feeling
it
was
looking
at
him
and
moved
away
towards
Sirius
and
Lupin
well
congratulations
said
Moody
still
glaring
at
Ron
with
his
normal
eye
authority
figures
always
attract
trouble
but
I
suppose
Dumbledore
thinks
you
can
withstand
most
major
jinxes
or
he
wouldnt
have
appointed
you
ron
looked
rather
startled
at
this
view
of
the
matter
but
was
saved
the
trouble
of
responding
by
the
arrival
of
his
father
and
eldest
brother
mrs
weasley
was
in
such
a
good
mood
she
did
not
even
complain
that
they
had
brought
Mundungus
with
them
he
was
wearing
a
long
overcoat
that
seemed
oddly
lumpy
in
unlikely
places
and
declined
the
offer
to
remove
it
and
put
it
with
moodys
traveling
cloak
well
I
think
a
toast
is
in
order
said
mr.
Weasley
when
everyone
had
a
drink
he
raised
his
goblet
to
Ron
and
Hermione
the
new
Gryffindor
prefects
ron
and
Hermione
beamed
as
everyone
drank
to
them
and
then
applauded
i
was
never
a
prefect
myself
said
Tonks
brightly
from
behind
Harry
as
everybody
moved
towards
the
table
to
help
themselves
to
food
her
hair
was
tomato
red
and
waist-length
today
she
looked
like
Ginnys
older
sister
my
Head
of
House
said
I
lacked
certain
necessary
qualities
like
what
said
Ginny
who
was
choosing
a
baked
potato
like
the
ability
to
behave
myself
said
Tonks
ginny
laughed
Hermione
looked
as
though
she
did
not
know
whether
to
smile
or
not
and
compromised
by
taking
an
extra
large
gulp
of
Butterbeer
and
choking
on
it
what
about
you
Sirius
ginny
asked
thumping
Hermione
on
the
back
sirius
who
was
right
beside
Harry
let
out
his
usual
bark-like
laugh
no
one
would
have
made
me
a
prefect
I
spent
too
much
time
in
detention
with
James
lupin
was
the
good
boy
he
got
the
badge
i
think
Dumbledore
might
have
hoped
I
would
be
able
to
exercise
some
control
over
my
best
friends
said
Lupin
i
need
scarcely
say
that
I
failed
dismally
harrys
mood
suddenly
lifted
his
father
had
not
been
a
prefect
either
all
at
once
the
party
seemed
much
more
enjoyable
he
loaded
up
his
plate
feeling
doubly
fond
of
everyone
in
the
room
ron
was
rhapsodizing
about
his
new
broom
to
anybody
who
would
listen
nought
to
seventy
in
ten
seconds
not
bad
is
it
when
you
think
the
Comet
Two
Ninetys
only
nought
to
sixty
and
thats
with
a
decent
tailwind
according
to
Which
Broomstick
hermione
was
talking
very
earnestly
to
Lupin
about
her
view
of
elf
rights
i
mean
its
the
same
kind
of
nonsense
as
werewolf
segregation
isnt
it
it
all
stems
from
this
horrible
thing
wizards
have
of
thinking
theyre
superior
to
other
creatures
mrs
weasley
and
Bill
were
having
their
usual
argument
about
Bills
hair
getting
really
out
of
hand
and
youre
so
good-looking
it
would
look
much
better
shorter
wouldnt
it
Harry
oh
I
dunno
said
Harry
slightly
alarmed
at
being
asked
his
opinion
he
slid
away
from
them
in
the
direction
of
Fred
and
George
who
were
huddled
in
a
corner
with
Mundungus
mundungus
stopped
talking
when
he
saw
Harry
but
Fred
winked
and
beckoned
Harry
closer
its
okay
he
told
Mundungus
we
can
trust
Harry
hes
our
financial
backer
look
what
Dungs
got
us
said
George
holding
out
his
hand
to
Harry
it
was
full
of
what
looked
like
shriveled
black
pods
a
faint
rattling
noise
was
coming
from
them
even
though
they
were
completely
stationary
venomous
Tentacula
seeds
said
George
we
need
them
for
the
Skiving
Snackboxes
but
theyre
a
Class
C
Non-Tradable
Substance
so
weve
been
having
a
bit
of
trouble
getting
hold
of
them
ten
Galleons
the
lot
then
Dung
said
Fred
wiv
all
the
trouble
I
went
to
to
get
em
said
Mundungus
his
saggy
bloodshot
eyes
stretching
even
wider
im
sorry
lads
but
Im
not
taking
a
Knut
under
twenty
dung
likes
his
little
joke
Fred
said
to
Harry
yeah
his
best
one
so
far
has
been
six
Sickles
for
a
bag
of
Knarl
quills
said
George
be
careful
Harry
warned
them
quietly
what
said
Fred
mums
busy
cooing
over
Prefect
Ron
were
okay
but
Moody
could
have
his
eye
on
you
Harry
pointed
out
mundungus
looked
nervously
over
his
shoulder
good
point
that
he
grunted
all
right
lads
ten
it
is
if
youll
take
em
quick
cheers
Harry
said
Fred
delightedly
when
Mundungus
had
emptied
his
pockets
into
the
twins
outstretched
hands
and
scuttled
off
towards
the
food
wed
better
get
these
upstairs
harry
watched
them
go
feeling
slightly
uneasy
it
had
just
occurred
to
him
that
mr.
and
Mrs
weasley
would
want
to
know
how
Fred
and
George
were
financing
their
joke
shop
business
when
as
was
inevitable
they
finally
found
out
about
it
giving
the
twins
his
Triwizard
winnings
had
seemed
a
simple
thing
to
do
at
the
time
but
what
if
it
led
to
another
family
row
and
a
Percylike
estrangement
would
Mrs
weasley
still
feel
that
Harry
was
as
good
as
her
son
if
she
found
out
he
had
made
it
possible
for
Fred
and
George
to
start
a
career
she
thought
quite
unsuitable
standing
where
the
twins
had
left
him
with
nothing
but
a
guilty
weight
in
the
pit
of
his
stomach
for
company
Harry
caught
the
sound
of
his
own
name
kingsley
Shacklebolts
deep
voice
was
audible
even
over
the
surrounding
chatter
why
Dumbledore
didnt
make
Potter
a
prefect
said
Kingsley
hell
have
had
his
reasons
replied
Lupin
but
it
wouldve
shown
confidence
in
him
its
what
Idve
done
persisted
Kingsley
specially
with
the
Daily
Prophet
having
a
go
at
him
every
few
days
harry
did
not
look
round
he
did
not
want
Lupin
or
Kingsley
to
know
he
had
heard
though
not
remotely
hungry
he
followed
Mundungus
back
towards
the
table
his
pleasure
in
the
party
had
evaporated
as
quickly
as
it
had
come
he
wished
he
were
upstairs
in
bed
mad-Eye
Moody
was
sniffing
at
a
chicken-leg
with
what
remained
of
his
nose
evidently
he
could
not
detect
any
trace
of
poison
because
he
then
tore
a
strip
off
it
with
his
teeth
the
handles
made
of
Spanish
oak
with
anti-jinx
varnish
and
in-built
vibration
control
Ron
was
saying
to
Tonks
mrs
weasley
yawned
widely
well
I
think
Ill
sort
out
that
Boggart
before
I
turn
in
arthur
I
dont
want
this
lot
up
too
late
all
right
night
Harry
dear
she
left
the
kitchen
harry
set
down
his
plate
and
wondered
whether
he
could
follow
her
without
attracting
attention
you
all
right
Potter
grunted
Moody
yeah
fine
lied
Harry
moody
took
a
swig
from
his
hipflask
his
electric-blue
eye
staring
sideways
at
Harry
come
here
Ive
got
something
that
might
interest
you
he
said
from
an
inner
pocket
of
his
robes
Moody
pulled
a
very
tattered
old
wizarding
photograph
original
Order
of
the
Phoenix
growled
Moody
found
it
last
night
when
I
was
looking
for
my
spare
Invisibility
Cloak
seeing
as
Podmore
hasnt
had
the
manners
to
return
my
best
one
thought
people
might
like
to
see
it
harry
took
the
photograph
a
small
crowd
of
people
some
waving
at
him
others
lifting
their
glasses
looked
back
up
at
him
theres
me
said
Moody
unnecessarily
pointing
at
himself
the
Moody
in
the
picture
was
unmistakable
though
his
hair
was
slightly
less
grey
and
his
nose
was
intact
and
theres
dumbledore
beside
me
Dedalus
Diggle
on
the
other
side
thats
Marlene
McKinnon
she
was
killed
two
weeks
after
this
was
taken
they
got
her
whole
family
thats
Frank
and
Alice
longbottom
harrys
stomach
already
uncomfortable
clenched
as
he
looked
at
Alice
Longbottom
he
knew
her
round
friendly
face
very
well
even
though
he
had
never
met
her
because
she
was
the
image
of
her
son
Neville
poor
devils
growled
Moody
better
dead
than
what
happened
to
them
and
thats
emmeline
Vance
youve
met
her
and
that
theres
Lupin
obviously
benjy
Fenwick
he
copped
it
too
we
only
ever
found
bits
of
him
shift
aside
there
he
added
poking
the
picture
and
the
little
photographic
people
edged
sideways
so
that
those
who
were
partially
obscured
could
move
to
the
front
thats
Edgar
Bones
brother
of
Amelia
Bones
they
got
him
and
his

stupid
hat
gideon
Prewett
it
took
five
Death
Eaters
to
kill
him
and
his
brother
Fabian
they
fought
like
heroes
budge
along
budge
along
the
little
people
in
the
photograph
jostled
among
themselves
and
those
hidden
right
at
the
back
appeared
at
the
forefront
of
the
picture
thats
Dumbledores
brother
Aberforth
only
time
I
ever
met
him
strange
bloke
thats
dorcas
Meadowes
Voldemort
killed
her
personally
sirius
when
he
still
had
short
hair
and
there
you
go
thought
that
would
interest
you
harrys
heart
turned
over
his
mother
and
father
were
beaming
up
at
him
sitting
on
either
side
of
a
small
watery-eyed
man
whom
Harry
recognized
at
once
as
Wormtail
the
one
who
had
betrayed
his
parents
whereabouts
to
Voldemort
and
so
helped
to
bring
about
their
deaths
eh
said
Moody
harry
looked
up
into
Moodys
heavily
scarred
and
pitted
face
evidently
Moody
was
under
the
impression
he
had
just
given
Harry
a
bit
of
a
treat
yeah
said
Harry
once
again
attempting
to
grin
er
listen
Ive
just
remembered
I
havent
packed
my
he
was
spared
the
trouble
of
inventing
an
object
he
had
not
packed
sirius
had
just
said
Whats
that
youve
got
there
Mad-Eye
and
Moody
had
turned
towards
him
harry
crossed
the
kitchen
slipped
through
the
door
and
up
the
stairs
before
anyone
could
call
him
back
he
did
not
know
why
it
had
been
such
a
shock
he
had
seen
pictures
of
his
parents
before
after
all
and
he
had
met
Wormtail
but
to
have
them
sprung
on
him
like
that
when
he
was
least
expecting
it
no
one
would
like
that
he
thought
angrily
and
then
to
see
them
surrounded
by
all
those
other
happy
faces
benjy
Fenwick
who
had
been
found
in
bits
and
Gideon
Prewett
who
had
died
like
a
hero
and
the
Longbottoms
who
had
been
tortured
into
madness
all
waving
happily
out
of
the
photograph
forever
more
not
knowing
that
they
were
doomed
well
Moody
might
find
that
interesting
he
Harry
found
it
disturbing
harry
tiptoed
up
the
stairs
in
the
hall
past
the
stuffed
elf-heads
glad
to
be
on
his
own
again
but
as
he
approached
the
first
landing
he
heard
noises
someone
was
sobbing
in
the
drawing
room
hello
harry
said
there
was
no
answer
but
the
sobbing
continued
he
climbed
the
remaining
stairs
two
at
a
time
walked
across
the
landing
and
opened
the
drawing-room
door
someone
was
cowering
against
the
dark
wall
her
wand
in
her
hand
her
whole
body
shaking
with
sobs
sprawled
on
the
dusty
old
carpet
in
a
patch
of
moonlight
clearly
dead
was
Ron
all
the
air
seemed
to
vanish
from
Harrys
lungs
he
felt
as
though
he
were
falling
through
the
floor
his
brain
turned
icy
cold
Ron
dead
no
it
couldnt
be
but
wait
a

into
the

by
Sirius
with
Moody
stumping
along
behind
them
lupin
looked
from
Mrs
weasley
to
the
dead
Harry
on
the
floor
and
seemed
to
understand
in
an
instant
pulling
out
his
own
wand
he
said
very
firmly
and
clearly
riddikulus
harrys
body
vanished
a
silvery
orb
hung
in
the
air
over
the
spot
where
it
had
lain
lupin
waved
his
wand
once
more
and
the
orb
vanished
in
a
puff
of
smoke
oh
oh
oh
gulped
Mrs
weasley
and
she
broke
into
a
storm
of
crying
her
face
in
her
hands
molly

Lupin
bleakly
walking
over
to
her
molly

Lupins

staring
at
the
patch
of
carpet
where
the
Boggart
pretending
to
be
Harrys
body
had
lain
moody
was
looking
at
Harry
who
avoided
his
gaze
he
had
a
funny
feeling
Moodys
magical
eye
had
followed
him
all
the
way
out
of
the
kitchen
d-d

Arthur
Mrs

Harry
trying
to
smile

said
tears
spilling
out
of
her
eyes
again
half
the
f
f
familys
in
the
Order
itll
b
b
be
a
miracle
if

I

said
Lupin
firmly
this
isnt
like
last
time
the
Order
are
better
prepared
weve
got
a
head
start
we
know
what
Voldemorts
up
to
mrs
weasley
gave
a
little
squeak
of
fright
at
the
sound
of
the
name
oh
Molly
come
on
its
about
time
you
got
used
to
hearing
his
name
look
I
cant
promise
no
ones
going
to
get
hurt
nobody
can
promise
that
but
were
much
better
off
than
we
were
last
time
you
werent
in
the
Order
then
you
dont
understand
last
time
we
were
outnumbered
twenty
to
one
by
the
Death
Eaters
and
they
were
picking
us
off
one
by
one
harry
thought
of
the
photograph
again
of
his
parents
beaming
faces
he
knew
Moody
was
still
watching
him
dont
worry
about
Percy
said
Sirius
abruptly
hell
come
round
its
only
a
matter
of
time
before
Voldemort
moves
into
the
open
once
he
does
the
whole
Ministrys
going
to
be
begging
us
to
forgive
them
and
Im
not
sure
Ill
be
accepting
their
apology
he
added
bitterly
and
as
for
whos
going
to
look
after
Ron
and
Ginny
if
you
and
Arthur
died
said
Lupin
smiling
slightly
what
do
you
think
wed
do
let
them
starve
mrs
weasley
smiled
tremulously
being
silly
she
muttered
again
mopping
her
eyes
but
Harry
closing
his
bedroom
door
behind
him
some
ten
minutes
later
could
not
think
Mrs
weasley
silly
he
could
still
see
his
parents
beaming
up
at
him
from
the
tattered
old
photograph
unaware
that
their
lives
like
so
many
of
those
around
them
were
drawing
to
a
close
the
image
of
the
Boggart
posing
as
the
corpse
of
each
member
of
Mrs
weasleys
family
in
turn
kept
flashing
before
his
eyes
without
warning
the
scar
on
his
forehead
seared
with
pain
again
and
his
stomach
churned
horribly
cut
it
out
he
said
firmly
rubbing
the
scar
as
the
pain
receded
first
sign
of
madness
talking
to
your
own
head
said
a
sly
voice
from
the
empty
picture
on
the
wall
harry
ignored
it
he
felt
older
than
he
had
ever
felt
in
his
life
and
it
seemed
extraordinary
to
him
that
barely
an
hour
ago
he
had
been
worried
about
a
joke
shop
and
who
had
got
a
prefects
badge
chapter
ten
luna
Lovegood
harry
had
a
troubled
nights
sleep
his
parents
wove
in
and
out
of
his
dreams
never
speaking
mrs
weasley
sobbed
over
Kreachers
dead
body
watched
by
Ron
and
Hermione
who
were
wearing
crowns
and
yet
again
Harry
found
himself
walking
down
a
corridor
ending
in
a
locked
door
he
awoke
abruptly
with
his
scar
prickling
to
find
Ron
already
dressed
and
talking
to
him
better
hurry
up
Mums
going
ballistic
she
says
were
going
to
miss
the
train
there
was
a
lot
of
commotion
in
the
house
from
what
he
heard
as
he
dressed
at
top
speed
harry
gathered
that
Fred
and
George
had
bewitched
their
trunks
to
fly
downstairs
to
save
the
bother
of
carrying
them
with
the
result
that
they
had
hurtled
straight
into
Ginny
and
knocked
her
down
two
flights
of
stairs
into
the
hall
Mrs
black
and
Mrs
weasley
were
both
screaming
at
the
top
of
their
voices
could
have
done
her
A
serious
injury
you
idiots
filthy
half-breeds
besmirching
the
house
of
my
fathers
hermione
came
hurrying
into
the
room
looking
flustered
just
as
Harry
was
putting
on
his
trainers
hedwig
was
swaying
on
her
shoulder
and
she
was
carrying
a
squirming
Crookshanks
in
her
arms
mum
and
Dad
just
sent
Hedwig
back
the
owl
fluttered
obligingly
over
and
perched
on
top
of
her
cage
are
you
ready
yet
nearly
is
Ginny
all
right
harry
asked
shoving
on
his
glasses
mrs
weasleys
patched
her
up
said
Hermione
but
now
Mad-Eyes
complaining
that
we
cant
leave
unless
Sturgis
Podmores
here
otherwise
the
guard
will
be
one
short
guard
said
Harry
we
have
to
go
to
Kings
Cross
with
a
guard
you
have
to
go
to
Kings
Cross
with
a
guard
Hermione
corrected
him
why
said
Harry
irritably
i
thought
Voldemort
was
supposed
to
be
lying
low
or
are
you
telling
me
hes
going
to
jump
out
from
behind
a
dustbin
to
try
and
do
me
in
i
dont
know
its
just
what
Mad-Eye
says
said
Hermione
distractedly
looking
at
her
watch
but
if
we
dont
leave
soon
were
definitely
going
to
miss
the
train
will
you
lot
get
down
here
now
please
mrs
weasley
bellowed
and
Hermione
jumped
as
though
scalded
and
hurried
out
of
the
room
harry
seized
Hedwig
stuffed
her
unceremoniously
into
her
cage
and
set
off
downstairs
after
Hermione
dragging
his
trunk
mrs
blacks
portrait
was
howling
with
rage
but
nobody
was
bothering
to
close
the
curtains
over
her
all
the
noise
in
the
hall
was
bound
to
rouse
her
again
anyway
harry
youre
to
come
with
me
and
Tonks
shouted
Mrs
weasley
over
the
repeated
screeches
of
mudbloods
scum
creatures
of
dirt
Leave
your
trunk
and
your
owl
alastors
going
to
deal
with
the
luggage
oh
for
heavens
sake
Sirius
Dumbledore
said
no
a
bear-like
black
dog
had
appeared
at
Harrys
side
as
he
was
clambering
over
the
various
trunks
cluttering
the
hall
to
get
to
Mrs
weasley
oh
honestly
said
Mrs
weasley
despairingly
well
on
your
own
head
be
it
she
wrenched
open
the
front
door
and
stepped
out
into
the
weak
September
sunlight
harry
and
the
dog
followed
her
the
door
slammed
behind
them
and
Mrs
blacks
screeches
were
cut
off
instantly
wheres
Tonks
harry
said
looking
round
as
they
went
down
the
stone
steps
of
number
twelve
which
vanished
the
moment
they
reached
the
pavement
shes
waiting
for
us
just
up
here
said
Mrs
weasley
stiffly
averting
her
eyes
from
the
lolloping
black
dog
beside
Harry
an
old
woman
greeted
them
on
the
corner
she
had
tightly
curled
grey
hair
and
wore
a
purple
hat
shaped
like
a
pork
pie
wotcher
Harry
she
said
winking
better
hurry
up
hadnt
we
Molly
she
added
checking
her
watch
i
know
I
know
moaned
Mrs
weasley
lengthening
her
stride
but
Mad-Eye
wanted
to
wait
for
Sturgis
if
only
Arthur
could
have
got
us
cars
from
the
Ministry
again
but
Fudge
wont
let
him
borrow
so
much
as
an
empty
ink
bottle
these
days
how
Muggles
can
stand
traveling
without
magic
but
the
great
black
dog
gave
a
joyful
bark
and
gamboled
around
them
snapping
at
pigeons
and
chasing
its
own
tail
harry
couldnt
help
laughing
sirius
had
been
trapped
inside
for
a
very
long
time
mrs
weasley
pursed
her
lips
in
an
almost
Aunt
petunia-ish
way
it
took
them
twenty
minutes
to
reach
Kings
Cross
on
foot
and
nothing
more
eventful
happened
during
that
time
than
Sirius
scaring
a
couple
of
cats
for
Harrys
entertainment
once
inside
the
station
they
lingered
casually
beside
the
barrier
between
platforms
nine
and
ten
until
the
coast
was
clear
then
each
of
them
leaned
against
it
in
turn
and
fell
easily
through
on
to
platform
nine
and
three-quarters
where
the
Hogwarts
Express
stood
belching
sooty
steam
over
a
platform
packed
with
departing
students
and
their
families
harry
inhaled
the
familiar
smell
and
felt
his
spirits
soar
he
was
really
going
back
i
hope
the
others
make
it
in
time
said
Mrs
weasley
anxiously
staring
behind
her
at
the
wrought-iron
arch
spanning
the
platform
through
which
new
arrivals
would
come
nice
dog
Harry
called
a
tall
boy
with
dreadlocks
thanks
Lee
said
Harry
grinning
as
Sirius
wagged
his
tail
frantically
oh
good
said
Mrs
weasley
sounding
relieved
heres
Alastor
with
the
luggage
look
a
porters
cap
pulled
low
over
his
mismatched
eyes
Moody
came
limping
through
the
archway
pushing
a
trolley
loaded
with
their
trunks
all
okay
he
muttered
to
Mrs
weasley
and
Tonks
dont
think
we
were
followed
seconds
later
mr.
Weasley
emerged
on
to
the
platform
with
Ron
and
Hermione
they
had
almost
unloaded
Moodys
luggage
trolley
when
Fred
George
and
Ginny
turned
up
with
Lupin
no
trouble
growled
Moody
nothing
said
Lupin
ill
still
be
reporting
Sturgis
to
Dumbledore
said
Moody
thats
the
second
time
hes
not
turned
up
in
a
week
getting
as
unreliable
as
Mundungus
well
look
after
yourselves
said
Lupin
shaking
hands
all
round
he
reached
Harry
last
and
gave
him
a
clap
on
the
shoulder
you
too
Harry
be
careful
yeah
keep
your
head
down
and
your
eyes
peeled
said
Moody
shaking
Harrys
hand
too
and
dont
forget
all
of
you

what
you
put
in
writing
if
in
doubt
dont
put
it
in
a
letter

meeting
all
of
you
said
Tonks
hugging
Hermione
and
Ginny
Well
see
you
soon
I
expect
a
warning
whistle
sounded
the
students
still
on
the
platform
started
hurrying
on
to
the
train
quick
quick
said
Mrs
weasley
distractedly
hugging
them
at
random
and
catching
Harry
twice
write
be
good
if
youve
forgotten
anything
well
send
it
on
on
to
the
train
now
hurry
for
one
brief
moment
the
great
black
dog
reared
on
to
its
hind
legs
and
placed
its
front
paws
on
harrys
shoulders
but
Mrs
weasley
shoved
Harry
away
towards
the
train
door
hissing
For
heavens
sake
act
more
like
a
dog
Sirius
see
you
harry
called
out
of
the
open
window
as
the
train
began
to
move
while
Ron
hermione
and
Ginny
waved
beside
him
the
figures
of
Tonks
Lupin
Moody
and
mr.
and
Mrs
weasley
shrank
rapidly
but
the
black
dog
was
bounding
alongside
the
window
wagging
its
tail
blurred
people
on
the
platform
were
laughing
to
see
it
chasing
the
train
then
they
rounded
a
bend
and
Sirius
was
gone
he
shouldnt
have
come
with
us
said
Hermione
in
a
worried
voice
oh
lighten
up
said
Ron
he
hasnt
seen
daylight
for
months
poor
bloke
well
said
Fred
clapping
his
hands
together
cant
stand
around
chatting
all
day
weve
got
business
to
discuss
with
Lee
see
you
later
and
he
and
George
disappeared
down
the
corridor
to
the
right
the
train
was
gathering
still
more
speed
so
that
the
houses
outside
the
window
flashed
past
and
they
swayed
where
they
stood
shall
we
go
and
find
a
compartment
then
harry
asked
ron
and
Hermione
exchanged
looks
er
said
Ron
were
well
Ron
and
I
are
supposed
to
go
into
the
prefect
carriage
Hermione
said
awkwardly
ron
wasnt
looking
at
Harry
he
seemed
to
have
become
intensely
interested
in
the
fingernails
on
his
left
hand
oh
said
Harry
right
fine
i
dont
think
well
have
to
stay
there
all
journey
said
Hermione
quickly
our
letters
said
we
just
get
instructions
from
the
Head
Boy
and
Girl
and
then
patrol
the
corridors
from
time
to
time
fine
said
Harry
again
well
I
I
might
see
you
later
then
yeah
definitely
said
Ron
casting
a
shifty
anxious
look
at
Harry
its
a
pain
having
to
go
down
there
Id
rather
but
we
have
to
I
mean
Im
not
enjoying
it
Im
not
Percy
he
finished
defiantly
i
know
youre
not
said
Harry
and
he
grinned
but
as
Hermione
and
Ron
dragged
their
trunks
crookshanks
and
a
caged
Pigwidgeon
off
towards
the
engine
end
of
the
train
Harry
felt
an
odd
sense
of
loss
he
had
never
traveled
on
the
Hogwarts
Express
without
Ron
come
on
Ginny
told
him
if
we
get
a
move
on
well
be
able
to
save
them
places
right
said
Harry
picking
up
Hedwigs
cage
in
one
hand
and
the
handle
of
his
trunk
in
the
other
they
struggled
off
down
the
corridor
peering
through
the
glass-paneled
doors
into
the
compartments
they
passed
which
were
already
full
harry
could
not
help
noticing
that
a
lot
of
people
stared
back
at
him
with
great
interest
and
that
several
of
them
nudged
their
neighbors
and
pointed
him
out
after
he
had
met
this
behavior
in
five
consecutive
carriages
he
remembered
that
the
Daily
Prophet
had
been
telling
its
readers
all
summer
what
a
lying
show-off
he
was
he
wondered
dully
whether
the
people
now
staring
and
whispering
believed
the
stories
in
the
very
last
carriage
they
met
Neville
Longbottom
Harrys
fellow
fifth-year
Gryffindor
his
round
face
shining
with
the
effort
of
pulling
his
trunk
along
and
maintaining
a
one-handed
grip
on
his
struggling
toad
Trevor
hi
Harry
he
panted
hi
Ginny
everywheres
full
i
cant
find
a
seat
what
are
you
talking
about
said
Ginny
who
had
squeezed
past
Neville
to
peer
into
the
compartment
behind
him
theres
room
in
this
one
theres
only
Loony
Lovegood
in
here
neville
mumbled
something
about
not
wanting
to
disturb
anyone
dont
be
silly
said
Ginny
laughing
shes
all
right
she
slid
the
door
open
and
pulled
her
trunk
inside
harry
and
Neville
followed
hi
Luna
said
Ginny
is
it
okay
if
we
take
these
seats
the
girl
beside
the
window
looked
up
she
had
straggly
waist-length
dirty
blonde
hair
very
pale
eyebrows
and
protuberant
eyes
that
gave
her
a
permanently
surprised
look
harry
knew
at
once
why
Neville
had
chosen
to
pass
this
compartment
by
the
girl
gave
off
an
aura
of
distinct
dottiness
perhaps
it
was
the
fact
that
she
had
stuck
her
wand
behind
her
left
ear
for
safekeeping
or
that
she
had
chosen
to
wear
a
necklace
of
Butterbeer
corks
or
that
she
was
reading
a
magazine
upside-down
her
eyes
ranged
over
Neville
and
came
to
rest
on
Harry
she
nodded
thanks
said
Ginny
smiling
at
her
harry
and
Neville
stowed
the
three
trunks
and
Hedwigs
cage
in
the
luggage
rack
and
sat
down
luna
watched
them
over
her
upside-down
magazine
which
was
called
The
Quibbler
she
did
not
seem
to
need
to
blink
as
much
as
normal
humans
she
stared
and
stared
at
Harry
who
had
taken
the
seat
opposite
her
and
now
wished
he
hadnt
had
a
good
summer
Luna
ginny
asked
yes
said
Luna
dreamily
without
taking
her
eyes
off
Harry
yes
it
was
quite
enjoyable
you
know
youre
Harry
Potter
she
added
i
know
I
am
said
Harry
neville
chuckled
luna
turned
her
pale
eyes
on
him
instead
and
I
dont
know
who
you
are
im
nobody
said
Neville
hurriedly
no
youre
not
said
Ginny
sharply
neville
Longbottom
Luna
Lovegood
lunas
in
my
year
but
in
Ravenclaw
wit
beyond
measure
is
mans
greatest
treasure
said
Luna
in
a
singsong
voice
she
raised
her
upside-down
magazine
high
enough
to
hide
her
face
and
fell
silent
harry
and
neville
looked
at
each
other
with
their
eyebrows
raised
ginny
suppressed
a
giggle
the
train
rattled
onwards
speeding
them
out
into
open
country
it
was
an
odd
unsettled
sort
of
day
one
moment
the
carriage
was
full
of
sunlight
and
the
next
they
were
passing
beneath
ominously
grey
clouds
guess
what
I
got
for
my
birthday
said
Neville
another
Remembrall
said
Harry
remembering
the
marble-like
device
Nevilles
grandmother
had
sent
him
in
an
effort
to
improve
his
abysmal
memory
no
said
Neville
i
could
do
with
one
though
I
lost
the
old
one
ages
ago
no
look
at
this
he
dug
the
hand
that
was
not
keeping
a
firm
grip
on
Trevor
into
his
schoolbag
and
after
a
little
bit
of
rummaging
pulled
out
what
appeared
to
be
a
small
grey
cactus
in
a
pot
except
that
it
was
covered
with
what
looked
like
boils
rather
than
spines
mimbulus
mimbletonia
he
said
proudly
harry
stared
at
the
thing
it
was
pulsating
slightly
giving
it
the
rather
sinister
look
of
some
diseased
internal
organ
its
really
really
rare
said
Neville
beaming
i
dont
know
if
theres
one
in
the
greenhouse
at
hogwarts
even
i
cant
wait
to
show
it
to
Professor
Sprout
my
Great
Uncle
Algie
got
it
for
me
in
Assyria
im
going
to
see
if
I
can
breed
from
it
harry
knew
that
Nevilles
favorite
subject
was
Herbology
but
for
the
life
of
him
he
could
not
see
what
he
would
want
with
this
stunted
little
plant
does
it
er
do
anything
he
asked
loads
of
stuff
said
Neville
proudly
its
got
an
amazing
defensive
mechanism
here
hold
trevor
for
me
he
dumped
the
toad
into
Harrys
lap
and
took
a
quill
from
his
schoolbag
luna
Lovegoods
popping
eyes
appeared
over
the
top
of
her
upside-down
magazine
again
to
watch
what
Neville
was
doing
neville
held
the
Mimbulus
mimbletonia
up
t
o
his
eyes
his
tongue
between
his
teeth
chose
his
spot
and
gave
the
plant
a
sharp
prod
with
the
tip
of
his
quill
liquid
squirted
from
every
boil
on
the
plant
thick
stinking
dark
green
jets
of
it
they
hit
the
ceiling
the
windows
and
spattered
Luna
Lovegoods
magazine
Ginny
who
had
flung
her
arms
up
in
front
of
her
face
just
in
time
merely
looked
as
though
she
was
wearing
a
slimy
green
hat
but
Harry
whose
hands
had
been
busy
preventing
Trevors
escape
received
a
faceful
it
smelled
like
rancid
manure
neville
whose
face
and
torso
were
also
drenched
shook
his
head
to
get
the
worst
out
of
his
eyes
s
sorry
he
gasped
i
havent
tried
that
before
didnt
realize
it
would
be
quite
so
dont
worry
though
Stinksaps
not
poisonous
he
added
nervously
as
Harry
spat
a
mouthful
on
to
the
floor
at
that
precise
moment
the
door
of
their
compartment
slid
open
oh
hello
Harry
said
a
nervous
voice
um
bad
time
harry
wiped
the
lenses
of
his
glasses
with
his
trevor-free
hand
a
very
pretty
girl
with
long
shiny
black
hair
was
standing
in
the
doorway
smiling
at
him
Cho
Chang
the
Seeker
on
the
ravenclaw
Quidditch
team
oh
hi
said
Harry
blankly
um
said
Cho
well
just
thought
Id
say
hello
bye
then
rather
pink
in
the
face
she
closed
the
door
and
departed
harry
slumped
back
in
his
seat
and
groaned
he
would
have
liked
Cho
to
discover
him
sitting
with
a
group
of
very
cool
people
laughing
their
heads
off
at
a
joke
he
had
just
told
he
would
not
have
chosen
to
be
sitting
with
neville
and
Loony
Lovegood
clutching
a
toad
and
dripping
in
Stinksap
never
mind
said
Ginny
bracingly
look
we
can
easily
get
rid
of
all
this
she
pulled
out
her
wand
scourgify
the
Stinksap
vanished
sorry
said
Neville
again
in
a
small
voice
ron
and
Hermione
did
not
turn
up
for
nearly
an
hour
by
which
time
the
food
trolley
had
already
gone
by
harry
Ginny
and
Neville
had
finished
their
pumpkin
pasties
and
were
busy
swapping
chocolate
Frog
Cards
when
the
compartment
door
slid
open
and
they
walked
in
accompanied
by
Crookshanks
and
a
shrilly
hooting
Pigwidgeon
in
his
cage
im
starving
said
Ron
stowing
Pigwidgeon
next
to
Hedwig
grabbing
a
Chocolate
Frog
from
harry
and
throwing
himself
into
the
seat
next
to
him
he
ripped
open
the
wrapper
bit
off
the
frogs
head
and
leaned
back
with
his
eyes
closed
as
though
he
had
had
a
very
exhausting
morning
well
there
are
two
fifth-year
prefects
from
each
house
said
Hermione
looking
thoroughly
disgruntled
as
she
took
her
seat
boy
and
girl
from
each
and
guess
whos
a
Slytherin
prefect
said
Ron
still
with
his
eyes
closed
malfoy
replied
Harry
at
once
certain
his
worst
fear
would
be
confirmed
course
said
Ron
bitterly
stuffing
the
rest
of
the
Frog
into
his
mouth
and
taking
another
and
that
complete
cow
Pansy
Parkinson
said
Hermione
viciously
how
she
got
to
be
a
prefect
when
shes
thicker
than
a
concussed
troll
whos
Hufflepuff
harry
asked
ernie
Macmillan
and
Hannah
Abbott
said
Ron
thickly
and
Anthony
Goldstein
and
Padma
Patil
for
Ravenclaw
said
Hermione
you
went
to
the
Yule
Ball
with
Padma
Patil
said
a
vague
voice
everyone
turned
to
look
at
Luna
Lovegood
who
was
gazing
unblinkingly
at
Ron
over
the
top
of
the
Quibbler
he
swallowed
his
mouthful
of
Frog
yeah
I
know
I
did
he
said
looking
mildly
surprised
she
didnt
enjoy
it
very
much
Luna
informed
him
she
doesnt
think
you
treated
her
very
well
because
you
wouldnt
dance
with
her
i
dont
think
Id
have
minded
she
added
thoughtfully
I
dont
like
dancing
very
much
she
retreated
behind
The
Quibbler
again
ron
stared
at
the
cover
with
his
mouth
hanging
open
for
a
few
seconds
then
looked
around
at
Ginny
for
some
kind
of
explanation
but
Ginny
had
stuffed
her
knuckles
in
her
mouth
to
stop
herself
giggling
ron
shook
his
head
bemused
then
checked
his
watch
were
supposed
to
patrol
the
corridors
every
so
often
he
told
Harry
and
Neville
and
we
can
give
out
punishments
if
people
are
misbehaving
i
cant
wait
to
get
Crabbe
and
Goyle
for
something
youre
not
supposed
to
abuse
your
position
Ron
said
Hermione
sharply
yeah
right
because
Malfoy
wont
abuse
it
at
all
said
Ron
sarcastically
so
youre
going
to
descend
to
his
level
no
Im
just
going
to
make
sure
I
get
his
mates
before
he
gets
mine
for
heavens
sake
Ron
ill
make
Goyle
do
lines
itll
kill
him
he
hates
writing
said
Ron
happily
he
lowered
his
voice
to
Goyles
low
grunt
and
screwing
up
his
face
in
a
look
of
pained
concentration
mimed
writing
in
midair
must
not
look
like
baboons
backside
everyone
laughed
but
nobody
laughed
harder
than
Luna
Lovegood
she
let
out
a
scream
of
mirth
that
caused
Hedwig
to
wake
up
and
flap
her
wings
indignantly
and
Crookshanks
to
leap
up
into
the
luggage
rack
hissing
luna
laughed
so
hard
her
magazine
slipped
out
of
her
grasp
slid
down
her
legs
and
on
to
the
floor
that
was
funny
her
prominent
eyes
swam
with
tears
as
she
gasped
for
breath
staring
at
Ron
utterly
nonplussed
he
looked
around
at
the
others
who
were
now
laughing
at
the
expression
on
Rons
face
and
at
the
ludicrously
prolonged
laughter
of
Luna
Lovegood
who
was
rocking
backwards
and
forwards
clutching
her
sides
are
you
taking
the
mickey
said
Ron
frowning
at
her
baboons
backside
she
choked
holding
her
ribs
everyone
else
was
watching
Luna
laughing
but
Harry
glancing
at
the
magazine
on
the
floor
noticed
something
that
made
him
dive
for
it
upside-down
it
had
been
hard
to
tell
what
the
picture
on
the
front
was
but
Harry
now
realized
it
was
a
fairly
bad
cartoon
of
Cornelius
Fudge
harry
only
recognized
him
because
of
the
lime-green
bowler
hat
one
of
Fudges
hands
was
clenched
around
a
bag
of
gold
the
other
hand
was
throttling
a
goblin
the
cartoon
was
captioned
How
Far
Will
Fudge
Go
to
Gain
Gringotts
beneath
this
were
listed
the
titles
of
other
articles
inside
the
magazine
corruption
in
the
Quidditch
League
how
the
Tornados
are
Taking
Control
secrets
of
the
Ancient
Runes
Revealed
sirius
Black
Villain
or
Victim
can
I
have
a
look
at
this
harry
asked
Luna
eagerly
she
nodded
still
gazing
at
Ron
breathless
with
laughter
harry
opened
the
magazine
and
scanned
the
index
until
this
moment
he
had
completely
forgotten
the
magazine
Kingsley
had
handed
mr.
Weasley
to
give
to
Sirius
but
it
must
have
been
this
edition
of
The
Quibbler
he
found
the
page
and
turned
excitedly
to
the
article
this
too
was
illustrated
by
a
rather
bad
cartoon
in
fact
Harry
would
not
have
known
it
was
supposed
to
be
Sirius
if
it
hadnt
been
captioned
sirius
was
standing
on
a
pile
of
human
bones
with
his
wand
out
the
headline
on
the
article
said
sirius
black
as
hes
painted
notorious
mass
murderer
or
innocent
singing
sensation
harry
had
to
read
this
first
sentence
several
times
before
he
was
convinced
that
he
had
not
misunderstood
it
since
when
had
Sirius
been
a
singing
sensation
for
fourteen
years
Sirius
Black
has
been
believed
guilty
of
the
mass
murder
of
twelve
innocent
muggles
and
one
wizard
blacks
audacious
escape
from
Azkaban
two
years
ago
has
led
to
the
widest
manhunt
ever
conducted
by
the
Ministry
of
Magic
none
of
us
has
ever
questioned
that
he
deserves
to
be
recaptured
and
handed
back
to
the
Dementors
but
does
he
startling
new
evidence
has
recently
come
to
light
that
Sirius
Black
may
not
have
committed
the
crimes
for
which
he
was
sent
to
Azkaban
in
fact
says
Doris
Purkiss
of
Acanthia
Way
Little
norton
Black
may
not
even
have
been
present
at
the
killings
what
people
dont
realize
is
that
Sirius
Black
is
a
false
name
says
Mrs
purkiss
the
man
people
believe
to
be
Sirius
Black
is
actually
Stubby
Boardman
lead
singer
of
popular
singing
group
The
Hobgoblins
who
retired
fro
m
public
life
after
being
struck
on
the
ear
by
a
turnip
at
a
concert
in
Little
Norton
Church
Hall
nearly
fifteen
years
ago
i
recognized
him
the
moment
I
saw
his
picture
in
the
paper
now
Stubby
couldnt
possibly
have
committed
those
crimes
because
on
the
day
in
question
he
happened
to
be
enjoying
a
romantic
candlelit
dinner
with
me
i
have
written
to
the
Minister
for
Magic
and
am
expecting
him
to
give
Stubby
alias
Sirius
a
full
pardon
any
day
now
harry
finished
reading
and
stared
at
the
page
in
disbelief
perhaps
it
was
a
joke
he
thought
perhaps
the
magazine
often
printed
spoof
Hems
he
flicked
back
a
few
pages
and
found
the
piece
on
Fudge
cornelius
Fudge
the
Minister
for
Magic
denied
that
he
had
any
plans
to
take
over
the
running
of
the
Wizarding
Bank
Gringotts
when
he
was
elected
Minister
for
Magic
five
years
ago
fudge
has
always
insisted
that
he
wants
nothing
more
than
to
co-operate
peacefully
with
the
guardians
of
our
gold
but
does
he
sources
close
to
the
Minister
have
recently
disclosed
that
Fudges
dearest
ambition
is
to
seize
control
of
the
goblin
gold
supplies
and
that
he
will
not
hesitate
to
use
force
if
need
be
it
wouldnt
be
the
first
time
either
said
a
Ministry
insider
cornelius
Goblin-Crusher
Fudge
thats
what
his
friends
call
him
if
you
could
hear
him
when
he
thinks
no
ones
listening
oh
hes
always
talking
about
the
goblins
hes
had
done
in
hes
had
them
drowned
hes
had
them
dropped
off
buildings
hes
had
them
poisoned
hes
had
them
cooked
in
pies
harry
did
not
read
any
further
fudge
might
have
many
faults
but
Harry
found
it
extremely
hard
to
imagine
him
ordering
goblins
to
be
cooked
in
pies
he
flicked
through
the
rest
of
the
magazine
pausing
every
few
pages
he
read
an
accusation
that
the
Tutshill
Tornados
were
winning
the
Quidditch
League
by
a
combination
of
blackmail
illegal
broom-tampering
and
torture
an
interview
with
a
wizard
who
claimed
to
have
flown
to
the
moon
on
a
Cleansweep
Six
and
brought
back
a
bag
of
moon
frogs
to
prove
it
and
an
article
on
ancient
runes
which
at
least
explained
why
Luna
had
been
reading
The
Quibbler
upside-down
according
to
the
magazine
if
you
turned
the
runes
on
their
heads
they
revealed
a
spell
to
make
your
enemys
ears
turn
into
kumquats
in
fact
compared
to
the
rest
of
the
articles
in
The
Quibbler
the
suggestion
that
Sirius
might
really
be
the
lead
singer
of
The
Hobgoblins
was
quite
sensible
anything
good
in
there
asked
Ron
as
Harry
closed
the
magazine
of
course
not
said
Hermione
scathingly
before
Harry
could
answer
the
Quibblers
rubbish
everyone
knows
that
excuse
me
said
Luna
her
voice
had
suddenly
lost
its
dreamy
quality
my
fathers
the
editor
i
oh
said
Hermione
looking
embarrassed
well
its
got
some
interesting
i
mean
its
quite
ill
have
it
back
thank
you
said
Luna
coldly
and
leaning
forwards
she
snatched
it
out
of
harrys
hands
riffling
through
it
to
page
fifty-seven
she
turned
it
resolutely
upside-down
again
and
disappeared
behind
it
just
as
the
compartment
door
opened
for
the
third
time
harry
looked
around
he
had
expected
this
but
that
did
not
make
the
sight
of
Draco
Malfoy
smirking
at
him
from
between
his
cronies
Crabbe
and
Goyle
any
more
enjoyable
what
he
said
aggressively
before
Malfoy
could
open
his
mouth
manners
Potter
or
Ill
have
to
give
you
a
detention
drawled
Malfoy
whose
sleek
blond
hair
and
pointed
chin
were
just
like
his
fathers
you
see
I
unlike
you
have
been
made
a
prefect
which
means
that
I
unlike
you
have
the
power
to
hand
out
punishments
yeah
said
Harry
but
you
unlike
me
are
a
git
so
get
out
and
leave
us
alone
ron
Hermione
Ginny
and
Neville
laughed
malfoys
lip
curled
tell
me
how
does
it
feel
being
second-best
to
Weasley
Potter
he
asked
shut
up
Malfoy
said
Hermione
sharply
i
seem
to
have
touched
a
nerve
said
Malfoy
smirking
well
just
watch
yourself
Potter
because
Ill
be
dogging
your
footsteps
in
case
you
step
out
of
line
get
out
said
Hermione
standing
up
sniggering
Malfoy
gave
Harry
a
last
malicious
look
and
departed
with
Crabbe
and
Goyle
lumbering
along
in
his
wake
hermione
slammed
the
compartment
door
behind
them
and
turned
to
look
at
Harry
who
knew
at
once
that
she
like
him
had
registered
what
Malfoy
had
said
and
been
just
as
unnerved
by
it
chuck
us
another
Frog
said
Ron
who
had
clearly
noticed
nothing
harry
could
not
talk
freely
in
front
of
Neville
and
Luna
he
exchanged
another
nervous
look
with
Hermione
then
stared
out
of
the
window
he
had
thought
Sirius
coming
with
him
to
the
station
was
a
bit
of
a
laugh
but
suddenly
it
seemed
reckless
if
not
downright
dangerous
hermione
had
been
right
sirius
should
not
have
come
what
if
mr.
Malfoy
had
noticed
the
black
dog
and
told
Draco
what
if
he
had
deduced
that
the
weasleys
Lupin
Tonks
and
Moody
knew
where
Sirius
was
hiding
or
had
Malfoys
use
of
the
word
dogging
been
a
coincidence
the
weather
remained
undecided
as
they
traveled
further
and
further
north
rain
spattered
the
windows
in
a
half-hearted
way
then
the
sun
put
in
a
feeble
appearance
before
clouds
drifted
over
it
once
more
when
darkness
fell
and
lamps
came
on
inside
the
carriages
Luna
rolled
up
The
quibbler
put
it
carefully
away
in
her
bag
and
took
to
staring
at
everyone
in
the
compartment
instead
harry
was
sitting
with
his
forehead
pressed
against
the
train
window
trying
to
get
a
first
distant
glimpse
of
Hogwarts
but
it
was
a
moonless
night
and
the
rain-streaked
window
was
grimy
wed
better
change
said
Hermione
at
last
and
all
of
them
opened
their
trunks
with
difficulty
and
pulled
on
their
school
robes
she
and
Ron
pinned
their
prefect
badges
carefully
to
their
chests
harry
saw
Ron
checking
his
reflection
in
the
black
window
at
last
the
train
began
to
slow
down
and
they
heard
the
usual
racket
up
and
down
it
as
everybody
scrambled
to
get
their
luggage
and
pets
assembled
ready
to
get
off
as
Ron
and
hermione
were
supposed
to
supervise
all
this
they
disappeared
from
the
carriage
again
leaving
harry
and
the
others
to
look
after
Crookshanks
and
Pigwidgeon
ill
carry
that
owl
if
you
like
said
Luna
to
Harry
reaching
out
for
Pigwidgeon
as
Neville
stowed
Trevor
carefully
in
an
inside
pocket
oh
er
thanks
said
Harry
handing
her
the
cage
and
hoisting
Hedwigs
more
securely
into
his
arms
they
shuffled
out
of
the
compartment
feeling
the
first
sting
of
the
night
air
on
their
faces
as
they
joined
the
crowd
in
the
corridor
slowly
they
moved
towards
the
doors
harry
could
smell
the
pine
trees
that
lined
the
path
down
to
the
lake
he
stepped
down
on
to
the
platform
and
looked
around
listening
for
the
familiar
call
of
firs-years
over
ere
firs-years
but
it
did
not
come
instead
a
quite
different
voice
a
brisk
female
one
was
calling
out
First
years
line
up
over
here
please
all
first-years
to
me
a
lantern
came
swinging
towards
Harry
and
by
its
light
he
saw
the
prominent
chin
and
severe
haircut
of
Professor
Grubbly-Plank
the
witch
who
had
taken
over
Hagrids
Care
of
Magical
creatures
lessons
for
a
while
the
previous
year
wheres
Hagrid
he
said
out
loud
i
dont
know
said
Ginny
but
wed
better
get
out
of
the
way
were
blocking
the
door
oh
yeah
harry
and
Ginny
became
separated
as
they
moved
off
along
the
platform
and
out
through
the
station
jostled
by
the
crowd
Harry
squinted
through
the
darkness
for
a
glimpse
of
Hagrid
he
had
to
be
here
Harry
had
been
relying
on
it
seeing
Hagrid
again
was
one
of
the
things
hed
been
looking
forward
to
most
but
there
was
no
sign
of
him
he
cant
have
left
Harry
told
himself
as
he
shuffled
slowly
through
a
narrow
doorway
on
to
the
road
outside
with
the
rest
of
the
crowd
hes
just
got
a
cold
or
something
he
looked
around
for
Ron
or
Hermione
wanting
to
know
what
they
thought
about
the
reappearance
of
Professor
Grubbly-Plank
but
neither
of
them
was
anywhere
near
him
so
he
allowed
himself
to
be
shunted
forwards
on
to
the
dark
rain-washed
road
outside
Hogsmeade
station
here
stood
the
hundred
or
so
horseless
stagecoaches
that
always
took
the
students
above
first
year
up
to
the
castle
harry
glanced
quickly
at
them
turned
away
to
keep
a
lookout
for
Ron
and
hermione
then
did
a
double-take
the
coaches
were
no
longer
horseless
there
were
creatures
standing
between
the
carriage
shafts
if
he
had
had
to
give
them
a
name
he
supposed
he
would
have
called
them
horses
though
there
was
something
reptilian
about
them
too
they
were
completely
fleshless
their
black
coats
clinging
to
their
skeletons
of
which
every
bone
was
visible
their
heads
were
dragonish
and
their
pupil-less
eyes
white
and
staring
wings
sprouted
from
each
wither
vast
black
leathery
wings
that
looked
as
though
they
ought
to
belong
to
giant
bats
standing
still
and
quiet
in
the
gathering
gloom
the
creatures
looked
eerie
and
sinister
harry
could
not
understand
why
the
coaches
were
being
pulled
by
these
horrible
horses
when
they
were
quite
capable
of
moving
along
by
themselves
wheres
Pig
said
Rons
voice
right
behind
Harry
that
Luna
girl
was
carrying
him
said
Harry
turning
quickly
eager
to
consult
Ron
about
hagrid
where
dyou
reckon
Hagrid
is
i
dunno
said
Ron
sounding
worried
hed
better
be
okay
a
short
distance
away
Draco
Malfoy
followed
by
a
small
gang
of
cronies
including
Crabbe
goyle
and
Pansy
Parkinson
was
pushing
some
timid-looking
second-years
out
of
the
way
so
that
he
and
his
friends
could
get
a
coach
to
themselves
seconds
later
Hermione
emerged
panting
from
the
crowd
malfoy
was
being
absolutely
foul
to
a
first-year
back
there
i
swear
Im
going
to
report
him
hes
only
had
his
badge
three
minutes
and
hes
using
it
to
bully
people
worse
than
ever
wheres
Crookshanks
ginnys
got
him
said
Harry
there
she
is
ginny
had
just
emerged
from
the
crowd
clutching
a
squirming
Crookshanks
thanks
said
Hermione
relieving
Ginny
of
the
cat
come
on
lets
get
a
carriage
together
before
they
all
fill
up
i
havent
got
Pig
yet
ron
said
but
Hermione
was
already
heading
off
towards
the
nearest
unoccupied
coach
harry
remained
behind
with
Ron
what
are
those
things
dyou
reckon
he
asked
Ron
nodding
at
the
horrible
horses
as
the
other
students
surged
past
them
what
things
those
horse
luna
appeared
holding
Pigwidgeons
cage
in
her
arms
the
tiny
owl
was
twittering
excitedly
as
usual
here
you
are
she
said
hes
a
sweet
little
owl
isnt
he
er
yeah
hes
all
right
said
Ron
gruffly
well
come
on
then
lets
get
in
what
were
you
saying
Harry
i
was
saying
what
are
those
horse
things
harry
said
as
he
Ron
and
Luna
made
for
the
carriage
in
which
Hermione
and
Ginny
were
already
sitting
what
horse
things
the
horse
things
pulling
the
carriages
said
Harry
impatiently
they
were
after
all
about
three
feet
from
the
nearest
one
it
was
watching
them
with
empty
white
eyes
ron
however
gave
harry
a
perplexed
look
what
are
you
talking
about
im
talking
about
look
harry
grabbed
Rons
arm
and
wheeled
him
about
so
that
he
was
face
to
face
with
the
winged
horse
ron
stared
straight
at
it
for
a
second
then
looked
back
at
Harry
what
am
I
supposed
to
be
looking
at
at
the
there
between
the
shafts
harnessed
to
the
coach
its
right
there
in
front
but
as
Ron
continued
to
look
bemused
a
strange
thought
occurred
to
Harry
cant
cant
you
see
them
see
what
cant
you
see
whats
pulling
the
carriages
ron
looked
seriously
alarmed
now
are
you
feeling
all
right
Harry
yeah
harry
felt
utterly
bewildered
the
horse
was
there
in
front
of
him
gleaming
solidly
in
the
dim
light
issuing
from
the
station
windows
behind
them
vapour
rising
from
its
nostrils
in
the
chilly
night
air
yet
unless
Ron
was
faking
and
it
was
a
very
feeble
joke
if
he
was
Ron
could
not
see
it
at
all
shall
we
get
in
then
said
Ron
uncertainly
looking
at
Harry
as
though
worried
about
him
yeah
said
Harry
yeah
go
on
its
all
right
said
a
dreamy
voice
from
beside
Harry
as
Ron
vanished
into
the
coachs
dark
interior
youre
not
going
mad
or
anything
i
can
see
them
too
can
you
said
Harry
desperately
turning
to
Luna
he
could
see
the
bat-winged
horses
reflected
in
her
wide
silvery
eyes
oh
yes
said
Luna
Ive
been
able
to
see
them
ever
since
my
first
day
here
theyve
always
pulled
the
carriages
dont
worry
youre
just
as
sane
as
I
am
smiling
faintly
she
climbed
into
the
musty
interior
of
the
carriage
after
Ron
not
altogether
reassured
Harry
followed
her
chapter
eleven
the
Sorting
Hats
New
Song
harry
did
not
want
to
tell
the
others
that
he
and
Luna
were
having
the
same
hallucination
if
that
was
what
it
was
so
he
said
nothing
more
about
the
horses
as
he
sat
down
inside
the
carriage
and
slammed
the
door
behind
him
nevertheless
he
could
not
help
watching
the
silhouettes
of
the
horses
moving
beyond
the
window
did
everyone
see
that
Grubbly-Plank
woman
asked
Ginny
whats
she
doing
back
here
hagrid
cant
have
left
can
he
ill
be
quite
glad
if
he
has
said
Luna
he
isnt
a
very
good
teacher
is
he
yes
he
is
said
Harry
Ron
and
Ginny
angrily
harry
glared
at
Hermione
she
cleared
her
throat
and
quickly
said
Erm
yes
hes
very
good
well
we
in
Ravenclaw
think
hes
a
bit
of
a
joke
said
Luna
unfazed
youve
got
a
rubbish
sense
of
humor
then
Ron
snapped
as
the
wheels
below
them
creaked
into
motion
luna
did
not
seem
perturbed
by
Rons
rudeness
on
the
contrary
she
simply
watched
him
for
a
while
as
though
he
were
a
mildly
interesting
television
program
rattling
and
swaying
the
carriages
moved
in
convoy
up
the
road
when
they
passed
between
the
tall
stone
pillars
topped
with
winged
boars
on
either
side
of
the
gates
to
the
school
grounds
harry
leaned
forwards
to
try
and
see
whether
there
were
any
lights
on
in
Hagrids
cabin
by
the
forbidden
Forest
but
the
grounds
were
in
complete
darkness
hogwarts
Castle
however
loomed
ever
closer
a
towering
mass
of
turrets
jet
black
against
the
dark
sky
here
and
there
a
window
blazing
fiery
bright
above
them
the
carriages
jingled
to
a
halt
near
the
stone
steps
leading
up
to
the
oak
front
doors
and
Harry
got
out
of
the
carriage
first
he
turned
again
to
look
for
lit
windows
down
by
the
Forest
but
there
was
definitely
no
sign
of
life
within
Hagrids
cabin
unwillingly
because
he
had
half-hoped
they
would
have
vanished
he
turned
his
eyes
instead
upon
the
strange
skeletal
creatures
standing
quietly
in
the
chill
night
air
their
blank
white
eyes
gleaming
harry
had
once
before
had
the
experience
of
seeing
something
that
Ron
could
not
but
that
had
been
a
reflection
in
a
mirror
something
much
more
insubstantial
than
a
hundred
very
solid
looking
beasts
strong
enough
to
pull
a
fleet
of
carriages
if
Luna
was
to
be
believed
the
beasts
had
always
been
there
but
invisible
why
then
could
Harry
suddenly
see
them
and
why
could
ron
not
are
you
coming
or
what
said
Ron
beside
him
oh
yeah
said
Harry
quickly
and
they
joined
the
crowd
hurrying
up
the
stone
steps
into
the
castle
the
Entrance
Hall
was
ablaze
with
torches
and
echoing
with
footsteps
as
the
students
crossed
the
flagged
stone
floor
for
the
double
doors
to
the
right
leading
to
the
Great
Hall
and
the
start-of-term
feast
the
four
long
house
tables
in
the
Great
Hall
were
filling
up
under
the
starless
black
ceiling
which
was
just
like
the
sky
they
could
glimpse
through
the
high
windows
candles
floated
in
midair
all
along
the
tables
illuminating
the
silvery
ghosts
who
were
dotted
about
the
Hall
and
the
faces
of
the
students
talking
eagerly
exchanging
summer
news
shouting
greetings
at
friends
from
other
houses
eyeing
one
anothers
new
haircuts
and
robes
again
Harry
noticed
people
putting
their
heads
together
to
whisper
as
he
passed
he
gritted
his
teeth
and
tried
to
act
as
though
he
neither
noticed
nor
cared
luna
drifted
away
from
them
at
the
Ravenclaw
table
the
moment
they
reached
Gryffindors
ginny
was
hailed
by
some
fellow
fourth-years
and
left
to
sit
with
them
Harry
Ron
Hermione
and
Neville
found
seats
together
about
halfway
down
the
table
between
Nearly
Headless
Nick
the
Gryffindor
house
ghost
and
Parvati
Patil
and
Lavender
Brown
the
last
two
of
whom
gave
harry
airy
overly-friendly
greetings
that
made
him
quite
sure
they
had
stopped
talking
about
him
a
split
second
before
he
had
more
important
things
to
worry
about
however
he
was
looking
over
the
students
heads
to
the
staff
table
that
ran
along
the
top
wall
of
the
Hall
hes
not
there
ron
and
Hermione
scanned
the
staff
table
too
though
there
was
no
real
need
Hagrids
size
made
him
instantly
obvious
in
any
lineup
he
cant
have
left
said
Ron
sounding
slightly
anxious
of
course
he
hasnt
said
Harry
firmly
you
dont
think
hes
hurt
or
anything
do
you
said
Hermione
uneasily
no
said
Harry
at
once
but
where
is
he
then
there
was
a
pause
then
Harry
said
very
quietly
so
that
Neville
Parvati
and
Lavender
could
not
hear
Maybe
hes
not
back
yet
you
know
from
his
mission
the
thing
he
was
doing
over
the
summer
for
Dumbledore
yeah
yeah
thatll
be
it
said
Ron
sounding
reassured
but
Hermione
bit
her
lip
looking
up
and
down
the
staff
table
as
though
hoping
for
some
conclusive
explanation
of
Hagrids
absence
whos
that
she
said
sharply
pointing
towards
the
middle
of
the
staff
table
harrys
eyes
followed
hers
they
lit
first
upon
Professor
Dumbledore
sitting
in
his
high-backed
golden
chair
at
the
center
of
the
long
staff
table
wearing
deep-purple
robes
scattered
with
silvery
stars
and
a
matching
hat
dumbledores
head
was
inclined
towards
the
woman
sitting
next
to
him
who
was
talking
into
his
ear
she
looked
Harry
thought
like
somebodys
maiden
aunt
squat
with
short
curly
mouse-brown
hair
in
which
she
had
placed
a
horrible
pink
Alice
band
that
matched
the
fluffy
pink
cardigan
she
wore
over
her
robes
then
she
turned
her
face
slightly
to
take
a
sip
from
her
goblet
and
he
saw
with
a
shock
of
recognition
a
pallid
toadlike
face
and
a
pair
of
prominent
pouchy
eyes
its
that
Umbridge
woman
who
said
Hermione
she
was
at
my
hearing
she
works
for
Fudge
nice
cardigan
said
Ron
smirking
she
works
for
Fudge
hermione
repeated
frowning
what
on
earths
she
doing
here
then
dunno
hermione
scanned
the
staff
table
her
eyes
narrowed
no
she
muttered
no
surely
not
harry
did
not
understand
what
she
was
talking
about
but
did
not
ask
his
attention
had
been
caught
by
Professor
Grubbly-Plank
who
had
just
appeared
behind
the
staff
table
she
worked
her
way
along
to
the
very
end
and
took
the
seat
that
ought
to
have
been
Hagrids
that
meant
the
first-years
must
have
crossed
the
lake
and
reached
the
castle
and
sure
enough
a
few
seconds
later
the
doors
from
the
Entrance
Hall
opened
a
long
line
of
scared-looking
first-years
entered
led
by
Professor
McGonagall
who
was
carrying
a
stool
on
which
sat
an
ancient
wizards
hat
heavily
patched
and
darned
with
a
wide
rip
near
the
frayed
brim
the
buzz
of
talk
in
the
Great
Hall
faded
away
the
first-years
lined
up
in
front
of
the
staff
table
facing
the
rest
of
the
students
and
Professor
McGonagall
placed
the
stool
carefully
in
front
of
them
then
stood
back
the
first-years
faces
glowed
palely
in
the
candlelight
a
small
boy
right
in
the
middle
of
the
row
looked
as
though
he
was
trembling
harry
recalled
fleetingly
how
terrified
he
had
felt
when
he
had
stood
there
waiting
for
the
unknown
test
that
would
determine
to
which
house
he
belonged
the
whole
school
waited
with
bated
breath
then
the
rip
near
the
hats
brim
opened
wide
like
a
mouth
and
the
Sorting
Hat
burst
into
song
in
times
of
old
when
I
was
new
and
Hogwarts
barely
started
the
founders
of
our
noble
school
thought
never
to
be
parted
united
by
a
common
goal
they
had
the
selfsame
yearning
to
make
the
worlds
best
magic
school
and
pass
along
their
learning
together
we
will
build
and
teach
the
four
good
friends
decided
and
never
did
they
dream
that
they
might
some
day
be
divided
for
were
there
such
friends
anywhere
as
Slytherin
and
Gryffindor
unless
it
was
the
second
pair
of
Hufflepuff
and
Ravenclaw
so
how
could
it
have
gone
so
wrong
how
could
such
friendships
fail
why
I
was
there
and
so
can
tell
the
whole
sad
sorry
tale
said
Slytherin
Well
teach
just
those
whose
ancestry
is
purest
said
Ravenclaw
Well
teach
those
whose
intelligence
is
surest
said
Gryffindor
Well
teach
all
those
with
brave
deeds
to
their
name
said
Hufflepuff
Ill
teach
the
lot
and
treat
them
just
the
same
these
differences
caused
little
strife
when
first
they
came
to
light
for
each
of
the
four
founders
had
a
house
in
which
they
might
take
only
those
they
wanted
so
for
instance
Slytherin
took
only
pure-blood
wizards
of
great
cunning
just
like
him
and
only
those
of
sharpest
mind
were
taught
by
Ravenclaw
while
the
bravest
and
the
boldest
went
to
daring
Gryffindor
good
Hufflepuff
she
took
the
rest
and
taught
them
all
she
knew
thus
the
houses
and
their
founders
retained
friendships
firm
and
true
so
Hogwarts
worked
in
harmony
for
several
happy
years
but
then
discord
crept
among
us
feeding
on
our
faults
and
fears
the
houses
that
like
pillars
four
had
once
held
up
our
school
now
turned
upon
each
other
and
divided
sought
to
rule
and
for
a
while
it
seemed
the
school
must
meet
an
early
end
what
with
dueling
and
with
fighting
and
the
clash
of
friend
on
friend
and
at
last
there
came
a
morning
when
old
Slytherin
departed
and
though
the
fighting
then
died
out
he
left
us
quite
downhearted
and
never
since
the
founders
four
were
whittled
down
to
three
have
the
houses
been
united
as
they
once
were
meant
to
be
and
now
the
Sorting
Hat
is
here
and
you
all
know
the
score
i
sort
you
into
houses
because
that
is
what
Im
for
but
this
year
Ill
go
further
listen
closely
to
my
song
though
condemned
I
am
to
split
you
still
I
worry
that
its
wrong
though
I
must
fulfill
my
duty
and
must
quarter
every
year
still
I
wonder
whether
Sorting
may
not
bring
the
end
I
fear
oh
know
the
perils
read
the
signs
the
warning
history
shows
for
our
Hogwarts
is
in
danger
from
external
deadly
foes
and
we
must
unite
inside
her
or
well
crumble
from
within
i
have
told
you
I
have
warned
you
let
the
Sorting
now
begin
the
Hat
became
motionless
once
more
applause
broke
out
though
it
was
punctured
for
the
first
time
in
Harrys
memory
with
muttering
and
whispers
all
across
the
Great
Hall
students
were
exchanging
remarks
with
their
neighbors
and
Harry
clapping
along
with
everyone
else
knew
exactly
what
they
were
talking
about
branched
out
a
bit
this
year
hasnt
it
said
Ron
his
eyebrows
raised
too
right
it
has
said
Harry
the
Sorting
Hat
usually
confined
itself
to
describing
the
different
qualities
looked
for
by
each
of
the
four
Hogwarts
houses
and
its
own
role
in
Sorting
them
harry
could
not
remember
it
ever
trying
to
give
the
school
advice
before
i
wonder
if
its
ever
given
warnings
before
said
Hermione
sounding
slightly
anxious
yes
indeed
said
Nearly
Headless
Nick
knowledgeably
leaning
across
Neville
towards
her
Neville
winced
it
was
very
uncomfortable
to
have
a
ghost
lean
through
you
the
Hat
feels
itself
honor-bound
to
give
the
school
due
warning
whenever
it
feels
but
Professor
McGonagall
who
was
waiting
to
read
out
the
list
of
first-years
names
was
giving
the
whispering
students
the
sort
of
look
that
scorches
nearly
Headless
Nick
placed
a
see-through
finger
to
his
lips
and
sat
primly
upright
again
as
the
muttering
came
to
an
abrupt
end
with
a
last
frowning
look
that
swept
the
four
house
tables
Professor
McGonagall
lowered
her
eyes
to
her
long
piece
of
parchment
and
called
out
the
first
name
abercrombie
Euan
the
terrified-looking
boy
Harry
had
noticed
earlier
stumbled
forwards
and
put
the
Hat
on
his
head
it
was
only
prevented
from
falling
right
down
to
his
shoulders
by
his
very
prominent
ears
the
Hat
considered
for
a
moment
then
the
rip
near
the
brim
opened
again
and
shouted
gryffindor
harry
clapped
loudly
with
the
rest
of
Gryffindor
house
as
Euan
Abercrombie
staggered
to
their
table
and
sat
down
looking
as
though
he
would
like
very
much
to
sink
through
the
floor
and
never
be
looked
at
again
slowly
the
long
line
of
first-years
thinned
in
the
pauses
between
the
names
and
the
Sorting
hats
decisions
Harry
could
hear
Rons
stomach
rumbling
loudly
finally
Zeller
Rose
was
sorted
into
Hufflepuff
and
Professor
McGonagall
picked
up
the
Hat
and
stool
and
marched
them
away
as
Professor
Dumbledore
rose
to
his
feet
whatever
his
recent
bitter
feelings
had
been
towards
his
Headmaster
Harry
was
somehow
soothed
to
see
Dumbledore
standing
before
them
all
between
the
absence
of
Hagrid
and
the
presence
of
those
dragonish
horses
he
had
felt
that
his
return
to
Hogwarts
so
long
anticipated
was
full
of
unexpected
surprises
like
jarring
notes
in
a
familiar
song
but
this
at
least
was
how
it
was
supposed
to
be
their
Headmaster
rising
to
greet
them
all
before
the
start-of-term
feast
to
our
newcomers
said
Dumbledore
in
a
ringing
voice
his
arms
stretched
wide
and
a
beaming
smile
on
his
lips
welcome
to
our
old
hands
welcome
back
there
is
a
time
for
speechmaking
but
this
is
not
it
tuck
in
there
was
an
appreciative
laugh
and
an
outbreak
of
applause
as
Dumbledore
sat
down
neatly
and
threw
his
long
beard
over
his
shoulder
so
as
to
keep
it
out
of
the
way
of
his
plate
for
food
had
appeared
out
of
nowhere
so
that
the
five
long
tables
were
groaning
under
joints
and
pies
and
dishes
of
vegetables
bread
and
sauces
and
flagons
of
pumpkin
juice
excellent
said
Ron
with
a
kind
of
groan
of
longing
and
he
seized
the
nearest
plate
of
chops
and
began
piling
them
on
to
his
plate
watched
wistfully
by
Nearly
Headless
Nick
what
were
you
saying
before
the
Sorting
hermione
asked
the
ghost
about
the
Hat
giving
warnings
oh
yes
said
Nick
who
seemed
glad
of
a
reason
to
turn
away
from
Ron
who
was
now
eating
roast
potatoes
with
almost
indecent
enthusiasm
yes
I
have
heard
the
Hat
give
several
warnings
before
always
at
times
when
it
detects
periods
of
great
danger
for
the
school
and
always
of
course
its
advice
is
the
same
stand
together
be
strong
from
within
ow
kunnit
nofe
skusin
danger
ifzat
said
Ron
his
mouth
was
so
full
Harry
thought
it
was
quite
an
achievement
for
him
to
make
any
noise
at
all
i
beg
your
pardon
said
Nearly
Headless
Nick
politely
while
Hermione
looked
revolted
ron
gave
an
enormous
swallow
and
said
How
can
it
know
if
the
schools
in
danger
if
its
a
Hat
i
have
no
idea
said
Nearly
Headless
Nick
of
course
it
lives
in
Dumbledores
office
so
I
daresay
it
picks
things
up
there
and
it
wants
all
the
houses
to
be
friends
said
Harry
looking
over
at
the
Slytherin
table
where
draco
Malfoy
was
holding
court
fat
chance
well
now
you
shouldnt
take
that
attitude
said
Nick
reprovingly
peaceful
cooperation
thats
the
key
we
ghosts
though
we
belong
to
separate
houses
maintain
links
of
friendship
in
spite
of
the
competitiveness
between
Gryffindor
and
Slytherin
I
would
never
dream
of
seeking
an
argument
with
the
Bloody
Baron
only
because
youre
terrified
of
him
said
Ron
nearly
Headless
Nick
looked
highly
affronted
terrified
i
hope
I
Sir
Nicholas
de
Mimsy-Porpington
have
never
been
guilty
of
cowardice
in
my
life
the
noble
blood
that
runs
in
my
veins
what
blood
asked
Ron
surely
you
havent
still
got
its
a
figure
of
speech
said
Nearly
Headless
Nick
now
so
annoyed
his
head
was
trembling
ominously
on
his
partially
severed
neck
i
assume
I
am
still
allowed
to
enjoy
the
use
of
whichever
words
I
like
even
if
the
pleasures
of
eating
and
drinking
are
denied
me
but
I
am
quite
used
to
students
poking
fun
at
my
death
I
assure
you
nick
he
wasnt
really
laughing
at
you
said
Hermione
throwing
a
furious
look
at
Ron
unfortunately
Rons
mouth
was
packed
to
exploding
point
again
and
all
he
could
manage
was
node
iddum
eentup
sechew
which
Nick
did
not
seem
to
think
constituted
an
adequate
apology
rising
into
the
air
he
straightened
his
feathered
hat
and
swept
away
from
them
to
the
other
end
of
the
table
coming
to
rest
between
the
Creevey
brothers
Colin
and
Dennis
well
done
Ron
snapped
Hermione
what
said
Ron
indignantly
having
managed
finally
to
swallow
his
food
im
not
allowed
to
ask
a
simple
question
oh
forget
it
said
Hermione
irritably
and
the
pair
of
them
spent
the
rest
of
the
meal
in
huffy
silence
harry
was
too
used
to
their
bickering
to
bother
trying
to
reconcile
them
he
felt
it
was
a
better
use
of
his
time
to
eat
his
way
steadily
through
his
steak
and
kidney
pie
then
a
large
plateful
of
his
favorite
treacle
tart
when
all
the
students
had
finished
eating
and
the
noise
level
in
the
Hall
was
starting
to
creep
upwards
again
Dumbledore
got
to
his
feet
once
more
talking
ceased
immediately
as
all
turned
to
lace
the
Headmaster
harry
was
feeling
pleasantly
drowsy
now
his
four-poster
bed
was
waiting
somewhere
above
wonderfully
warm
and
soft
well
now
that
we
are
all
digesting
another
magnificent
feast
I
beg
a
few
moments
of
your
attention
for
the
usual
start-of-term
notices
said
Dumbledore
first-years
ought
to
know
that
the
Forest
in
the
grounds
is
out-of-bounds
to
students
and
a
few
of
our
older
students
ought
to
know
by
now
too
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
exchanged
smirks
mr.
Filch
the
caretaker
has
asked
me
for
what
he
tells
me
is
the
four-hundred-and-sixty
second
time
to
remind
you
all
that
magic
is
not
permitted
in
corridors
between
classes
nor
are
a
number
of
other
things
all
of
which
can
be
checked
on
the
extensive
list
now
fastened
to
Mr
filchs
office
door
we
have
had
two
changes
in
staffing
this
year
we
are
very
pleased
to
welcome
back
Professor
grubbly-Plank
who
will
be
taking
Care
of
Magical
Creatures
lessons
we
are
also
delighted
to
introduce
Professor
Umbridge
our
new
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
teacher
there
was
a
round
of
polite
but
fairly
unenthusiastic
applause
during
which
Harry
Ron
and
hermione
exchanged
slightly
panicked
looks
Dumbledore
had
not
said
for
how
long
Grubbly
plank
would
be
teaching
dumbledore
continued
Tryouts
for
the
house
Quidditch
teams
will
take
place
on
the
he
broke
off
looking
enquiringly
at
Professor
Umbridge
as
she
was
not
much
taller
standing
than
sitting
there
was
a
moment
when
nobody
understood
why
Dumbledore
had
stopped
talking
but
then
Professor
Umbridge
cleared
her
throat
Hem
hem
and
it
became
clear
that
she
had
got
to
her
feet
and
was
intending
to
make
a
speech
dumbledore
only
looked
taken
aback
for
a
moment
then
he
sat
down
smartly
and
looked
alertly
at
Professor
Umbridge
as
though
he
desired
nothing
better
than
to
listen
to
her
talk
other
members
of
staff
were
not
as
adept
at
hiding
their
surprise
professor
Sprouts
eyebrows
had
disappeared
into
her
flyaway
hair
and
Professor
McGonagalls
mouth
was
as
thin
as
Harry
had
ever
seen
it
no
new
teacher
had
ever
interrupted
Dumbledore
before
many
of
the
students
were
smirking
this
woman
obviously
did
not
know
how
things
were
done
at
Hogwarts
thank
you
Headmaster
Professor
Umbridge
simpered
for
those
kind
words
of
welcome
her
voice
was
high-pitched
breathy
and
little-girlish
and
again
Harry
felt
a
powerful
rush
of
dislike
that
he
could
not
explain
to
himself
all
he
knew
was
that
he
loathed
everything
about
her
from
her
stupid
voice
to
her
fluffy
pink
cardigan
she
gave
another
little
throat-clearing
cough
hem
hem
and
continued
well
it
is
lovely
to
be
back
at
Hogwarts
I
must
say
she
smiled
revealing
very
pointed
teeth
and
to
see
such
happy
little
faces
looking
up
at
me
harry
glanced
around
none
of
the
faces
he
could
see
looked
happy
on
the
contrary
they
all
looked
rather
taken-aback
at
being
addressed
as
though
they
were
five
years
old
i
am
very
much
looking
forward
to
getting
to
know
you
all
and
Im
sure
well
be
very
good
friends
students
exchanged
looks
at
this
some
of
them
were
barely
concealing
grins
ill
be
her
friend
as
long
as
I
dont
have
to
borrow
that
cardigan
Parvati
whispered
to
lavender
and
both
of
them
lapsed
into
silent
giggles
professor
Umbridge
cleared
her
throat
again
hem
hem
but
when
she
continued
some
of
the
breathiness
had
vanished
from
her
voice
she
sounded
much
more
businesslike
and
now
her
words
had
a
dull
learned-by-heart
sound
to
them
the
Ministry
of
Magic
has
always
considered
the
education
of
young
witches
and
wizards
to
be
of
vital
importance
the
rare
gifts
with
which
you
were
born
may
come
to
nothing
if
not
nurtured
and
honed
by
careful
instruction
the
ancient
skills
unique
to
the
wizarding
community
must
be
passed
down
the
generations
lest
we
lose
them
for
ever
the
treasure
trove
of
magical
knowledge
amassed
by
our
ancestors
must
be
guarded
replenished
and
polished
by
those
who
have
been
called
to
the
noble
profession
of
teaching
professor
Umbridge
paused
here
and
made
a
little
bow
to
her
fellow
staff
members
none
of
whom
bowed
back
to
her
professor
McGonagalls
dark
eyebrows
had
contracted
so
that
she
looked
positively
hawklike
and
Harry
distinctly
saw
her
exchange
a
significant
glance
with
professor
Sprout
as
Umbridge
gave
another
little
hem
hem
and
went
on
with
her
speech
every
headmaster
and
headmistress
of
Hogwarts
has
brought
something
new
to
the
weighty
task
of
governing
this
historic
school
and
that
is
as
it
should
be
for
without
progress
there
will
be
stagnation
and
decay
there
again
progress
for
progresss
sake
must
be
discouraged
for
our
tried
and
tested
traditions
often
require
no
tinkering
a
balance
then
between
old
and
new
between
permanence
and
change
between
tradition
and
innovation
harry
found
his
attentiveness
ebbing
as
though
his
brain
was
slipping
in
and
out
of
tune
the
quiet
that
always
filled
the
Hall
when
Dumbledore
was
speaking
was
breaking
up
as
students
put
their
heads
together
whispering
and
giggling
over
on
the
Ravenclaw
table
Cho
Chang
was
chatting
animatedly
with
her
friends
a
few
seats
along
from
Cho
Luna
Lovegood
had
got
out
The
Quibbler
again
meanwhile
at
the
Hufflepuff
table
Ernie
Macmillan
was
one
of
the
few
still
staring
at
Professor
Umbridge
but
he
was
glassy-eyed
and
Harry
was
sure
he
was
only
pretending
to
listen
in
an
attempt
to
live
up
to
the
new
prefects
badge
gleaming
on
his
chest
professor
Umbridge
did
not
seem
to
notice
the
restlessness
of
her
audience
harry
had
the
impression
that
a
full-scale
riot
could
have
broken
out
under
her
nose
and
she
would
have
ploughed
on
with
her
speech
the
teachers
however
were
still
listening
very
attentively
and
hermione
seemed
to
be
drinking
in
every
word
Umbridge
spoke
though
judging
by
her
expression
they
were
not
at
all
to
her
taste
because
some
changes
will
be
for
the
better
while
others
will
come
in
the
fullness
of
time
to
be
recognized
as
errors
of
judgment
meanwhile
some
old
habits
will
be
retained
and
rightly
so
whereas
others
outmoded
and
outworn
must
be
abandoned
let
us
move
forward
then
into
a
new
era
of
openness
effectiveness
and
accountability
intent
on
preserving
what
ought
to
be
preserved
perfecting
what
needs
to
be
perfected
and
pruning
wherever
we
find
practices
that
ought
to
be
prohibited
she
sat
down
dumbledore
clapped
the
staff
followed
his
lead
though
Harry
noticed
that
several
of
them
brought
their
hands
together
only
once
or
twice
before
stopping
a
few
students
joined
in
but
most
had
been
taken
unawares
by
the
end
of
the
speech
not
having
listened
to
more
than
a
few
words
of
it
and
before
they
could
start
applauding
properly
Dumbledore
had
stood
up
again
thank
you
very
much
Professor
Umbridge
that
was
most
illuminating
he
said
bowing
to
her
now
as
I
was
saying
Quidditch
tryouts
will
be
held
yes
it
certainly
was
illuminating
said
Hermione
in
a
low
voice
youre
not
telling
me
you
enjoyed
it
ron
said
quietly
turning
a
glazed
face
towards
hermione
that
was
about
the
dullest
speech
Ive
ever
heard
and
I
grew
up
with
Percy
i
said
illuminating
not
enjoyable
said
Hermione
it
explained
a
lot
did
it
said
Harry
in
surprise
sounded
like
a
load
of
waffle
to
me
there
was
some
important
stuff
hidden
in
the
waffle
said
Hermione
grimly
was
there
said
Ron
blankly
how
about
progress
for
progresss
sake
must
be
discouraged
how
about
pruning
wherever
we
find
practices
that
ought
to
be
prohibited
well
what
does
that
mean
said
Ron
impatiently
ill
tell
you
what
it
means
said
Hermione
through
gritted
teeth
it
means
the
Ministrys
interfering
at
Hogwarts
there
was
a
great
clattering
and
banging
all
around
them
Dumbledore
had
obviously
just
dismissed
the
school
because
everyone
was
standing
up
ready
to
leave
the
Hall
hermione
jumped
up
looking
flustered
ron
were
supposed
to
show
the
first-years
where
to
go
oh
yeah
said
Ron
who
had
obviously
forgotten
hey
hey
you
lot
midgets
ron
well
they
are
theyre
titchy
i
know
but
you
cant
call
them
midgets
first-years
hermione
called
commandingly
along
the
table
this
way
please
a
group
of
new
students
walked
shyly
up
the
gap
between
the
Gryffindor
and
Hufflepuff
tables
all
of
them
trying
hard
not
to
lead
the
group
they
did
indeed
seem
very
small
Harry
was
sure
he
had
not
appeared
that
young
when
he
had
arrived
here
he
grinned
at
them
a
blond
boy
next
to
Euan
Abercrombie
looked
petrified
he
nudged
Euan
and
whispered
something
in
his
ear
euan
Abercrombie
looked
equally
frightened
and
stole
a
horrified
look
at
Harry
who
felt
the
grin
slide
off
his
face
like
Stinksap
see
you
later
he
said
dully
to
Ron
and
Hermione
and
he
made
his
way
out
of
the
Great
Hall
alone
doing
everything
he
could
to
ignore
more
whispering
staring
and
pointing
as
he
passed
he
kept
his
eyes
fixed
ahead
as
he
wove
his
way
through
the
crowd
in
the
Entrance
Hall
then
he
hurried
up
the
marble
staircase
took
a
couple
of
concealed
short
cuts
and
had
soon
left
most
of
the
crowds
behind
he
had
been
stupid
not
to
expect
this
he
thought
angrily
as
he
walked
through
the
much
emptier
upstairs
corridors
of
course
everyone
was
staring
at
him
he
had
emerged
from
the
Triwizard
maze
two
months
previously
clutching
the
dead
body
of
a
fellow
student
and
claiming
to
have
seen
Lord
Voldemort
return
to
power
there
had
not
been
time
last
term
to
explain
himself
before
theyd
all
had
to
go
home
even
if
he
had
felt
up
to
giving
the
whole
school
a
detailed
account
of
the
terrible
events
in
that
graveyard
harry
had
reached
the
end
of
the
corridor
to
the
Gryffindor
common
room
and
come
to
a
halt
in
front
of
the
portrait
of
the
Fat
Lady
before
he
realized
that
he
did
not
know
the
new
password
er
he
said
glumly
staring
up
at
the
Fat
Lady
who
smoothed
the
folds
of
her
pink
satin
dress
and
looked
sternly
back
at
him
no
password
no
entrance
she
said
loftily
harry
I
know
it
someone
panted
up
behind
him
and
he
turned
to
see
Neville
jogging
towards
him
guess
what
it
is
im
actually
going
to
be
able
to
remember
it
for
once
He
waved
the
stunted
little
cactus
he
had
shown
them
on
the
train
mimbulus
mimbletonia
correct
said
the
Fat
Lady
and
her
portrait
swung
open
towards
them
like
a
door
revealing
a
circular
hole
in
the
wall
behind
through
which
Harry
and
Neville
now
climbed
the
Gryffindor
common
room
looked
as
welcoming
as
ever
a
cozy
circular
tower
room
full
of
dilapidated
squashy
armchairs
and
rickety
old
tables
a
fire
was
crackling
merrily
in
the
grate
and
a
few
people
were
warming
their
hands
by
it
before
going
up
to
their
dormitories
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
Fred
and
George
Weasley
were
pinning
something
up
on
the
noticeboard
harry
waved
goodnight
to
them
and
headed
straight
for
the
door
to
the
boys
dormitories
he
was
not
in
much
of
a
mood
for
talking
at
the
moment
neville
followed
him
dean
Thomas
and
Seamus
Finnigan
had
reached
the
dormitory
first
and
were
in
the
process
of
covering
the
walls
beside
their
beds
with
posters
and
photographs
they
had
been
talking
as
harry
pushed
open
the
door
but
stopped
abruptly
the
moment
they
saw
him
harry
wondered
whether
they
had
been
talking
about
him
then
whether
he
was
being
paranoid
hi
he
said
moving
across
to
his
own
trunk
and
opening
it
hey
Harry
said
Dean
who
was
putting
on
a
pair
of
pajamas
in
the
West
Ham
colors
good
holiday
not
bad
muttered
Harry
as
a
true
account
of
his
holiday
would
have
taken
most
of
the
night
to
relate
and
he
could
not
face
it
you
yeah
it
was
okay
chuckled
Dean
better
than
Seamuss
anyway
he
was
just
telling
me
why
what
happened
Seamus
neville
asked
as
he
placed
his
Mimbulus
mimbletonia
tenderly
on
his
bedside
cabinet
seamus
did
not
answer
immediately
he
was
making
rather
a
meal
of
ensuring
that
his
poster
of
the
Kenmare
Kestrels
Quidditch
team
was
quite
straight
then
he
said
with
his
back
still
turned
to
Harry
Me
mam
didnt
want
me
to
come
back
what
said
Harry
pausing
in
the
act
of
pulling
off
his
robes
she
didnt
want
me
to
come
back
to
Hogwarts
seamus
turned
away
from
his
poster
and
pulled
his
own
pajamas
out
of
his
trunk
still
not
looking
at
Harry
but
why
said
Harry
astonished
he
knew
that
Seamuss
mother
was
a
witch
and
could
not
understand
therefore
why
she
should
have
come
over
so
Dursleyish
seamus
did
not
answer
until
he
had
finished
buttoning
his
pajamas
well
he
said
in
a
measured
voice
I
suppose
because
of
you
what
dyou
mean
said
Harry
quickly
his
heart
was
beating
rather
fast
he
felt
vaguely
as
though
something
was
closing
in
on
him
well
said
Seamus
again
still
avoiding
Harrys
eye
she
er
well
its
not
just
you
its
dumbledore
too
she
believes
the
Daily
Prophet
said
Harry
she
thinks
Im
a
liar
and
Dumbledores
an
old
fool
seamus
looked
up
at
him
yeah
something
like
that
harry
said
nothing
he
threw
his
wand
down
on
to
his
bedside
table
pulled
off
his
robes
stuffed
them
angrily
into
his
trunk
and
pulled
on
his
pajamas
he
was
sick
of
it
sick
of
being
the
person
who
was
stared
at
and
talked
about
all
the
time
if
any
of
them
knew
if
any
of
them
had
the
faintest
idea
what
it
felt
like
to
be
the
one
all
these
things
had
happened
to
mrs
finnigan
had
no
idea
the
stupid
woman
he
thought
savagely
he
got
into
bed
and
made
to
pull
the
hangings
closed
around
him
but
before
he
could
do
so
seamus
said
Look
what
did
happen
that
night
when
you
know
when
with
Cedric
diggory
and
all
seamus
sounded
nervous
and
eager
at
the
same
time
dean
who
had
been
bending
over
his
trunk
trying
to
retrieve
a
slipper
went
oddly
still
and
Harry
knew
he
was
listening
hard
what
are
you
asking
me
for
harry
retorted
just
read
the
Daily
Prophet
like
your
mother
why
dont
you
thatll
tell
you
all
you
need
to
know
dont
you
have
a
go
at
my
mother
Seamus
snapped
ill

a
go
at
anyone
who
calls
me
a
liar
said
Harry
dont
talk
to
me
like
that
ill
talk
to
you
how
I
want
said
Harry
his
temper
rising
so
fast
he
snatched
his
wand
back
from
his
bedside
table
if
youve
got
a
problem
sharing
a
dormitory
with
me
go
and
ask
mcGonagall
if

can
be
moved

your
mummy
worrying
leave
my
mother
out
of
this
Potter
whats
going
on
ron
had
appeared
in
the
doorway
his
wide
eyes
traveled
from
Harry
who
was
kneeling
on
his
bed
with
his
wand
pointing
at
Seamus
to
Seamus
who
was
standing
there
with
his
fists
raised
hes
having
a
go
at
my
mother
seamus
yelled
what
said
Ron
harry
wouldnt
do
that

met
your
mother
we
liked
her
thats
before
she
started
believing
every
word
the
stinking
Daily
Prophet
writes
about
me
said
Harry
at
the
top
of
his
voice
oh
said
Ron
comprehension
dawning
across
his
freckled
face
oh
right
you
know
what
said
Seamus
heatedly
casting
Harry
a
venomous
look
hes
right
I
dont
want
to
share
a
dormitory
with
him
any
more
hes
a
madman
thats
out
of
order
Seamus
said
Ron
whose
ears
were
starting
to
glow
red
always
a
danger
sign
out
of
order
am
I
shouted
Seamus
who
in
contrast
with
Ron
was
tuning
paler
you
believe
all
the
rubbish
hes
come
out
with
about
You-Know-Who
do
you
you
reckon
hes
telling
the
truth
yeah
I
do
said
Ron
angrily
then
youre
mad
too
said
Seamus
in
disgust
yeah
well
unfortunately
for
you
pal
Im
also
a
prefect
said
Ron
jabbing
himself
in
the
chest
with
a
finger
so
unless
you
want
detention
watch
your
mouth
seamus
looked
for
a
few
seconds
as
though
detention
would
be
a
reasonable
price
to
pay
to
say
what
was
going
through
his
mind
but
with
a
noise
of
contempt
he
turned
on
his
heel
vaulted
into
bed
and
pulled
the
hangings
shut
with
such
violence
that
they
were
ripped
from
the
bed
and
fell
in
a
dusty
pile
to
the
floor
ron
glared
at
Seamus
then
looked
at
Dean
and
Neville
anyone
elses
parents
got
a
problem
with
Harry
he
said
aggressively
my
parents
are
Muggles
mate
said
Dean
shrugging
they
dont
know
nothing
about
no
deaths
at
Hogwarts
because
Im
not
stupid
enough
to
tell
them
you
dont
know
my
mother
shed
weasel
anything
out
of
anyone
seamus
snapped
at
him
anyway
your
parents
dont
get
the
Daily
Prophet
they
dont
know
our
Headmasters
been
sacked
from
the
Wizengamot
and
the
International
Confederation
of
Wizards
because
hes
losing
his
marbles
my
gran
says
thats
rubbish
piped
up
Neville
she
says
its
the
Daily
Prophet
thats
going
downhill
not
Dumbledore
shes
cancelled
our
subscription
we
believe
Harry
said
Neville
simply
he
climbed
into
bed
and
pulled
the
covers
up
to
his
chin
looking
owlishly
over
them
at
seamus
my
grans
always
said
You-Know-Who
would
come
back
one
day
she
says
if
dumbledore
says
hes
back
hes
back
harry
felt
a
rush
of
gratitude
towards
Neville
nobody
else
said
anything
seamus
got
out
his
wand
repaired
the
bed
hangings
and
vanished
behind
them
dean
got
into
bed
rolled
over
and
fell
silent
neville
who
appeared
to
have
nothing
more
to
say
either
was
gazing
fondly
at
his
moonlit
cactus
harry
lay
back
on
his
pillows
while
Ron
bustled
around
the
next
bed
putting
his
things
away
he
felt
shaken
by
the
argument
with
Seamus
whom
he
had
always
liked
very
much
how
many
more
people
were
going
to
suggest
that
he
was
lying
or
unhinged
had
Dumbledore
suffered
like
this
all
summer
as
first
the
Wizengamot
then
the
International
confederation
of
Wizards
had
thrown
him
from
their
ranks
was
it
anger
at
Harry
perhaps
that
had
stopped
Dumbledore
getting
in
touch
with
him
for
months
the
two
of
them
were
in
this
together
after
all
Dumbledore
had
believed
Harry
announced
his
version
of
events
to
the
whole
school
and
then
to
the
wider
wizarding
community
anyone
who
thought
Harry
was
a
liar
had
to
think
that
Dumbledore
was
too
or
else
that
Dumbledore
had
been
hoodwinked
theyll
know
were
right
in
the
end
thought
Harry
miserably
as
Ron
got
into
bed
and
extinguished
the
last
candle
in
the
dormitory
but
he
wondered
how
many
more
attacks
like
seamuss
he
would
have
to
endure
before
that
time
came
chapter
twelve
professor
Umbridge
seamus
dressed
at
top
speed
next
morning
and
left
the
dormitory
before
Harry
had
even
put
on
his
socks
does
he
think
hell
turn
into
a
nutter
if
he
stays
in
a
room
with
me
too
long
asked
Harry
loudly
as
the
hem
of
Seamuss
robes
whipped
out
of
sight
dont
worry
about
it
Harry
Dean
muttered
hoisting
his
schoolbag
on
to
his
shoulder
hes
just
but
apparently
he
was
unable
to
say
exactly
what
Seamus
was
and
after
a
slightly
awkward
pause
followed
him
out
of
the
room
neville
and
Ron
both
gave
Harry
an
its-his-problem-not-yours
look
but
Harry
was
not
much
consoled
how
much
more
of
this
would
he
have
to
take
whats
the
matter
asked
Hermione
five
minutes
later
catching
up
with
Harry
and
Ron
halfway
across
the
common
room
as
they
all
headed
towards
breakfast
you
look
absolutely
Oh
for
heavens
sake
she
was
staring
at
the
common-room
noticeboard
where
a
large
new
sign
had
been
put
up
gallons
of
galleons
pocket
money
failing
to
keep
pace
with
your
outgoings
like
to
earn
a
little
extra
gold
contact
Fred
and
George
Weasley
Gryffindor
common
room
for
simple
part-time
virtually
painless
jobs
We
regret
that
all
work
is
undertaken
at
applicants
own
risk
they
are
the
limit
said
Hermione
grimly
taking
d
own
the
sign
which
Fred
and
George
had
pinned
up
over
a
poster
giving
the
date
of
the
first
Hogsmeade
weekend
in
October
well
have
to
talk
to
them
Ron
ron
looked
positively
alarmed
why
because
were
prefects
said
Hermione
as
they
c
l
imbed
out
through
the
portrait
hole
its
up
to
us
to
stop
this
kind
of
thing
ron
said
nothing
Harry
could
tell
from
his
glum
expression
that
the
prospect
of
stopping
Fred
and
George
doing
exactly
what
they
liked
was
not
one
he
found
inviting
anyway
whats
up
Harry
hermione
continued
as
they
walked
down
a
flight
of
stairs
lined
with
portraits
of
old
witches
and
wizards
all
of
whom
ignored
them
being
engrossed
in
their
own
conversation
you
look
really
angry
about
something
seamus
reckons
Harrys
lying
about
You-Know-Who
said
Ron
succinctly
when
Harry
did
not
respond
hermione
who
Harry
had
expected
to
react
angrily
on
his
behalf
sighed
yes
Lavender
thinks
so
too
she
said
gloomily
been
having
a
nice
little
chat
with
her
about
whet
her
or
not
Im
a
lying
attention-seeking
prat
have
you
harry
said
loudly
no
said
Hermione
calmly
i
told
her
to
keep
her
big
fat
mouth
shut
about
you
actually
and
it
would
be
quite
nice
if
you
stopped
jumping
down
our
throats
Harry
because
in
case
you
havent
noticed
Ron
and
I
are
on
your
side
there
was
a
short
pause
sorry
said
Harry
in
a
low
voice
thats
quite
all
right
said
Hermione
with
dignity
then
she
shook
her
head
dont
you
remember
what
Dumbledore
said
at
the
last
end-of-term
feast
harry
and
Ron
both
looked
at
her
blankly
and
Hermione
sighed
again
about
You-Know-Who
he
said
his
gift
for
spreading
discord
and
enmity
is
very
great
we
can
fight
it
only
by
showing
an
equally
strong
bond
of
friendship
and
trust
how
do
you
remember
stuff
like
that
asked
Ron
looking
at
her
in
admiration
i
listen
Ron
said
Hermione
with
a
touch
of
asperity
so
do
I
but
I
still
couldnt
tell
you
exactly
what
the
point
Hermione
pressed
on
loudly
is
that
this
sort
of
thing
is
exactly
what
Dumbledore
was
talking
about
you-Know-Whos
only
been
back
two
months
and
weve
already
started
fighting
among
ourselves
and
the
Sorting
Hats
warning
was
the
same
stand
together
be
united
and
Harry
got
it
right
last
night
retorted
Ron
if
that
means
were
supposed
to
get
matey
with
the
slytherins-fat
chance
well
I
think
its
a
pity
were
not
trying
for
a
bit
of
inter-house
unity
said
Hermione
crossly
they
had
reached
the
foot
of
the
marble
staircase
a
line
of
fourth-year
Ravenclaws
was
crossing
the
Entrance
Hall
they
caught
sight
of
Harry
and
hurried
to
form
a
tighter
group
as
though
frightened
he
might
attack
stragglers
yeah
we
really
ought
to
be
trying
to
make
friends
with
people
like
that
said
Harry
sarcastically
they
followed
the
Ravenclaws
into
the
Great
Hall
all
looking
instinctively
at
the
staff
table
as
they
entered
professor
Grubbly-Plank
was
chatting
to
Professor
Sinistra
the
Astronomy
teacher
and
Hagrid
was
once
again
conspicuous
only
by
his
absence
the
enchanted
ceiling
above
them
echoed
Harrys
mood
it
was
a
miserable
rain-cloud
grey
dumbledore
didnt
even
mention
how
long
that
Grubbly-Plank
womans
staying
he
said
as
they
made
their
way
across
to
the
Gryffindor
table
maybe
said
Hermione
thoughtfully
what
said
both
Harry
and
Ron
together
well
maybe
he
didnt
want
to
draw
attention
to
Hagrid
not
being
here
what
dyou
mean
draw
attention
to
it
said
Ron
half-laughing
how
could
we
not
notice
before
Hermione
could
answer
a
tall
black
girl
with
long
braided
hair
had
marched
up
to
Harry
hi
Angelina
hi
she
said
briskly
good
summer
and
without
waiting
for
an
answer
Listen
Ive
been
made
Gryffindor
Quidditch
Captain
nice
one
said
Harry
grinning
at
her
he
suspected
Angelinas
pep
talks
might
not
be
as
longwinded
as
Oliver
Woods
had
been
which
could
only
be
an
improvement
yeah
well
we
need
a
new
Keeper
now
Olivers
left
tryouts
are
on
Friday
at
five
oclock
and
I
want
the
whole
team
there
all
right
then
we
can
see
how
the
new
personnel
fit
in
okay
said
Harry
angelina
smiled
at
him
and
departed
id
forgotten
Wood
had
left
said
Hermione
vaguely
as
she
sat
down
beside
Ron
and
pulled
a
plate
of
toast
towards
her
i
suppose
that
will
make
quite
a
difference
to
the
team
i
spose
said
Harry
taking
the
bench
opposite
he
was
a
good
Keeper
still
it
wont
hurt
to
have
some
new
blood
will
it
said
Ron
with
a
whoosh
and
a
clatter
hundreds
of
owls
came
soaring
in
through
the
upper
windows
they
descended
all
over
the
Hall
bringing
letters
and
packages
to
their
owners
and
showering
the
breakfasters
with
droplets
of
water
it
was
clearly
raining
hard
outside
hedwig
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
but
Harry
was
hardly
surprised
his
only
correspondent
was
Sirius
and
he
doubted
sirius
would
have
anything
new
to
tell
him
after
only
twenty-four
hours
apart
hermione
however
had
to
move
her
orange
juice
aside
quickly
to
make
way
for
a
large
damp
barn
owl
bearing
a
sodden
Daily
Prophet
in
its
beak
what
are
you
still
getting
that
for
said
Harry
irritably
thinking
of
Seamus
as
Hermione
placed
a
Knut
in
the
leather
pouch
on
the
owls
leg
and
it
took
off
again
im
not
bothering
load
of
rubbish
its
best
to
know
what
the
enemy
is
saying
said
Hermione
darkly
and
she
unfurled
the
newspaper
and
disappeared
behind
it
not
emerging
until
Harry
and
Ron
had
finished
eating
nothing
she
said
simply
rolling
up
the
newspaper
and
laying
it
down
by
her
plate
nothing
about
you
or
Dumbledore
or
anything
professor
McGonagall
was
now
moving
along
the
table
handing
out
schedules
look
at
today
groaned
Ron
history
of
Magic
double
Potions
Divination
and
double
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
binns
Snape
Trelawney
and
that
Umbridge
woman
all
in
one
day
i
wish
Fred
and
Georged
hurry
up
and
get
those
Skiving
Snackboxes
sorted
do
mine
ears
deceive
me
said
Fred
arriving
with
George
and
squeezing
on
to
the
bench
beside
Harry
hogwarts
prefects
surely
dont
wish
to
skive
off
lessons
look
what
weve
got
today
said
Ron
grumpily
shoving
his
timetable
under
Freds
nose
thats
the
worst
Monday
Ive
ever
seen
fair
point
little
bro
said
Fred
scanning
the
column
you
can
have
a
bit
of
Nosebleed
Nougat
cheap
if
you
like
whys
it
cheap
said
Ron
suspiciously
because
youll
keep
bleeding
till
you
shrivel
up
we
havent
got
an
antidote
yet
said
George
helping
himself
to
a
kipper
cheers
said
Ron
moodily
pocketing
his
timetable
but
I
think
Ill
take
the
lessons
and
speaking
of
your
Skiving
Snackboxes
said
Hermione
eyeing
Fred
and
George
beadily
you
cant
advertise
for
testers
on
the
Gryffindor
noticeboard
says
who
said
George
looking
astonished
says
me
said
Hermione
and
Ron
leave
me
out
of
it
said
Ron
hastily
hermione
glared
at
him
fred
and
George
sniggered
youll
be
singing
a
different
tune
soon
enough
Hermione
said
Fred
thickly
buttering
a
crumpet
youre
starting
your
fifth
year
youll
be
begging
us
for
a
Snackbox
before
long
and
why

Skiving
Snackbox
asked
Hermione

George

exams

your
noses

grindstone

said
Fred
with
satisfaction
half
our
year
had
minor
breakdowns
coming
up
to
OWLs
said
George
happily
tears
and
tantrums
patricia
Stimpson
kept
coming
over
faint
kenneth
Towler
came
out
in
boils
dyou
remember
said
Fred
reminiscently
thats
cause

Bulbadox

pajamas
said
George
oh

said
Fred
grinning
id
forgotten
hard
to
keep
track
sometimes

anyway
its
a
nightmare
of
a
year
the
fifth
said
George

about

results

fred
and
I
managed
to
keep
our
spirits
up
somehow
yeah
you
got
what
was
it
three
OWLs
each
said
Ron
yep
said
Fred
unconcernedly
but
we
feel
our
futures
lie
outside
the
world
of
academic
achievement
we
seriously
debated
whether
we
were
going
to
bother
coming
back
for
our
seventh
year
said
george
brightly
now
that
weve
got
he
broke
off
at
a
warning
look
from
Harry
who
knew
George
had
been
about
to
mention
the
triwizard
winnings
he
had
given
them
now
that
weve
got
our
OWLs
George
said
hastily
i
mean
do
we
really
need
NEWTs
but
we
didnt
think
Mum
could
take
us
leaving
school
early
not
on
top
of
Percy
turning
out
to
be
the
worlds
biggest
prat
were
not
going
to
waste
our
last
year
here
though
said
Fred
looking
affectionately
around
at
the
Great
Hall
were
going
to
use
it
to
do
a
bit
of
market
research
find
out
exactly
what
the
average
Hogwarts
student
requires
from
a
joke
shop
carefully
evaluate
the
results
of
our
research
then
produce
products
to
fit
the
demand
but
where
are
you
going
to
get
the
gold
to
start
a
joke
shop
hermione
asked
skeptically
youre
going
to
need
all
the
ingredients
and
materials
and
premises
too
I
suppose
harry
did
not
look
at
the
twins
his
face
felt
hot
he
deliberately
dropped
his
fork
and
dived
down
to
retrieve
it
he
heard
Fred
say
overhead
Ask
us
no
questions
and
well
tell
you
no
lies
hermione
cmon
George
if
we
get
there
early
we
might
be
able
to
sell
a
few
Extendable
Ears
before
Herbology
harry
emerged
from
under
the
table
to
see
Fred
and
George
walking
away
each
carrying
a
stack
of
toast
what
did
that
mean
said
Hermione
looking
from
Harry
to
Ron
ask
us
no
questions
does
that
mean
theyve
already
got
some
gold
to
start
a
joke
shop
you
know
Ive
been
wondering
about
that
said
Ron
his
brow
furrowed
they
bought
me
a
new
set
of
dress
robes
this
summer
and
I
couldnt
understand
where
they
got
the
Galleons
harry
decided
it
was
time
to
steer
the
conversation
out
of
these
dangerous
waters
dyou
reckon
its
true
this
years
going
to
be
really
tough
because
of
the
exams
oh
yeah
said
Ron
bound
to
be
isnt
it
oWLs
are
really
important
affect
the
jobs
you
can
apply
for
and
everything
we
get
career
advice
too
later
this
year
Bill
told
me
so
you
can
choose
what
NEWTs
you
want
to
do
next
year
dyou
know
what
you
want
to
do
after
Hogwarts
harry
asked
the
other
two
as
they
left
the
great
Hall
shortly
afterwards
and
set
off
towards
their
History
of
Magic
classroom
not
really
said
Ron
slowly
except
well
he
looked
slightly
sheepish
what
harry
urged
him
well
itd
be
cool
to
be
an
Auror
said
Ron
in
an
off-hand
voice
yeah
it
would
said
Harry
fervently
but
theyre
like
the
elite
said
Ron
youve
got
to
be
really
good
what
about
you
Hermione
i
dont
know
she
said
i
think
Id
like
to
do
something
really
worthwhile
an
Aurors
worthwhile
said
Harry
yes
it
is
but
its
not
the
only
worthwhile
thing
said
Hermione
thoughtfully
I
mean
if
I
could
take
spew
further
harry
and
Ron
carefully
avoided
looking
at
each
other
history
of
Magic
was
by
common
consent
the
most
boring
subject
ever
devised
by
wizardkind
professor
Binns
their
ghost
teacher
had
a
wheezy
droning
voice
that
was
almost
guaranteed
to
cause
severe
drowsiness
within
ten
minutes
five
in
warm
weather
he
never
varied
the
form
of
their
lessons
but
lectured
them
without
pausing
while
they
took
notes
or
rather
gazed
sleepily
into
space
harry
and
Ron
had
so
far
managed
to
scrape
passes
in
this
subject
only
by
copying
hermiones
notes
before
exams
she
alone
seemed
able
to
resist
the
soporific
power
of
Binnss
voice
today
they
suffered
an
hour
and
a
halfs
droning
on
the
subject
of
giant
wars
harry
heard
just
enough
within
the
first
ten
minutes
to
appreciate
dimly
that
in
another
teachers
hands
this
subject
might
have
been
mildly
interesting
but
then
his
brain
disengaged
and
he
spent
the
remaining
hour
and
twenty
minutes
playing
hangman
on
a
corner
of
his
parchment
with
Ron
while
Hermione
shot
them
filthy
looks
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
how
would
it
be
she
asked
them
coldly
as
they
left
the
classroom
for
break
Binns
drifting
away
through
the
blackboard
if
I
refused
to
lend
you
my
notes
this
year
wed
fail
our
owl
said
Ron
if
you
want
that
on
your
conscience
Hermione
well
youd
deserve
it
she
snapped
you
dont
even
try
to
listen
to
him
do
you
we
do
try
said
Ron
we
just
havent
got
your
brains
or
your
memory
or
your
concentration
youre
just
cleverer
than
we
are
is
it
nice
to
rub
it
in
oh
dont
give
me
that
rubbish
said
Hermione
but
she
looked
slightly
mollified
as
she
led
the
way
out
into
the
damp
courtyard
a
fine
misty
drizzle
was
falling
so
that
the
people
standing
in
huddles
around
the
edges
of
the
yard
looked
blurred
at
the
edges
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
chose
a
secluded
corner
under
a
heavily
dripping
balcony
turning
up
the
collars
of
their
robes
against
the
chilly
September
air
and
talking
about
what
Snape
was
likely
to
set
them
in
the
first
lesson
of
the
year
they
had
got
as
far
as
agreeing
that
it
was
likely
to
be
something
extremely
difficult
just
to
catch
them
off
guard
after
a
two-month
holiday
when
someone
walked
around
the
corner
towards
them
hello
Harry
it
was
Cho
Chang
and
what
was
more
she
was
on
her
own
again
this
was
most
unusual
Cho
was
almost
always
surrounded
by
a
gang
of
giggling
girls
Harry
remembered
the
agony
of
trying
to
get
her
by
herself
to
ask
her
to
the
Yule
Ball
hi
said
Harry
feeling
his
face
grow
hot
at
least
youre
not
covered
in
Stinksap
this
time
he
told
himself
cho
seemed
to
be
thinking
along
the
same
lines
you
got
that
stuff
off
then
yeah
said
Harry
trying
to
grin
as
though
the
memory
of
their
last
meeting
was
funny
as
opposed
to
mortifying
so
did
you
er
have
a
good
summer
the
moment
he
had
said
this
he
wished
he
hadnt
Cedric
had
been
Chos
boyfriend
and
the
memory
of
his
death
must
have
affected
her
holiday
almost
as
badly
as
it
had
affected
Harrys
something
seemed
to
tauten
in
her
face
but
she
said
Oh
it
was
all
right
you
know
is
that
a
Tornados
badge
ron
demanded
suddenly
pointing
to
the
front
of
Chos
robes
where
a
sky-blue
badge
emblazoned
with
a
double
gold
T
was
pinned
you
dont
support
them
do
you
yeah
I
do
said
Cho
have
you
always
supported
them
or
just
since
they
started
winning
the
league
said
Ron
in
what
Harry
considered
an
unnecessarily
accusatory
tone
of
voice
ive
supported
them
since
I
was
six
said
Cho
coolly
anyway
see
you
Harry
she
walked
away
hermione
waited
until
Cho
was
halfway
across
the
courtyard
before
rounding
on
Ron
you
are
so
tactless
what
i
only
asked
her
if
couldnt
you
tell
she
wanted
to
talk
to
Harry
on
her
own
so
she
couldve
done
I
wasnt
stopping
why
on
earth
were
you
attacking
her
about
her
Quidditch
team
attacking
i
wasnt
attacking
her
I
was
only
who
cares
if
she
supports
the
Tornados
oh
come
on
half
the
people
you
see
wearing
those
badges
only
bought
them
last
season
but
what
does
it
matter
it
means
theyre
not
real
fans
theyre
just
jumping
on
the
bandwagon
thats
the
bell
said
Harry
dully
because
Ron
and
Hermione
were
bickering
too
loudly
to
hear
it
they
did
not
stop
arguing
all
the
way
down
to
Snapes
dungeon
which
gave
Harry
plenty
of
time
to
reflect
that
between
Neville
and
Ron
he
would
be
lucky
ever
to
have
two
minutes
of
conversation
with
Cho
that
he
could
look
back
on
without
wanting
to
leave
the
country
and
yet
he
thought
as
they
joined
the
queue
lining
up
outside
Snapes
classroom
door
she
had
chosen
to
come
and
talk
to
him
hadnt
she
she
had
been
Cedrics
girlfriend
she
could
easily
have
hated
Harry
for
coming
out
of
the
Triwizard
maze
alive
when
Cedric
had
died
yet
she
was
talking
to
him
in
a
perfectly
friendly
way
not
as
though
she
thought
him
mad
or
a
liar
or
in
some
horrible
way
responsible
for
Cedrics
death
yes
she
had
definitely
chosen
to
come
and
talk
to
him
and
that
made
the
second
time
in
two
days
and
at
this
thought
Harrys
spirits
rose
even
the
ominous
sound
of
Snapes
dungeon
door
creaking
open
did
not
puncture
the
small
hopeful
bubble
that
seemed
to
have
swelled
in
his
chest
he
filed
into
the
classroom
behind
Ron
and
Hermione
and
followed
them
to
their
usual
table
at
the
back
where
he
sat
down
between
ron
and
Hermione
and
ignored
the
huffy
irritable
noises
now
issuing
from
both
of
them
settle
down
said
Snape
coldly
shutting
the
door
behind
him
there
was
no
real
need
for
the
call
to
order
the
moment
the
class
had
heard
the
door
close
quiet
had
fallen
and
all
fidgeting
stopped
snapes
mere
presence
was
usually
enough
to
ensure
a
classs
silence
before
we
begin
todays
lesson
said
Snape
sweeping
over
to
his
desk
and
staring
around
at
them
all
I
think
it
appropriate
to
remind
you
that
next
June
you
will
be
sitting
an
important
examination
during
which
you
will
prove
how
much
you
have
learned
about
the
composition
and
use
of
magical
potions
moronic
though
some
of
this
class
undoubtedly
are
I
expect
you
to
scrape
an
Acceptable
in
your
owl
or
suffer
my
displeasure
his
gaze
lingered
this
time
on
Neville
who
gulped
after
this
year
of
course
many
of
you
will
cease
studying
with
me
Snape
went
on
i
take
only
the
very
best
into
my
newt
Potions
class
which
means
that
some
of
us
will
certainly
be
saying
goodbye
his
eyes
rested
on
Harry
and
his
lip
curled
harry
glared
back
feeling
a
grim
pleasure
at
the
idea
that
he
would
be
able
to
give
up
Potions
after
fifth
year
but
we
have
another
year
to
go
before
that
happy
moment
of
farewell
said
Snape
softly
so
whether
or
not
you
are
intending
to
attempt
newt
I
advise
all
of
you
to
concentrate
your
efforts
upon
maintaining
the
high
pass
level
I
have
come
to
expect
from
my
owl
students
today
we
will
be
mixing
a
potion
that
often
comes
up
at
Ordinary
Wizarding
Level
the
draught
of
Peace
a
potion
to
calm
anxiety
and
soothe
agitation
be
warned
if
you
are
too
heavy-handed
with
the
ingredients
you
will
put
the
drinker
into
a
heavy
and
sometimes
irreversible
sleep
so
you
will
need
to
pay
close
attention
to
what
you
are
doing
on
Harrys
left
hermione
sat
up
a
little
straighter
her
expression
one
of
utmost
attention
the
ingredients
and
method
Snape
flicked
his
wand
are
on
the
blackboard
they
appeared
there
you
will
find
everything
you
need
he
flicked
his
wand
again
in
the
store
cupboard
the
door
of
the
said
cupboard
sprang
open
you
have
an
hour
and
a
half
start
just
as
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
had
predicted
Snape
could
hardly
have
set
them
a
more
difficult
fiddly
potion
the
ingredients
had
to
be
added
to
the
cauldron
in
precisely
the
right
order
and
quantities
the
mixture
had
to
be
stirred
exactly
the
right
number
of
times
firstly
in
clockwise
then
in
anti-clockwise
directions
the
heat
of
the
flames
on
which
it
was
simmering
had
to
be
lowered
to
exactly
the
right
level
for
a
specific
number
of
minutes
before
the
final
ingredient
was
added
a
light
silver
vapour
should
now
be
rising
from
your
potion
called
Snape
with
ten
minutes
left
to
go
harry
who
was
sweating
profusely
looked
desperately
around
the
dungeon
his
own
cauldron
was
issuing
copious
amounts
of
dark
grey
steam
Rons
was
spitting
green
sparks
seamus
was
feverishly
prodding
the
flames
at
the
base
of
his
cauldron
with
the
tip
of
his
wand
as
they
seemed
to
be
going
out
the
surface
of
Hermiones
potion
however
was
a
shimmering
mist
of
silver
vapour
and
as
Snape
swept
by
he
looked
down
his
hooked
nose
at
it
without
comment
which
meant
he
could
find
nothing
to
criticize
at
Harrys
cauldron
however
Snape
stopped
and
looked
down
at
it
with
a
horrible
smirk
on
his
face
potter
what
is
this
supposed
to
be
the
Slytherins
at
the
front
of
the
class
all
looked
up
eagerly
they
loved
hearing
Snape
taunt
harry
the
Draught
of
Peace
said
Harry
tensely
tell
me
Potter
said
Snape
softly
can
you
read
draco
Malfoy
laughed
yes
I
can
said
Harry
his
fingers
clenched
tightly
around
his
wand
read
the
third
line
of
the
instructions
for
me
Potter
harry
squinted
at
the
blackboard
it
was
not
easy
to
make
out
the
instructions
through
the
haze
of
multi-colored
steam
now
filling
the
dungeon
add
powdered
moonstone
stir
three
times
counter-clockwise
allow
to
simmer
for
seven
minutes
then
add
two
drops
of
syrup
of
hellebore
his
heart
sank
he
had
not
added
syrup
of
hellebore
but
had
proceeded
straight
to
the
fourth
line
of
the
instructions
after
allowing
his
potion
to
simmer
for
seven
minutes
did
you
do
everything
on
the
third
line
Potter
no
said
Harry
very
quietly
i
beg
your
pardon
no
said
Harry
more
loudly
i
forgot
the
hellebore
i
know
you
did
Potter
which
means
that
this
mess
is
utterly
worthless
evanesco
the
contents
of
Harrys
potion
vanished
he
was
left
standing
foolishly
beside
an
empty
cauldron
those
of
you
who
have
managed
to
read
the
instructions
fill
one
flagon
with
a
sample
of
your
potion
label
it
clearly
with
your
name
and
bring
it
up
to
my
desk
for
testing
said
Snape
homework
twelve
inches
of
parchment
on
the
properties
of
moonstone
and
its
uses
in
potion
making
to
be
handed
in
on
Thursday
while
everyone
around
him
filled
their
flagons
Harry
cleared
away
his
things
seething
his
potion
had
been
no
worse
than
Rons
which
was
now
giving
off
a
foul
odour
of
bad
eggs
or
nevilles
which
had
achieved
the
consistency
of
just-mixed
cement
and
which
Neville
was
now
having
to
gouge
out
of
his
cauldron
yet
it
was
he
Harry
who
would
be
receiving
zero
marks
for
the
days
work
he
stuffed
his
wand
back
into
his
bag
and
slumped
down
on
to
his
seat
watching
everyone
else
march
up
to
Snapes
desk
with
filled
and
corked
flagons
when
at
long
last
the
bell
rang
Harry
was
first
out
of
the
dungeon
and
had
already
started
his
lunch
by
the
time
Ron
and
hermione
joined
him
in
the
Great
Hall
the
ceiling
had
turned
an
even
murkier
grey
during
the
morning
rain
was
lashing
the
high
windows
that
was
really
unfair
said
Hermione
consolingly
sitting
down
next
to
Harry
and
helping
herself
to
shepherds
pie
your
potion
wasnt
nearly
as
bad
as
Goyles
when
he
put
it
in
his
flagon
the
whole
thing
shattered
and
set
his
robes
on
fire
yeah
well
said
Harry
glowering
at
his
plate
since
when
has
Snape
ever
been
fair
to
me
neither
of
the
others
answered
all
three
of
them
knew
that
Snape
and
Harrys
mutual
enmity
had
been
absolute
from
the
moment
Harry
had
set
foot
in
Hogwarts
i
did
think
he
might
be
a
bit
better
this
year
said
Hermione
in
a
disappointed
voice
i
mean
you
know
she
looked
around
carefully
there
were
half
a
dozen
empty
seats
on
either
side
of
them
and
nobody
was
passing
the
table
now
hes
in
the
Order
and
everything
poisonous
toadstools
dont
change
their
spots
said
Ron
sagely
anyway
Ive
always
thought
dumbledore
was
cracked
trusting
Snape
wheres
the
evidence
he
ever
really
stopped
working
for
You-Know-Who
i
think
Dumbledores
probably
got
plenty
of
evidence
even
if
he
doesnt
share
it
with
you
Ron
snapped
Hermione
oh
shut
up
the
pair
of
you
said
Harry
heavily
as
Ron
opened
his
mouth
to
argue
back
hermione
and
Ron
both
froze
looking
angry
and
offended
cant
you
give
it
a
rest
said
Harry
youre
always
having
a
go
at
each
other
its
driving
me
mad
and
abandoning
his
shepherds
pie
he
swung
his
schoolbag
back
over
his
shoulder
and
left
them
sitting
there
he
walked
up
the
marble
staircase
two
steps
at
a
time
past
the
many
students
hurrying
towards
lunch
the
anger
that
had
just
flared
so
unexpectedly
still
blazed
inside
him
and
the
vision
of
ron
and
Hermiones
shocked
faces
afforded
him
a
sense
of
deep
satisfaction
serve
them
right
he
thought
why
cant
they
give
it
a
rest
bickering
all
the
time
its
enough
to
drive
anyone
upthe
wall
he
passed
the
large
picture
of
Sir
Cadogan
the
knight
on
a
landing
Sir
Cadogan
drew
his
sword
and
brandished
it
fiercely
at
Harry
who
ignored
him
come
back
you
scurvy
dog
stand
fast
and
fight
yelled
Sir
Cadogan
in
a
muffled
voice
from
behind
his
visor
but
Harry
merely
walked
on
and
when
Sir
Cadogan
attempted
to
follow
him
by
running
into
a
neighboring
picture
he
was
rebuffed
by
its
inhabitant
a
large
and
angry-looking
wolfhound
harry
spent
the
rest
of
the
lunch
hour
sitting
alone
underneath
the
trapdoor
at
the
top
of
North
tower
consequently
he
was
the
first
to
ascend
the
silver
ladder
that
led
to
Sibyll
Trelawneys
classroom
when
the
bell
rang
after
Potions
Divination
was
Harrys
least
favorite
class
which
was
due
mainly
to
Professor
trelawneys
habit
of
predicting
his
premature
death
every
few
lessons
a
thin
woman
heavily
draped
in
shawls
and
glittering
with
strings
of
beads
she
always
reminded
Harry
of
some
kind
of
insect
with
her
glasses
hugely
magnifying
her
eyes
she
was
busy
putting
copies
of
battered
leather-bound
books
on
each
of
the
spindly
little
tables
with
which
her
room
was
littered
when
harry
entered
the
room
but
the
light
cast
by
the
lamps
covered
by
scarves
and
the
low-burning
sickly-scented
fire
was
so
dim
she
appeared
not
to
notice
him
as
he
took
a
seat
in
the
shadows
the
rest
of
the
class
arrived
over
the
next
five
minutes
ron
emerged
from
the
trapdoor
looked
around
carefully
spotted
Harry
and
made
directly
for
him
or
as
directly
as
he
could
while
having
to
wend
his
way
between
tables
chairs
and
overstuffed
pouffes
hermione
and
me
have
stopped
arguing
he
said
sitting
down
beside
Harry
good
grunted
Harry
but
Hermione
says
she
thinks
it
would
be
nice
if
you
stopped
taking
out
your
temper
on
us
said
Ron
im
not
im
just
passing
on
the
message
said
Ron
talking
over
him
but
I
reckon
shes
right
its
not
our
fault
how
Seamus
and
Snape
treat
you
i
never
said
it
good-day
said
Professor
Trelawney
in
her
usual
misty
dreamy
voice
and
Harry
broke
off
again
feeling
both
annoyed
and
slightly
ashamed
of
himself
and
welcome
back
to
Divination
have
of
course
been
following
your
fortunes
most
carefully
over
the
holidays
and
am
delighted
to
see
that
you
have
all
returned
to
Hogwarts
safely
as
of
course
I
knew
you
would
you
will
find
on
the
tables
before
you
copies
of
The
Dream
Oracle
by
Inigo
Imago
dream
interpretation
is
a
most
important
means
of
divining
the
future
and
one
that
may
very
probably
be
tested
in
your
owl
not
of
course
that
I
believe
examination
passes
or
failures
are
of
the
remotest
importance
when
it
comes
to
the
sacred
art
of
divination
if
you
have
the
Seeing
Eye
certificates
and
grades
matter
very
little
however
the
Headmaster
likes
you
to
sit
the
examination
so
her
voice
trailed
away
delicately
leaving
them
all
in
no
doubt
that
Professor
Trelawney
considered
her
subject
above
such
sordid
matters
as
examinations
turn
please
to
the
introduction
and
read
what
Imago
has
to
say
on
the
matter
of
dream
interpretation
then
divide
into
pairs
use
The
Dream
Oracle
to
interpret
each
others
most
recent
dreams
carry
on
the
one
good
thing
to
be
said
for
this
lesson
was
that
it
was
not
a
double
period
by
the
time
they
had
all
finished
reading
the
introduction
of
the
book
they
had
barely
ten
minutes
left
for
dream
interpretation
at
the
table
next
to
Harry
and
Ron
Dean
had
paired
up
with
Neville
who
immediately
embarked
on
a
long-winded
explanation
of
a
nightmare
involving
a
pair
of
giant
scissors
wearing
his
grandmothers
best
hat
Harry
and
Ron
merely
looked
at
each
other
glumly
i
never
remember
my
dreams
said
Ron
you
say
one
you
must
remember
one
of
them
said
Harry
impatiently
he
was
not
going
to
share
his
dreams
with
anyone
he
knew
perfectly
well
what
his
regular
nightmare
about
a
graveyard
meant
he
did
not
need
Ron
or
Professor
Trelawney
or
the
stupid
Dream
Oracle
to
tell
him
well
I
dreamed
I
was
playing
Quidditch
the
other
night
said
Ron
screwing
up
his
face
in
an
effort
to
remember
what
dyou
reckon
that
means
probably
that
youre
going
to
be
eaten
by
a
giant
marshmallow
or
something
said
Harry
turning
the
pages
of
The
Dream
Oracle
without
interest
it
was
very
dull
work
looking
up
bits
of
dreams
in
the
Oracle
and
Harry
was
not
cheered
up
when
Professor
Trelawney
set
them
the
task
of
keeping
a
dream
diary
for
a
month
as
homework
when
the
bell
went
he
and
Ron
led
the
way
back
down
the
ladder
Ron
grumbling
loudly
dyou
realize
how
much
homework
weve
got
already
binns
set
us
a
foot-and-a-half-long
essay
on
giant
wars
Snape
wants
a
foot
on
the
use
of
moonstones
and
now
weve
got
a
months
dream
diary
from
Trelawney
fred
and
George
werent
wrong
about
owl
year
were
they
that
umbridge
woman
had
better
not
give
us
any
when
they
entered
the
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
classroom
they
found
Professor
Umbridge
already
seated
at
the
teachers
desk
wearing
the
fluffy
pink
cardigan
of
the
night
before
and
the
black
velvet
bow
on
top
of
her
head
harry
was
again
reminded
forcibly
of
a
large
fly
perched
unwisely
on
top
of
an
even
larger
toad
the
class
was
quiet
as
it
entered
the
room
Professor
Umbridge
was
as
yet
an
unknown
quantity
and
nobody
knew
how
strict
a
disciplinarian
she
was
likely
to
be
well
good
afternoon
she
said
when
finally
the
whole
class
had
sat
down
a
few
people
mumbled
good
afternoon
in
reply
tut
tut
said
Professor
Umbridge
that
wont
do
now
will
it
i
should
like
you
please
to
reply
Good
afternoon
Professor
Umbridge
one
more
time
please
good
afternoon
class
good
afternoon
Professor
Umbridge
they
chanted
back
at
her
there
now
said
Professor
Umbridge
sweetly
that
wasnt
too
difficult
was
it
wands
away
and
quills
out
please
many
of
the
class
exchanged
gloomy
looks
the
order
wands
away
had
never
yet
been
followed
by
a
lesson
they
had
found
interesting
harry
shoved
his
wand
back
inside
his
bag
and
pulled
out
quill
ink
and
parchment
professor
Umbridge
opened
her
handbag
extracted
her
own
wand
which
was
an
unusually
short
one
and
tapped
the
blackboard
sharply
with
it
words
appeared
on
the
board
at
once
defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
A
Return
to
Basic
Principles
well
now
your
teaching
in
this
subject
has
been
rather
disrupted
and
fragmented
hasnt
it
stated
Professor
Umbridge
turning
to
face
the
class
with
her
hands
clasped
neatly
in
front
of
her
the
constant
changing
of
teachers
many
of
whom
do
not
seem
to
have
followed
any
Ministry
approved
curriculum
has
unfortunately
resulted
in
your
being
far
below
the
standard
we
would
expect
to
see
in
your
owl
year
you
will
be
pleased
to
know
however
that
these
problems
are
now
to
be
rectified
we
will
be
following
a
carefully
structured
theory-centerd
ministry-approved
course
of
defensive
magic
this
year
copy
down
the
following
please
she
rapped
the
blackboard
again
the
first
message
vanished
and
was
replaced
by
Course
aims
understanding
the
principles
underlying
defensive
magic
learning
to
recognize
situations
in
which
defensive
magic
can
legally
be
used
placing
the
use
of
defensive
magic
in
a
context
for
practical
use
for
a
couple
of
minutes
the
room
was
full
of
the
sound
of
scratching
quills
on
parchment
when
everyone
had
copied
down
Professor
Umbridges
three
course
aims
she
asked
Has
everybody
got
a
copy
of
Defensive
Magical
Theory
by
Wilbert
Slinkhard
there
was
a
dull
murmur
of
assent
throughout
the
class
i
think
well
try
that
again
said
Professor
Umbridge
when
I
ask
you
a
question
I
should
like
you
to
reply
Yes
Professor
Umbridge
or
No
Professor
Umbridge
so
has
everyone
got
a
copy
of
Defensive
Magical
Theory
by
Wilbert
Slinkhard
yes
Professor
Umbridge
rang
through
the
room
good
said
Professor
Umbridge
i
should
like
you
to
turn
to
page
five
and
read
Chapter
One
basics
for
Beginners
there
will
be
no
need
to
talk
professor
Umbridge
left
the
blackboard
and
settled
herself
in
the
chair
behind
the
teachers
desk
observing
them
all
closely
with
those
pouchy
toads
eyes
harry
turned
to
page
five
of
his
copy
of
Defensive
Magical
Theory
and
started
to
read
it
was
desperately
dull
quite
as
bad
as
listening
to
Professor
Binns
he
felt
his
concentration
sliding
away
from
him
he
had
soon
read
the
same
line
half
a
dozen
times
without
taking
in
more
than
the
first
few
words
several
silent
minutes
passed
next
to
him
Ron
was
absent-mindedly
turning
his
quill
over
and
over
in
his
fingers
staring
at
the
same
spot
on
the
page
harry
looked
right
and
received
a
surprise
to
shake
him
out
of
his
torpor
hermione
had
not
even
opened
her
copy
of
Defensive
Magical
Theory
she
was
staring
fixedly
at
Professor
Umbridge
with
her
hand
in
the
air
harry
could
not
remember
Hermione
ever
neglecting
to
read
when
instructed
to
or
indeed
resisting
the
temptation
to
open
any
book
that
came
under
her
nose
he
looked
at
her
enquiringly
but
she
merely
shook
her
head
slightly
to
indicate
that
she
was
not
about
to
answer
questions
and
continued
to
stare
at
Professor
Umbridge
who
was
looking
just
as
resolutely
in
another
direction
after
several
more
minutes
had
passed
however
Harry
was
not
the
only
one
watching
hermione
the
chapter
they
had
been
instructed
to
read
was
so
tedious
that
more
and
more
people
were
choosing
to
watch
Hermiones
mute
attempt
to
catch
Professor
Umbridges
eye
rather
than
struggle
on
with
Basics
for
Beginners
when
more
than
half
the
class
were
staring
at
Hermione
rather
than
at
their
books
Professor
umbridge
seemed
to
decide
that
she
could
ignore
the
situation
no
longer
did
you
want
to
ask
something
about
the
chapter
dear
she
asked
Hermione
as
though
she
had
only
just
noticed
her
not
about
the
chapter
no
said
Hermione
well
were
reading
just
now
said
Professor
Umbridge
showing
her
small
pointed
teeth
if
you
have
other
queries
we
can
deal
with
them
at
the
end
of
class
ive
got
a
query
about
your
course
aims
said
Hermione
professor
Umbridge
raised
her
eyebrows
and
your
name
is
hermione
Granger
said
Hermione
well
Miss
Granger
I
think
the
course
aims
are
perfectly
clear
if
you
read
them
through
carefully
said
Professor
Umbridge
in
a
voice
of
determined
sweetness
well
I
dont
said
Hermione
bluntly
theres
nothing
written
up
there
about
using
defensive
spells
there
was
a
short
silence
in
which
many
members
of
the
class
turned
their
heads
to
frown
at
the
three
course
aims
still
written
on
the
blackboard
using
defensive
spells
professor
Umbridge
repeated
with
a
little
laugh
why
I
cant
imagine
any
situation
arising
in
my
classroom
that
would
require
you
to
use
a
defensive
spell
Miss
Granger
you
surely
arent
expecting
to
be
attacked
during
class
were
not
going
to
use
magic
ron
exclaimed
loudly
students
raise
their
hands
when
they
wish
to
speak
in
my
class
mr.
weasley
said
Ron
thrusting
his
hand
into
the
air
professor
Umbridge
smiling
still
more
widely
turned
her
back
on
him
harry
and
Hermione
immediately
raised
their
hands
too
professor
Umbridges
pouchy
eyes
lingered
on
Harry
for
a
moment
before
she
addressed
Hermione
yes
Miss
Granger
you
wanted
to
ask
something
else
yes
said
Hermione
surely
the
whole
point
of
Defence
Against
the
Dark
Arts
is
to
practice
defensive
spells
are
you
a
ministry-trained
educational
expert
Miss
Granger
asked
Professor
Umbridge
in
her
falsely
sweet
voice
no
but
well
then
Im
afraid
you
are
not
qualified
to
decide
what
the
whole
point
of
any
class
is
wizards
much
older
and
cleverer
than
you
have
devised
our
new
program
of
study
you
will
be
learning
about
defensive
spells
in
a
secure
risk-free
way
what
use
is
that
said
Harry
loudly
if
were
going
to
be
attacked
it
wont
be
in
a
hand
mr.
Potter
sang
Professor
Umbridge
harry
thrust
his
fist
in
the
air
again
Professor
Umbridge
promptly
turned
away
from
him
but
now
several
other
people
had
their
hands
up
too
and
your
name
is
professor
Umbridge
said
to
Dean
dean
Thomas
well
mr.
Thomas
well
its
like
Harry
said
isnt
it
said
Dean
if
were
going
to
be
attacked
it
wont
be
risk
free
i
repeat
said
Professor
Umbridge
smiling
in
a
very
irritating
fashion
at
Dean
do
you
expect
to
be
attacked
during
my
classes
no
but
professor
Umbridge
talked
over
him
i
do
not
wish
to
criticize
the
way
things
have
been
run
in
this
school
she
said
an
unconvincing
smile
stretching
her
wide
mouth
but
you
have
been
exposed
to
some
very
irresponsible
wizards
in
this
class
very
irresponsible
indeed
not
to
mention
she
gave
a
nasty
little
laugh
extremely
dangerous
half-breeds
if
you
mean
Professor
Lupin
piped
up
Dean
angrily
he
was
the
best
we
ever
hand
mr.
Thomas
as
I
was
saying
you
have
been
introduced
to
spells
that
have
been
complex
inappropriate
to
your
age
group
and
potentially
lethal
you
have
been
frightened
into
believing
that
you
are
likely
to
meet
Dark
attacks
every
other
day
no
we
havent
Hermione
said
we
just
your
hand
is
not
up
Miss
Granger
hermione
put
up
her
hand
professor
Umbridge
turned
away
from
her
it
is
my
understanding
that
my
predecessor
not
only
performed
illegal
curses
in
front
of
you
he
actually
performed
them
on
you
well
he
turned
out
to
be
a
maniac
didnt
he
said
Dean
hotly
mind
you
we
still
learned
loads
your
hand
is
not
up
mr.
Thomas
trilled
Professor
Umbridge
now
it
is
the
view
of
the
ministry
that
a
theoretical
knowledge
will
be
more
than
sufficient
to
get
you
through
your
examination
which
after
all
is
what
school
is
all
about
and
your
name
is
she
added
staring
at
Parvati
whose
hand
had
just
shot
up
parvati
Patil
and
isnt
there
a
practical
bit
in
our
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
owl
arent
we
supposed
to
show
that
we
can
actually
do
the
counter-curses
and
things
as
long
as
you
have
studied
the
theory
hard
enough
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
not
be
able
to
perform
the
spells
under
carefully
controlled
examination
conditions
said
Professor
umbridge
dismissively
without
ever
practicing
them
beforehand
said
Parvati
incredulously
are
you
telling
us
that
the
first
time
well
get
to
do
the
spells
will
be
during
our
exam
i
repeat
as
long
as
you
have
studied
the
theory
hard
enough
and
what
goods
theory
going
to
be
in
the
real
world
said
Harry
loudly
his
fist
in
the
air
again
professor
Umbridge
looked
up
this
is
school
mr.
Potter
not
the
real
world
she
said
softly
so
were
not
supposed
to
be
prepared
for
whats
waiting
for
us
out
there
there
is
nothing
waiting
out
there
mr.
Potter
oh
yeah
said
Harry
his
temper
which
seemed
to
have
been
bubbling
just
beneath
the
surface
all
day
was
reaching
boiling
point
who
do
you
imagine
wants
to
attack
children
like
yourselves
enquired
Professor
Umbridge
in
a
horribly
honeyed
voice
hmm
lets
think
said
Harry
in
a
mock
thoughtful
voice
maybe
lord
Voldemort
ron
gasped
Lavender
Brown
uttered
a
little
scream
Neville
slipped
sideways
off
his
stool
professor
Umbridge
however
did
not
flinch
she
was
staring
at
Harry
with
a
grimly
satisfied
expression
on
her
face
ten
points
from
Gryffindor
mr.
Potter
the
classroom
was
silent
and
still
everyone
was
staring
at
either
Umbridge
or
Harry
now
let
me
make
a
few
things
quite
plain
professor
Umbridge
stood
up
and
leaned
towards
them
her
stubby-fingered
hands
splayed
on
her
desk
you
have
been
told
that
a
certain
Dark
wizard
has
returned
from
the
dead
he
wasnt
dead
said
Harry
angrily
but
yeah
hes
returned
mr-potter-you-have-already-lost-your-house-ten-points-do-not-make-matters-worse-for
yourself
said
Professor
Umbridge
in
one
breath
without
looking
at
him
as
I
was
saying
you
have
been
informed
that
a
certain
Dark
wizard
is
at
large
once
again
this
is
a
lie
it
is
not
a
lie
said
Harry
i
saw
him
I
fought
him
detention
mr.
Potter
said
Professor
Umbridge
triumphantly
tomorrow
evening
five
oclock
my
office
i
repeat
this
is
a
lie
the
Ministry
of
Magic
guarantees
that
you
are
not
in
danger
from
any
Dark
wizard
if
you
are
still
worried
by
all
means
come
and
see
me
outside
class
hours
if
someone
is
alarming
you
with
fibs
about
reborn
Dark
wizards
I
would
like
to
hear
about
it
i
am
here
to
help
i
am
your
friend
and
now
you
will
kindly
continue
your
reading
page
five
Basics
for
Beginners
professor
Umbridge
sat
down
behind
her
desk
harry
however
stood
up
everyone
was
staring
at
him
Seamus
looked
half-scared
half-fascinated
harry
no
hermione
whispered
in
a
warning
voice
tugging
at
his
sleeve
but
Harry
jerked
his
arm
out
of
her
reach
so
according
to
you
Cedric
Diggory
dropped
dead
of
his
own
accord
did
he
harry
asked
his
voice
shaking
there
was
a
collective
intake
of
breath
from
the
class
for
none
of
them
apart
from
Ron
and
hermione
had
ever
heard
Harry
talk
about
what
had
happened
on
the
night
Cedric
had
died
they
stared
avidly
from
Harry
to
Professor
Umbridge
who
had
raised
her
eyes
and
was
staring
at
him
without
a
trace
of
a
fake
smile
on
her
face
cedric
Diggorys
death
was
a
tragic
accident
she
said
coldly
it
was
murder
said
Harry
he
could
feel
himself
shaking
he
had
hardly
spoken
to
anyone
about
this
least
of
all
thirty
eagerly
listening
classmates
voldemort
killed
him
and
you
know
it
professor
Umbridges
face
was
quite
blank
for
a
moment
Harry
thought
she
was
going
to
scream
at
him
then
she
said
in
her
softest
most
sweetly
girlish
voice
Come
here
mr.
Potter
dear
he
kicked
his
chair
aside
strode
around
Ron
and
Hermione
and
up
to
the
teachers
desk
he
could
feel
the
rest
of
the
class
holding
its
breath
he
felt
so
angry
he
did
not
care
what
happened
next
professor
Umbridge
pulled
a
small
roll
of
pink
parchment
out
of
her
handbag
stretched
it
out
on
the
desk
dipped
her
quill
into
a
bottle
of
ink
and
started
scribbling
hunched
over
so
that
Harry
could
not
see
what
she
was
writing
nobody
spoke
after
a
minute
or
so
she
rolled
up
the
parchment
and
tapped
it
with
her
wand
it
sealed
itself
seamlessly
so
that
he
could
not
open
it
take
this
to
Professor
McGonagall
dear
said
Professor
Umbridge
holding
out
the
note
to
him
he
took
it
from
her
without
saying
a
word
turned
on
his
heel
and
left
the
room
not
even
looking
back
at
Ron
and
Hermione
slamming
the
classroom
door
shut
behind
him
he
walked
very
fast
along
the
corridor
the
note
to
McGonagall
clutched
tight
in
his
hand
and
turning
a
corner
walked
slap
into
Peeves
the
poltergeist
a
wide-mouthed
little
man
floating
on
his
back
in
midair
juggling
several
inkwells
why
its
Potty
Wee
Potter
cackled
Peeves
allowing
two
of
the
inkwells
to
fall
to
the
ground
where
they
smashed
and
spattered
the
walls
with
ink
Harry
jumped
backwards
out
of
the
way
with
a
snarl
get
out
of
it
Peeves
oooh
Crackpots
feeling
cranky
said
Peeves
pursuing
Harry
along
the
corridor
leering
as
he
zoomed
along
above
him
what
is
it
this
time
my
fine
Potty
friend
hearing
voices
seeing
visions
speaking
in
Peeves
blew
a
gigantic
raspberry
tongues
i
said
leave
me
alone
harry
shouted
running
down
the
nearest
flight
of
stairs
but
Peeves
merely
slid
down
the
banister
on
his
back
beside
him
oh
most
think
hes
barking
the
potty
wee
lad
But
some
are
more
kindly
and
think
hes
just
sad
but
Peevesy
knows
better
and
says
that
hes
mad
shut
up
a
door
to
his
left
flew
open
and
Professor
McGonagall
emerged
from
her
office
looking
grim
and
slightly
harassed
what
on
earth
are
you
shouting
about
Potter
she
snapped
as
Peeves
cackled
gleefully
and
zoomed
out
of
sight
why
arent
you
in
class
ive
been
sent
to
see
you
said
Harry
stiffly
sent
what
do
you
mean
sent
he
held
out
the
note
from
Professor
Umbridge
professor
McGonagall
took
it
from
him
frowning
slit
it
open
with
a
tap
of
her
wand
stretched
it
out
and
began
to
read
her
eyes
zoomed
from
side
to
side
behind
their
square
spectacles
as
she
read
what
Umbridge
had
written
and
with
each
line
they
became
narrower
come
in
here
Potter
he
followed
her
inside
her
study
the
door
closed
automatically
behind
him
well
said
Professor
McGonagall
rounding
on
him
is
this
true
is
what
true
harry
asked
rather
more
aggressively
than
he
had
intended
professor
he
added
in
an
attempt
to
sound
more
polite
is
it
true
that
you
shouted
at
Professor
Umbridge
yes
said
Harry
you
called
her
a
liar
yes
you
told
her
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
is
back
yes
professor
McGonagall
sat
down
behind
her
desk
watching
Harry
closely
then
she
said
Have
a
biscuit
Potter
have
what
have
a
biscuit
she
repeated
impatiently
indicating
a
tartan
tin
of
cookies
lying
on
top
of
one
of
the
piles
of
papers
on
her
desk
and
sit
down
there
had
been
a
previous
occasion
when
Harry
expecting
to
be
caned
by
Professor
mcGonagall
had
instead
been
appointed
by
her
to
the
Gryffindor
Quidditch
team
he
sank
into
a
chair
opposite
her
and
helped
himself
to
a
Ginger
Newt
feeling
just
as
confused
and
wrong
footed
as
he
had
done
on
that
occasion
professor
McGonagall
set
down
Professor
Umbridges
note
and
looked
very
seriously
at
Harry
potter
you
need
to
be
careful
harry
swallowed
his
mouthful
of
Ginger
Newt
and
stared
at
her
her
tone
of
voice
was
not
at
all
what
he
was
used
to
it
was
not
brisk
crisp
and
stern
it
was
low
and
anxious
and
somehow
much
more
human
than
usual
misbehavior
in
Dolores
Umbridges
class
could
cost
you
much
more
than
house
points
and
a
detention
what
do
you
potter
use
your
common
sense
snapped
Professor
McGonagall
with
an
abrupt
return
to
her
usual
manner
you
know
where
she
comes
from
you
must
know
to
whom
she
is
reporting
the
bell
rang
for
the
end
of
the
lesson
overhead
and
all
around
came
the
elephantine
sounds
of
hundreds
of
students
on
the
move
it
says
here
shes
given
you
detention
every
evening
this
week
starting
tomorrow
Professor
mcGonagall
said
looking
down
at
Umbridges
note
again
every
evening
this
week
harry
repeated
horrified
but
Professor
couldnt
you
no
I

Professor
McGonagall
flatly
but
she
is
your
teacher
and
has
every
right
to
give
you
detention

will
go
to
her
room
at
five
oclock
tomorrow
for
the
first
one
just
remember
tread
carefully
around
Dolores
Umbridge
but
I
was
telling
the
truth
said
Harry
outraged
voldemort
is
back
you
know
he
is
Professor
Dumbledore
knows
he
is
for
heavens
sake
Potter
said
Professor
McGonagall
straightening
her
glasses
angrily
she
had
winced
horribly
when
he
had
used
Voldemorts
name
do
you
really
think
this
is
about
truth
or
lies
its
about
keeping
your
head
down
and
your
temper
under
control
she
stood
up
nostrils
wide
and
mouth
very
thin
and
Harry
stood
up
too
have
another
biscuit
she
said
irritably
thrusting
the
tin
at
him
no
thanks
said
Harry
coldly
dont
be
ridiculous
she
snapped
he
took
one
thanks
he
said
grudgingly
didnt
you
listen
to
Dolores
Umbridges
speech
at
the
start-of-term
feast
Potter
yeah
said
Harry
yeah
she
said
progress
will
be
prohibited
or
well
it
meant
that
that
the
Ministry
of
Magic
is
trying
to
interfere
at
Hogwarts
professor
McGonagall
eyed
him
closely
for
a
moment
then
sniffed
walked
around
her
desk
and
held
open
the
door
for
him
well
Im
glad
you
listen
to
Hermione
Granger
at
any
rate
she
said
pointing
him
out
of
her
office
chapter
thirteen
detention
with
Dolores
dinner
in
the
Great
Hall
that
night
was
not
a
pleasant
experience
for
Harry
the
news
about
his
shouting
match
with
Umbridge
had
traveled
exceptionally
fast
even
by
Hogwarts
standards
he
heard
whispers
all
around
him
as
he
sat
eating
between
Ron
and
Hermione
the
funny
thing
was
that
none
of
the
whisperers
seemed
to
mind
him
overhearing
what
they
were
saying
about
him
on
the
contrary
it
was
as
though
they
were
hoping
he
would
get
angry
and
start
shouting
again
so
that
they
could
hear
his
story
first-hand
he
says
he
saw
Cedric
Diggory
murdered
he
reckons
he
dueled
with
You-Know-Who
come
off
it
who
does
he
think
hes
kidding
pur-Lease
what
I
dont
get
said
Harry
through
clenched
teeth
laying
down
his
knife
and
fork
his
hands
were
shaking
too
much
to
hold
them
steady
is
why
they
all
believed
the
story
two
months
ago
when
Dumbledore
told
them
the
thing
is
Harry
Im
not
sure
they
did
said
Hermione
grimly
oh
lets
get
out
of
here
she
slammed
down
her
own
knife
and
fork
Ron
looked
longingly
at
his
half-finished
apple
pie
but
followed
suit
people
stared
at
them
all
the
way
out
of
the
Hall
what
dyou
mean
youre
not
sure
they
believed
Dumbledore
harry
asked
Hermione
when
they
reached
the
first-floor
landing
look
you
dont
understand
what
it
was
like
after
it
happened
said
Hermione
quietly
you
arrived
back
in
the
middle
of
the
lawn
clutching
Cedrics
dead
body
none
of
us
saw
what
happened
in
the
maze
we
just
had
Dumbledores
word
for
it
that
You-Know-Who
had
come
back
and
killed
Cedric
and
fought
you
which
is
the
truth
said
Harry
loudly
i
know
it
is
Harry
so
will
you
please
stop
biting
my
head
off
said
Hermione
wearily
its
just
that
before
the
truth
could
sink
in
everyone
went
home
for
the
summer
where
they
spent
two
months
reading
about
how
youre
a
nutcase
and
Dumbledores
going
senile
rain
pounded
on
the
windowpanes
as
they
strode
along
the
empty
corridors
back
to
Gryffindor
tower
harry
felt
as
though
his
first
day
had
lasted
a
week
but
he
still
had
a
mountain
of
homework
to
do
before
bed
a
dull
pounding
pain
was
developing
over
his
right
eye
he
glanced
out
of
a
rain-washed
window
at
the
dark
grounds
as
they
turned
into
the
Fat
Ladys
corridor
there
was
still
no
light
in
Hagrids
cabin
mimbulus
mimbletonia
said
Hermione
before
the
Fat
Lady
could
ask
the
portrait
swung
open
to
reveal
the
hole
behind
it
and
the
three
of
them
scrambled
through
it
the
common
room
was
almost
empty
nearly
everyone
was
still
down
at
dinner
crookshanks
uncoiled
himself
from
an
armchair
and
trotted
to
meet
them
purring
loudly
and
when
Harry
ron
and
Hermione
took
their
three
favorite
chairs
at
the
fireside
he
leapt
lightly
on
to
hermiones
lap
and
curled
up
there
like
a
furry
ginger
cushion
harry
gazed
into
the
flames
feeling
drained
and
exhausted
how
can
Dumbledore
have
let
this
happen
hermione
cried
suddenly
making
Harry
and
Ron
jump
Crookshanks
leapt
off
her
looking
affronted
she
pounded
the
arms
of
her
chair
in
fury
so
that
bits
of
stuffing
leaked
out
of
the
holes
how
can
he
let
that
terrible
woman
teach
us
and
in
our
owl
year
too
well
weve
never
had
great
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
teachers
have
we
said
Harry
you
know
what
its
like
Hagrid
told
us
nobody
wants
the
job
they
say
its
jinxed
yes
but
to
employ
someone
whos
actually
refusing
to
let
us
do
magic
whats
Dumbledore
playing
at
and
shes
trying
to
get
people
to
spy
for
her
said
Ron
darkly
remember
when
she
said
she
wanted
us
to
come
and
tell
her
if
we
hear
anyone
saying
You-Know-Whos
back
of
course
shes
here
to
spy
on
us
all
thats
obvious
why
else
would
Fudge
have
wanted
her
to
come
snapped
Hermione
dont
start
arguing
again
said
Harry
wearily
as
Ron
opened
his
mouth
to
retaliate
cant
we
just
lets
just
do
that
homework
get
it
out
of
the
way
they
collected
their
schoolbags
from
a
corner
and
returned
to
the
chairs
by
the
fire
people
were
coming
back
from
dinner
now
harry
kept
his
face
averted
from
the
portrait
hole
but
could
still
sense
the
stares
he
was
attracting
shall
we
do
Snapes
stuff
first
said
Ron
dipping
his
quill
into
his
ink
the
properties
of
moonstone
and
its
uses
in
potion-making
he
muttered
writing
the
words
across
the
top
of
his
parchment
as
he
spoke
them
there
he
underlined
the
title
then
looked
up
expectantly
at
Hermione
so
what
are
the
properties
of
moonstone
and
its
uses
in
potion-making
but
Hermione
was
not
listening
she
was
squinting
over
into
the
far
corner
of
the
room
where
fred
George
and
Lee
Jordan
were
now
sitting
at
the
center
of
a
knot
of
innocent-looking
first
years
all
of
whom
were
chewing
something
that
seemed
to
have
come
out
of
a
large
paper
bag
that
Fred
was
holding
no
Im
sorry
theyve
gone
too
far
she
said
standing
up
and
looking
positively
furious
come
on
Ron
i
what
said
Ron
plainly
playing
for
time
no
come
on
Hermione
we
cant
tell
them
off
for
giving
out
sweets
you
know
perfectly
well
that
those
are
bits
of
Nosebleed
Nougat
or
or
Puking
Pastilles
or
fainting
Fancies
harry
suggested
quietly
one
by
one
as
though
hit
over
the
head
with
an
invisible
mallet
the
first-years
were
slumping
unconscious
in
their
seats
some
slid
right
on
to
the
floor
others
merely
hung
over
the
arms
of
their
chairs
their
tongues
lolling
out
most
of
the
people
watching
were
laughing
Hermione
however
squared
her
shoulders
and
marched
directly
over
to
where
Fred
and
George
now
stood
with
clipboards
closely
observing
the
unconscious
first-years
ron
rose
halfway
out
of
his
chair
hovered
uncertainly
for
a
moment
or
two
then
muttered
to
Harry
Shes
got
it
under
control
before
sinking
as
low
in
his
chair
as
his
lanky
frame
permitted
thats
enough
hermione
said
forcefully
to
Fred
and
George
both
of
whom
looked
up
in
mild
surprise
yeah
youre
right
said
George
nodding
this
dosage
looks
strong
enough
doesnt
it
i
told
you
this
morning
you
cant
test
your
rubbish
on
students
were
paying
them
said
Fred
indignantly
i
dont
care
it
could
be
dangerous
rubbish
said
Fred
calm
down
Hermione
theyre
fine
said
Lee
reassuringly
as
he
walked
from
first-year
to
first
year
inserting
purple
sweets
into
their
open
mouths
yeah
look
theyre
coming
round
now
said
George
a
few
of
the
first-years
were
indeed
stirring
several
looked
so
shocked
to
find
themselves
lying
on
the
floor
or
dangling
off
their
chairs
that
Harry
was
sure
Fred
and
George
had
not
warned
them
what
the
sweets
were
going
to
do
feel
all
right
said
George
kindly
to
a
small
dark-haired
girl
lying
at
his
feet
i
I
think
so
she
said
shakily
excellent
said
Fred
happily
but
the
next
second
Hermione
had
snatched
both
his
clipboard
and
the
paper
bag
of
Fainting
Fancies
from
his
hands
it
is
not
excellent
course
it
is
theyre
alive
arent
they
said
Fred
angrily
you
cant
do
this
what
if
you
made
one
of
them
really
ill
were
not
going
to
make
them
ill
weve
already
tested
them
all
on
ourselves
this
is
just
to
see
if
everyone
reacts
the
same
if
you
dont
stop
doing
it
Im
going
to
put
us
in
detention
said
Fred
in
an
id-like-to-see-you-try-it
voice
make
us
write
lines
said
George
smirking
onlookers
all
over
the
room
were
laughing
hermione
drew
herself
up
to
her
full
height
her
eyes
were
narrowed
and
her
bushy
hair
seemed
to
crackle
with
electricity
no
she
said
her
voice
quivering
with
anger
but
I
will
write
to
your
mother
you
wouldnt
said
George
horrified
taking
a
step
back
from
her
oh
yes
I
would
said
Hermione
grimly
i
cant
stop
you
eating
the
stupid
things
yourselves
but
youre
not
to
give
them
to
the
first-years
fred
and
George
looked
thunderstruck
it
was
clear
that
as
far
as
they
were
concerned
hermiones
threat
was
way
below
the
belt
with
a
last
threatening
look
at
them
she
thrust
Freds
clipboard
and
the
bag
of
Fancies
back
into
his
arms
and
stalked
back
to
her
chair
by
the
fire
ron
was
now
so
low
in
his
seat
that
his
nose
was
roughly
level
with
his
knees
thank
you
for
your
support
Ron
Hermione
said
acidly
you
handled
it
fine
by
yourself
Ron
mumbled
hermione
stared
down
at
her
blank
piece
of
parchment
for
a
few
seconds
then
said
edgily
Oh
its
no
good
I
cant
concentrate
now
im
going
to
bed
she
wrenched
her
bag
open
Harry
thought
she
was
about
to
put
her
books
away
but
instead
she
pulled
out
two
misshapen
woolly
objects
placed
them
carefully
on
a
table
by
the
fireplace
covered
them
with
a
few
screwed-up
bits
of
parchment
and
a
broken
quill
and
stood
back
to
admire
the
effect
what
in
the
name
of
Merlin
are
you
doing
said
Ron
watching
her
as
though
fearful
for
her
sanity
theyre
hats
for
house-elves
she
said
briskly
now
stuffing
her
books
back
into
her
bag
i
did
them
over
the
summer
im
a
really
slow
knitter
without
magic
but
now
Im
back
at
school
I
should
be
able
to
make
lots
more
youre
leaving
out
hats
for
the
house-elves
said
Ron
slowly
and
youre
covering
them
up
with
rubbish
first
yes
said
Hermione
defiantly
swinging
her
bag
on
to
her
back
thats
not
on
said
Ron
angrily
youre
trying
to
trick
them
into
picking
up
the
hats
youre
setting
them
free
when
they
might
not
want
to
be
free
of
course
they
want
to
be
free
said
Hermione
at
once
though
her
face
was
turning
pink
dont
you
dare
touch
those
hats
Ron
she
turned
on
her
heel
and
left
ron
waited
until
she
had
disappeared
through
the
door
to
the
girls
dormitories
then
cleared
the
rubbish
off
the
woolly
hats
they
should
at
least
see
what
theyre
picking
up
he
said
firmly
anyway
he
rolled
up
the
parchment
on
which
he
had
written
the
title
of
Snapes
essay
theres
no
point
trying
to
finish
this
now
I
cant
do
it
without
Hermione
I
havent
got
a
clue
what
youre
supposed
to
do
with
moonstones
have
you
harry
shook
his
head
noticing
as
he
did
so
that
the
ache
in
his
right
temple
was
getting
worse
he
thought
of
the
long
essay
on
giant
wars
and
the
pain
stabbed
at
him
sharply
knowing
perfectly
well
that
when
the
morning
came
he
would
regret
not
finishing
his
homework
that
night
he
piled
his
books
back
into
his
bag
im
going
to
bed
too
he
passed
Seamus
on
the
way
to
the
door
leading
to
the
dormitories
but
did
not
look
at
him
harry
had
a
fleeting
impression
that
Seamus
had
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
but
he
sped
up
and
reached
the
soothing
peace
of
the
stone
spiral
staircase
without
having
to
endure
any
more
provocation
the
following
day
dawned
just
as
leaden
and
rainy
as
the
previous
one
hagrid
was
still
absent
from
the
staff
table
at
breakfast
but
on
the
plus
side
no
Snape
today
said
Ron
bracingly
hermione
yawned
widely
and
poured
herself
some
coffee
she
looked
mildly
pleased
about
something
and
when
Ron
asked
her
what
she
had
to
be
so
happy
about
she
simply
said
The
hats
have
gone
seems
the
house-elves
do
want
freedom
after
all
i
wouldnt
bet
on
it
Ron
told
her
cuttingly
they
might
not
count
as
clothes
they
didnt
look
anything
like
hats
to
me
more
like
woolly
bladders
hermione
did
not
speak
to
him
all
morning
double
Charms
was
succeeded
by
double
Transfiguration
professor
Flitwick
and
Professor
mcGonagall
both
spent
the
first
fifteen
minutes
of
their
lessons
lecturing
the
class
on
the
importance
of
OWLs
what
you
must
remember
said
little
Professor
Flitwick
squeakily
perched
as
ever
on
a
pile
of
books
so
that
he
could
see
over
the
top
of
his
desk
is
that
these
examinations
may
influence
your
futures
for
many
years
to
come
if
you
have
not
already
given
serious
thought
to
your
careers
now
is
the
time
to
do
so
and
in
the
meantime
Im
afraid
we
shall
be
working
harder
than
ever
to
ensure
that
you
all
do
yourselves
justice
they
then
spent
over
an
hour
reviewing
Summoning
Charms
which
according
to
Professor
flitwick
were
bound
to
come
up
in
their
owl
and
he
rounded
off
the
lesson
by
setting
them
their
largest
ever
amount
of
Charms
homework
it
was
the
same
if
not
worse
in
Transfiguration
you
cannot
pass
an
owl
said
Professor
McGonagall
grimly
without
serious
application
practice
and
study
i
see
no
reason
why
everybody
in
this
class
should
not
achieve
an
owl
in
transfiguration
as
long
as
they
put
in
the
work
neville
made
a
sad
little
disbelieving
noise
yes
you
too
Longbottom
said
Professor
McGonagall
theres
nothing
wrong
with
your
work
except
lack
of
confidence
so
today
we
are
starting
Vanishing
Spells
these
are
easier
than
Conjuring
Spells
which
you
would
not
usually
attempt
until
newt
level
but
they
are
still
among
the
most
difficult
magic
you
will
be
tested
on
in
your
owl
she
was
quite
right
Harry
found
the
Vanishing
Spells
horribly
difficult
by
the
end
of
a
double
period
neither
he
nor
Ron
had
managed
to
vanish
the
snails
on
which
they
were
practicing
though
Ron
said
hopefully
he
thought
his
looked
a
bit
paler
hermione
on
the
other
hand
successfully
vanished
her
snail
on
the
third
attempt
earning
her
a
ten-point
bonus
for
Gryffindor
from
Professor
McGonagall
she
was
the
only
person
not
given
homework
everybody
else
was
told
to
practice
the
spell
overnight
ready
for
a
fresh
attempt
on
their
snails
the
following
afternoon
now
panicking
slightly
about
the
amount
of
homework
they
had
to
do
Harry
and
Ron
spent
their
lunch
hour
in
the
library
looking
up
the
uses
of
moonstones
in
potion-making
still
angry
about
Rons
slur
on
her
woolly
hats
Hermione
did
not
join
them
by
the
time
they
reached
Care
of
Magical
Creatures
in
the
afternoon
Harrys
head
was
aching
again
the
day
had
become
cool
and
breezy
and
as
they
walked
down
the
sloping
lawn
towards
hagrids
cabin
on
the
edge
of
the
Forbidden
Forest
they
felt
the
occasional
drop
of
rain
on
their
faces
professor
Grubbly-Plank
stood
waiting
for
the
class
some
ten
yards
from
Hagrids
front
door
a
long
trestle
table
in
front
of
her
laden
with
twigs
as
Harry
and
Ron
reached
her
a
loud
shout
of
laughter
sounded
behind
them
turning
they
saw
Draco
Malfoy
striding
towards
them
surrounded
by
his
usual
gang
of
Slytherin
cronies
he
had
clearly
just
said
something
highly
amusing
because
Crabbe
Goyle
Pansy
Parkinson
and
the
rest
continued
to
snigger
heartily
as
they
gathered
around
the
trestle
table
and
judging
by
the
way
they
all
kept
looking
over
at
harry
he
was
able
to
guess
the
subject
of
the
joke
without
too
much
difficulty
everyone
here
barked
Professor
Grubbly-Plank
once
all
the
Slytherins
and
Gryffindors
had
arrived
lets
crack
on
then
who
can
tell
me
what
these
things
are
called
she
indicated
the
heap
of
twigs
in
front
of
her
hermiones
hand
shot
into
the
air
behind
her
back
Malfoy
did
a
buck-toothed
imitation
of
her
jumping
up
and
down
in
eagerness
to
answer
a
question
pansy
Parkinson
gave
a
shriek
of
laughter
that
turned
almost
at
once
into
a
scream
as
the
twigs
on
the
table
leapt
into
the
air
and
revealed
themselves
to
be
what
looked
like
tiny
pixieish
creatures
made
of
wood
each
with
knobbly
brown
arms
and
legs
two
twiglike
fingers
at
the
end
of
each
hand
and
a
funny
flat
barklike
face
in
which
a
pair
of
beetle-brown
eyes
glittered
oooooh
said
Parvati
and
Lavender
thoroughly
irritating
Harry
anyone
would
have
thought
hagrid
had
never
shown
them
impressive
creatures
admittedly
the
Flobberworms
had
been
a
bit
dull
but
the
Salamanders
and
Hippogriffs
had
been
interesting
enough
and
the
Blast-Ended
skrewts
perhaps
too
much
so
kindly
keep
your
voices
down
girls
said
Professor
Grubbly-Plank
sharply
scattering
a
handful
of
what
looked
like
brown
rice
among
the
stick-creatures
who
immediately
fell
upon
the
food
so
anyone
know
the
names
of
these
creatures
miss
Granger
bowtruckles
said
Hermione
theyre
tree-guardians
usually
live
in
wand-trees
five
points
for
Gryffindor
said
Professor
Grubbly-Plank
yes
these
are
Bowtruckles
and
as
miss
Granger
rightly
says
they
generally
live
in
trees
whose
wood
is
of
wand
quality
anybody
know
what
they
eat
woodlice
said
Hermione
promptly
which
explained
why
what
Harry
had
taken
to
be
grains
of
brown
rice
were
moving
but
fairy
eggs
if
they
can
get
them
good
girl
take
another
five
points
so
whenever
you
need
leaves
or
wood
from
a
tree
in
which
a
Bowtruckle
lodges
it
is
wise
to
have
a
gift
of
woodlice
ready
to
distract
or
placate
it
they
may
not
look
dangerous
but
if
angered
they
will
try
to
gouge
at
human
eyes
with
their
fingers
which
as
you
can
see
are
very
sharp
and
not
at
all
desirable
near
the
eyeballs
so
if
youd
like
to
gather
closer
take
a
few
woodlice
and
a
Bowtruckle
I
have
enough
here
for
one
between
three
you
can
study
them
more
closely
i
want
a
sketch
from
each
of
you
with
all
body-parts
labeled
by
the
end
of
the
lesson
the
class
surged
forwards
around
the
trestle
table
harry
deliberately
circled
around
the
back
so
that
he
ended
up
right
next
to
Professor
Grubbly-Plank
wheres
Hagrid
he
asked
her
while
everyone
else
was
choosing
Bowtruckles
never
you
mind
said
Professor
Grubbly-Plank
repressively
which
had
been
her
attitude
last
time
Hagrid
had
failed
to
turn
up
for
a
class
too
smirking
all
over
his
pointed
face
Draco
malfoy
leaned
across
Harry
and
seized
the
largest
Bowtruckle
maybe
said
Malfoy
in
an
undertone
so
that
only
Harry
could
hear
him
the
stupid
great
oafs
got
himself
badly
injured
maybe
you
will
if
you
dont
shut
up
said
Harry
out
of
the
side
of
his
mouth
maybe
hes
been
messing
with
stuff
thats
too
big
for
him
if
you
get
my
drift
malfoy
walked
away
smirking
over
his
shoulder
at
Harry
who
felt
suddenly
sick
did
Malfoy
know
something
his
father
was
a
Death
Eater
after
all
what
if
he
had
information
about
hagrids
fate
that
had
not
yet
reached
the
ears
of
the
Order
he
hurried
back
around
the
table
to
ron
and
Hermione
who
were
squatting
on
the
grass
some
distance
away
and
attempting
to
persuade
a
Bowtruckle
to
remain
still
long
enough
for
them
to
draw
it
harry
pulled
out
parchment
and
quill
crouched
down
beside
the
others
and
related
in
a
whisper
what
Malfoy
had
just
said
dumbledore
would
know
if
some
thing
had
happened
to
Hagrid
said
Hermione
at
once
its
just
playing
into
Malfoys
hands
to
look
worried
it
tells
him
we
dont
know
exactly
whats
going
on
weve
got
to
ignore
him
Harry
here
hold
the
Bowtruckle
for
a
moment
just
so
I
can
draw
its
face
yes
came
Malfoys
clear
drawl
from
the
group
nearest
them
Father
was
talking
to
the
minister
just
a
couple
of
days
ago
you
know
and
it
sounds
as
though
the
Ministrys
really
determined
to
crack
down
on
sub-standard
teaching
in
this
place
so
even
if
that
overgrown
moron
does
show
up
again
hell
probably
be
sent
packing
straightaway
ouch
harry
had
gripped
the
Bowtruckle
so
hard
that
it
had
almost
snapped
and
it
had
just
taken
a
great
retaliatory
swipe
at
his
hand
with
its
sharp
fingers
leaving
two
long
deep
cuts
there
harry
dropped
it
crabbe
and
Goyle
who
had
already
been
guffawing
at
the
idea
of
Hagrid
being
sacked
laughed
still
harder
as
the
Bowtruckle
set
off
at
full
tilt
towards
the
Forest
a
little
moving
stick-man
soon
swallowed
up
among
the
tree
roots
when
the
bell
echoed
distantly
over
the
grounds
Harry
rolled
up
his
blood-stained
Bowtruckle
picture
and
marched
off
to
Herbology
with
his
hand
wrapped
in
Hermiones
handkerchief
and
Malfoys
derisive
laughter
still
ringing
in
his
ears
if
he
calls
Hagrid
a
moron
one
more
time
said
Harry
through
gritted
teeth
harry
dont
go
picking
a
row
with
Malfoy
dont
forget
hes
a
prefect
now
he
could
make
life
difficult
for
you
wow
I
wonder
what
itd
be
like
to
have
a
difficult
life
said
Harry
sarcastically
ron
laughed
but
Hermione
frowned
together
they
traipsed
across
the
vegetable
patch
the
sky
still
appeared
unable
to
make
up
its
mind
whether
it
wanted
to
rain
or
not
i
just
wish
Hagrid
would
hurry
up
and
get
back
thats
all
said
Harry
in
a
low
voice
as
they
reached
the
greenhouses
and
dont
say
that
Grubbly-Plank
womans
a
better
teacher
he
added
threateningly
i
wasnt
going
to
said
Hermione
calmly
because
shell
never
be
as
good
as
Hagrid
said
Harry
firmly
fully
aware
that
he
had
just
experienced
an
exemplary
Care
of
Magical
Creatures
lesson
and
was
thoroughly
annoyed
about
it
the
door
of
the
nearest
greenhouse
opened
and
some
fourth-years
spilled
out
of
it
including
ginny
hi
she
said
brightly
as
she
passed
a
few
seconds
later
Luna
Lovegood
emerged
trailing
behind
the
rest
of
the
class
a
smudge
of
earth
on
her
nose
and
her
hair
tied
in
a
knot
on
the
top
of
her
head
when
she
saw
Harry
her
prominent
eyes
seemed
to
bulge
excitedly
and
she
made
a
beeline
straight
for
him
many
of
his
classmates
turned
curiously
to
watch
luna
took
a
great
breath
and
then
said
without
so
much
as
a
preliminary
hello
I
believe
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
is
back
and
I
believe
you
fought
him
and
escaped
from
him
er
right
said
Harry
awkwardly
luna
was
wearing
what
looked
like
a
pair
of
orange
radishes
for
earrings
a
fact
that
Parvati
and
Lavender
seemed
to
have
noticed
as
they
were
both
giggling
and
pointing
at
her
earlobes
you
can
laugh
Luna
said
her
voice
rising
apparently
under
the
impression
that
Parvati
and
lavender
were
laughing
at
what
she
had
said
rather
than
what
she
was
wearing
but
people
used
to
believe
there
were
no
such
things
as
the
Blibbering
Humdinger
or
the
Crumple-Horned
snorkack
well
they
were
right
werent
they
said
Hermione
impatiently
there
werent
any
such
things
as
the
Blibbering
Humdinger
or
the
Crumple-Horned
Snorkack
luna
gave
her
a
withering
look
and
flounced
away
radishes
swinging
madly
Parvati
and
lavender
were
not
the
only
ones
hooting
with
laughter
now
dyou
mind
not
offending
the
only
people
who
believe
me
harry
asked
Hermione
as
they
made
their
way
into
class
oh
for
heavens
sake
Harry
you
can
do
better
than
her
said
Hermione
ginnys
told
me
all
about
her
apparently
shell
only
believe
in
things
as
long
as
theres
no
proof
at
all
well
I
wouldnt
expect
anything
else
from
someone
whose
father
runs
The
Quibbler
harry
thought
of
the
sinister
winged
horses
he
had
seen
on
the
night
he
had
arrived
and
how
luna
had
said
she
could
see
them
too
his
spirits
sank
slightly
had
she
been
lying
but
before
he
could
devote
much
more
thought
to
the
matter
Ernie
Macmillan
had
stepped
up
to
him
i
want
you
to
know
Potter
he
said
in
a
loud
carrying
voice
that
its
not
only
weirdos
who
support
you
i
personally
believe
you
one
hundred
percent
my
family
have
always
stood
firm
behind
Dumbledore
and
so
do
I
er
thanks
very
much
Ernie
said
Harry
taken
aback
but
pleased
ernie
might
be
pompous
on
occasions
like
this
but
Harry
was
in
a
mood
to
deeply
appreciate
a
vote
of
confidence
from
somebody
who
did
not
have
radishes
dangling
from
their
ears
ernies
words
had
certainly
wiped
the
smile
from
Lavender
Browns
face
and
as
he
turned
to
talk
to
Ron
and
Hermione
Harry
caught
Seamuss
expression
which
looked
both
confused
and
defiant
to
nobodys
surprise
Professor
Sprout
started
their
lesson
by
lecturing
them
about
the
importance
of
owls.
Harry
wished
all
the
teachers
would
stop
doing
this
he
was
starting
to
get
an
anxious
twisted
feeling
in
his
stomach
every
time
he
remembered
how
much
homework
he
had
to
do
a
feeling
that
worsened
dramatically
when
Professor
Sprout
gave
them
yet
another
essay
at
the
end
of
class
tired
and
smelling
strongly
of
dragon
dung
Professor
Sprouts
preferred
type
of
fertilizer
the
Gryffindors
trooped
back
up
to
the
castle
an
hour
and
a
half
later
none
of
them
talking
very
much
it
had
been
another
long
day
as
Harry
was
starving
and
he
had
his
first
detention
with
Umbridge
at
five
oclock
he
headed
straight
for
dinner
without
dropping
off
his
bag
in
Gryffindor
Tower
so
that
he
could
bolt
something
down
before
facing
whatever
she
had
in
store
for
him
he
had
barely
reached
the
entrance
of
the
Great
Hall
however
when
a
loud
and
angry
voice
yelled
Oy
Potter
what
now
he
muttered
wearily
turning
to
face
Angelina
Johnson
who
looked
as
though
she
was
in
a
towering
temper
ill
tell
you
what
now
she
said
marching
straight
up
to
him
and
poking
him
hard
in
the
chest
with
her
finger
how
come
youve
landed
yourself
in
detention
for
five
oclock
on
Friday
what
said
Harry
why
oh
yeah
Keeper
tryouts
now
he
remembers
snarled
Angelina
didnt
I
tell
you
I
wanted
to
do
a
tryout
with
the
wholeteam
and
find
someone
who
fitted
in
with
everyone
didnt
I
tell
you
Id
booked
the
Quidditch
pitch
specially
and
now
youve
decided
youre
not
going
to
be
there
i
didnt
decide
not
to
be
there
said
Harry
stun
g
by
the
injustice
of
these
words
i
got
detention
from
that
Umbridge
woman
just
because
I
told
her
the
truth
about
You-Know-Who
well
you
can
just
go
straight
to
her
and
ask
her
to
let
you
off
on
Friday
said
Angelina
fiercely
and
I
dont
care
how
you
do
it
tell
her
You-Know-Whos
a
figment
of
your
imagination
if
you
like
just
make
sure
youre
there
she
turned
on
her
heel
and
stormed
away
you
know
what
harry
said
to
Ron
and
Hermione
as
they
entered
the
Great
Hall
i
think
wed
better
check
with
Puddlemere
United
whether
Oliver
Woods
been
killed
during
a
training
session
because
Angelina
seems
to
be
channeling
his
spirit
what
dyou
reckon
are
the
odds
of
Umbridge
letting
you
off
on
Friday
said
Ron
skeptically
as
they
sat
down
at
the
Gryffindor
table
less
than
zero
said
Harry
glumly
tipping
lamb
c
hops
on
to
his
plate
and
starting
to
eat
better
try
though
hadnt
I
ill
offer
to
do
two
more
detentions
or
something
I
dunno
he
swallowed
a
mouthful
of
potato
and
added
I
hope
she
doesnt
keep
me
too
long
this
evening
you
realize
weve
got
to
write
three
essays
practice
Vanishing
Spells
for
McGonagall
work
out
a
counter-charm
for
Flitwick
finish
the
Bowtruckle
drawing
and
start
that
stupid
dream
diary
for
trelawney
ron
moaned
and
for
some
reason
glanced
up
at
the
ceiling
and
it
looks
like
its
going
to
rain
whats
that
got
to
do
with
our
homework
said
Hermione
her
eyebrows
raised
nothing
said
Ron
at
once
his
ears
reddening
at
five
to
five
Harry
bade
the
other
two
goodbye
and
set
off
for
Umbridges
office
on
the
third
floor
when
he
knocked
on
the
door
she
called
Come
in
in
a
sugary
voice
he
entered
cautiously
looking
around
he
had
known
this
office
under
three
of
its
previous
occupants
in
the
days
when
Gilderoy
Lockhart
had
lived
here
it
had
been
plastered
in
beaming
portraits
of
himself
when
Lupin
had
occupied
it
it
was
likely
you
would
meet
some
fascinating
Dark
creature
in
a
cage
or
tank
if
you
came
to
call
in
the
impostor
Moodys
days
it
had
been
packed
with
various
instruments
and
artifacts
for
the
detection
of
wrong
doing
and
concealment
now
however
it
looked
totally
unrecognizable
the
surfaces
had
all
been
draped
in
lacy
covers
and
cloths
there
were
several
vases
full
of
dried
flowers
each
one
residing
on
its
own
doily
and
on
one
of
the
walls
was
a
collection
of
ornamental
plates
each
decorated
with
a
large
technicolor
kitten
wearing
a
different
bow
around
its
neck
these
were
so
foul
that
Harry
stared
at
them
transfixed
until
Professor
Umbridge
spoke
again
good
evening
mr.
Potter
harry
started
and
looked
around
he
had
not
noticed
her
at
first
because
she
was
wearing
a
luridly
flowered
set
of
robes
that
blended
only
too
well
with
the
tablecloth
on
the
desk
behind
her
evening
Professor
Umbridge
Harry
said
stiffly
well
sit
down
she
said
pointing
towards
a
small
table
draped
in
lace
beside
which
she
had
drawn
up
a
straight-backed
chair
a
piece
of
blank
parchment
lay
on
the
table
apparently
waiting
for
him
er
said
Harry
without
moving
professor
Umbridge
er
before
we
start
I
I
wanted
to
ask
you
a
a
favor
her
bulging
eyes
narrowed
oh
yes
well
Im
im
in
the
Gryffindor
Quidditch
team
and
I
was
supposed
to
be
at
the
tryouts
for
the
new
Keeper
at
five
oclock
on
Friday
and
I
was
was
wondering
whether
I
could
skip
detention
that
night
and
do
it
do
it
another
night
instead
he
knew
long
before
he
reached
the
end
of
his
sentence
that
it
was
no
good
oh
no
said
Umbridge
smiling
so
widely
that
she
looked
as
though
she
had
just
swallowed
a
particularly
juicy
fly
oh
no
no
no
this
is
your
punishment
for
spreading
evil
nasty
attention-seeking
stories
mr.
Potter
and
punishments
certainly
cannot
be
adjusted
to
suit
the
guilty
ones
convenience
no
you
will
come
here
at
five
oclock
tomorrow
and
the
next
day
and
on
Friday
too
and
you
will
do
your
detentions
as
planned
i
think
it
rather
a
good
thing
that
you
are
missing
something
you
really
want
to
do
it
ought
to
reinforce
the
lesson
I
am
trying
to
teach
you
harry
felt
the
blood
surge
to
his
head
and
heard
a
thumping
noise
in
his
ears
so
he
told
evil
nasty
attention-seeking
stones
did
he
she
was
watching
him
with
her
head
slightly
to
one
side
still
smiling
widely
as
though
she
knew
exactly
what
he
was
thinking
and
was
waiting
to
see
whether
he
would
start
shouting
again
with
a
massive
effort
Harry
looked
away
from
her
dropped
his
schoolbag
beside
the
straight-backed
chair
and
sat
down
there
said
Umbridge
sweetly
were
getting
better
at
controlling
our
temper
already
arent
we
now
you
are
going
to
be
doing
some
lines
for
me
mr.
Potter
no
not
with
your
quill
she
added
as
Harry
bent
down
to
open
his
bag
youre
going
to
be
using
a
rather
special
one
of
mine
here
you
are
she
handed
him
a
long
thin
black
quill
with
an
unusually
sharp
point
i
want
you
to
write
I
must
not
tell
lies
she
told
him
softly
how
many
times
harry
asked
with
a
creditable
imitation
of
politeness
oh
as
long
as
it
takes
for
the
message
to
sink
in
said
Umbridge
sweetly
off
you
go
she
moved
over
to
her
desk
sat
down
and
bent
over
a
stack
of
parchment
that
looked
like
essays
for
marking
harry
raised
the
sharp
black
quill
then
realized
what
was
missing
you
havent
given
me
any
ink
he
said
oh
you
wont
need
ink
said
Professor
Umbridge
with
the
merest
suggestion
of
a
laugh
in
her
voice
harry
placed
the
point
of
the
quill
on
the
paper
and
wrote
I
must
not
tell
lies
he
let
out
a
gasp
of
pain
the
words
had
appeared
on
the
parchment
in
what
appeared
to
be
shining
red
ink
at
the
same
time
the
words
had
appeared
on
the
back
of
Harrys
right
hand
cut
into
his
skin
as
though
traced
there
by
a
scalpel
yet
even
as
he
stared
at
the
shining
cut
the
skin
healed
over
again
leaving
the
place
where
it
had
been
slightly
redder
than
before
but
quite
smooth
harry
looked
round
at
Umbridge
she
was
watching
him
her
wide
toadlike
mouth
stretched
in
a
smile
yes
nothing
said
Harry
quietly
he
looked
back
at
the
parchment
placed
the
quill
on
it
once
more
wrote
I
must
not
tell
lies
and
felt
the
searing
pain
on
the
back
of
his
hand
for
a
second
time
once
again
the
words
had
been
cut
into
his
skin
once
again
they
healed
over
seconds
later
and
on
it
went
again
and
again
Harry
wrote
the
words
on
the
parchment
in
what
he
soon
came
to
realize
was
not
ink
but
his
own
blood
and
again
and
again
the
words
were
cut
into
the
back
of
his
hand
healed
and
reappeared
the
next
time
he
set
quill
to
parchment
darkness
fell
outside
Umbridges
window
harry
did
not
ask
when
he
would
be
allowed
to
stop
he
did
not
even
check
his
watch
he
knew
she
was
watching
him
for
signs
of
weakness
and
he
was
not
going
to
show
any
not
even
if
he
had
to
sit
there
all
night
cutting
open
his
own
hand
with
this
quill
come
here
she
said
after
what
seemed
hours
he
stood
up
his
hand
was
stinging
painfully
when
he
looked
down
at
it
he
saw
that
the
cut
had
healed
but
that
the
skin
there
was
red
raw
hand
she
said
he
extended
it
she
took
it
in
her
own
harry
repressed
a
shudder
as
she
touched
him
with
her
thick
stubby
fingers
on
which
she
wore
a
number
of
ugly
old
rings
tut
tut
I
dont
seem
to
have
made
much
of
an
impression
yet
she
said
smiling
well
well
just
have
to
try
again
tomorrow
evening
wont
we
you
may
go
harry
left
her
office
without
a
word
the
school
was
quite
deserted
it
was
surely
past
midnight
he
walked
slowly
up
the
corridor
then
when
he
had
turned
the
corner
and
was
sure
she
would
not
hear
him
broke
into
a
run
he
had
not
had
time
to
practice
Vanishing
Spells
had
not
written
a
single
dream
in
his
dream
diary
and
had
not
finished
the
drawing
of
the
Bowtruckle
nor
had
he
written
his
essays
he
skipped
breakfast
next
morning
to
scribble
down
a
couple
of
made-up
dreams
for
Divination
their
first
lesson
and
was
surprised
to
find
a
disheveled
Ron
keeping
him
company
how
come
you
didnt
do
it
last
night
harry
asked
as
Ron
stared
wildly
around
the
common
room
for
inspiration
ron
who
had
been
fast
asleep
when
Harry
got
back
to
the
dormitory
muttered
something
about
doing
other
stuff
bent
low
over
his
parchment
and
scrawled
a
few
words
thatll
have
to
do
he
said
slamming
the
diary
shut
ive
said
I
dreamed
I
was
buying
a
new
pair
of
shoes
she
cant
make
anything
weird
out
of
that
can
she
they
hurried
off
to
North
Tower
together
how
was
detention
with
Umbridge
anyway
what
did
she
make
you
do
harry
hesitated
for
a
fraction
of
a
second
then
said
Lines
thats
not
too
bad
then
eh
said
Ron
nope
said
Harry
hey
I
forgot
did
she
let
you
off
for
Friday
no
said
Harry
ron
groaned
sympathetically
it
was
another
bad
day
for
Harry
he
was
one
of
the
worst
in
Transfiguration
not
having
practiced
Vanishing
Spells
at
all
he
had
to
give
up
his
lunch
hour
to
complete
the
picture
of
the
bowtruckle
and
meanwhile
Professors
McGonagall
Grubbly-Plank
and
Sinistra
gave
them
yet
more
homework
which
he
had
no
prospect
of
finishing
that
evening
because
of
his
second
detention
with
Umbridge
to
cap
it
all
Angelina
Johnson
tracked
him
down
at
dinner
again
and
on
learning
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
attend
Fridays
Keeper
tryouts
told
him
she
was
not
at
all
impressed
by
his
attitude
and
that
she
expected
players
who
wished
to
remain
on
the
team
to
put
training
before
their
other
commitments
im
in
detention
harry
yelled
after
her
as
she
s
talked
away
dyou
think
Id
rather
be
stuck
in
a
room
with
that
old
toad
or
playing
Quidditch
at
least
its
only
lines
said
Hermione
consolingly
as
Harry
sank
back
on
to
his
bench
and
looked
down
at
his
steak
and
kidney
pie
which
he
no
longer
fancied
very
much
its
not
as
if
its
a
dreadful
punishment
really
harry
opened
his
mouth
closed
it
again
and
nodded
he
was
not
really
sure
why
he
was
not
telling
Ron
and
Hermione
exactly
what
was
happening
in
Umbridges
room
he
only
knew
that
he
did
not
want
to
see
their
looks
of
horror
that
would
make
the
whole
thing
seem
worse
and
therefore
more
difficult
to
face
he
also
felt
dimly
that
this
was
between
himself
and
Umbridge
a
private
battle
of
wills
and
he
was
not
going
to
give
her
the
satisfaction
of
hearing
that
he
had
complained
about
it
i
cant
believe
how
much
homework
weve
got
said
Ron
miserably
well
why
didnt
you
do
any
last
night
hermione
asked
him
where
were
you
anyway
i
was
i
fancied
a
walk
said
Ron
shiftily
harry
had
the
distinct
impression
that
he
was
not
alone
in
concealing
things
at
the
moment
the
second
detention
was
just
as
bad
as
the
previous
one
the
skin
on
the
back
of
Harrys
hand
became
irritated
more
quickly
now
and
was
soon
red
and
inflamed
harry
thought
it
unlikely
that
it
would
keep
healing
as
effectively
for
long
soon
the
cut
would
remain
etched
into
his
hand
and
umbridge
would
perhaps
be
satisfied
he
let
no
gasp
of
pain
escape
him
however
and
from
the
moment
of
entering
the
room
to
the
moment
of
his
dismissal
again
past
midnight
he
said
nothing
but
good
evening
and
goodnight
his
homework
situation
however
was
now
desperate
and
when
he
returned
to
the
Gryffindor
common
room
he
did
not
though
exhausted
go
to
bed
but
opened
his
books
and
began
Snapes
moonstone
essay
it
was
half
past
two
by
the
time
he
had
finished
it
he
knew
he
had
done
a
poor
job
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
unless
he
had
something
to
give
in
he
would
be
in
detention
with
Snape
next
he
then
dashed
off
answers
to
the
questions
Professor
McGonagall
had
set
them
cobbled
together
something
on
the
proper
handling
of
Bowtruckles
for
Professor
Grubbly
plank
and
staggered
up
to
bed
where
he
fell
fully
clothed
on
top
of
the
covers
and
fell
asleep
immediately
thursday
passed
in
a
haze
of
tiredness
ron
seemed
very
sleepy
too
though
Harry
could
not
see
why
he
should
be
harrys
third
detention
passed
in
the
same
way
as
the
previous
two
except
that
after
two
hours
the
words
I
must
not
tell
lies
did
not
fade
from
the
back
of
Harrys
hand
but
remained
scratched
there
oozing
droplets
of
blood
the
pause
in
the
pointed
quills
scratching
made
Professor
Umbridge
look
up
ah
she
said
softly
moving
around
her
desk
to
examine
his
hand
herself
good
that
ought
to
serve
as
a
reminder
to
you
oughtnt
it
you
may
leave
for
tonight
do
I
still
have
to
come
back
tomorrow
said
Harry
picking
up
his
schoolbag
with
his
left
hand
rather
than
his
smarting
right
one
oh
yes
said
Professor
Umbridge
smiling
as
widely
as
before
yes
I
think
we
can
etch
the
message
a
little
deeper
with
another
evenings
work
harry
had
never
before
considered
the
possibility
that
there
might
be
another
teacher
in
the
world
he
hated
more
than
Snape
but
as
he
walked
back
towards
Gryffindor
Tower
he
had
to
admit
he
had
found
a
strong
contender
shes
evil
he
thought
as
he
climbed
a
staircase
to
the
seventh
floor
shes
an
evil
twisted
mad
old
ron
he
had
reached
the
top
of
the
stairs
turned
right
and
almost
walked
into
Ron
who
was
lurking
behind
a
statue
of
Lachlan
the
Lanky
clutching
his
broomstick
he
gave
a
great
leap
of
surprise
when
he
saw
Harry
and
attempted
to
hide
his
new
Cleansweep
Eleven
behind
his
back
what
are
you
doing
er
nothing
what
are
you
doing
harry
frowned
at
him

tell
me

are
you
hiding

im
Im

from
Fred

George

said
Ron
they
just
went
past
with
a
bunch
of
first-years

testing
stuff
on
them
again
i
mean
they
cant
do
it
in
the
common
room
now

they
not
with
Hermione
there
he
was
talking
in
a
very
fast
feverish
way
but

broom

you
havent
been
flying

harry
asked
i

well

ron
said
defensively
turning
redder
with
every
second
i

thought

out

Gryffindor
Keeper

a
decent
broom

Harry

said
Ron
who
looked
immensely
relieved
at
Harrys
reaction
charlie
Fred
and
george
always
made
me
Keep
for
them
when
they
were
training
during
the
holidays
so

evening
since
Tuesday

though

at
me
but
it
hasnt
been
easy
and
I

ron

nervous
and
anxious
fred
and
George
are
going
to
laugh
themselves
stupid
when
I
turn
up
for
the
tryouts
they
havent
stopped
taking
the
mickey
out
of
me
since
I
got
made
a
prefect
i
wish
I
was
going
to
be
there
said
Harry
bitterly
as
they
set
off
together
towards
the
common
room
yeah
so
do
Harry
whats
that
on
the
back
of
your
hand
harry
who
had
just
scratched
his
nose
with
his
free
right
hand
tried
to
hide
it
but
had
as
much
success
as
Ron
with
his
Cleansweep
its
just
a
cut
its
nothing
its
but
Ron
had
grabbed
Harrys
forearm
and
pulled
the
back
of
Harrys
hand
up
level
with
his
eyes
there
was
a
pause
during
which
he
stared
at
the
words
carved
into
the
skin
then
looking
sick
he
released
Harry
i
thought
you
said
she
was
just
giving
you
lines
harry
hesitated
but
after
all
Ron
had
been
honest
with
him
so
he
told
Ron
the
truth
about
the
hours
he
had
been
spending
in
Umbridges
office
the
old
hag
ron
said
in
a
revolted
whisper
as
they
came
to
a
halt
in
front
of
the
Fat
Lady
who
was
dozing
peacefully
with
her
head
against
her
frame
shes
sick
go
to
McGonagall
say
something
no
said
Harry
at
once
im
not
giving
her
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
shes
got
to
me
got
to
you
you
cant
let
her
get
away
with
this
i
dont
know
how
much
power
McGonagalls
got
over
her
said
Harry
dumbledore
then
tell
Dumbledore
no
said
Harry
flatly
why
not
hes
got
enough
on
his
mind
said
Harry
but
that
was
not
the
true
reason
he
was
not
going
to
go
to
Dumbledore
for
help
when
Dumbledore
had
not
spoken
to
him
once
since
June
well
I
reckon
you
should
Ron
began
but
he
was
interrupted
by
the
Fat
Lady
who
had
been
watching
them
sleepily
and
now
burst
out
Are
you
going
to
give
me
the
password
or
will
I
have
to
stay
awake
all
night
waiting
for
you
to
finish
your
conversation
friday
dawned
sullen
and
sodden
as
the
rest
of
the
week
though
Harry
automatically
glanced
towards
the
staff
table
when
he
entered
the
Great
Hall
it
was
without
any
real
hope
of
seeing
hagrid
and
he
turned
his
mind
immediately
to
his
more
pressing
problems
such
as
the
mountainous
pile
of
homework
he
had
to
do
and
the
prospect
of
yet
another
detention
with
umbridge
two
things
sustained
Harry
that
day
one
was
the
thought
that
it
was
almost
the
weekend
the
other
was
that
dreadful
though
his
final
detention
with
Umbridge
was
sure
to
be
he
had
a
distant
view
of
the
Quidditch
pitch
from
her
window
and
might
with
luck
be
able
to
see
something
of
rons
tryout
these
were
rather
feeble
rays
of
light
it
was
true
but
Harry
was
grateful
for
anything
that
might
lighten
his
present
darkness
he
had
never
had
a
worse
first
week
of
term
at
hogwarts
at
five
oclock
that
evening
he
knocked
on
Professor
Umbridges
office
door
for
what
he
sincerely
hoped
would
be
the
final
time
and
was
told
to
enter
the
blank
parchment
lay
ready
for
him
on
the
lace-covered
table
the
pointed
black
quill
beside
it
you
know
what
to
do
mr.
Potter
said
Umbridge
smiling
sweetly
at
him
harry
picked
up
the
quill
and
glanced
through
the
window
if
he
just
shifted
his
chair
an
inch
or
so
to
the
right
on
the
pretext
of
shifting
himself
closer
to
the
table
he
managed
it
he
now
had
a
distant
view
of
the
Gryffindor
Quidditch
team
soaring
up
and
down
the
pitch
while
half
a
dozen
black
figures
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
three
high
goalposts
apparently
awaiting
their
turn
to
keep
it
was
impossible
to
tell
which
one
was
Ron
at
this
distance
i
must
not
tell
lies
Harry
wrote
the
cut
in
the
back
of
his
right
hand
opened
and
began
to
bleed
afresh
i
must
not
tell
lies
the
cut
dug
deeper
stinging
and
smarting
i
must
not
tell
lies
blood
trickled
down
his
wrist
he
chanced
another
glance
out
of
the
window
whoever
was
defending
the
goalposts
now
was
doing
a
very
poor
job
indeed
katie
Bell
scored
twice
in
the
few
seconds
Harry
dared
to
watch
hoping
very
much
that
the
Keeper
wasnt
Ron
he
dropped
his
eyes
back
to
the
parchment
shining
with
blood
i
must
not
tell
lies
i
must
not
tell
lies
he
looked
up
whenever
he
thought
he
could
risk
it
when
he
could
hear
the
scratching
of
umbridges
quill
or
the
opening
of
a
desk
drawer
the
third
person
to
try
out
was
pretty
good
the
fourth
was
terrible
the
fifth
dodged
a
Bludger
exceptionally
well
but
then
fumbled
an
easy
save
the
sky
was
darkening
and
Harry
doubted
he
would
be
able
to
see
the
sixth
and
seventh
people
at
all
i
must
not
tell
lies
i
must
not
tell
lies
the
parchment
was
now
dotted
with
drops
of
blood
from
the
back
of
his
hand
which
was
searing
with
pain
when
he
next
looked
up
night
had
fallen
and
the
Quidditch
pitch
was
no
longer
visible
lets
see
if
youve
gotten
the
message
yet
shall
we
said
Umbridges
soft
voice
half
an
hour
later
she
moved
towards
him
stretching
out
her
short
ringed
fingers
for
his
arm
and
then
as
she
took
hold
of
him
to
examine
the
words
now
cut
into
his
skin
pain
seared
not
across
the
back
of
his
hand
but
across
the
scar
on
his
forehead
at
the
same
time
he
had
a
most
peculiar
sensation
somewhere
around
his
midriff
he
wrenched
his
arm
out
of
her
grip
and
leapt
to
his
feet
staring
at
her
she
looked
back
at
him
a
smile
stretching
her
wide
slack
mouth
yes
it
hurts
doesnt
it
she
said
softly
he
did
not
answer
his
heart
was
thumping
very
hard
and
fast
was
she
talking
about
his
hand
or
did
she
know
what
he
had
just
felt
in
his
forehead
well
I
think
Ive
made
my
point
mr.
Potter
you
may
go
he
caught
up
his
schoolbag
and
left
the
room
as
quickly
as
he
could
stay
calm
he
told
himself
as
he
sprinted
up
the
stairs
stay
calm
it
doesnt
necessarily
mean
what
you
think
it
means
mimbulus
mimbletonia
he
gasped
at
the
Fat
Lady
who
swung
forwards
once
more
a
roar
of
sound
greeted
him
ron
came
running
towards
him
beaming
all
over
his
face
and
slopping
Butterbeer
down
his
front
from
the
goblet
he
was
clutching
harry
I
did
it
Im
in
Im
Keeper
what
oh
brilliant
said
Harry
trying
to
smile
naturally
while
his
heart
continued
to
race
and
his
hand
throbbed
and
bled
have
a
Butterbeer
ron
pressed
a
bottle
on
him
i
cant
believe
it
wheres
Hermione
gone
shes
there
said
Fred
who
was
also
swigging
Butterbeer
and
pointed
to
an
armchair
by
the
fire
hermione
was
dozing
in
it
her
drink
tipping
precariously
in
her
hand
well
she
said
she
was
pleased
when
I
told
her
said
Ron
looking
slightly
put
out
let
her
sleep
said
George
hastily
it
was
a
few
moments
before
Harry
noticed
that
several
of
the
first-years
gathered
around
them
bore
unmistakable
signs
of
recent
nosebleeds
come
here
Ron
and
see
if
Olivers
old
robes
fit
you
called
Katie
Bell
we
can
take
off
his
name
and
put
yours
on
instead
as
Ron
moved
away
Angelina
came
striding
up
to
Harry
sorry
I
was
a
bit
short
with
you
earlier
Potter
she
said
abruptly
its
stressful
this
managing
lark
you
know
Im
starting
to
think
I
was
a
bit
hard
on
Wood
sometimes
she
was
watching
ron
over
the
rim
of
her
goblet
with
a
slight
frown
on
her
face
look
I
know
hes
your
best
mate
but
hes
not
fabulous
she
said
bluntly
i
think
with
a
bit
of
training
hell
be
all
right
though
he
comes
from
a
family
of
good
Quidditch
players
im
banking
on
him
turning
out
to
have
a
bit
more
talent
than
he
showed
today
to
be
honest
vicky
frobisher
and
Geoffrey
Hooper
both
flew
better
this
evening
but
Hoopers
a
real
whiner
hes
always
moaning
about
something
or
other
and
Vickys
involved
in
all
sorts
of
societies
she
admitted
herself
that
if
training
clashed
with
her
Charms
Club
shed
put
Charms
first
anyway
were
having
a
practice
session
at
two
oclock
tomorrow
so
just
make
sure
youre
there
this
time
and
do
me
a
favor
and
help
Ron
as
much
as
you
can
okay
he
nodded
and
Angelina
strolled
back
to
Alicia
Spinnet
harry
moved
over
to
sit
next
to
hermione
who
awoke
with
a
jerk
as
he
put
down
his
bag
oh
Harry
its
you
good
about
Ron
isnt
it
she
said
blearily
im
just
so-so
so
tired
she
yawned
i
was
up
until
one
oclock
making
more
hat
s
theyre
disappearing
like
mad
and
sure
enough
now
that
he
looked
Harry
saw
that
there
were
woolly
hats
concealed
all
around
the
room
where
unwary
elves
might
accidentally
pick
them
up
great
said
Harry
distractedly
if
he
did
not
tell
somebody
soon
he
would
burst
listen
hermione
I
was
just
up
in
Umbridges
office
and
she
touched
my
arm
hermione
listened
closely
when
Harry
had
finished
she
said
slowly
Youre
worried
You
know-Whos
controlling
her
like
he
controlled
Quirrell
well
said
Harry
dropping
his
voice
its
a
possibility
isnt
it
i
suppose
so
said
Hermione
though
she
sounded
unconvinced
but
I
dont
think
he
can
be
possessing
her
the
way
he
possessed
Quirrell
I
mean
hes
properly
alive
again
now
isnt
he
hes
got
his
own
body
he
wouldnt
need
to
share
someone
elses
he
could
have
her
under
the
imperius
Curse
I
suppose
harry
watched
Fred
George
and
Lee
Jordan
juggling
empty
Butterbeer
bottles
for
a
moment
then
Hermione
said
But
last
year
your
scar
hurt
when
nobody
was
touching
you
and
didnt
dumbledore
say
it
had
to
do
with
what
You-Know-Who
was
feeling
at
the
time
i
mean
maybe
this
hasnt
got
anything
to
do
with
Umbridge
at
all
maybe
its
just
coincidence
it
happened
while
you
were
with
her
shes
evil
said
Harry
flatly
twisted
shes
horrible
yes
but
harry
I
think
you
ought
to
tell
Dumbledore
your
scar
hurt
it
was
the
second
time
in
two
days
he
had
been
advised
to
go
to
Dumbledore
and
his
answer
to
hermione
was
just
the
same
as
his
answer
to
Ron
im
not
bothering
him
with
this
like
you
just
said
its
not
a
big
deal
its
been
hurting
on
and
off
all
summer
it
was
just
a
bit
worse
tonight
thats
all
harry
Im
sure
Dumbledore
would
want
to
be
bothered
by
this
yeah
said
Harry
before
he
could
stop
himself
thats
the
only
bit
of
me
Dumbledore
cares
about
isnt
it
my
scar
dont
say
that
its
not
true
i
think
Ill
write
and
tell
Sirius
about
it
see
what
he
thinks
harry
you
cant
put
something
like
that
in
a
letter
said
Hermione
looking
alarmed
dont
you
remember
Moody
told
us
to
be
careful
what
we
put
in
writing
we
just
cant
guarantee
owls
arent
being
intercepted
any
more
all
right
all
right
I
wont
tell
him
then
said
Harry
irritably
he
got
to
his
feet
im
going
to
bed
tell
Ron
for
me
will
you
oh
no
said
Hermione
looking
relieved
if
youre
going
that
means
I
can
go
too
without
being
rude
im
absolutely
exhausted
and
I
want
to
make
some
more
hats
tomorrow
listen
you
can
help
me
if
you
like
its
quite
fun
Im
getting
better
I
can
do
patterns
and
bobbles
and
all
sorts
of
things
now
harry
looked
into
her
face
which
was
shining
with
glee
and
tried
to
look
as
though
he
was
vaguely
tempted
by
this
offer
er
no
I
dont
think
I
will
thanks
he
said
er
not
tomorrow
ive
got
loads
of
homework
to
do
and
he
traipsed
off
to
the
boys
stairs
leaving
her
looking
slightly
disappointed
chapter
fourteen
percy
and
Padfoot
harry
was
first
to
wake
up
in
his
dormitory
next
morning
he
lay
for
a
moment
watching
dust
swirl
in
the
chink
of
sunlight
coming
through
the
gap
in
his
four-posters
hangings
and
savored
the
thought
that
it
was
Saturday
the
first
week
of
term
seemed
to
have
dragged
on
forever
like
one
gigantic
History
of
Magic
lesson
judging
by
the
sleepy
silence
and
the
freshly
minted
look
of
that
beam
of
sunlight
it
was
just
after
daybreak
he
pulled
open
the
curtains
around
his
bed
got
up
and
started
to
dress
the
only
sound
apart
from
the
distant
twittering
of
birds
was
the
slow
deep
breathing
of
his
fellow
gryffindors
he
opened
his
schoolbag
carefully
pulled
out
parchment
and
quill
and
headed
out
of
the
dormitory
for
the
common
room
making
straight
for
his
favorite
squashy
old
armchair
beside
the
now
extinct
fire
Harry
settled
himself
down
comfortably
and
unrolled
his
parchment
while
looking
around
the
room
the
detritus
of
crumpled-up
bits
of
parchment
old
Gobstones
empty
ingredient
jars
and
sweet
wrappers
that
usually
covered
the
common
room
at
the
end
of
each
day
was
gone
as
were
all
hermiones
elf
hats
wondering
vaguely
how
many
elves
had
now
been
set
free
whether
they
wanted
to
be
or
not
Harry
uncorked
his
ink
bottle
dipped
his
quill
into
it
then
held
it
suspended
an
inch
above
the
smooth
yellowish
surface
of
his
parchment
thinking
hard
but
after
a
minute
or
so
he
found
himself
staring
into
the
empty
grate
at
a
complete
loss
for
what
to
say
he
could
now
appreciate
how
hard
it
had
been
for
Ron
and
Hermione
to
write
him
letters
over
the
summer
how
was
he
supposed
to
tell
Sirius
everything
that
had
happened
over
the
past
week
and
pose
all
the
questions
he
was
burning
to
ask
without
giving
potential
letter-thieves
a
lot
of
information
he
did
not
want
them
to
have
he
sat
quite
motionless
for
a
while
gazing
into
the
fireplace
then
finally
coming
to
a
decision
he
dipped
his
quill
into
the
ink
bottle
once
more
and
set
it
resolutely
on
the
parchment
dear
Snuffles
hope
youre
okay
the
first
week
back
heres
been
terrible
Im
really
glad
its
the
weekend
weve
got
a
new
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
teacher
Professor
Umbridge
shes
nearly
as
nice
as
your
mum
im
writing
because
that
thing
I
wrote
to
you
about
last
summer
happened
again
last
night
when
I
was
doing
a
detention
with
Umbridge
were
all
missing
our
biggest
friend
we
hope
hell
be
back
soon
please
write
back
quickly
best
harry
harry
reread
the
letter
several
times
trying
to
see
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
an
outsider
he
could
not
see
how
they
would
know
what
he
was
talking
about
or
who
he
was
talking
to
just
from
reading
this
letter
he
did
hope
Sirius
would
pick
up
the
hint
about
Hagrid
and
tell
them
when
he
might
be
back
harry
did
not
want
to
ask
directly
in
case
it
drew
too
much
attention
to
what
Hagrid
might
be
up
to
while
he
was
not
at
Hogwarts
considering
it
was
a
very
short
letter
it
had
taken
a
long
time
to
write
sunlight
had
crept
halfway
across
the
room
while
he
had
been
working
on
it
and
he
could
now
hear
distant
sounds
of
movement
from
the
dormitories
above
sealing
the
parchment
carefully
he
climbed
through
the
portrait
hole
and
headed
off
for
the
Owlery
i
would
not
go
that
way
if
I
were
you
said
Nearly
Headless
Nick
drifting
disconcertingly
through
a
wall
just
ahead
of
Harry
as
he
walked
down
the
passage
peeves
is
planning
an
amusing
joke
on
the
next
person
to
pass
the
bust
of
Paracelsus
halfway
down
the
corridor
does
it
involve
Paracelsus
falling
on
top
of
the
persons
head
asked
Harry
funnily
enough
it
does
said
Nearly
Headless
Nick
in
a
bored
voice
subtlety
has
never
been
peevess
strong
point
im
off
to
try
and
find
the
Bloody
Baron
he
might
be
able
to
put
a
stop
to
it
see
you
Harry
yeah
bye
said
Harry
and
instead
of
turning
right
he
turned
left
taking
a
longer
but
safer
route
up
to
the
Owlery
his
spirits
rose
as
he
walked
past
window
after
window
showing
brilliantly
blue
sky
he
had
training
later
he
would
be
back
on
the
Quidditch
pitch
at
last
something
brushed
his
ankles
he
looked
down
and
saw
the
caretakers
skeletal
grey
cat
Mrs
norris
slinking
past
him
she
turned
lamplike
yellow
eyes
on
him
for
a
moment
before
disappearing
behind
a
statue
of
Wilfred
the
Wistful
im
not
doing
anything
wrong
Harry
called
after
her
she
had
the
unmistakable
air
of
a
cat
that
was
off
to
report
to
her
boss
yet
Harry
could
not
see
why
he
was
perfectly
entitled
to
walk
up
to
the
Owlery
on
a
Saturday
morning
the
sun
was
high
in
the
sky
now
and
when
Harry
entered
the
Owlery
the
glassless
windows
dazzled
his
eyes
thick
silvery
beams
of
sunlight
crisscrossed
the
circular
room
in
which
hundreds
of
owls
nestled
on
rafters
a
little
restless
in
the
early-morning
light
some
clearly
just
returned
from
hunting
the
straw-covered
floor
crunched
a
little
as
he
stepped
across
tiny
animal
bones
craning
his
neck
for
a
sight
of
Hedwig
there
you
are
he
said
spotting
her
somewhere
near
the
very
top
of
the
vaulted
ceiling
get
down
here
Ive
got
a
letter
for
you
with
a
low
hoot
she
stretched
her
great
white
wings
and
soared
down
on
to
his
shoulder
right
I
know
this
says
Snuffles
on
the
outside
he
told
her
giving
her
the
letter
to
clasp
in
her
beak
and
without
knowing
exactly
why
whispering
but
its
for
Sirius
okay
she
blinked
her
amber
eyes
once
and
he
took
that
to
mean
that
she
understood
safe
flight
then
said
Harry
and
he
carried
her
to
one
of
the
windows
with
a
moments
pressure
on
his
arm
Hedwig
took
off
into
the
blindingly
bright
sky
he
watched
her
until
she
became
a
tiny
black
speck
and
vanished
then
switched
his
gaze
to
Hagrids
hut
clearly
visible
from
this
window
and
just
as
clearly
uninhabited
the
chimney
smokeless
the
curtains
drawn
the
treetops
of
the
Forbidden
Forest
swayed
in
a
light
breeze
harry
watched
them
savoring
the
fresh
air
on
his
face
thinking
about
Quidditch
later
then
he
saw
it
a
great
reptilian
winged
horse
just
like
the
ones
pulling
the
Hogwarts
carriages
with
leathery
black
wings
spread
wide
like
a
pterodactyls
rose
up
out
of
the
trees
like
a
grotesque
giant
bird
it
soared
in
a
great
circle
then
plunged
back
into
the
trees
the
whole
thing
had
happened
so
quickly
Harry
could
hardly
believe
what
he
had
seen
except
that
his
heart
was
hammering
madly
the
Owlery
door
opened
behind
him
he
leapt
in
shock
and
turning
quickly
saw
Cho
Chang
holding
a
letter
and
a
parcel
in
her
hands
hi
said
Harry
automatically
oh
hi
she
said
breathlessly
i
didnt
think
anyone
would
be
up
here
this
early
i
only
remembered
five
minutes
ago
its
my
mums
birthday
she
held
up
the
parcel
right
said
Harry
his
brain
seemed
to
have
jammed
he
wanted
to
say
something
funny
and
interesting
but
the
memory
of
that
terrible
winged
horse
was
fresh
in
his
mind
nice
day
he
said
gesturing
to
the
windows
his
insides
seemed
to
shrivel
with
embarrassment
the
weather
he
was
talking
about
the
weather
yeah
said
Cho
looking
around
for
a
suitable
owl
good
Quidditch
conditions
i
havent
been
out
all
week
have
you
no
said
Harry
cho
had
selected
one
of
the
school
barn
owls
she
coaxed
it
down
on
to
her
arm
where
it
held
out
an
obliging
leg
so
that
she
could
attach
the
parcel
hey
has
Gryffindor
got
a
new
Keeper
yet
she
asked
yeah
said
Harry
its
my
friend
Ron
Weasley
dyou
know
him
the
tornados-hater
said
Cho
rather
coolly
is
he
any
good
yeah
said
Harry
I
think
so
i
didnt
see
his
tryout
though
I
was
in
detention
cho
looked
up
the
parcel
only
half-attached
to
the
owls
legs
that
Umbridge
womans
foul
she
said
in
a
low
voice
putting
you
in
detention
just
because
you
told
the
truth
about
how
how
how
he
died
everyone
heard
about
it
it
was
all
over
the
school
you
were
really
brave
standing
up
to
her
like
that
harrys
insides
re-inflated
so
rapidly
he
felt
as
though
he
might
actually
float
a
few
inches
off
the
dropping-strewn
floor
who
cared
about
a
stupid
flying
horse
Cho
thought
he
had
been
really
brave
for
a
moment
he
considered
accidentally-on-purpose
showing
her
his
cut
hand
as
he
helped
her
tie
her
parcel
on
to
her
owl
but
the
very
instant
this
thrilling
thought
occurred
the
Owlery
door
opened
again
filch
the
caretaker
came
wheezing
into
the
room
there
were
purple
patches
on
his
sunken
veined
cheeks
his
jowls
were
aquiver
and
his
thin
grey
hair
disheveled
he
had
obviously
run
here
mrs
norris
came
trotting
at
his
heels
gazing
up
at
the
owls
overhead
and
mewing
hungrily
there
was
a
restless
shifting
of
wings
from
above
and
a
large
brown
owl
snapped
his
beak
in
a
menacing
fashion
aha
said
Filch
taking
a
flat-footed
step
toward
s
Harry
his
pouchy
cheeks
trembling
with
anger
ive
had
a
tip-off
that
you
are
intending
to
place
a
massive
order
for
Dungbombs
harry
folded
his
arms
and
stared
at
the
caretaker
who
told
you
I
was
ordering
Dungbombs
cho
was
looking
from
Harry
to
Filch
also
frowning
the
barn
owl
on
her
arm
tired
of
standing
on
one
leg
gave
an
admonitory
hoot
but
she
ignored
it
i
have
my
sources
said
Filch
in
a
self-satisfied
hiss
now
hand
over
whatever
it
is
youre
sending
feeling
immensely
thankful
that
he
had
not
dawdled
in
posting
off
the
letter
Harry
said
I
cant
its
gone
gone
said
Filch
his
face
contorting
with
rage
gone
said
Harry
calmly
filch
opened
his
mouth
furiously
mouthed
for
a
few
seconds
then
raked
Harrys
robes
with
his
eyes
how
do
I
know
you
havent
got
it
in
your
pocket
because
i
saw
him
send
it
said
Cho
angrily
filch
rounded
on
her
you
saw
him
thats
right
I
saw
him
she
said
fiercely
there
was
a
moments
pause
in
which
Filch
glared
at
Cho
and
Cho
glared
right
back
then
the
caretaker
turned
on
his
heel
and
shuffled
back
towards
the
door
he
stopped
with
his
hand
on
the
handle
and
looked
back
at
Harry
if
I
get
so
much
as
a
whiff
of
a
Dungbomb
he
stumped
off
down
the
stairs
mrs
norris
cast
a
last
longing
look
at
the
owls
and
followed
him
harry
and
Cho
looked
at
each
other
thanks
Harry
said
no
problem
said
Cho
finally
fixing
the
parcel
to
the
barn
owls
other
leg
her
face
slightly
pink
you
werent
ordering
Dungbombs
were
you
no
said
Harry
i
wonder
why
he
thought
you
were
then
she
said
as
she
carried
the
owl
to
the
window
harry
shrugged
he
was
quite
as
mystified
by
that
as
she
was
though
oddly
it
was
not
bothering
him
very
much
at
the
moment
they
left
the
Owlery
together
at
the
entrance
of
a
corridor
that
led
towards
the
west
wing
of
the
castle
Cho
said
Im
going
this
way
well
Ill
ill
see
you
around
Harry
yeah
see
you
she
smiled
at
him
and
departed
harry
walked
on
feeling
quietly
elated
he
had
managed
to
have
an
entire
conversation
with
her
and
not
embarrassed
himself
once
you
were
really
brave
standing
up
to
her
like
that
cho
had
called
him
brave
she
did
not
hate
him
for
being
alive
of
course
she
had
preferred
Cedric
he
knew
that
though
if
hed
only
asked
her
to
the
Ball
before
Cedric
had
things
might
have
turned
out
differently
she
had
seemed
sincerely
sorry
that
shed
had
to
refuse
when
Harry
asked
her
morning
Harry
said
brightly
to
Ron
and
Hermione
as
he
joined
them
at
the
Gryffindor
table
in
the
Great
Hall
what
are
you
looking
so
pleased
about
said
Ron
eyeing
Harry
in
surprise
erm
quidditch
later
said
Harry
happily
pulling
a
large
platter
of
bacon
and
eggs
towards
him
oh
yeah
said
Ron
he
put
down
the
piece
of
toast
he
was
eating
and
took
a
large
swig
of
pumpkin
juice
then
he
said
Listen
you
dont
fancy
going
out
a
bit
earlier
with
me
do
you
just
to
er
give
me
some
practice
before
training
so
I
can
you
know
get
my
eye
in
a
bit
yeah
okay
said
Harry
look
I
dont
think
you
should
said
Hermione
seriously
youre
both
really
behind
on
homework
as
it
but
she
broke
off
the
morning
post
was
arriving
and
as
usual
the
Daily
Prophet
was
soaring
towards
her
in
the
beak
of
a
screech
owl
which
landed
perilously
close
to
the
sugar
bowl
and
held
out
a
leg
hermione
pushed
a
Knut
into
its
leather
pouch
took
the
newspaper
and
scanned
the
front
page
critically
as
the
owl
took
off
anything
interesting
said
Ron
harry
grinned
knowing
Ron
was
keen
to
keep
her
off
the
subject
of
homework
no
she
sighed
just
some
guff
about
the
bass
player
in
the
Weird
Sisters
getting
married
hermione
opened
the
paper
and
disappeared
behind
it
harry
devoted
himself
to
another
helping
of
eggs
and
bacon
ron
was
staring
up
at
the
high
windows
looking
slightly
preoccupied
wait
a
moment
said
Hermione
suddenly
oh
no
sirius
whats
happened
said
Harry
snatching
at
the
paper
so
violently
it
ripped
down
the
middle
with
him
and
Hermione
each
holding
one
half
the
Ministry
of
Magic
has
received
a
tip-off
from
a
reliable
source
that
Sirius
Black
notorious
mass
murderer
blah
blah
blah
is
currently
hiding
in
London
hermione
read
from
her
half
in
an
anguished
whisper
lucius
Malfoy
Ill
bet
anything
said
Harry
in
a
low
furious
voice
he
did
recognize
Sirius
on
the
platform
what
said
Ron
looking
alarmed
you
didnt
say
shh
said
the
other
two
warns
wizarding
community
that
Black
is
very
dangerous
killed
thirteen
people
broke
out
of
Azkaban
the
usual
rubbish
Hermione
concluded
laying
down
her
half
of
the
paper
and
looking
fearfully
at
Harry
and
Ron
well
he
just
wont
be
able
to
leave
the
house
again
thats
all
she
whispered
dumbledore
did
warn
him
not
to
harry
looked
down
glumly
at
the
bit
of
the
Prophet
he
had
torn
off
most
of
the
page
was
devoted
to
an
advertisement
for
Madam
Malkins
Robes
for
All
Occasions
which
was
apparently
having
a
sale
hey
he
said
flattening
it
down
so
Hermione
and
Ron
could
see
it
look
at
this
ive
got
all
the
robes
I
want
said
Ron
no
said
Harry
look
this
little
piece
here
ron
and
Hermione
bent
closer
to
read
it
the
item
was
barely
an
inch
long
and
placed
right
at
the
bottom
of
a
column
it
was
headlined
trespass
at
ministry
sturgis
Podmore
of
number
two
Laburnum
Garden
s
Clapham
has
appeared
in
front
of
the
wizengamot
charged
with
trespass
and
attempted
robbery
at
the
Ministry
of
Magic
onst
august
podmore
was
arrested
by
Ministry
of
Magic
watchwizard
Eric
Munch
who
found
him
attempting
to
force
his
way
through
a
top-security
door
at
one
oclock
in
the
morning
podmore
who
refused
to
speak
in
his
own
defense
was
convicted
on
both
charges
and
sentenced
to
six
months
in
Azkaban
sturgis
Podmore
said
Ron
slowly
hes
that
bloke
who
looks
like
his
heads
been
thatched
isnt
he
hes
one
of
the
Ord
ron
shh
said
Hermione
casting
a
terrified
look
around
them
six
months
in
Azkaban
whispered
Harry
shocked
just
for
trying
to
get
through
a
door
dont
be
silly
it
wasnt
just
for
trying
to
get
through
a
door
what
on
earth
was
he
doing
at
the
ministry
of
Magic
at
one
oclock
in
the
morning
breathed
Hermione
dyou
reckon
he
was
doing
something
for
the
Order
ron
muttered
wait
a
moment
said
Harry
slowly
sturgis
was
supposed
to
come
and
see
us
off
remember
the
other
two
looked
at
him
yeah
he
was
supposed
to
be
part
of
our
guard
going
to
Kings
Cross
remember
and
Moody
was
all
annoyed
because
he
didnt
turn
up
so
he
couldnt
have
been
on
a
job
for
them
could
he
well
maybe
they
didnt
expect
him
to
get
caught
said
Hermione
it
could
be
a
frame-up
ron
exclaimed
excitedly
no
listen
he
went
on
dropping
his
voice
dramatically
at
the
threatening
look
on
Hermiones
face
the
Ministry
suspects
hes
one
of
dumbledores
lot
so
I
dunno
they
lured
him
to
the
Ministry
and
he
wasnt
trying
to
get
through
a
door
at
all
maybe
theyve
just
made
something
up
to
get
him
there
was
a
pause
while
Harry
and
Hermione
considered
this
harry
thought
it
seemed
farfetched
hermione
on
the
other
hand
looked
rather
impressed
do
you
know
I
wouldnt
be
at
all
surprised
if
that
were
true
she
folded
up
her
half
of
the
newspaper
thoughtfully
as
Harry
laid
down
his
knife
and
fork
she
seemed
to
come
out
of
a
reverie
right
well
I
think
we
should
tackle
that
essay
for
Sprout
on
self-fertilizing
shrubs
first
and
if
were
lucky
well
be
able
to
start
McGonagalls
Inanimatus
Conjurus
Spell
before
lunch
harry
felt
a
small
twinge
of
guilt
at
the
thought
of
the
pile
of
homework
awaiting
him
upstairs
but
the
sky
was
a
clear
exhilarating
blue
and
he
had
not
been
on
his
Firebolt
for
a
week
i
mean
we
can
do
it
tonight
said
Ron
as
he
and
Harry
walked
down
the
sloping
lawns
towards
the
Quidditch
pitch
their
broomsticks
over
their
shoulders
and
with
Hermiones
dire
warnings
that
they
would
fail
all
their
OWLs
still
ringing
in
their
ears
and
weve
got
tomorrow
she
gets
too
worked
up
about
work
thats
her
trouble
there
was
a
pause
and
he
added
in
a
slightly
more
anxious
tone
Dyou
think
she
meant
it
when
she
said
we
werent
copying
from
her
yeah
I
do
said
Harry
still
this
is
important
too
weve
got
to
practice
if
we
want
to
stay
on
the
Quidditch
team
yeah
thats
right
said
Ron
in
a
heartened
tone
and
we
have
got
plenty
of
time
to
do
it
all
as
they
approached
the
Quidditch
pitch
Harry
glanced
over
to
his
right
to
where
the
trees
of
the
forbidden
Forest
were
swaying
darkly
nothing
flew
out
of
them
the
sky
was
empty
but
for
a
few
distant
owls
fluttering
around
the
Owlery
tower
he
had
enough
to
worry
about
the
flying
horse
wasnt
doing
him
any
harm
he
pushed
it
out
of
his
mind
they
collected
balls
from
the
cupboard
in
the
changing
room
and
set
to
work
Ron
guarding
the
three
tall
goalposts
Harry
playing
Chaser
and
trying
to
get
the
Quaffle
past
Ron
harry
thought
ron
was
pretty
good
he
blocked
three-quarters
of
the
goals
Harry
attempted
to
put
past
him
and
played
better
the
longer
they
practiced
after
a
couple
of
hours
they
returned
to
the
castle
for
lunch
during
which
Hermione
made
it
quite
clear
she
thought
they
were
irresponsible
then
returned
to
the
Quidditch
pitch
for
the
real
training
session
all
their
teammates
but
Angelina
were
already
in
the
changing
room
when
they
entered
all
right
Ron
said
George
winking
at
him
yeah
said
Ron
who
had
become
quieter
and
quieter
all
the
way
down
to
the
pitch
ready
to
show
us
all
up
Ickle
Prefect
said
Fred
emerging
tousle-haired
from
the
neck
of
his
quidditch
robes
a
slightly
malicious
grin
on
his
face
shut
up
said
Ron
stony-faced
pulling
on
his
own
team
robes
for
the
first
time
they
fitted
him
well
considering
they
had
been
Oliver
Woods
who
was
rather
broader
in
the
shoulder
okay
everyone
said
Angelina
entering
from
the
Captains
office
already
changed
lets
get
to
it
Alicia
and
Fred
if
you
can
just
bring
out
the
ball
crate
for
us
oh
and
there
are
a
couple
of
people
out
there
watching
but
I
want
you
to
just
ignore
them
all
right
something
in
her
would-be
casual
voice
made
Harry
think
he
might
know
who
the
uninvited
spectators
were
and
sure
enough
when
they
left
the
changing
room
for
the
bright
sunlight
of
the
pitch
it
was
to
a
storm
of
catcalls
and
jeers
from
the
Slytherin
Quidditch
team
and
assorted
hangers-on
who
were
grouped
halfway
up
the
empty
stands
and
whose
voices
echoed
loudly
around
the
stadium
whats
that
Weasleys
riding
malfoy
called
in
his
sneering
drawl
why
would
anyone
put
a
flying
charm
on
a
mouldy
old
log
like
that
crabbe
Goyle
and
Pansy
Parkinson
guffawed
and
shrieked
with
laughter
ron
mounted
his
broom
and
kicked
off
from
the
ground
and
Harry
followed
him
watching
his
ears
turn
red
from
behind
ignore
them
he
said
accelerating
to
catch
up
with
Ron
well
see
whos
laughing
after
we
play
them
exactly
the
attitude
I
want
Harry
said
Angelina
approvingly
soaring
around
them
with
the
quaffle
under
her
arm
and
slowing
to
hover
on
the
spot
in
front
of
her
airborne
team
okay
everyone
were
going
to
start
with
some
passes
just
to
warm
up
the
whole
team
please
hey
Johnson
whats
with
that
hairstyle
anyway
shrieked
Pansy
Parkinson
from
below
why
would
anyone
want
to
look
like
theyve
got
worms
coming
out
of
their
head
angelina
swept
her
long
braided
hair
out
of
her
face
and
continued
calmly
Spread
out
then
and
lets
see
what
we
can
do
harry
reversed
away
from
the
others
to
the
far
side
of
the
pitch
ron
fell
back
towards
the
opposite
goal
angelina
raised
the
Quaffle
with
one
hand
and
threw
it
hard
to
Fred
who
passed
to
George
who
passed
to
Harry
who
passed
to
Ron
who
dropped
it
the
Slytherins
led
by
Malfoy
roared
and
screamed
with
laughter
ron
who
had
pelted
towards
the
ground
to
catch
the
Quaffle
before
it
landed
pulled
out
of
the
dive
untidily
so
that
he
slipped
sideways
on
his
broom
and
returned
to
playing
height
blushing
harry
saw
Fred
and
George
exchange
looks
but
uncharacteristically
neither
of
them
said
anything
for
which
he
was
grateful
pass
it
on
Ron
called
Angelina
as
though
nothing
had
happened
ron
threw
the
Quaffle
to
Alicia
who
passed
back
to
Harry
who
passed
to
George
hey
Potter
hows
your
scar
feeling
called
Malfoy
sure
you
dont
need
a
lie
down
it
must
be
what
a
whole
week
since
you
were
in
the
hospital
wing
thats
a
record
for
you
isnt
it
george
passed
to
Angelina
she
reverse-passed
to
Harry
who
had
not
been
expecting
it
but
caught
it
in
the
very
tips
of
his
fingers
and
passed
it
quickly
to
Ron
who
lunged
for
it
and
missed
by
inches
come
on
now
Ron
said
Angelina
crossly
as
he
dived
for
the
ground
again
chasing
the
quaffle
pay
attention
it
would
have
been
hard
to
say
whether
Rons
face
or
the
Quaffle
was
a
deeper
scarlet
when
he
again
returned
to
playing
height
malfoy
and
the
rest
of
the
Slytherin
team
were
howling
with
laughter
on
his
third
attempt
Ron
caught
the
Quaffle
perhaps
out
of
relief
he
passed
it
on
so
enthusiastically
that
it
soared
straight
through
Katies
outstretched
hands
and
hit
her
hard
in
the
face
sorry
ron
groaned
zooming
forwards
to
see
whether
he
had
done
any
damage
get
back
in
position
shes
fine
barked
Angelina
but
as
youre
passing
to
a
teammate
do
try
not
to
knock
her
off
her
broom
wont
you
weve
got
Bludgers
for
that
katies
nose
was
bleeding
down
below
the
Slytherins
were
stamping
their
feet
and
jeering
fred
and
George
converged
on
Katie
here

Fred
told
her

her
something
small
and
purple

out
of
his
pocket

Angelina
Fred
George

goalposts
harry

the
Snitch

harry
zoomed
off
after
the
twins
to
fetch
the
Snitch
rons
making
a
right
pigs
ear
of
things
isnt
he
muttered
George
as
the
three
of
them
landed
at
the
crate
containing
the
balls
and
opened
it
to
extract
one
of
the
Bludgers
and
the
Snitch
hes
just
nervous
said
Harry
he
was
fine
when
I
was
practicing
with
him
this
morning
yeah
well
I
hope
he
hasnt
peaked
too
soon
said
Fred
gloomily
they
returned
to
the
air
when
Angelina
blew
her
whistle
Harry
released
the
Snitch
and
Fred
and
George
let
fly
the
Bludger
from
that
moment
on
Harry
was
barely
aware
of
what
the
others
were
doing
it
was
his
job
to
recapture
the
tiny
fluttering
golden
ball
that
was
worth
a
hundred
and
fifty
points
to
the
Seekers
team
and
doing
so
required
enormous
speed
and
skill
he
accelerated
rolling
and
swerving
in
and
out
of
the
Chasers
the
warm
autumn
air
whipping
his
face
and
the
distant
yells
of
the
Slytherins
so
much
meaningless
roaring
in
his
ears
but
too
soon
the
whistle
brought
him
to
a
halt
again
stop
stop
stop
screamed
Angelina
ron
youre
not
covering
your
middle
post
harry
looked
round
at
Ron
who
was
hovering
in
front
of
the
left-hand
hoop
leaving
the
other
two
completely
unprotected
oh
sorry
you
keep
shifting
around
while
youre
watching
the
Chasers
said
Angelina
either
stay
in
center
position
until
you
have
to
move
to
defend
a
hoop
or
else
circle
the
hoops
but
dont
drift
vaguely
off
to
one
side
thats
how
you
let
in
the
last
three
goals
sorry
ron
repeated
his
red
face
shining
like
a
beacon
against
the
bright
blue
sky
and
Katie
cant
you
do
something
about
that
nosebleed
its
just
getting
worse
said
Katie
thickly
attempting
to
stem
the
flow
with
her
sleeve
harry
glanced
round
at
Fred
who
was
looking
anxious
and
checking
his
pockets
he
saw
Fred
pull
out
something
purple
examine
it
for
a
second
and
then
look
round
at
Katie
evidently
horror-struck
well
lets
try
again
said
Angelina
she
was
ignoring
the
Slytherins
who
had
now
set
up
a
chant
of
Gryffindor
are
losers
Gryffindor
are
losers
but
there
was
a
certain
rigidity
about
her
seat
on
the
broom
nevertheless
this
time
they
had
been
flying
for
barely
three
minutes
when
Angelinas
whistle
sounded
harry
who
had
just
sighted
the
Snitch
circling
the
opposite
goalpost
pulled
up
feeling
distinctly
aggrieved
what
now
he
said
impatiently
to
Alicia
who
was
nearest
katie
she
said
shortly
harry
turned
and
saw
Angelina
Fred
and
George
all
flying
as
fast
as
they
could
towards
Katie
harry
and
Alicia
sped
towards
her
too
it
was
plain
that
Angelina
had
stopped
training
just
in
time
Katie
was
now
chalk
white
and
covered
in
blood
she
needs
the
hospital
wing
said
Angelina
well
take
her
said
Fred
she
er
might
have
swallowed
a
Blood
Blisterpod
by
mistake
well
theres
no
point
continuing
with
no
Beaters
and
a
Chaser
gone
said
Angelina
glumly
as
fred
and
George
zoomed
off
towards
the
castle
supporting
Katie
between
them
come
on
lets
go
and
get
changed
the
Slytherins
continued
to
chant
as
they
trailed
back
into
the
changing
rooms
how
was
practice
asked
Hermione
rather
coolly
half
an
hour
later
as
Harry
and
Ron
climbed
through
the
portrait
hole
into
the
Gryffindor
common
room
it
was
Harry
began
completely
lousy
said
Ron
in
a
hollow
voice
sinking
into
a
chair
beside
Hermione
she
looked
up
at
Ron
and
her
frostiness
seemed
to
melt
well
it
was
only
your
first
one
she
said
consolingly
its
bound
to
take
time
to
who
said
it
was
me
who
made
it
lousy
snapped
Ron
no
one
said
Hermione
looking
taken
aback
I
thought
you
thought
I
was
bound
to
be
rubbish
no
of
course
I
didnt
look
you
said
it
was
lousy
so
I
just
im
going
to
get
started
on
some
homework
said
Ron
angrily
and
stomped
off
to
the
staircase
to
the
boys
dormitories
and
vanished
from
sight
hermione
turned
to
Harry
was
he
lousy
no
said
Harry
loyally
hermione
raised
her
eyebrows
well
I
suppose
he
couldve
played
better
Harry
muttered
but
it
was
only
the
first
training
session
like
you
said
neither
Harry
nor
Ron
seemed
to
make
much
headway
with
their
homework
that
night
harry
knew
Ron
was
too
preoccupied
with
how
badly
he
had
performed
at
Quidditch
practice
and
he
himself
was
having
difficulty
in
getting
the
Gryffindor
are
losers
chant
out
of
his
head
they
spent
the
whole
of
Sunday
in
the
common
room
buried
in
their
books
while
the
room
around
them
filled
up
then
emptied
it
was
another
clear
fine
day
and
most
of
their
fellow
gryffindors
spent
the
day
out
in
the
grounds
enjoying
what
might
well
be
some
of
the
last
sunshine
that
year
by
the
evening
Harry
felt
as
though
somebody
had
been
beating
his
brain
against
the
inside
of
his
skull
you
know
we
probably
should
try
and
get
more
homework
done
during
the
week
Harry
muttered
to
Ron
as
they
finally
laid
aside
Professor
McGonagalls
long
essay
on
the
Inanimatus
conjurus
Spell
and
turned
miserably
to
Professor
Sinistras
equally
long
and
difficult
essay
about
Jupiters
many
moons
yeah
said
Ron
rubbing
slightly
bloodshot
eyes
and
throwing
his
fifth
spoiled
bit
of
parchment
into
the
fire
beside
them
listen
shall
we
just
ask
Hermione
if
we
can
have
a
look
at
what
shes
done
harry
glanced
over
at
her
she
was
sitting
with
Crookshanks
on
her
lap
and
chatting
merrily
to
ginny
as
a
pair
of
knitting
needles
flashed
in
midair
in
front
of
her
now
knitting
a
pair
of
shapeless
elf
socks
no
he
said
heavily
you
know
she
wont
let
us
and
so
they
worked
on
while
the
sky
outside
the
windows
became
steadily
darker
slowly
the
crowd
in
the
common
room
began
to
thin
again
at
half
past
eleven
Hermione
wandered
over
to
them
yawning
nearly
done
no
said
Ron
shortly
jupiters
biggest
moon
is
Ganymede
not
Callisto
she
said
pointing
over
Rons
shoulder
at
a
line
in
his
Astronomy
essay
and
its
lo
thats
got
the
volcanoes
thanks
snarled
Ron
scratching
out
the
offending
sentences
sorry
I
only
yeah
well
if
youve
just
come
over
here
to
criticize
ron
i
havent
got
time
to
listen
to
a
sermon
all
right
Hermione
Im
up
to
my
neck
in
it
here
no
look
hermione
was
pointing
to
the
nearest
window
harry
and
Ron
both
looked
over
a
handsome
screech
owl
was
standing
on
the
windowsill
gazing
into
the
room
at
Ron
isnt
that
Hermes
said
Hermione
sounding
amazed
blimey
it
is
said
Ron
quietly
throwing
down
his
quill
and
getting
to
his
feet
whats
Percy
writing
to
me
for
he
crossed
to
the
window
and
opened
it
Hermes
flew
inside
landed
on
Rons
essay
and
held
out
a
leg
to
which
a
letter
was
attached
ron
took
the
letter
off
it
and
the
owl
departed
at
once
leaving
inky
footprints
across
Rons
drawing
of
the
moon
lo
thats
definitely
Percys
handwriting
said
Ron
s
inking
back
into
his
chair
and
staring
at
the
words
on
the
outside
of
the
scroll
Ronald
Weasley
Gryffindor
House
Hogwarts
he
looked
up
at
the
other
two
what
dyou
reckon
open
it
said
Hermione
eagerly
and
Harry
nodded
ron
unrolled
the
scroll
and
began
to
read
the
further
down
the
parchment
his
eyes
traveled
the
more
pronounced
became
his
scowl
when
he
had
finished
reading
he
looked
disgusted
he
thrust
the
letter
at
Harry
and
Hermione
who
leaned
towards
each
other
to
read
it
together
dear
Ron
i
have
only
just
heard
from
no
less
a
person
than
the
Minister
for
Magic
himself
who
has
it
from
your
new
teacher
Professor
Umbridge
that
you
have
become
a
Hogwarts
prefect
i
was
most
pleasantly
surprised
when
I
heard
this
news
and
must
firstly
offer
my
congratulations
i
must
admit
that
I
have
always
been
afraid
that
you
would
take
what
we
might
call
the
Fred
and
George
route
rather
than
following
in
my
footsteps
so
you
can
imagine
my
feelings
on
hearing
you
have
stopped
flouting
authority
and
have
decided
to
shoulder
some
real
responsibility
but
I
want
to
give
you
more
than
congratulations
Ron
I
want
to
give
you
some
advice
which
is
why
I
am
sending
this
at
night
rather
than
by
the
usual
morning
post
hopefully
you
will
be
able
to
read
this
away
from
prying
eyes
and
avoid
awkward
questions
from
something
the
Minister
let
slip
when
telling
me
you
are
now
a
prefect
I
gather
that
you
are
still
seeing
a
lot
of
Harry
Potter
i
must
tell
you
Ron
that
nothing
could
put
you
in
danger
of
losing
your
badge
more
than
continued
fraternization
with
that
boy
yes
I
am
sure
you
are
surprised
to
hear
this
no
doubt
you
will
say
that
Potter
has
always
been
Dumbledores
favorite
but
I
feel
bound
to
tell
you
that
Dumbledore
may
not
be
in
charge
at
Hogwarts
much
longer
and
the
people
who
count
have
a
very
different
and
probably
more
accurate
view
of
Potters
behavior
i
shall
say
no
more
here
but
if
you
look
at
the
Daily
Prophet
tomorrow
you
will
get
a
good
idea
of
the
way
the
wind
is
blowing
and
see
if
you
can
spot
yours
truly
seriously
Ron
you
do
not
want
to
be
tarred
with
the
same
brush
as
Potter
it
could
be
very
damaging
to
your
future
prospects
and
I
am
talking
here
about
life
after
school
too
as
you
must
be
aware
given
that
our
father
escorted
him
to
court
Potter
had
a
disciplinary
hearing
this
summer
in
front
of
the
whole
Wizengamot
and
he
did
not
come
out
of
it
looking
too
good
he
got
off
on
a
mere
technicality
if
you
ask
me
and
many
of
the
people
Ive
spoken
to
remain
convinced
of
his
guilt
it
may
be
that
you
are
afraid
to
sever
ties
with
Potter
I
know
that
he
can
be
unbalanced
and
for
all
I
know
violent
but
if
you
have
any
worries
about
this
or
have
spotted
anything
else
in
potters
behavior
that
is
troubling
you
I
urge
you
to
speak
to
Dolores
Umbridge
a
truly
delightful
woman
who
I
know
will
be
only
too
happy
to
advise
you
this
leads
me
to
my
other
bit
of
advice
as
I
have
hinted
above
Dumbledores
regime
at
hogwarts
may
soon
be
over
your
loyalty
Ron
should
be
not
to
him
but
to
the
school
and
the
ministry
i
am
very
sorry
to
hear
that
so
far
Professor
Umbridge
is
encountering
very
little
cooperation
from
staff
as
she
strives
to
make
those
necessary
changes
within
Hogwarts
that
the
ministry
so
ardently
desires
although
she
should
find
this
easier
from
next
week
again
see
the
Daily
Prophet
tomorrow
i
shall
say
only
this
a
student
who
shows
himself
willing
to
help
professor
Umbridge
now
may
be
very
well-placed
for
Head
Boyship
in
a
couple
of
years
i
am
sorry
that
I
was
unable
to
see
more
of
you
over
the
summer
it
pains
me
to
criticize
our
parents
but
I
am
afraid
I
can
no
longer
live
under
their
roof
while
they
remain
mixed
up
with
the
dangerous
crowd
around
Dumbledore
If
you
are
writing
to
Mother
at
any
point
you
might
tell
her
that
a
certain
Sturgis
Podmore
who
is
a
great
friend
of
Dumbledores
has
recently
been
sent
to
Azkaban
for
trespass
at
the
Ministry
perhaps
that
will
open
their
eyes
to
the
kind
of
petty
criminals
with
whom
they
are
currently
rubbing
shoulders
I
count
myself
very
lucky
to
have
escaped
the
stigma
of
association
with
such
people
the
Minister
really
could
not
be
more
gracious
to
me
and
I
do
hope
Ron
that
you
will
not
allow
family
ties
to
blind
you
to
the
misguided
nature
of
our
parents
beliefs
and
actions
either
i
sincerely
hope
that
in
time
they
will
realize
how
mistaken
they
were
and
I
shall
of
course
be
ready
to
accept
a
full
apology
when
that
day
comes
please
think
over
what
I
have
said
most
carefully
particularly
the
bit
about
Harry
Potter
and
congratulations
again
on
becoming
prefect
your
brother
percy
harry
looked
up
at
Ron
well
he
said
trying
to
sound
as
though
he
found
the
whole
thing
a
joke
if
you
want
to
er
what
is
it
he
checked
Percys
letter
Oh
yeah
severe
ties
with
me
I
swear
I
wont
get
violent
give
it
back
said
Ron
holding
out
his
hand
he
is
Ron
said
jerkily
tearing
Percys
letter
in
half
the
worlds
he
tore
it
into
quarters
biggest
he
tore
it
into
eighths
git
he
threw
the
pieces
into
the
fire
come
on
weve
got
to
get
this
finished
sometime
before
dawn
he
said
briskly
to
Harry
pulling
Professor
Sinistras
essay
back
towards
him
hermione
was
looking
at
Ron
with
an
odd
expression
on
her
face
oh
give
them
here
she
said
abruptly
what
said
Ron
give
them
to
me
Ill
look
through
them
and
correct
them
she
said
are
you
serious
ah
Hermione
youre
a
life-saver
said
Ron
what
can
I
what
you
can
say
is
promise
well
never
leave
our
homework
this
late
again
she
said
holding
out
both
hands
for
their
essays
but
she
looked
slightly
amused
all
the
same
thanks
a
million
Hermione
said
Harry
weakly
passing
over
his
essay
and
sinking
back
into
his
armchair
rubbing
his
eyes
it
was
now
past
midnight
and
the
common
room
was
deserted
but
for
the
three
of
them
and
crookshanks
the
only
sound
was
that
of
Hermiones
quill
scratching
out
sentences
here
and
there
on
their
essays
and
the
ruffle
of
pages
as
she
checked
various
facts
in
the
reference
books
strewn
across
the
table
harry
was
exhausted
he
also
felt
an
odd
sick
empty
feeling
in
his
stomach
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
tiredness
and
everything
to
do
with
the
letter
now
curling
blackly
in
the
heart
of
the
fire
he
knew
that
half
the
people
inside
Hogwarts
thought
him
strange
even
mad
he
knew
that
the
Daily
Prophet
had
been
making
snide
allusions
to
him
for
months
but
there
was
something
about
seeing
it
written
down
like
that
in
Percys
writing
about
knowing
that
Percy
was
advising
ron
to
drop
him
and
even
to
tell
tales
about
him
to
Umbridge
that
made
his
situation
real
to
him
as
nothing
else
had
he
had
known
Percy
for
four
years
had
stayed
in
his
house
during
the
summer
holidays
shared
a
tent
with
him
during
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
had
even
been
awarded
full
marks
by
him
in
the
second
task
of
the
Triwizard
Tournament
last
year
yet
now
percy
thought
him
unbalanced
and
possibly
violent
and
with
a
surge
of
sympathy
for
his
godfather
Harry
thought
Sirius
was
probably
the
only
person
he
knew
who
could
really
understand
how
he
felt
at
the
moment
because
Sirius
was
in
the
same
situation
nearly
everyone
in
the
wizarding
world
thought
Sirius
a
dangerous
murderer
and
a
great
Voldemort
supporter
and
he
had
had
to
live
with
that
knowledge
for
fourteen
years
harry
blinked
he
had
just
seen
something
in
the
fire
that
could
not
have
been
there
it
had
flashed
into
sight
and
vanished
immediately
no
it
could
not
have
been
he
had
imagined
it
because
he
had
been
thinking
about
Sirius
okay
write
that
down
Hermione
said
to
Ron
pushing
his
essay
and
a
sheet
covered
in
her
own
writing
back
to
Ron
then
add
this
conclusion
Ive
written
for
you
hermione
you
are
honestly
the
most
wonderful
person
Ive
ever
met
said
Ron
weakly
and
if
im
ever
rude
to
you
again
Ill
know
youre
back
to
normal
said
Hermione
harry
yours
is
okay
except
for
this
bit
at
the
end
I
think
you
must
have
misheard
Professor
Sinistra
Europas
covered
in
ice
not
mice
harry
harry
had
slid
off
his
chair
on
to
his
knees
and
was
now
crouching
on
the
singed
and
threadbare
hearthrug
gazing
into
the
flames
er
Harry
said
Ron
uncertainly
why
are
you
down
there
because
Ive
just
seen
Siriuss
head
in
the
fire
said
Harry
he
spoke
quite
calmly
after
all
he
had
seen
Siriuss
head
in
this
very
fire
the
previous
year
and
talked
to
it
too
nevertheless
he
could
not
be
sure
that
he
had
really
seen
it
this
time
it
had
vanished
so
quickly
siriuss
head
hermione
repeated
you
mean
like
when
he
wanted
to
talk
to
you
during
the
triwizard
Tournament
but
he
wouldnt
do
that
now
it
would
be
too
Sirius
she
gasped
gazing
at
the
fire
Ron
dropped
his
quill
there
in
the
middle
of
the
dancing
flames
sat
Siriuss
head
long
dark
hair
falling
around
his
grinning
face
i
was
starting
to
think
youd
go
to
bed
before
everyone
else
had
disappeared
he
said
ive
been
checking
every
hour
youve
been
popping
into
the
fire
every
hour
harry
said
half-laughing
just
for
a
few
seconds
to
check
if
the
coast
was
clear
but
what
if
youd
been
seen
said
Hermione
anxiously
well
I
think
a
girl
first-year
by
the
look
of
her
mightve
got
a
glimpse
of
me
earlier
but
dont
worry
Sirius
said
hastily
as
Hermione
clapped
a
hand
to
her
mouth
I
was
gone
the
moment
she
looked
back
at
me
and
Ill
bet
she
just
thought
I
was
an
oddly-shaped
log
or
something
but
Sirius
this
is
taking
an
awful
risk
Hermione
began
you
sound
like
Molly
said
Sirius
this
was
the
only
way
I
could
come
up
with
of
answering
harrys
letter
without
resorting
to
a
code
and
codes
are
breakable
at
the
mention
of
Harrys
letter
Hermione
and
Ron
both
turned
to
stare
at
him
you
didnt
say
youd
written
to
Sirius
said
Hermione
accusingly
i
forgot
said
Harry
which
was
perfectly
true
h
is
meeting
with
Cho
in
the
Owlery
had
driven
everything
before
it
out
of
his
mind
dont
look
at
me
like
that
Hermione
there
was
no
way
anyone
would
have
got
secret
information
out
of
it
was
there
Sirius
no
it
was
very
good
said
Sirius
smiling
anyway
wed
better
be
quick
just
in
case
were
disturbed
your
scar
what
about
ron
began
but
Hermione
interrupted
him
well
tell
you
afterwards
go
on
sirius
well
I
know
it
cant
be
fun
when
it
hurts
but
we
dont
think
its
anything
to
really
worry
about
it
kept
aching
all
last
year
didnt
it
yeah
and
Dumbledore
said
it
happened
whenever
Voldemort
was
feeling
a
powerful
emotion
said
Harry
ignoring
as
usual
Ron
and
Hermiones
winces
so
maybe
he
was
just
I
dunno
really
angry
or
something
the
night
I
had
that
detention
well
now
hes
back
its
bound
to
hurt
more
often
said
Sirius
so
you
dont
think
it
had
anything
to
do
with
Umbridge
touching
me
when
I
was
in
detention
with
her
harry
asked
i
doubt
it
said
Sirius
i
know
her
by
reputation
and
Im
sure
shes
no
Death
Eater
shes
foul
enough
to
be
one
said
Harry
darkly
and
Ron
and
Hermione
nodded
vigorously
in
agreement
yes
but
the
world
isnt
split
into
good
people
and
Death
Eaters
said
Sirius
with
a
wry
smile
i
know
shes
a
nasty
piece
of
work
though
you
should
hear
Remus
talk
about
her
does
Lupin
know
her
asked
Harry
quickly
remembering
Umbridges
comments
about
dangerous
half-breeds
during
her
first
lesson
no
said
Sirius
but
she
drafted
a
bit
of
anti-werewolf
legislation
two
years
ago
that
makes
it
almost
impossible
for
him
to
get
a
job
harry
remembered
how
much
shabbier
Lupin
looked
these
days
and
his
dislike
of
Umbridge
deepened
even
further
whats
she
got
against
werewolves
said
Hermione
angrily
scared
of
them
I
expect
said
Sirius
smiling
at
her
indignation
apparently
she
loathes
part
humans
she
campaigned
to
have
merpeople
rounded
up
and
tagged
last
year
too
imagine
wasting
your
time
and
energy
persecuting
merpeople
when
there
are
little
toerags
like
Kreacher
on
the
loose
ron
laughed
but
Hermione
looked
upset
sirius
she
said
reproachfully
honestly
if
you
made
a
bit
of
an
effort
with
Kreacher
Im
sure
hed
respond
after
all
you
are
the
only
member
of
his
family
hes
got
left
and
Professor
dumbledore
said
so
what
are
Umbridges
lessons
like
sirius
interrupted
is
she
training
you
all
to
kill
half-breeds
no
said
Harry
ignoring
Hermiones
affronted
look
at
being
cut
off
in
her
defense
of
Kreacher
shes
not
letting
us
use
magic
at
all
all
we
do
is
read
the
stupid
textbook
said
Ron
ah
well
that
figures
said
Sirius
our
information
from
inside
the
Ministry
is
that
Fudge
doesnt
want
you
trained
in
combat
trained
in
combat
repeated
Harry
incredulously
what
does
he
think
were
doing
here
forming
some
sort
of
wizard
army
thats
exactly
what
he
thinks
youre
doing
said
Sirius
or
rather
thats
exactly
what
hes
afraid
Dumbledores
doing
forming
his
own
private
army
with
which
he
will
be
able
to
take
on
the
Ministry
of
Magic
there
was
a
pause
at
this
then
Ron
said
Thats
the
most
stupid
thing
Ive
ever
heard
including
all
the
stuff
that
Luna
Lovegood
comes
out
with
so
were
being
prevented
from
learning
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
because
Fudge
is
scared
well
use
spells
against
the
Ministry
said
Hermione
looking
furious
yep
said
Sirius
fudge
thinks
Dumbledore
will
stop
at
nothing
to
seize
power
hes
getting
more
paranoid
about
Dumbledore
by
the
day
its
a
matter
of
time
before
he
has
Dumbledore
arrested
on
some
trumped-up
charge
this
reminded
Harry
of
Percys
letter
dyou
know
if
theres
going
to
be
anything
about
Dumbledore
in
the
Daily
Prophet
tomorrow
rons
brother
Percy
reckons
there
will
be
i
dont
know
said
Sirius
I
havent
seen
anyone
from
the
Order
all
weekend
theyre
all
busy
its
just
been
Kreacher
and
me
here
there
was
a
definite
note
of
bitterness
in
Siriuss
voice
so
you
havent
had
any
news
about
Hagrid
either
ah
said
Sirius
well
he
was
supposed
to
be
back
by
now
no
ones
sure
whats
happened
to
him
then
seeing
their
stricken
faces
he
added
quickly
But
Dumbledores
not
worried
so
dont
you
three
get
yourselves
in
a
state
Im
sure
Hagrids
fine
but
if
he
was
supposed
to
be
back
by
now
said
Hermione
in
a
small
anxious
voice
madame
Maxime
was
with
him
weve
been
in
touch
with
her
and
she
says
they
got
separated
on
the
journey
home
but
theres
nothing
to
suggest
hes
hurt
or
well
nothing
to
suggest
hes
not
perfectly
okay
unconvinced
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
exchanged
worried
looks
listen
dont
go
asking
too
many
questions
about
Hagrid
said
Sirius
hastily
itll
just
draw
even
more
attention
to
the
fact
that
hes
not
back
and
I
know
Dumbledore
doesnt
want
that
hagrids
tough
hell
be
okay
and
when
they
did
not
appear
cheered
by
this
Sirius
added
whens
your
next
Hogsmeade
weekend
anyway
i
was
thinking
we
got
away
with
the
dog
disguise
at
the
station
didnt
we
i
thought
I
could
no
said
Harry
and
Hermione
together
very
loudly
sirius
didnt
you
see
the
Daily
Prophet
said
Hermione
anxiously
oh
that
said
Sirius
grinning
theyre
always
guessing
where
I
am
they
havent
really
got
a
clue
yeah
but
we
think
this
time
they
have
said
Harry
something
Malfoy
said
on
the
train
made
us
think
he
knew
it
was
you
and
his
father
was
on
the
platform
Sirius
you
know
Lucius
malfoy
so
dont
come
up
here
whatever
you
do
if
Malfoy
recognizes
you
again
all
right
all
right
Ive
got
the
point
said
Sirius
he
looked
most
displeased
just
an
idea
thought
you
might
like
to
get
together
i
would
I
just
dont
want
you
chucked
back
in
Azkaban
said
Harry
there
was
a
pause
in
which
Sirius
looked
out
of
the
fire
at
Harry
a
crease
between
his
sunken
eyes
youre
less
like
your
father
than
I
thought
he
said
finally
a
definite
coolness
in
his
voice
the
risk
wouldve
been
what
made
it
fun
for
James
look
well
Id
better
get
going
I
can
hear
Kreacher
coming
down
the
stairs
said
Sirius
but
Harry
was
sure
he
was
lying
ill
write
to
tell
you
a
time
I
can
make
it
back
into
the
fire
then
shall
I
if
you
can
stand
to
risk
it
there
was
a
tiny
pop
and
the
place
where
Siriuss
head
had
been
was
flickering
flame
once
more
chapter
fifteen
the
Hogwarts
High
Inquisitor
they
had
expected
to
have
to
comb
Hermiones
Daily
Prophet
carefully
next
morning
to
find
the
article
Percy
had
mentioned
in
his
letter
however
the
departing
delivery
owl
had
barely
cleared
the
top
of
the
milk
jug
when
Hermione
let
out
a
huge
gasp
and
flattened
the
newspaper
to
reveal
a
large
photograph
of
Dolores
Umbridge
smiling
widely
and
blinking
slowly
at
them
from
beneath
the
headline
ministry
seeks
educational
reform
dolores
umbridge
appointed
first
ever
high
inquisitor
umbridge
Inquisitor
said
Harry
darkly
his
half-eaten
piece
of
toast
slipping
from
his
fingers
what
does
that
maen
hermione
rad
aloud
in
a
surprise
move
last
night
the
Ministry
of
Magic
passed
new
legislation
giving
itself
an
unprecedented
level
of
control
at
Hogwarts
School
of
Witchcraft
and
Wizardry
the
Minister
has
been
growing
uneasy
about
goings-on
at
Hogwarts
for
some
time
said
junior
Assistant
to
the
Minister
Percy
Weasley
he
is
now
responding
to
concerns
voiced
by
anxious
parents
who
feel
the
school
may
be
moving
in
a
direction
they
do
not
approve
this
is
not
the
first
time
in
recent
weeks
that
the
Minister
Cornelius
Fudge
has
used
new
laws
to
effect
improvements
at
the
wizarding
school
as
recently
as
August
th
Educational
Decree
number
twenty-two
was
passed
to
ensure
that
in
the
event
of
the
current
Headmaster
being
unable
to
provide
a
candidate
for
a
teaching
post
the
Ministry
should
select
an
appropriate
person
thats
how
Dolores
Umbridge
came
to
be
appointed
to
the
teaching
staff
at
Hogwarts
said
Weasley
last
night
dumboldore
couldnt
find
anyone
so
the
Minister
put
in
Umbridge
and
of
course
shes
been
an
immediate
success
shes
been
a
what
said
Harry
loudly
wait
theres
more
said
Hermione
grimly
an
immediate
success
totally
revolutionizing
the
teaching
of
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
and
providing
the
Minister
with
on-the-ground
feedback
about
whats
really
happening
at
hogwarts
it
is
this
last
function
that
the
Ministry
has
now
formalized
with
the
passing
of
Educational
decree
Number
twenty-three
which
creates
the
new
position
of
Hogwarts
High
Inquisitor
this
is
an
exciting
new
phase
in
the
Ministers
plan
to
get
to
grips
with
what
some
are
calling
the
falling
standards
at
Hogwarts
said
Weasley
the
Inquisitor
will
have
powers
to
inspect
her
fellow
educators
and
make
sure
that
they
are
coming
up
to
scratch
professor
Umbridge
has
been
offered
this
position
in
addition
to
her
own
teaching
post
and
we
are
delighted
to
say
that
she
has
accepted
the
Ministrys
new
moves
have
received
enthusiastic
support
from
parents
of
students
at
hogwarts
i
feel
much
easier
in
my
mind
now
that
I
know
Dumbledore
is
being
subjected
to
fair
and
objective
evaluation
said
mr.
Lucius
Malfoy
speaking
from
his
Wiltshire
mansion
last
night
many
of
us
with
our
childrens
best
interests
at
heart
have
been
concerned
about
some
of
dumbledores
eccentric
decisions
in
the
last
few
years
and
are
glad
to
know
that
the
Ministry
is
keeping
an
eye
on
the
situation
among
those
eccentric
decisions
are
undoubtedly
the
controversial
staff
appointments
previously
described
in
this
newspaper
which
have
included
the
employment
of
werewolf
Remus
Lupin
half-giant
Rubeus
Hagrid
and
delusional
ex-Auror
Mad
Eye
Moody
rumors
abound
of
course
that
Albus
Dumbledore
once
Supreme
Mugwump
of
the
international
Confederation
of
Wizards
and
Chief
Warlock
of
the
Wizengamot
is
no
longer
up
to
the
task
of
managing
the
prestigious
school
of
Hogwarts
i
think
the
appointment
of
the
Inquisitor
is
a
first
step
towards
ensuring
that
Hogwarts
has
a
headmaster
in
whom
we
can
all
repose
our
confidence
said
a
Ministry
insider
last
night
wizengamot
elders
Griselda
Marchbanks
and
Tiberius
Ogden
have
resigned
in
protest
at
the
introduction
of
the
post
of
Inquisitor
to
Hogwarts
hogwarts
is
a
school
not
an
outpost
of
Cornelius
Fudges
office
said
Madam
Marchbanks
this
is
a
further
disgusting
attempt
to
discredit
Albus
Dumbledore
For
a
full
account
of
Madam
Marchbankss
alleged
links
to
subversive
goblin
groups
turn
to
page
seventeen
hermione
finished
reading
and
looked
across
the
table
at
the
other
two
so
now
we
know
how
we
ended
up
with
Umbridge
fudge
passed
this
Decree
and
forced
her
on
us
and
now
hes
given
her
the
power
to
inspect
the
other
teachers
hermione
was
breathing
fast
and
her
eyes
were
very
bright
i
cant
believe
this
its
outrageous
i
know
it
is
said
Harry
he
looked
down
at
his
right
hand
clenched
on
the
table-top
and
saw
the
faint
white
outline
of
the
words
Umbridge
had
forced
him
to
cut
into
his
skin
but
a
grin
was
unfurling
on
Rons
face
what
said
Harry
and
Hermione
together
staring
at
him
oh
I
cant
wait
to
see
McGonagall
inspected
said
Ron
happily
umbridge
wont
know
whats
hit
her
well
come
on
said
Hermione
jumping
up
wed
better
get
going
if
shes
inspecting
Binnss
class
we
dont
want
to
be
late
but
Professor
Umbridge
was
not
inspecting
their
History
of
Magic
lesson
which
was
just
as
dull
as
the
previous
Monday
nor
was
she
in
Snapes
dungeon
when
they
arrived
for
double
Potions
where
Harrys
moonstone
essay
was
handed
back
to
him
with
a
large
spiky
black
D
scrawled
in
an
upper
corner
i
have
awarded
you
the
grades
you
would
have
received
if
you
presented
this
work
in
your
owl
said
Snape
with
a
smirk
as
he
swept
among
them
passing
back
their
homework
this
should
give
you
a
realiztic
idea
of
what
to
expect
in
the
examination
snape
reached
the
front
of
the
class
and
turned
on
his
heel
to
face
them
the
general
standard
of
this
homework
was
abysmal
most
of
you
would
have
failed
had
this
been
your
examination
i
expect
to
see
a
great
deal
more
effort
for
this
weeks
essay
on
the
various
varieties
of
venom
antidotes
or
I
shall
have
to
start
handing
out
detentions
to
those
dunces
who
get
a
D
he
smirked
as
Malfoy
sniggered
and
said
in
a
carrying
whisper
Some
people
got
a
D
ha
harry
realized
that
Hermione
was
looking
sideways
to
see
what
grade
he
had
received
he
slid
his
moonstone
essay
back
into
his
bag
as
quickly
as
possible
feeling
that
he
would
rather
keep
that
information
private
determined
not
to
give
Snape
an
excuse
to
fail
him
this
lesson
Harry
read
and
reread
every
line
of
instructions
on
the
blackboard
at
least
three
times
before
acting
on
them
his
Strengthening
solution
was
not
precisely
the
clear
turquoise
shade
of
Hermiones
but
it
was
at
least
blue
rather
than
pink
like
Nevilles
and
he
delivered
a
flask
of
it
to
Snapes
desk
at
the
end
of
the
lesson
with
a
feeling
of
mingled
defiance
and
relief
well
that
wasnt
as
bad
as
last
week
was
it
said
Hermione
as
they
climbed
the
steps
out
of
the
dungeon
and
made
their
way
across
the
Entrance
Hall
towards
lunch
and
the
homework
didnt
go
too
badly
either
did
it
when
neither
Ron
nor
Harry
answered
she
pressed
on
I
mean
all
right
I
didnt
expect
the
top
grade
not
if
hes
marking
to
owl
standard
but
a
pass
is
quite
encouraging
at
this
stage
wouldnt
you
say
harry
made
a
non-committal
noise
in
his
throat
of
course
a
lot
can
happen
between
now
and
the
exam
weve
got
plenty
of
time
to
improve
but
the
grades
were
getting
now
are
a
sort
of
baseline
arent
they
something
we
can
build
on
they
sat
down
together
at
the
Gryffindor
table
obviously
Id
have
been
thrilled
if
Id
got
an
O
hermione
said
Ron
sharply
if
you
want
to
know
what
grades
we
got
ask
i
dont
I
didnt
mean
well
if
you
want
to
tell
me
i
got
a
P
said
Ron
ladling
soup
into
his
bowl
happy
well
thats
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
said
Fred
who
had
just
arrived
at
the
table
with
George
and
Lee
Jordan
and
was
sitting
down
on
Harrys
right
nothing
wrong
with
a
good
healthy
P
but
said
Hermione
doesnt
P
stand
for
poor
yeah
said
Lee
Jordan
still
better
than
D
isnt
it
dreadful
harry
felt
his
face
grow
warm
and
faked
a
small
coughing
fit
over
his
roll
when
he
emerged
from
this
he
was
sorry
to
find
that
Hermione
was
still
in
full
flow
about
owl
grades
so
top
grades
O
for
Outstanding
she
was
saying
and
then
theres
A
no
E
George
corrected
her
E
for
Exceeds
Expectations
and
Ive
always
thought
Fred
and
I
shouldve
got
E
in
everything
because
we
exceeded
expectations
just
by
turning
up
for
the
exams
they
all
laughed
except
Hermione
who
ploughed
on
So
after
E
its
A
for
Acceptable
and
thats
the
last
pass
grade
isnt
it
yep
said
Fred
dunking
an
entire
roll
in
his
soup
transferring
it
to
his
mouth
and
swallowing
it
whole
then
you
get
P
for
Poor
Ron
raised
both
his
arms
in
mock
celebration
and
D
for
Dreadful
and
then
T
George
reminded
him
asked
Hermione
looking
appalled
even
lower
than
a
D
what
on
earth
does
that
stand
for
troll
said
George
promptly
harry
laughed
again
though
he
was
not
sure
whether
or
not
George
was
joking
he
imagined
trying
to
conceal
from
Hermione
that
he
had
received
Ts
in
all
his
OWLs
and
immediately
resolved
to
work
harder
from
now
on
you
lot
had
an
inspected
lesson
yet
fred
asked
them
no
said
Hermione
at
once
have
you
just
now
before
lunch
said
George
charms
what
was
it
like
harry
and
Hermione
asked
together
fred
shrugged
not
that
bad
umbridge
just
lurked
in
the
corner
making
notes
on
a
clipboard
you
know
what
flitwicks
like
he
treated
her
like
a
guest
didnt
seem
to
bother
him
at
all
she
didnt
say
much
asked
Alicia
a
couple
of
questions
about
what
the
classes
are
normally
like
Alicia
told
her
they
were
really
good
that
was
it
i
cant
see
old
Flitwick
getting
marked
down
said
George
he
usually
gets
everyone
through
their
exams
all
right
whove
you
got
this
afternoon
fred
asked
Harry
trelawney
a
T
if
ever
I
saw
one
and
Umbridge
herself
well
be
a
good
boy
and
keep
your
temper
with
Umbridge
today
said
George
angelinall
do
her
nut
if
you
miss
any
more
Quidditch
practices
but
Harry
did
not
have
to
wait
for
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
to
meet
Professor
Umbridge
he
was
pulling
out
his
dream
diary
in
a
seat
at
the
very
back
of
the
shadowy
Divination
room
when
Ron
elbowed
him
in
the
ribs
and
looking
round
he
saw
Professor
Umbridge
emerging
through
the
trapdoor
in
the
floor
the
class
which
had
been
talking
cheerily
fell
silent
at
once
the
abrupt
fall
in
the
noise
level
made
Professor
Trelawney
who
had
been
wafting
about
handing
out
copies
of
The
Dream
Oracle
look
round
good
afternoon
Professor
Trelawney
said
Professor
Umbridge
with
her
wide
smile
you
received
my
note
I
trust
giving
the
time
and
date
of
your
inspection
professor
Trelawney
nodded
curtly
and
looking
very
disgruntled
turned
her
back
on
Professor
umbridge
and
continued
to
give
out
books
still
smiling
Professor
Umbridge
grasped
the
back
of
the
nearest
armchair
and
pulled
it
to
the
front
of
the
class
so
that
it
was
a
few
inches
behind
professor
Trelawneys
seat
she
then
sat
down
took
her
clipboard
from
her
flowery
bag
and
looked
up
expectantly
waiting
for
the
class
to
begin
professor
Trelawney
pulled
her
shawls
tight
about
her
with
slightly
trembling
hands
and
surveyed
the
class
through
her
hugely
magnifying
lenses
we
shall
be
continuing
our
study
of
prophetic
dreams
today
she
said
in
a
brave
attempt
at
her
usual
mystic
tones
though
her
voice
shook
slightly
divide
into
pairs
please
and
interpret
each
others
latest
night-time
visions
with
the
aid
of
the
Oracle
she
made
as
though
to
sweep
back
to
her
seat
saw
Professor
Umbridge
sitting
right
beside
it
and
immediately
veered
left
towards
Parvati
and
Lavender
who
were
already
deep
in
discussion
about
Parvatis
most
recent
dream
harry
opened
his
copy
of
The
Dream
Oracle
watching
Umbridge
covertly
she
was
already
making
notes
on
her
clipboard
after
a
few
minutes
she
got
to
her
feet
and
began
to
pace
the
room
in
Trelawneys
wake
listening
to
her
conversations
with
students
and
posing
questions
here
and
there
harry
bent
his
head
hurriedly
over
his
book
think
of
a
dream
quick
he
told
Ron
in
case
the
old
toad
comes
our
way
i
did
it
last
time
Ron
protested
its
your
turn
you
tell
me
one
oh
I
dunno
said
Harry
desperately
who
could
not
remember
dreaming
anything
at
all
over
the
last
few
days
lets
say
I
dreamed
I
was
drowning
Snape
in
my
cauldron
yeah
thatll
do
ron
chortled
as
he
opened
his
Dream
Oracle
okay
weve
got
to
add
your
age
to
the
date
you
had
the
dream
the
number
of
letters
in
the
subject
would
that
be
drowning
or
cauldron
or
Snape
it
doesnt
matter
pick
any
of
them
said
Harry
chancing
a
glance
behind
him
professor
umbridge
was
now
standing
at
Professor
Trelawneys
shoulder
making
notes
while
the
divination
teacher
questioned
Neville
about
his
dream
diary
what
night
did
you
dream
this
again
ron
said
immersed
in
calculations
i
dunno
last
night
whenever
you
like
Harry
told
him
trying
to
listen
to
what
Umbridge
was
saying
to
Professor
Trelawney
they
were
only
a
table
away
from
him
and
Ron
now
professor
umbridge
was
making
another
note
on
her
clipboard
and
Professor
Trelawney
was
looking
extremely
put
out
now
said
Umbridge
looking
up
at
Trelawney
youve
been
in
this
post
how
long
exactly
professor
Trelawney
scowled
at
her
arms
crossed
and
shoulders
hunched
as
though
wishing
to
protect
herself
as
much
as
possible
from
the
indignity
of
the
inspection
after
a
slight
pause
in
which
she
seemed
to
decide
that
the
question
was
not
so
offensive
that
she
could
reasonably
ignore
it
she
said
in
a
deeply
resentful
tone
Nearly
sixteen
years
quite
a
period
said
Professor
Umbridge
making
a
note
on
her
clipboard
so
it
was
Professor
dumbledore
who
appointed
you
thats
right
said
Professor
Trelawney
shortly
professor
Umbridge
made
another
note
and
you
are
a
great-great-granddaughter
of
the
celebrated
Seer
Cassandra
Trelawney
yes
said
Professor
Trelawney
holding
her
head
a
little
higher
another
note
on
the
clipboard
but
I
think
correct
me
if
I
am
mistaken
that
you
are
the
first
in
your
family
since
Cassandra
to
be
possessed
of
Second
Sight
these
things
often
skip
er
three
generations
said
Professor
Trelawney
professor
Umbridges
toadlike
smile
widened
of
course
she
said
sweetly
making
yet
another
note
well
if
you
could
just
predict
something
for
me
then
and
she
looked
up
enquiringly
still
smiling
professor
Trelawney
stiffened
as
though
unable
to
believe
her
ears
i
dont
understand
you
she
said
clutching
convulsively
at
the
shawl
around
her
scrawny
neck
id
like
you
to
make
a
prediction
for
me
said
Professor
Umbridge
very
clearly
harry
and
Ron
were
not
the
only
people
now
watching
and
listening
sneakily
from
behind
their
books
most
of
the
class
were
staring
transfixed
at
Professor
Trelawney
as
she
drew
herself
up
to
her
full
height
her
beads
and
bangles
clinking
the
Inner
Eye
does
not
See
upon
command
she
said
in
scandalized
tones
i
see
said
Professor
Umbridge
softly
making
yet
another
note
on
her
clipboard
i
but
but
wait
said
Professor
Trelawney
suddenly
in
an
attempt
at
her
usual
ethereal
voice
though
the
mystical
effect
was
ruined
somewhat
by
the
way
it
was
shaking
with
anger
i
think
I
do
see
something
something
that
concerns
you
why
I
sense
something
something
dark
some
grave
peril
professor
Trelawney
pointed
a
shaking
finger
at
Professor
Umbridge
who
continued
to
smile
blandly
at
her
eyebrows
raised
i
am
afraid
i
am
afraid
that
you
are
in
grave
danger
professor
Trelawney
finished
dramatically
there
was
a
pause
professor
Umbridge
surveyed
Professor
Trelawney
right
she
said
softly
scribbling
on
her
clipboard
once
more
well
if
thats
really
the
best
you
can
do
she
turned
away
leaving
Professor
Trelawney
standing
rooted
to
the
spot
her
chest
heaving
harry
caught
Rons
eye
and
knew
that
Ron
was
thinking
exactly
the
same
as
he
was
they
both
knew
that
Professor
Trelawney
was
an
old
fraud
but
on
the
other
hand
they
loathed
Umbridge
so
much
that
they
felt
very
much
on
Trelawneys
side
until
she
swooped
down
on
them
a
few
seconds
later
that
is
well
she
said
snapping
her
long
fingers
under
Harrys
nose
uncharacteristically
brisk
let
me
see
the
start
youve
made
on
your
dream
diary
please
and
by
the
time
she
had
interpreted
Harrys
dreams
at
the
top
of
her
voice
all
of
which
even
the
ones
that
involved
eating
porridge
apparently
foretold
a
gruesome
and
early
death
he
was
feeling
much
less
sympathetic
towards
her
all
the
while
Professor
Umbridge
stood
a
few
feet
away
making
notes
on
that
clipboard
and
when
the
bell
rang
she
descended
the
silver
ladder
first
and
was
waiting
for
them
all
when
they
reached
their
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
lesson
ten
minutes
later
she
was
humming
and
smiling
to
herself
when
they
entered
the
room
harry
and
Ron
told
hermione
who
had
been
in
Arithmancy
exactly
what
had
happened
in
Divination
while
they
all
took
out
their
copies
of
Defensive
Magical
Theory
but
before
Hermione
could
ask
any
questions
professor
Umbridge
had
called
them
all
to
order
and
silence
fell
wands
away
she
instructed
them
all
with
a
smile
and
those
people
who
had
been
hopeful
enough
to
take
them
out
sadly
returned
them
to
their
bags
as
we
finished
Chapter
One
last
lesson
I
would
like
you
all
to
turn
to
page
nineteen
today
and
commence
Chapter
Two
common
Defensive
Theories
and
their
Derivation
there
will
be
no
need
to
talk
still
smiling
her
wide
self-satisfied
smile
she
sat
down
at
her
desk
the
class
gave
an
audible
sigh
as
it
turned
as
one
to
page
nineteen
harry
wondered
dully
whether
there
were
enough
chapters
in
the
book
to
keep
them
reading
through
all
this
years
lessons
and
was
on
the
point
of
checking
the
contents
page
when
he
noticed
that
Hermione
had
her
hand
in
the
air
again
professor
Umbridge
had
noticed
too
and
what
was
more
she
seemed
to
have
worked
out
a
strategy
for
just
such
an
eventuality
instead
of
trying
to
pretend
she
had
not
noticed
Hermione
she
got
to
her
feet
and
walked
around
the
front
row
of
desks
until
they
were
face
to
face
then
she
bent
down
and
whispered
so
that
the
rest
of
the
class
could
not
hear
What
is
it
this
time
Miss
granger
ive
already
read
Chapter
Two
said
Hermione
well
then
proceed
to
Chapter
Three
ive
read
that
too
ive
read
the
whole
book
professor
Umbridge
blinked
but
recovered
her
poise
almost
instantly
well
then
you
should
be
able
to
tell
me
what
Slinkhard
says
about
counter-jinxes
in
Chapter
fifteen
he
says
that
counter-jinxes
are
improperly
named
said
Hermione
promptly
he
says
jinx
is
just
a
name
people
give
their
jinxes
when
they
want
to
make
them
sound
more
acceptable
professor
Umbridge
raised
her
eyebrows
and
Harry
knew
she
was
impressed
against
her
will
but
I
disagree
Hermione
continued
professor
Umbridges
eyebrows
rose
a
little
higher
and
her
gaze
became
distinctly
colder
you
disagree
she
repeated
yes
I
do
said
Hermione
who
unlike
Umbridge
was
not
whispering
but
speaking
in
a
clear
carrying
voice
that
had
by
now
attracted
the
attention
of
the
rest
of
the
class
mr.
Slinkhard
doesnt
like
jinxes
does
he
but
I
think
they
can
be
very
useful
when
theyre
used
defensively
oh
you
do
do
you
said
Professor
Umbridge
forgetting
to
whisper
and
straightening
up
well
Im
afraid
it
is
mr.
Slinkhards
opinion
and
not
yours
that
matters
within
this
classroom
miss
Granger
but
Hermione
began
that
is
enough
said
Professor
Umbridge
she
walked
back
to
the
front
of
the
class
and
stood
before
them
all
the
jauntiness
she
had
shown
at
the
beginning
of
the
lesson
gone
miss
Granger
I
am
going
to
take
five
points
from
Gryffindor
house
there
was
an
outbreak
of
muttering
at
this
what
for
said
Harry
angrily
dont
you
get
involved
hermione
whispered
urgently
to
him
for
disrupting
my
class
with
pointless
interruptions
said
Professor
Umbridge
smoothly
i
am
here
to
teach
you
using
a
ministry-approved
method
that
does
not
include
inviting
students
to
give
their
opinions
on
matters
about
which
they
understand
very
little
your
previous
teachers
in
this
subject
may
have
allowed
you
more
license
but
as
none
of
them
with
the
possible
exception
of
Professor
Quirrell
who
did
at
least
appear
to
have
restricted
himself
to
age
appropriate
subjects
would
have
passed
a
Ministry
inspection
yeah
Quirrell
was
a
great
teacher
said
Harry
loudly
there
was
just
that
minor
drawback
of
him
having
Lord
Voldemort
sticking
out
of
the
back
of
his
head
this
pronouncement
was
followed
by
one
of
the
loudest
silences
Harry
had
ever
heard
then
i
think
another
weeks
detentions
would
do
you
some
good
mr.
Potter
said
Umbridge
sleekly
the
cut
on
the
back
of
Harrys
hand
had
barely
healed
and
by
the
following
morning
it
was
bleeding
again
he
did
not
complain
during
the
evenings
detention
he
was
determined
not
to
give
Umbridge
the
satisfaction
over
and
over
again
he
wrote
I
must
not
tell
lies
and
not
a
sound
escaped
his
lips
though
the
cut
deepened
with
every
letter
the
very
worst
part
of
this
second
weeks
worth
of
detentions
was
just
as
George
had
predicted
angelinas
reaction
she
cornered
him
just
as
he
arrived
at
the
Gryffindor
table
for
breakfast
on
tuesday
and
shouted
so
loudly
that
Professor
McGonagall
came
sweeping
down
upon
the
pair
of
them
from
the
staff
table
miss
Johnson
how
dare
you
make
such
a
racket
in
the
Great
Hall
five
points
from
Gryffindor
but
Professor
hes
gone
and
landed
himself
in
detention
again
whats
this
Potter
said
Professor
McGonagall
sharply
rounding
on
Harry
detention
from
whom
from
Professor
Umbridge
muttered
Harry
not
meeting
Professor
McGonagalls
beady
square-framed
eyes
are
you
telling
me
she
said
lowering
her
voice
so
that
the
group
of
curious
Ravenclaws
behind
them
could
not
hear
that
after
the
warning
I
gave
you
last
Monday
you
lost
your
temper
in
Professor
Umbridges
class
again
yes
Harry
muttered
speaking
to
the
floor
potter
you
must
get
a
grip
on
yourself
you
are
heading
for
serious
trouble
another
five
points
from
Gryffindor
but
what
professor
no
harry
said
furious
at
this
injustice
Im
already
being
punished
by
her
why
do
you
have
to
take
points
as
well
because
detentions
do
not
appear
to
have
any
effect
on
you
whatsoever
said
Professor
mcGonagall
tartly
no
not
another
word
of
complaint
Potter
and
as
for
you
Miss
Johnson
you
will
confine
your
shouting
matches
to
the
Quidditch
pitch
in
future
or
risk
losing
the
team
captaincy
professor
McGonagall
strode
back
towards
the
staff
table
angelina
gave
Harry
a
look
of
deepest
disgust
and
stalked
away
upon
which
he
flung
himself
on
to
the
bench
beside
Ron
fuming
shes
taken
points
off
Gryffindor
because
Im
having
my
hand
sliced
open
every
night
how
is
that
fair
how
i
know
mate
said
Ron
sympathetically
tipping
bacon
on
to
Harrys
plate
shes
bang
out
of
order
hermione
however
merely
rustled
the
pages
of
her
Daily
Prophet
and
said
nothing
you
think
McGonagall
was
right
do
you
said
Harry
angrily
to
the
picture
of
Cornelius
Fudge
obscuring
Hermiones
face
i
wish
she
hadnt
taken
points
from
you
but
I
think
shes
right
to
warn
you
not
to
lose
your
temper
with
Umbridge
said
Hermiones
voice
while
Fudge
gesticulated
forcefully
from
the
front
page
clearly
giving
some
kind
of
speech
harry
did
not
speak
to
Hermione
all
through
Charms
but
when
they
entered
Transfiguration
he
forgot
about
being
cross
with
her
professor
Umbridge
and
her
clipboard
were
sitting
in
a
corner
and
the
sight
of
her
drove
the
memory
of
breakfast
right
out
of
his
head
excellent
whispered
Ron
as
they
sat
down
in
their
usual
seats
lets
see
Umbridge
get
what
she
deserves
professor
McGonagall
marched
into
the
room
without
giving
the
slightest
indication
that
she
knew
Professor
Umbridge
was
there
that
will
do
she
said
and
silence
fell
immediately
mr.
Finnigan
kindly
come
here
and
hand
back
the
homework
Miss
Brown
please
take
this
box
of
mice
dont
be
silly
girl
they
wont
hurt
you
and
hand
one
to
each
student
hem
hem
said
Professor
Umbridge
employing
the
same
silly
little
cough
she
had
used
to
interrupt
Dumbledore
on
the
first
night
of
term
professor
McGonagall
ignored
her
seamus
handed
back
Harrys
essay
Harry
took
it
without
looking
at
him
and
saw
to
his
relief
that
he
had
managed
an
A
right
then
everyone
listen
closely
Dean
Thomas
if
you
do
that
to
the
mouse
again
I
shall
put
you
in
detention
most
of
you
have
now
successfully
Vanished
your
snails
and
even
those
who
were
left
with
a
certain
amount
of
shell
have
got
the
gist
of
the
spell
today
we
shall
be
hem
hem
said
Professor
Umbridge
yes
said
Professor
McGonagall
turning
round
her
eyebrows
so
close
together
they
seemed
to
form
one
long
severe
line
i
was
just
wondering
Professor
whether
you
received
my
note
telling
you
of
the
date
and
time
of
your
inspec
obviously
I
received
it
or
I
would
have
asked
you
what
you
are
doing
in
my
classroom
said
professor
McGonagall
turning
her
back
firmly
on
Professor
Umbridge
many
of
the
students
exchanged
looks
of
glee
as
I
was
saying
today
we
shall
be
practicing
the
altogether
more
difficult
Vanishment
of
mice
now
the
Vanishing
Spell
hem
hem
i
wonder
said
Professor
McGonagall
in
cold
fury
turning
on
Professor
Umbridge
how
you
expect
to
gain
an
idea
of
my
usual
teaching
methods
if
you
continue
to
interrupt
me
you
see
I
do
not
generally
permit
people
to
talk
when
I
am
talking
professor
Umbridge
looked
as
though
she
had
just
been
slapped
in
the
face
she
did
not
speak
but
straightened
the
parchment
on
her
clipboard
and
began
scribbling
furiously
looking
supremely
unconcerned
Professor
McGonagall
addressed
the
class
once
more
as
I
was
saying
the
Vanishing
Spell
becomes
more
difficult
with
the
complexity
of
the
animal
to
be
Vanished
the
snail
as
an
invertebrate
does
not
present
much
of
a
challenge
the
mouse
as
a
mammal
offers
a
much
greater
one
this
is
not
therefore
magic
you
can
accomplish
with
your
mind
on
your
dinner
so
you
know
the
incantation
let
me
see
what
you
can
do
how
she
can
lecture
me
about
not
losing
my
temper
with
Umbridge
harry
muttered
to
Ron
under
his
breath
but
he
was
grinning
his
anger
with
Professor
McGonagall
had
quite
evaporated
professor
Umbridge
did
not
follow
Professor
McGonagall
around
the
class
as
she
had
followed
professor
Trelawney
perhaps
she
realized
Professor
McGonagall
would
not
permit
it
she
did
however
take
many
more
notes
while
sitting
in
her
corner
and
when
Professor
McGonagall
finally
told
them
all
to
pack
away
she
rose
with
a
grim
expression
on
her
face
well
its
a
start
said
Ron
holding
up
a
long
wriggling
mouse-tail
and
dropping
it
back
into
the
box
Lavender
was
passing
around
as
they
filed
out
of
the
classroom
Harry
saw
Professor
Umbridge
approach
the
teachers
desk
he
nudged
Ron
who
nudged
Hermione
in
turn
and
the
three
of
them
deliberately
fell
back
to
eavesdrop
how
long
have
you
been
teaching
at
Hogwarts
professor
Umbridge
asked
thirty-nine
years
this
December
said
Professor
McGonagall
brusquely
snapping
her
bag
shut
professor
Umbridge
made
a
note
very
well
she
said
you
will
receive
the
results
of
your
inspection
in
ten
days
time
i
can
hardly
wait
said
Professor
McGonagall
in
a
coldly
indifferent
voice
and
she
strode
off
towards
the
door
hurry
up
you
three
she
added
sweeping
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
before
her
harry
could
not
help
giving
her
a
faint
smile
and
could
have
sworn
he
received
one
in
return
he
had
thought
that
the
next
time
he
would
see
Umbridge
would
be
in
his
detention
that
evening
but
he
was
wrong
when
they
walked
down
the
lawns
towards
the
Forest
for
Care
of
Magical
creatures
they
found
her
and
her
clipboard
waiting
for
them
beside
Professor
Grubbly-Plank
you
do
not
usually
take
this
class
is
that
correct
harry
heard
her
ask
as
they
arrived
at
the
trestle
table
where
the
group
of
captive
Bowtruckles
were
scrabbling
around
for
woodlice
like
so
many
living
twigs
quite
correct
said
Professor
Grubbly-Plank
hands
behind
her
back
and
bouncing
on
the
balls
of
her
feet
i
am
a
substitute
teacher
standing
in
for
Professor
Hagrid
harry
exchanged
uneasy
looks
with
Ron
and
Hermione
malfoy
was
whispering
with
Crabbe
and
goyle
he
would
surely
love
this
opportunity
to
tell
tales
on
Hagrid
to
a
member
of
the
Ministry
hmm
said
Professor
Umbridge
dropping
her
voice
though
Harry
could
still
hear
her
quite
clearly
i
wonder
the
Headmaster
seems
strangely
reluctant
to
give
me
any
information
on
the
matter
can
you
tell
me
what
is
causing
Professor
Hagrids
very
extended
leave
of
absence
harry
saw
Malfoy
look
up
eagerly
and
watch
Umbridge
and
Grubbly-Plank
closely
fraid
I
cant
said
Professor
Grubbly-Plank
breezily
dont
know
anything
more
about
it
than
you
do
got
an
owl
from
Dumbledore
would
I
like
a
couple
of
weeks
teaching
work
accepted
thats
as
much
as
I
know
well
shall
I
get
started
then
yes
please
do
said
Professor
Umbridge
scribbling
on
her
clipboard
umbridge
took
a
different
tack
in
this
class
and
wandered
amongst
the
students
questioning
them
on
magical
creatures
most
people
were
able
to
answer
well
and
Harrys
spirits
lifted
somewhat
at
least
the
class
was
not
letting
Hagrid
down
overall
said
Professor
Umbridge
returning
to
Professor
Grubbly-Planks
side
after
a
lengthy
interrogation
of
Dean
Thomas
how
do
you
as
a
temporary
member
of
staff
an
objective
outsider
I
suppose
you
might
say
how
do
you
find
Hogwarts
do
you
feel
you
receive
enough
support
from
the
school
management
oh
yes
Dumbledores
excellent
said
Professor
Grubbly-Plank
heartily
yes
Im
very
happy
with
the
way
things
are
run
very
happy
indeed
looking
politely
incredulous
Umbridge
made
a
tiny
note
on
her
clipboard
and
went
on
And
what
are
you
planning
to
cover
with
this
class
this
year
assuming
of
course
that
Professor
hagrid
does
not
return
oh
Ill
take
them
through
the
creatures
that
most
often
come
up
in
owl
said
Professor
grubbly-Plank
not
much
left
to
do
theyve
studied
unicorns
and
Nifflers
I
thought
wed
cover
Porlocks
and
Kneazles
make
sure
they
can
recognize
Crups
and
Knarls
you
know
well
you
seem
to
know
what
youre
doing
at
any
rate
said
Professor
Umbridge
making
a
very
obvious
tick
on
her
clipboard
harry
did
not
like
the
emphasis
she
put
on
you
and
liked
it
even
less
when
she
put
her
next
question
to
Goyle
now
I
hear
there
have
been
injuries
in
this
class
goyle
gave
a
stupid
grin
malfoy
hastened
to
answer
the
question
that
was
me
he
said
i
was
slashed
by
a
Hippogriff
a
Hippogriff
said
Professor
Umbridge
now
scribbling
frantically
only
because
he
was
too
stupid
to
listen
to
what
Hagrid
told
him
to
do
said
Harry
angrily
both
Ron
and
Hermione
groaned
professor
Umbridge
turned
her
head
slowly
in
Harrys
direction
another
nights
detention
I
think
she
said
softly
well
thank
you
very
much
Professor
grubbly-Plank
I
think
thats
all
I
need
here
you
will
be
receiving
the
results
of
your
inspection
within
ten
days
jolly
good
said
Professor
Grubbly-Plank
and
Professor
Umbridge
set
off
back
across
the
lawn
to
the
castle
it
was
nearly
midnight
when
Harry
left
Umbridges
office
that
night
his
hand
now
bleeding
so
severely
that
it
was
staining
the
scarf
he
had
wrapped
around
it
he
expected
the
common
room
to
be
empty
when
he
returned
but
Ron
and
Hermione
had
sat
up
waiting
for
him
he
was
pleased
to
see
them
especially
as
Hermione
was
disposed
to
be
sympathetic
rather
than
critical
here
she
said
anxiously
pushing
a
small
bowl
of
yellow
liquid
towards
him
soak
your
hand
in
that
its
a
solution
of
strained
and
pickled
Murtlap
tentacles
it
should
help
harry
placed
his
bleeding
aching
hand
into
the
bowl
and
experienced
a
wonderful
feeling
of
relief
crookshanks
curled
around
his
legs
purring
loudly
then
leapt
into
his
lap
and
settled
down
thanks
he
said
gratefully
scratching
behind
Crookshankss
ears
with
his
left
hand
i
still
reckon
you
should
complain
about
this
said
Ron
in
a
low
voice
no
said
Harry
flatly
mcGonagall
would
go
nuts
if
she
knew
yeah
she
probably
would
said
Harry
dully
and
how
long
do
you
reckon
itd
take
Umbridge
to
pass
another
decree
saying
anyone
who
complains
about
the
High
Inquisitor
gets
sacked
immediately
ron
opened
his
mouth
to
retort
but
nothing
came
out
and
after
a
moment
he
closed
it
again
defeated
shes
an
awful
woman
said
Hermione
in
a
small
voice
awful
you
know
I
was
just
saying
to
Ron
when
you
came
in
weve
got
to
do
something
about
her
i
suggested
poison
said
Ron
grimly
no
i
mean
something
about
what
a
dreadful
teacher
she
is
and
how
were
not
going
to
learn
any
Defense
from
her
at
all
said
Hermione
well
what
can
we
do
about
that
said
Ron
yawning
its
too
late
isnt
it
shes
got
the
job
shes
here
to
stay
fudgell
make
sure
of
that
well
said
Hermione
tentatively
you
know
I
was
thinking
today
she
shot
a
slightly
nervous
look
at
Harry
and
then
plunged
on
I
was
thinking
that
maybe
the
times
come
when
we
should
just
just
do
it
ourselves
do
what
ourselves
said
Harry
suspiciously
still
floating
his
hand
in
the
essence
of
Murtlap
tentacles
well
learn
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
ourselves
said
Hermione
come
off
it
groaned
Ron
you
want
us
to
do
extra
work
dyou
realize
Harry
and
I
are
behind
on
homework
again
and
its
only
the
second
week
but
this
is
much
more
important
than
homework
said
Hermione
harry
and
Ron
goggled
at
her
i
didnt
think
there
was
anything
in
the
universe
more
important
than
homework
said
Ron
dont
be
silly
of
course
there
is
said
Hermione
and
Harry
saw
with
an
ominous
feeling
that
her
face
was
suddenly
alight
with
the
kind
of
fervour
that
spew
usually
inspired
in
her
its
about
preparing
ourselves
like
Harry
said
in
Umbridges
first
lesson
for
whats
waiting
for
us
out
there
its
about
making
sure
we
really
can
defend
ourselves
if
we
dont
learn
anything
for
a
whole
year
we
cant
do
much
by
ourselves
said
Ron
in
a
defeated
voice
i
mean
all
right
we
can
go
and
look
jinxes
up
in
the
library
and
try
and
practice
them
I
suppose
no
I
agree
weve
gone
past
the
stage
where
we
can
just
learn
things
out
of
books
said
hermione
we
need
a
teacher
a
proper
one
who
can
show
us
how
to
use
the
spells
and
correct
us
if
were
going
wrong
if
youre
talking
about
Lupin
harry
began
no
no
Im
not
talking
about
Lupin
said
Hermione
hes
too
busy
with
the
Order
and
anyway
the
most
we
could
see
him
is
during
Hogsmeade
weekends
and
thats
not
nearly
often
enough
who
then
said
Harry
frowning
at
her
hermione
heaved
a
very
deep
sigh
isnt
it
obvious
she
said
im
talking
about
you
Harry
there
was
a
moments
silence
a
light
night
breeze
rattled
the
windowpanes
behind
Ron
and
the
fire
guttered
about
me
what
said
Harry
im
talking
about
you
teaching
us
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
harry
stared
at
her
then
he
turned
to
Ron
ready
to
exchange
the
exasperated
looks
they
sometimes
shared
when
Hermione
elaborated
on
far-fetched
schemes
like
spew
to
Harrys
consternation
however
Ron
did
not
look
exasperated
he
was
frowning
slightly
apparently
thinking
then
he
said
Thats
an
idea
whats
an
idea
said
Harry
you
said
Ron
teaching
us
to
do
it
but
harry
was
grinning
now
sure
the
pair
of
them
were
pulling
his
leg
but
Im
not
a
teacher
I
cant
harry
youre
the
best
in
the
year
at
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
said
Hermione
me
said
Harry
now
grinning
more
broadly
than
ever
no
Im
not
youve
beaten
me
in
every
test
actually
I
havent
said
Hermione
coolly
you
beat
me
in
our
third
year
the
only
year
we
both
sat
the
test
and
had
a
teacher
who
actually
knew
the
subject
but
Im
not
talking
about
test
results
Harry
think
what
youve
done
how
dyou
mean
you
know
what
Im
not
sure
I
want
someone
this
stupid
teaching
me
Ron
said
to
Hermione
smirking
slightly
he
turned
to
Harry
lets
think
he
said
pulling
a
face
like
Goyle
concentrating
uh
first
year
you
saved
the
sorcerers
Stone
from
You-Know-Who
but
that
was
luck
said
Harry
it
wasnt
skill
second
year
Ron
interrupted
you
killed
the
Basilisk
and
destroyed
Riddle
yeah
but
if
Fawkes
hadnt
turned
up
I
third
year
said
Ron
louder
still
you
fought
off
about
a
hundred
Dementors
at
once
you
know
that
was
a
fluke
if
the
Time-Turner
hadnt
last
year
Ron
said
almost
shouting
now
you
fought
off
You-Know-Who
again
listen
to
me
said
Harry
almost
angrily
because
Ron
and
Hermione
were
both
smirking
now
just
listen
to
me
all
right
it
sounds
great
when
you
say
it
like
that
but
all
that
stuff
was
luck
I
didnt
know
what
I
was
doing
half
the
time
I
didnt
plan
any
of
it
I
just
did
whatever
I
could
think
of
and
I
nearly
always
had
help
ron
and
Hermione
were
still
smirking
and
Harry
felt
his
temper
rise
he
wasnt
even
sure
why
he
was
feeling
so
angry
dont
sit
there
grinning
like
you
know
better
than
I
do
I
was
there
wasnt
I
he
said
heatedly
i
know
what
went
on
all
right
and
I
didnt
get
through
any
of
that
because
I
was
brilliant
at
defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
I
got
through
it
all
because
because
help
came
at
the
right
time
or
because
I
guessed
right
but
I
just
blundered
through
it
all
I
didnt
have
a
clue
what
I
was
doing
stop
laughing
the
bowl
of
Murtlap
essence
fell
to
the
floor
and
smashed
he
became
aware
that
he
was
on
his
feet
though
he
couldnt
remember
standing
up
crookshanks
streaked
away
under
a
sofa
ron
and
Hermiones
smiles
had
vanished
you
dont
know
what
its
like
you
neither
of
you
youve
never
had
to
face
him
have
you
you
think
its
just
memorizing
a
bunch
of
spells
and
throwing
them
at
him
like
youre
in
class
or
something
the
whole
time
youre
sure
you
know
theres
nothing
between
you
and
dying
except
your
own
your
own
brain
or
guts
or
whatever
like
you
can
think
straight
when
you
know
youre
about
a
second
from
being
murdered
or
tortured
or
watching
your
friends
die
theyve
never
taught
us
that
in
their
classes
what
its
like
to
deal
with
things
like
that
and
you
two
sit
there
acting
like
Im
a
clever
little
boy
to
be
standing
here
alive
like
Diggory
was
stupid
like
he
messed
up
you
just
dont
get
it
that
could
just
as
easily
have
been
me
it
would
have
been
if
Voldemort
hadnt
needed
me
we
werent
saying
anything
like
that
mate
said
Ron
looking
aghast
we
werent
having
a
go
at
Diggory
we
didnt
youve
got
the
wrong
end
of
the
he
looked
helplessly
at
Hermione
whose
face
was
stricken
harry
she
said
timidly
dont
you
see
this
this
is
exactly
why
we
need
you
we
need
to
know
what
its
r-really
like
facing
him
facing
V-Voldemort
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
ever
said
Voldemorts
name
and
it
was
this
more
than
anything
else
that
calmed
Harry
still
breathing
hard
he
sank
back
into
his
chair
becoming
aware
as
he
did
so
that
his
hand
was
throbbing
horribly
again
he
wished
he
had
not
smashed
the
bowl
of
Murtlap
essence
well
think
about
it
said
Hermione
quietly
please
harry
could
not
think
of
anything
to
say
he
was
feeling
ashamed
of
his
outburst
already
he
nodded
hardly
aware
of
what
he
was
agreeing
to
hermione
stood
up
well
Im
off
to
bed
she
said
in
a
voice
that
was
clearly
as
natural
as
she
could
make
it
erm
night
ron
had
gotten
to
his
feet
too
coming
he
said
awkwardly
to
Harry
yeah
said
Harry
in
in
a
minute
ill
just
clear
this
up
he
indicated
the
smashed
bowl
on
the
floor
ron
nodded
and
left
reparo
Harry
muttered
pointing
his
wand
at
the
broken
pieces
of
china
they
flew
back
together
good
as
new
but
there
was
no
returning
the
Murtlap
essence
to
the
bowl
he
was
suddenly
so
tired
he
was
tempted
to
sink
back
into
his
armchair
and
sleep
there
but
instead
he
forced
himself
to
his
feet
and
followed
Ron
upstairs
his
restless
night
was
punctuated
once
more
by
dreams
of
long
corridors
and
locked
doors
and
he
awoke
next
day
with
his
scar
prickling
again
chapter
sixteen
in
the
Hogs
Head
hermione
made
no
mention
of
Harry
giving
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
lessons
for
two
whole
weeks
after
her
original
suggestion
harrys
detentions
with
Umbridge
were
finally
over
he
doubted
whether
the
words
now
etched
into
the
back
of
his
hand
would
ever
fade
entirely
ron
had
had
four
more
Quidditch
practices
and
not
been
shouted
at
during
the
last
two
and
all
three
of
them
had
managed
to
Vanish
their
mice
in
Transfiguration
Hermione
had
actually
progressed
to
Vanishing
kittens
before
the
subject
was
broached
again
on
a
wild
blustery
evening
at
the
end
of
September
when
the
three
of
them
were
sitting
in
the
library
looking
up
potion
ingredients
for
Snape
i
was
wondering
Hermione
said
suddenly
whether
youd
thought
any
more
about
Defense
against
the
Dark
Arts
Harry
course
I
have
said
Harry
grumpily
cant
forget
it
can
we
with
that
hag
teaching
us
i
meant
the
idea
Ron
and
I
had
Ron
cast
her
an
alarmed
threatening
kind
of
look
she
frowned
at
him
Oh
all
right
the
idea
I
had
then
about
you
teaching
us
harry
did
not
answer
at
once
he
pretended
to
be
perusing
a
page
of
Asiatic
Anti-Venoms
because
he
did
not
want
to
say
what
was
in
his
mind
he
had
given
the
matter
a
great
deal
of
thought
over
the
past
fortnight
sometimes
it
seemed
an
insane
idea
just
as
it
had
on
the
night
Hermione
had
proposed
it
but
at
others
he
had
found
himself
thinking
about
the
spells
that
had
served
him
best
in
his
various
encounters
with
Dark
creatures
and
Death
Eaters
found
himself
in
fact
subconsciously
planning
lessons
well
he
said
slowly
when
he
could
no
longer
pretend
to
find
Asiatic
Anti-Venoms
interesting
yeah
I
Ive
thought
about
it
a
bit
and
said
Hermione
eagerly
i
dunno
said
Harry
playing
for
time
he
looked
up
at
Ron
i
thought
it
was
a
good
idea
from
the
start
said
Ron
who
seemed
keener
to
join
in
this
conversation
now
that
he
was
sure
Harry
was
not
going
to
start
shouting
again
harry
shifted
uncomfortably
in
his
chair
you
did
listen
to
what
I
said
about
a
load
of
it
being
luck
didnt
you
yes
Harry
said
Hermione
gently
but
all
the
same
theres
no
point
pretending
that
youre
not
good
at
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
because
you
are
you
were
the
only
person
last
year
who
could
throw
off
the
Imperius
Curse
completely
you
can
produce
a
Patronus
you
can
do
all
sorts
of
stuff
that
full-grown
wizards
cant
Viktor
always
said
ron
looked
round
at
her
so
fast
he
appeared
to
crick
his
neck
rubbing
it
he
said
Yeah
what
did
Vicky
say
ho
ho
said
Hermione
in
a
bored
voice
he
said
Harry
knew
how
to
do
stuff
even
he
didnt
and
he
was
in
the
final
year
at
Durmstrang
ron
was
looking
at
Hermione
suspiciously
youre
not
still
in
contact
with
him
are
you
so
what
if
I
am
said
Hermione
coolly
though
her
face
was
a
little
pink
i
can
have
a
pen-pal
if
I
he
didnt
only
want
to
be
your
pen-pal
said
Ron
accusingly
hermione
shook
her
head
exasperatedly
and
ignoring
Ron
who
was
continuing
to
watch
her
said
to
Harry
Well
what
do
you
think
will
you
teach
us
just
you
and
Ron
yeah
well
said
Hermione
looking
a
mite
anxious
again
well
now
dont
fly
off
the
handle
again
Harry
please
but
I
really
think
you
ought
to
teach
anyone
who
wants
to
learn
i
mean
were
talking
about
defending
ourselves
against
V-Voldemort
oh
dont
be
pathetic
Ron
it
doesnt
seem
fair
if
we
dont
offer
the
chance
to
other
people
harry
considered
this
for
a
moment
then
said
Yeah
but
I
doubt
anyone
except
you
two
would
want
to
be
taught
by
me
im
a
nutter
remember
well
I
think
you
might
be
surprised
how
many
people
would
be
interested
in
hearing
what
youve
got
to
say
said
Hermione
seriously
look
she
leaned
towards
him
Ron
who
was
still
watching
her
with
a
frown
on
his
face
leaned
forwards
to
listen
too
you
know
the
first
weekend
in
Octobers
a
Hogsmeade
weekend
how
would
it
be
if
we
tell
anyone
whos
interested
to
meet
us
in
the
village
and
we
can
talk
it
over
why
do
we
have
to
do
it
outside
school
said
Ron
because
said
Hermione
returning
to
the
diagram
of
the
Chinese
Chomping
Cabbage
she
was
copying
I
dont
think
Umbridge
would
be
very
happy
if
she
found
out
what
we
were
up
to
harry
had
been
looking
forward
to
the
weekend
trip
into
Hogsmeade
but
there
was
one
thing
worrying
him
sirius
had
maintained
a
stony
silence
since
he
had
appeared
in
the
fire
at
the
beginning
of
September
Harry
knew
they
had
made
him
angry
by
saying
they
didnt
want
him
to
come
but
he
still
worried
from
time
to
time
that
Sirius
might
throw
caution
to
the
winds
and
turn
up
anyway
what
were
they
going
to
do
if
the
great
black
dog
came
bounding
up
the
street
towards
them
in
Hogsmeade
perhaps
under
the
nose
of
Draco
Malfoy
well
you
cant
blame
him
for
wanting
to
get
out
and
about
said
Ron
when
Harry
discussed
his
fears
with
him
and
Hermione
i
mean
hes
been
on
the
run
for
over
two
years
hasnt
he
and
I
know
that
cant
have
been
a
laugh
but
at
least
he
was
free
wasnt
he
and
now
hes
just
shut
up
all
the
time
with
that
ghastly
elf
hermione
scowled
at
Ron
but
otherwise
ignored
the
slight
on
Kreacher
the
trouble
is
she
said
to
Harry
until
V-Voldemort
oh
for
heavens
sake
Ron
comes
out
into
the
open
Sirius
is
going
to
have
to
stay
hidden
isnt
he
i
mean
the
stupid
Ministry
isnt
going
to
realize
Sirius
is
innocent
until
they
accept
that
Dumbledores
been
telling
the
truth
about
him
all
along
and
once
the
fools
start
catching
real
Death
Eaters
again
itll
be
obvious
Sirius
isnt
one
i
mean
he
hasnt
got
the
Mark
for
one
thing
i
dont
reckon
hed
be
stupid
enough
to
turn
up
said
Ron
bracingly
dumbledored
go
mad
if
he
did
and
Sirius
listens
to
Dumbledore
even
if
he
doesnt
like
what
he
hears
when
Harry
continued
to
look
worried
Hermione
said
Listen
Ron
and
I
have
been
sounding
out
people
who
we
thought
might
want
to
learn
some
proper
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
and
there
are
a
couple
who
seem
interested
weve
told
them
to
meet
us
in
Hogsmeade
right
said
Harry
vaguely
his
mind
still
on
Sirius
dont
worry
Harry
Hermione
said
quietly
youve
got
enough
on
your
plate
without
Sirius
too
she
was
quite
right
of
course
he
was
barely
keeping
up
with
his
homework
though
he
was
doing
much
better
now
that
he
was
no
longer
spending
every
evening
in
detention
with
umbridge
ron
was
even
further
behind
with
his
work
than
Harry
because
while
they
both
had
quidditch
practice
twice
a
week
Ron
also
had
his
prefect
duties
however
Hermione
who
was
taking
more
subjects
than
either
of
them
had
not
only
finished
all
her
homework
but
was
also
finding
time
to
knit
more
elf
clothes
harry
had
to
admit
that
she
was
getting
better
it
was
now
almost
always
possible
to
distinguish
between
the
hats
and
the
socks
the
morning
of
the
Hogsmeade
visit
dawned
bright
but
windy
after
breakfast
they
queued
up
in
front
of
Filch
who
matched
their
names
to
the
long
list
of
students
who
had
permission
from
their
parents
or
guardian
to
visit
the
village
with
a
slight
pang
Harry
remembered
that
if
it
hadnt
been
for
Sirius
he
would
not
have
been
going
at
all
when
Harry
reached
Filch
the
caretaker
gave
a
great
sniff
as
though
trying
to
detect
a
whiff
of
something
from
Harry
then
he
gave
a
curt
nod
that
set
his
jowls
aquiver
again
and
Harry
walked
on
out
on
to
the
stone
steps
and
the
cold
sunlit
day
er
why
was
Filch
sniffing
you
asked
Ron
as
he
Harry
and
Hermione
set
off
at
a
brisk
pace
down
the
wide
drive
to
the
gates
i
suppose
he
was
checking
for
the
smell
of
Dungbombs
said
Harry
with
a
small
laugh
forgot
to
tell
you
and
he
recounted
the
story
of
sending
his
letter
to
Sirius
and
Filch
bursting
in
seconds
later
demanding
to
see
the
letter
to
his
slight
surprise
Hermione
found
this
story
highly
interesting
much
more
indeed
than
he
did
himself
he
said
he
was
tipped
off
you
were
ordering
Dungbombs
but
who
tipped
him
off
i
dunno
said
Harry
shrugging
maybe
Malfoy
hed
think
it
was
a
laugh
they
walked
between
the
tall
stone
pillars
topped
with
winged
boars
and
turned
left
on
to
the
road
into
the
village
the
wind
whipping
their
hair
into
their
eyes
malfoy
said
Hermione
skeptically
well
yes
maybe
and
she
remained
deep
in
thought
all
the
way
into
the
outskirts
of
Hogsmeade
where
are
we
going
anyway
harry
asked
the
Three
Broomsticks
oh
no
said
Hermione
coming
out
of
her
reverie
no
its
always
packed
and
really
noisy
ive
told
the
others
to
meet
us
in
the
Hogs
Head
that
other
pub
you
know
the
one
its
not
on
the
main
road
i
think
its
a
bit
you
know
dodgy
but
students
dont
normally
go
in
there
so
I
dont
think
well
be
overheard
they
walked
down
the
main
street
past
Zonkos
Wizarding
Joke
Shop
where
they
were
not
surprised
to
see
Fred
George
and
Lee
Jordan
past
the
post
office
from
which
owls
issued
at
regular
intervals
and
turned
up
a
side-street
at
the
top
of
which
stood
a
small
inn
a
battered
wooden
sign
hung
from
a
rusty
bracket
over
the
door
with
a
picture
on
it
of
a
wild
boars
severed
head
leaking
blood
on
to
the
white
cloth
around
it
the
sign
creaked
in
the
wind
as
they
approached
all
three
of
them
hesitated
outside
the
door
well
come
on
said
Hermione
slightly
nervously
harry
led
the
way
inside
it
was
not
at
all
like
the
Three
Broomsticks
whose
large
bar
gave
an
impression
of
gleaming
warmth
and
cleanliness
the
Hogs
Head
bar
comprised
one
small
dingy
and
very
dirty
room
that
smelled
strongly
of
something
that
might
have
been
goats
the
bay
windows
were
so
encrusted
with
grime
that
very
little
daylight
could
permeate
the
room
which
was
lit
instead
with
the
stubs
of
candles
sitting
on
rough
wooden
tables
the
floor
seemed
at
first
glance
to
be
compressed
earth
though
as
Harry
stepped
on
to
it
he
realized
that
there
was
stone
beneath
what
seemed
to
be
the
accumulated
filth
of
centuries
harry
remembered
Hagrid
mentioning
this
pub
in
his
first
year
Yeh
get
a
lot
o
funny
folk
in
the
Hogs
Head
he
had
said
explaining
how
he
had
won
a
dragons
egg
from
a
hooded
stranger
there
at
the
time
Harry
had
wondered
why
Hagrid
had
not
found
it
odd
that
the
stranger
kept
his
face
hidden
throughout
their
encounter
now
he
saw
that
keeping
your
face
hidden
was
something
of
a
fashion
in
the
Hogs
Head
there
was
a
man
at
the
bar
whose
whole
head
was
wrapped
in
dirty
grey
bandages
though
he
was
still
managing
to
gulp
endless
glasses
of
some
smoking
fiery
substance
through
a
slit
over
his
mouth
two
figures
shrouded
in
hoods
sat
at
a
table
in
one
of
the
windows
Harry
might
have
thought
them
Dementors
if
they
had
not
been
talking
in
strong
Yorkshire
accents
and
in
a
shadowy
corner
beside
the
fireplace
sat
a
witch
with
a
thick
black
veil
that
fell
to
her
toes
they
could
just
see
the
tip
of
her
nose
because
it
caused
the
veil
to
protrude
slightly
i
dont
know
about
this
Hermione
Harry
muttered
as
they
crossed
to
the
bar
he
was
looking
particularly
at
the
heavily
veiled
witch
has
it
occurred
to
you
Umbridge
might
be
under
that
hermione
cast
an
appraising
eye
over
the
veiled
figure
umbridge
is
shorter
than
that
woman
she
said
quietly
and
anyway
even
if
Umbridge
does
come
in
here
theres
nothing
she
can
do
to
stop
us
Harry
because
Ive
double
and
triplechecked
the
school
rules
were
not
out
of
bounds
I
specifically
asked
Professor
Flitwick
whether
students
were
allowed
to
come
in
the
Hogs
Head
and
he
said
yes
but
he
advised
me
strongly
to
bring
our
own
glasses
and
Ive
looked
up
everything
I
can
think
of
about
study
groups
and
homework
groups
and
theyre
definitely
allowed
i
just
dont
think
its
a
good
idea
if
we
parade
what
were
doing
no
said
Harry
dryly
especially
as
its
not
exactly
a
homework
group
youre
planning
is
it
the
barman
sidled
towards
them
out
of
a
back
room
he
was
a
grumpy-looking
old
man
with
a
great
deal
of
long
grey
hair
and
beard
he
was
tall
and
thin
and
looked
vaguely
familiar
to
Harry
what
he
grunted
three
Butterbeers
please
said
Hermione
the
man
reached
beneath
the
counter
and
pulled
up
three
very
dusty
very
dirty
bottles
which
he
slammed
on
the
bar
six
Sickles
he
said
ill
get
them
said
Harry
quickly
passing
over
the
silver
the
barmans
eyes
traveled
over
harry
resting
for
a
fraction
of
a
second
on
his
scar
then
he
turned
away
and
deposited
Harrys
money
in
an
ancient
wooden
till
whose
drawer
slid
open
automatically
to
receive
it
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
retreated
to
the
furthest
table
from
the
bar
and
sat
down
looking
around
the
man
in
the
dirty
grey
bandages
rapped
the
counter
with
his
knuckles
and
received
another
smoking
drink
from
the
barman
you
know
what
ron
murmured
looking
over
at
the
bar
with
enthusiasm
we
could
order
anything
we
liked
in
here
i
bet
that
bloke
would
sell
us
anything
he
wouldnt
care
ive
always
wanted
to
try
Firewhisky
you
are
a
prefect
snarled
Hermione
oh
said
Ron
the
smile
fading
from
his
face
yeah
so
who
did
you
say
is
supposed
to
be
meeting
us
harry
asked
wrenching
open
the
rusty
top
of
his
Butterbeer
and
taking
a
swig
just
a
couple
of
people
Hermione
repeated
checking
her
watch
and
looking
anxiously
towards
the
door
i
told
them
to
be
here
about
now
and
Im
sure
they
all
know
where
it
is
oh
look
this
might
be
them
now
the
door
of
the
pub
had
opened
a
thick
band
of
dusty
sunlight
split
the
room
in
two
for
a
moment
and
then
vanished
blocked
by
the
incoming
rush
of
a
crowd
of
people
first
came
Neville
with
Dean
and
Lavender
who
were
closely
followed
by
Parvati
and
Padma
patil
with
Harrys
stomach
did
a
back-flip
Cho
and
one
of
her
usually-giggling
girlfriends
then
on
her
own
and
looking
so
dreamy
she
might
have
walked
in
by
accident
Luna
Lovegood
then
katie
Bell
Alicia
Spinnet
and
Angelina
Johnson
Colin
and
Dennis
Creevey
Ernie
Macmillan
justin
Finch-Fletchley
Hannah
Abbott
a
Hufflepuff
girl
with
a
long
plait
down
her
back
whose
name
Harry
did
not
know
three
Ravenclaw
boys
he
was
pretty
sure
were
called
Anthony
goldstein
Michael
Corner
and
Terry
Boot
Ginny
closely
followed
by
a
tall
skinny
blond
boy
with
an
upturned
nose
whom
Harry
recognized
vaguely
as
being
a
member
of
the
Hufflepuff
quidditch
team
and
bringing
up
the
rear
Fred
and
George
Weasley
with
their
friend
Lee
Jordan
all
three
of
whom
were
carrying
large
paper
bags
crammed
with
Zonkos
merchandise
a
couple
of
people
said
Harry
hoarsely
to
Hermione
a
couple
of
people
yes
well
the
idea
seemed
quite
popular
said
Hermione
happily
Ron
do
you
want
to
pull
up
some
more
chairs
the
barman
had
frozen
in
the
act
of
wiping
out
a
glass
with
a
rag
so
filthy
it
looked
as
though
it
had
never
been
washed
possibly
he
had
never
seen
his
pub
so
full
hi
said
Fred
reaching
the
bar
first
and
counting
his
companions
quickly
could
we
have
twenty-five
Butterbeers
please
the
barman
glared
at
him
for
a
moment
then
throwing
down
his
rag
irritably
as
though
he
had
been
interrupted
in
something
very
important
he
started
passing
up
dusty
Butterbeers
from
under
the
bar
cheers
said
Fred
handing
them
out
cough
up
everyone
I
havent
got
enough
gold
for
all
of
these
harry
watched
numbly
as
the
large
chattering
group
took
their
beers
from
Fred
and
rummaged
in
their
robes
to
find
coins
he
could
not
imagine
what
all
these
people
had
turned
up
for
until
the
horrible
thought
occurred
to
him
that
they
might
be
expecting
some
kind
of
speech
at
which
he
rounded
on
Hermione
what
have
you
been
telling
people
he
said
in
a
low
voice
what
are
they
expecting
ive
told
you
they
just
want
to
hear
what
youve
got
to
say
said
Hermione
soothingly
but
harry
continued
to
look
at
her
so
furiously
that
she
added
quickly
you
dont
have
to
do
anything
yet
Ill
speak
to
them
first
hi
Harry
said
Neville
beaming
and
taking
a
seat
opposite
him
harry
tried
to
smile
back
but
did
not
speak
his
mouth
was
exceptionally
dry
cho
had
just
smiled
at
him
and
sat
down
on
Rons
right
her
friend
who
had
curly
reddish-blonde
hair
did
not
smile
but
gave
Harry
a
thoroughly
mistrustful
look
which
plainly
told
him
that
given
her
way
she
would
not
be
here
at
all
in
twos
and
threes
the
new
arrivals
settled
around
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
some
looking
rather
excited
others
curious
Luna
Lovegood
gazing
dreamily
into
space
when
everybody
had
pulled
up
a
chair
the
chatter
died
out
every
eye
was
upon
Harry
er
said
Hermione
her
voice
slightly
higher
than
usual
out
of
nerves
well
er
hi
the
group
focused
its
attention
on
her
instead
though
eyes
continued
to
dart
back
regularly
to
harry
well
erm
well
you
know
why
youre
here
erm
well
Harry
here
had
the
idea
I
mean
Harry
had
thrown
her
a
sharp
look
I
had
the
idea
that
it
might
be
good
if
people
who
wanted
to
study
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
and
I
mean
really
study
it
you
know
not
the
rubbish
that
Umbridge
is
doing
with
us
Hermiones
voice
became
suddenly
much
stronger
and
more
confident
because
nobody
could
call
that
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
Hear
hear
said
Anthony
Goldstein
and
Hermione
looked
heartened
Well
I
thought
it
would
be
good
if
we
well
took
matters
into
our
own
hands
she
paused
looked
sideways
at
Harry
and
went
on
And
by
that
I
mean
learning
how
to
defend
ourselves
properly
not
just
in
theory
but
doing
the
real
spells
you
want
to
pass
your
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
owl
too
though
I
bet
said
Michael
corner
who
was
watching
her
closely
of
course
I
do
said
Hermione
at
once
but
more
than
that
I
want
to
be
properly
trained
in
defense
because
because
she
took
a
great
breath
and
finished
because
Lord
Voldemort
is
back
the
reaction
was
immediate
and
predictable
chos
friend
shrieked
and
slopped
Butterbeer
down
herself
Terry
Boot
gave
a
kind
of
involuntary
twitch
Padma
Patil
shuddered
and
Neville
gave
an
odd
yelp
that
he
managed
to
turn
into
a
cough
all
of
them
however
looked
fixedly
even
eagerly
at
Harry
well
thats
the
plan
anyway
said
Hermione
if
you
want
to
join
us
we
need
to
decide
how
were
going
to
wheres
the
proof
You-Know-Whos
back
said
the
blond
Hufflepuff
player
in
a
rather
aggressive
voice
well
Dumbledore
believes
it
Hermione
began
you
mean
Dumbledore
believes
him
said
the
blond
boy
nodding
at
Harry
who
are
you
said
Ron
rather
rudely
zacharias
Smith
said
the
boy
and
I
think
weve
got
the
right
to
know
exactly
what
makes
him
say
You-Know-Whos
back
look
said
Hermione
intervening
swiftly
thats
really
not
what
this
meeting
was
supposed
to
be
about
its
okay
Hermione
said
Harry
it
had
just
dawned
on
him
why
there
were
so
many
people
there
he
thought
Hermione
should
have
seen
this
coming
some
of
these
people
maybe
even
most
of
them
had
turned
up
in
the
hopes
of
hearing
Harrys
story
firsthand
what
makes
me
say
You-Know-Whos
back
he
repeated
looking
Zacharias
straight
in
the
face
i
saw
him
but
Dumbledore
told
the
whole
school
what
happened
last
year
and
if
you
didnt
believe
him
you
wont
believe
me
and
Im
not
wasting
an
afternoon
trying
to
convince
anyone
the
whole
group
seemed
to
have
held
its
breath
while
Harry
spoke
harry
had
the
impression
that
even
the
barman
was
listening
he
was
wiping
the
same
glass
with
the
filthy
rag
making
it
steadily
dirtier
zacharias
said
dismissively
All
Dumbledore
told
us
last
year
was
that
Cedric
Diggory
got
killed
by
You-Know-Who
and
that
you
brought
Diggorys
body
back
to
Hogwarts
he
didnt
give
us
details
he
didnt
tell
us
exactly
how
Diggory
got
murdered
I
think
wed
all
like
to
know
if
youve
come
to
hear
exactly
what
it
looks
like
when
Voldemort
murders
someone
I
cant
help
you
Harry
said
his
temper
always
so
close
to
the
surface
these
days
was
rising
again
he
did
not
take
his
eyes
from
Zacharias
Smiths
aggressive
face
and
was
determined
not
to
look
at
Cho
i
dont
want
to
talk
about
Cedric
Diggory
all
right
so
if
thats
what
youre
here
for
you
might
as
well
clear
out
he
cast
an
angry
look
in
Hermiones
direction
this
was
he
felt
all
her
fault
she
had
decided
to
display
him
like
some
sort
of
freak
and
of
course
they
had
all
turned
up
to
see
just
how
wild
his
story
was
but
none
of
them
left
their
seats
not
even
Zacharias
Smith
though
he
continued
to
gaze
intently
at
Harry
so
said
Hermione
her
voice
very
high-pitched
again
so
like
I
was
saying
if
you
want
to
learn
some
defense
then
we
need
to
work
out
how
were
going
to
do
it
how
often
were
going
to
meet
and
where
were
going
to
is
it
true
interrupted
the
girl
with
the
long
plait
down
her
back
looking
at
Harry
that
you
can
produce
a
Patronus
there
was
a
murmur
of
interest
around
the
group
at
this
yeah
said
Harry
slightly
defensively
a
corporeal
Patronus
the
phrase
stirred
something
in
Harrys
memory
er
you
dont
know
Madam
Bones
do
you
he
asked
the
girl
smiled
shes
my
auntie
she
said
im
Susan
Bones
she
told
me
about
your
hearing
so
is
it
really
true
you
make
a
stag
Patronus
yes
said
Harry
blimey
Harry
said
Lee
looking
deeply
impressed
i
never
knew
that
mum
told
Ron
not
to
spread
it
around
said
Fred
grinning
at
Harry
she
said
you
got
enough
attention
as
it
was
shes
not
wrong
mumbled
Harry
and
a
couple
of
people
laughed
the
veiled
witch
sitting
alone
shifted
very
slightly
in
her
seat
and
did
you
kill
a
Basilisk
with
that
sword
in
Dumbledores
office
demanded
Terry
Boot
thats
what
one
of
the
portraits
on
the
wall
told
me
when
I
was
in
there
last
year
er
yeah
I
did
yeah
said
Harry
justin
Finch-Fletchley
whistled
the
Creevey
brothers
exchanged
awestruck
looks
and
Lavender
brown
said
Wow
softly
harry
was
feeling
slightly
hot
around
the
collar
now
he
was
determinedly
looking
anywhere
but
at
Cho
and
in
our
first
year
said
Neville
to
the
group
at
large
he
saved
that
Sorcerous
Stone
sorcerers
hissed
Hermione
yes
that
from
You-Know-Who
finished
Neville
hannah
Abbotts
eyes
were
as
round
as
Galleons
and
thats
not
to
mention
said
Cho
Harrys
eyes
snapped
across
to
her
she
was
looking
at
him
smiling
his
stomach
did
another
somersault
all
the
tasks
he
had
to
get
through
in
the
triwizard
Tournament
last
year
getting
past
dragons
and
merpeople
and
Acromantula
and
things
there
was
a
murmur
of
impressed
agreement
around
the
table
harrys
insides
were
squirming
he
was
trying
to
arrange
his
face
so
that
he
did
not
look
too
pleased
with
himself
the
fact
that
cho
had
just
praised
him
made
it
much
much
harder
for
him
to
say
the
thing
he
had
sworn
to
himself
he
would
tell
them
look
he
said
and
everyone
fell
silent
at
once
I
i
dont
want
to
sound
like
Im
trying
to
be
modest
or
anything
but
i
had
a
lot
of
help
with
all
that
stuff
not
with
the
dragon
you
didnt
said
Michael
Corner
at
once
that
was
a
seriously
cool
bit
of
flying
yeah
well
said
Harry
feeling
it
would
be
churlish
to
disagree
and
nobody
helped
you
get
rid
of
those
Dementors
this
summer
said
Susan
Bones
no
said
Harry
no
okay
I
know
I
did
bits
of
it
without
help
but
the
point
Im
trying
to
make
is
are
you
trying
to
weasel
out
of
showing
us
any
of
this
stuff
said
Zacharias
Smith
heres
an
idea
said
Ron
loudly
before
Harry
could
speak
why
dont
you
shut
your
mouth
perhaps
the
word
weasel
had
affected
Ron
particularly
strongly
in
any
case
he
was
now
looking
at
Zacharias
as
though
he
would
like
nothing
better
than
to
thump
him
zacharias
flushed
well
weve
all
turned
up
to
learn
from
him
and
now
hes
telling
us
he
cant
really
do
any
of
it
he
said
thats
not
what
he
said
snarled
Fred
would
you
like
us
to
clean
out
your
ears
for
you
enquired
George
pulling
a
long
and
lethal
looking
metal
instrument
from
inside
one
of
the
Zonkos
bags
or
any
part
of
your
body
really
were
not
fussy
where
we
stick
this
said
Fred
yes
well
said
Hermione
hastily
moving
on
the
point
is
are
we
agreed
we
want
to
take
lessons
from
Harry
there
was
a
murmur
of
general
agreement
zacharias
folded
his
arms
and
said
nothing
though
perhaps
this
was
because
he
was
too
busy
keeping
an
eye
on
the
instrument
in
Freds
hand
right
said
Hermione
looking
relieved
that
something
had
at
last
been
settled
well
then
the
next
question
is
how
often
we
do
it
i
really
dont
think
theres
any
point
in
meeting
less
than
once
a
week
hang
on
said
Angelina
we
need
to
make
sure
this
doesnt
clash
with
our
Quidditch
practice
no
said
Cho
nor
with
ours
nor
ours
added
Zacharias
Smith
im
sure
we
can
find
a
night
that
suits
everyone
aid
Hermione
slightly
impatiently
but
you
know
this
is
rather
important
were
talking
about
learning
to
defend
ourselves
against
V-Voldemorts
Death
Eaters
well
said
barked
Ernie
Macmillan
who
Harry
had
been
expecting
to
speak
long
before
this
personally
I
think
this
is
really
important
possibly
more
important
than
anything
else
well
do
this
year
even
with
our
OWLs
coming
up
he
looked
around
impressively
as
though
waiting
for
people
to
cry
Surely
not
when
nobody
spoke
he
went
on
I
personally
am
at
a
loss
to
see
why
the
Ministry
has
foisted
such
a
useless
teacher
on
us
at
this
critical
period
obviously
they
are
in
denial
about
the
return
of
You-Know
who
but
to
give
us
a
teacher
who
is
trying
to
actively
prevent
us
from
using
defensive
spells
we
think
the
reason
Umbridge
doesnt
want
us
trained
in
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
said
hermione
is
that
shes
got
some
some
mad
idea
that
Dumbledore
could
use
the
students
in
the
school
as
a
kind
of
private
army
she
thinks
hed
mobilize
us
against
the
Ministry
nearly
everybody
looked
stunned
at
this
news
everybody
except
Luna
Lovegood
who
piped
up
well
that
makes
sense
after
all
Cornelius
Fudge
has
got
his
own
private
army
what
said
Harry
completely
thrown
by
this
unexpected
piece
of
information
yes
hes
got
an
army
of
Heliopaths
said
Luna
so
lemnly
no
he
hasnt
snapped
Hermione
yes
he
has
said
Luna
what
are
Heliopaths
asked
Neville
looking
blank
theyre
spirits
of
fire
said
Luna
her
protuberant
eyes
widening
so
that
she
looked
madder
than
ever
great
tall
flaming
creatures
that
gallop
across
the
ground
burning
everything
in
front
of
they
dont
exist
Neville
said
Hermione
tartly
oh
yes
they
do
said
Luna
angrily
im
sorry
but
wheres
the
proof
of
that
snapped
Hermione
there
are
plenty
of
eye-witness
accounts
just
because
youre
so
narrow-minded
you
need
to
have
everything
shoved
under
your
nose
before
you
hem
hem
said
Ginny
in
such
a
good
imitation
of
Professor
Umbridge
that
several
people
looked
around
in
alarm
and
then
laughed
werent
we
trying
to
decide
how
often
were
going
to
meet
and
have
defense
lessons
yes
said
Hermione
at
once
yes
we
were
youre
right
Ginny
well
once
a
week
sounds
cool
said
Lee
Jordan
as
long
as
began
Angelina
yes
yes
we
know
about
the
Quidditch
said
Hermione
in
a
tense
voice
well
the
other
thing
to
decide
is
where
were
going
to
meet
this
was
rather
more
difficult
the
whole
group
fell
silent
library
suggested
Katie
Bell
after
a
few
moments
i
cant
see
Madam
Pince
being
too
chuffed
with
us
doing
jinxes
in
the
library
said
Harry
maybe
an
unused
classroom
said
Dean
yeah
said
Ron
McGonagall
might
let
us
have
hers
she
did
when
Harry
was
practicing
for
the
Triwizard
but
Harry
was
pretty
certain
that
McGonagall
would
not
be
so
accommodating
this
time
for
all
that
Hermione
had
said
about
study
and
homework
groups
being
allowed
he
had
the
distinct
feeling
that
this
one
might
be
considered
a
lot
more
rebellious
right
well
well
try
to
find
somewhere
said
Hermione
well
send
a
message
round
to
everybody
when
weve
got
a
time
and
a
place
for
the
first
meeting
she
rummaged
in
her
bag
and
produced
parchment
and
a
quill
then
hesitated
rather
as
though
she
was
steeling
herself
to
say
something
i
I
think
everybody
should
write
their
name
down
just
so
we
know
who
was
here
but
I
also
think
she
took
a
deep
breath
that
we
all
ought
to
agree
not
to
shout
about
what
were
doing
so
if
you
sign
youre
agreeing
not
to
tell
Umbridge
or
anybody
else
what
were
up
to
fred
reached
out
for
the
parchment
and
cheerfully
wrote
his
signature
but
Harry
noticed
at
once
that
several
people
looked
less
than
happy
at
the
prospect
of
putting
their
names
on
the
list
er
said
Zacharias
slowly
not
taking
the
parchment
that
George
was
trying
to
pass
to
him
well
im
sure
Ernie
will
tell
me
when
the
meeting
is
but
Ernie
was
looking
rather
hesitant
about
signing
too
hermione
raised
her
eyebrows
at
him
i
well
we
are
prefects
Ernie
burst
out
and
if
this
list
was
found
well
I
mean
to
say
you
said
yourself
if
Umbridge
finds
out
you
just
said
this
group
was
the
most
important
thing
youd
do
this
year
Harry
reminded
him
i
yes
said
Ernie
yes
I
do
believe
that
it
s
just
ernie
do
you
really
think
Id
leave
that
list
lying
around
said
Hermione
testily
no.
No
of
course
not
said
Ernie
looking
slightly
less
anxious
i
yes
of
course
Ill
sign
nobody
raised
objections
after
Ernie
though
Harry
saw
Chos
friend
give
her
a
rather
reproachful
look
before
adding
her
own
name
when
the
last
person
Zacharias
had
signed
hermione
took
the
parchment
back
and
slipped
it
carefully
into
her
bag
there
was
an
odd
feeling
in
the
group
now
it
was
as
though
they
had
just
signed
some
kind
of
contract
well
times
ticking
on
said
Fred
briskly
getting
to
his
feet
george
Lee
and
I
have
got
items
of
a
sensitive
nature
to
purchase
well
be
seeing
you
all
later
in
twos
and
threes
the
rest
of
the
group
took
their
leave
too
cho
made
rather
a
business
of
fastening
the
catch
on
her
bag
before
leaving
her
long
dark
curtain
of
hair
swinging
forwards
to
hide
her
face
but
her
friend
stood
beside
her
arms
folded
clicking
her
tongue
so
that
Cho
had
little
choice
but
to
leave
with
her
as
her
friend
ushered
her
through
the
door
Cho
looked
back
and
waved
at
Harry
well
I
think
that
went
quite
well
said
Hermione
happily
as
she
Harry
and
Ron
walked
out
of
the
Hogs
Head
into
the
bright
sunlight
a
few
moments
later
harry
and
Ron
were
clutching
their
bottles
of
Butterbeer
that
Zacharias
blokes
a
wart
said
Ron
who
was
glowering
after
the
figure
of
Smith
just
discernible
in
the
distance
i
dont
like
him
much
either
admitted
Hermione
but
he
overheard
me
talking
to
Ernie
and
hannah
at
the
Hufflepuff
table
and
he
seemed
really
interested
in
coming
so
what
could
I
say
but
the
more
people
the
better
really
I
mean
Michael
Corner
and
his
friends
wouldnt
have
come
if
he
hadnt
been
going
out
with
Ginny
ron
who
had
been
draining
the
last
few
drops
from
his
Butterbeer
bottle
gagged
and
sprayed
butterbeer
down
his
front
hes
what
spluttered
Ron
outraged
his
ears
now
resembling
curls
of
raw
beef
shes
going
out
with
my
sisters
going
what
dyou
mean
Michael
Corner
well
thats
why
he
and
his
friends
came
I
think
well
theyre
obviously
interested
in
learning
defense
but
if
Ginny
hadnt
told
Michael
what
was
going
on
when
did
this
when
did
she
they
met
at
the
Yule
Ball
and
got
together
at
the
end
of
last
year
said
Hermione
composedly
they
had
turned
into
the
High
Street
and
she
paused
outside
Scrivenshafts
Quill
Shop
where
there
was
a
handsome
display
of
pheasant
feather
quills
in
the
window
hmm
i
could
do
with
a
new
quill
she
turned
into
the
shop
harry
and
Ron
followed
her
which
one
was
Michael
Corner
ron
demanded
furiously
the
dark
one
said
Hermione
i
didnt
like
him
said
Ron
at
once
big
surprise
said
Hermione
under
her
breath
but
said
Ron
following
Hermione
along
a
row
of
quills
in
copper
pots
I
thought
Ginny
fancied
Harry
hermione
looked
at
him
rather
pityingly
and
shook
her
head
ginny
used
to
fancy
Harry
but
she
gave
up
on
him
months
ago
not
that
she
doesnt
like
you
of
course
she
added
kindly
to
Harry
while
she
examined
a
long
black
and
gold
quill
harry
whose
head
was
still
full
of
Chos
parting
wave
did
not
find
this
subject
quite
as
interesting
as
Ron
who
was
positively
quivering
with
indignation
but
it
did
bring
something
home
to
him
that
until
now
he
had
not
really
registered
so
thats
why
she
talks
now
he
asked
Hermione
she
never
used
to
talk
in
front
of
me
exactly
said
Hermione
yes
I
think
Ill
have
this
one
she
went
up
to
the
counter
and
handed
over
fifteen
Sickles
and
two
Knuts
with
Ron
still
breathing
down
her
neck
ron
she
said
severely
as
she
turned
and
trod
on
his
feet
this
is
exactly
why
Ginny
hasnt
told
you
shes
seeing
Michael
she
knew
youd
take
it
badly
so
dont
harp
on
about
it
for
heavens
sake
what
dyou
mean
whos
taking
anything
badly
im
not
going
to
harp
on
about
anything
ron
continued
to
chunter
under
his
breath
all
the
way
down
the
street
hermione
rolled
her
eyes
at
Harry
and
then
said
in
an
undertone
while
Ron
was
still
muttering
imprecations
about
Michael
Corner
And
talking
about
Michael
and
Ginny
what
about
Cho
and
you
what
dyou
mean
said
Harry
quickly
it
was
as
though
boiling
water
was
rising
rapidly
inside
him
a
burning
sensation
that
was
causing
his
face
to
smart
in
the
cold
had
he
been
that
obvious
well
said
Hermione
smiling
slightly
she
just
couldnt
keep
her
eyes
off
you
could
she
harry
had
never
before
appreciated
just
how
beautiful
the
village
of
Hogsmeade
was
chapter
seventeen
educational
Decree
Number
Twenty-Four
harry
felt
happier
for
the
rest
of
the
weekend
than
he
had
done
all
term
he
and
Ron
spent
much
of
Sunday
catching
up
with
all
their
homework
again
and
although
this
could
hardly
be
called
fun
the
last
burst
of
autumn
sunshine
persisted
so
rather
than
sitting
hunched
over
tables
in
the
common
room
they
took
their
work
outside
and
lounged
in
the
shade
of
a
large
beech
tree
on
the
edge
of
the
lake
hermione
who
of
course
was
up
to
date
with
all
her
work
brought
more
wool
outside
with
her
and
bewitched
her
knitting
needles
so
that
they
flashed
and
clicked
in
midair
beside
her
producing
more
hats
and
scarves
knowing
they
were
doing
something
to
resist
Umbridge
and
the
Ministry
and
that
he
was
a
key
part
of
the
rebellion
gave
Harry
a
feeling
of
immense
satisfaction
he
kept
reliving
Saturdays
meeting
in
his
mind
all
those
people
coming
to
him
to
learn
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
and
the
looks
on
their
faces
as
they
had
heard
some
of
the
things
he
had
done
and
Cho
praising
his
performance
in
the
Triwizard
Tournament
The
knowledge
that
all
those
people
did
not
think
him
a
lying
weirdo
but
someone
to
be
admired
buoyed
him
up
so
much
that
he
was
still
cheerful
on
Monday
morning
despite
the
imminent
prospect
of
all
his
least
favorite
classes
he
and
Ron
headed
downstairs
from
their
dormitory
discussing
Angelinas
idea
that
they
were
to
work
on
a
new
move
called
the
Sloth
Grip
Roll
during
that
nights
Quidditch
practice
and
not
until
they
were
halfway
across
the
sunlit
common
room
did
they
notice
the
addition
to
the
room
that
had
already
attracted
the
attention
of
a
small
group
of
people
a
large
sign
had
been
affixed
to
the
Gryffindor
noticeboard
so
large
it
covered
everything
else
on
it
the
lists
of
secondhand
spellbooks
for
sale
the
regular
reminders
of
school
rules
from
argus
Filch
the
Quidditch
team
training
timetable
the
offers
to
barter
certain
Chocolate
Frog
cards
for
others
the
Weasleys
latest
advertisement
for
testers
the
dates
of
the
Hogsmeade
weekends
and
the
lost
and
found
notices
the
new
sign
was
printed
in
large
black
letters
and
there
was
a
highly
official-looking
seal
at
the
bottom
beside
a
neat
and
curly
signature
by
order
of
the
high
inquisitor
of
hogwarts

Umbridge

harry
and
Ron
read
the
notice
over
the
heads
of
some
anxious-looking
second-years
does
this
mean
theyre
going
to
shut
down
the
Gobstones
Club
one
of
them
asked
his
friend
i
reckon
youll
be
okay
with
Gobstones
Ron
said
darkly
making
the
second-year
jump
i
dont
think
were
going
to
be
as
lucky
though
do
you
he
asked
Harry
as
the
second-years
hurried
away
harry
was
reading
the
notice
through
again
the
happiness
that
had
filled
him
since
Saturday
was
gone
his
insides
were
pulsing
with
rage
this
isnt
a
coincidence
he
said
his
hands
forming
fists
she
knows
she
cant
said
Ron
at
once
there
were
people
listening
in
that
pub
and
lets
face
it
we
dont
know
how
many
of
the
people
who
turned
up
we
can
trust
any
of
them
could
have
run
off
and
told
Umbridge
and
he
had
thought
they
believed
him
thought
they
even
admired
him
zacharias
Smith
said
Ron
at
once
punching
a
fist
into
his
hand
or
I
thought
that
Michael
corner
had
a
really
shifty
look
too
i
wonder
if
Hermiones
seen
this
yet
harry
said
looking
round
at
the
door
to
the
girls
dormitories
lets
go
and
tell
her
said
Ron
he
bounded
forwards
pulled
open
the
door
and
set
off
up
the
spiral
staircase
he
was
on
the
sixth
stair
when
there
was
a
loud
wailing
klaxon-like
sound
and
the
steps
melted
together
to
make
a
long
smooth
stone
slid
there
was
a
brief
moment
when
Ron
tried
to
keep
running
arms
working
madly
like
windmills
then
he
toppled
over
backwards
and
shot
down
the
newly
created
slide
coming
to
rest
on
his
back
at
Harrys
feet
er
I
dont
think
were
allowed
in
the
girls
dormitories
said
Harry
pulling
Ron
to
his
feet
and
trying
not
to
laugh
two
fourth-year
girls
came
zooming
gleefully
down
the
stone
slide
oooh
who
tried
to
get
upstairs
they
giggled
happily
leaping
to
their
feet
and
ogling
Harry
and
Ron
me
said
Ron
who
was
still
rather
disheveled
i
didnt
realize
that
would
happen
its
not
fair
he
added
to
Harry
as
the
girls
headed
off
for
the
portrait
hole
still
giggling
madly
hermiones
allowed
in
our
dormitory
how
come
were
not
allowed
well
its
an
old-fashioned
rule
said
Hermione
who
had
just
slid
neatly
on
to
a
rug
in
front
of
them
and
was
now
getting
to
her
feet
but
it
says
in
Hogwarts
A
History
that
the
founders
thought
boys
were
less
trustworthy
than
girls
anyway
why
were
you
trying
to
get
in
there
to
see
you
look
at
this
said
Ron
dragging
her
over
to
the
noticeboard
hermiones
eyes
slid
rapidly
down
the
notice
her
expression
became
stony
someone
must
have
blabbed
to
her
ron
said
angrily
they
cant
have
done
said
Hermione
in
a
low
voice
youre
so
naive
said
Ron
you
think
just
because
youre
all
honorable
and
trustworthy
no
they
cant
have
done
because
I
put
a
jinx
on
that
piece
of
parchment
we
all
signed
said
hermione
grimly
believe
me
if
anyones
run
off
and
told
Umbridge
well
know
exactly
who
they
are
and
they
will
really
regret
it
whatll
happen
to
them
said
Ron
eagerly
well
put
it
this
way
said
Hermione
itll
make
Eloise
Midgeons
acne
look
like
a
couple
of
cute
freckles
come
on
lets
get
down
to
breakfast
and
see
what
the
others
think
i
wonder
whether
this
has
been
put
up
in
all
the
houses
it
was
immediately
apparent
on
entering
the
Great
Hall
that
Umbridges
sign
had
not
only
appeared
in
Gryffindor
Tower
there
was
a
peculiar
intensity
about
the
chatter
and
an
extra
measure
of
movement
in
the
Hall
as
people
scurried
up
and
down
their
tables
conferring
on
what
they
had
read
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
had
barely
taken
their
seats
when
Neville
Dean
Fred
george
and
Ginny
descended
upon
them
did
you
see
it
dyou
reckon
she
knows
what
are
we
going
to
do
they
were
all
looking
at
Harry
he
glanced
around
to
make
sure
there
were
no
teachers
near
them
were
going
to
do
it
anyway
of
course
he
said
quietly
knew
youd
say
that
said
George
beaming
and
thumping
Harry
on
the
arm
the
prefects
as
well
said
Fred
looking
quizzically
at
Ron
and
Hermione
of
course
said
Hermione
coolly
here
come
Ernie
and
Hannah
Abbott
said
Ron
looking
over
his
shoulder
and
those
ravenclaw
blokes
and
Smith
and
no
one
looks
very
spotty
hermione
looked
alarmed
nevermind
spots
the
idiots
cant
come
over
here
now
itll
look
really
suspicious
sit
down
she
mouthed
to
Ernie
and
Hannah
gesturing
frantically
to
them
to
rejoin
the
Hufflepuff
table
later
well
talk
to
you
later
ill
tell
Michael
said
Ginny
impatiently
swinging
herself
off
her
bench
the
fool
honestly
she
hurried
off
towards
the
Ravenclaw
table
Harry
watched
her
go
cho
was
sitting
not
far
away
talking
to
the
curly-haired
friend
she
had
brought
along
to
the
Hogs
Head
would
umbridges
notice
scare
her
off
meeting
them
again
but
the
full
repercussions
of
the
sign
were
not
felt
until
they
were
leaving
the
Great
Hall
for
history
of
Magic
harry
ron
it
was
Angelina
and
she
was
hurrying
towards
them
looking
perfectly
desperate
its
okay
said
Harry
quietly
when
she
was
near
enough
to
hear
him
were
still
going
to
you
realize
shes
including
Quidditch
in
this
angelina
said
over
him
we
have
to
go
and
ask
permission
to
re-form
the
Gryffindor
team
what
said
Harry
no
way
said
Ron
appalled
you
read
the
sign
it
mentions
teams
too
so
listen
Harry
i
am
saying
this
for
the
last
time
please
please
dont
lose
your
temper
with
Umbridge
again
or
she
might
not
let
us
play
any
more
okayokay
said
Harry
for
Angelina
looked
as
though
she
was
on
the
verge
of
tears
dont
worry
Ill
behave
myself
bet
Umbridge
is
in
History
of
Magic
said
Ron
grimly
as
they
set
off
for
Binnss
lesson
she
hasnt
inspected
Binns
yet
bet
you
anything
shes
there
but
he
was
wrong
the
only
teacher
present
when
they
entered
was
Professor
Binns
floating
an
inch
or
so
above
his
chair
as
usual
and
preparing
to
continue
his
monotonous
drone
on
giant
wars
harry
did
not
even
attempt
to
follow
what
he
was
saying
today
he
doodled
idly
on
his
parchment
ignoring
Hermiones
frequent
glares
and
nudges
until
a
particularly
painful
poke
in
the
ribs
made
him
look
up
angrily
what
she
pointed
at
the
window
harry
looked
round
hedwig
was
perched
on
the
narrow
window
ledge
gazing
through
the
thick
glass
at
him
a
letter
tied
to
her
leg
harry
could
not
understand
it
they
had
just
had
breakfast
why
on
earth
hadnt
she
delivered
the
letter
then
as
usual
many
of
his
classmates
were
pointing
out
Hedwig
to
each
other
too
oh
Ive
always
loved
that
owl
shes
so
beautiful
Harry
heard
Lavender
sigh
to
Parvati
he
glanced
round
at
Professor
Binns
who
continued
to
read
his
notes
serenely
unaware
that
the
classs
attention
was
even
less
focused
upon
him
than
usual
harry
slipped
quietly
off
his
chair
crouched
down
and
hurried
along
the
row
to
the
window
where
he
slid
the
catch
and
opened
it
very
slowly
he
had
expected
Hedwig
to
hold
out
her
leg
so
that
he
could
remove
the
letter
and
then
fly
off
to
the
Owlery
but
the
moment
the
window
was
open
wide
enough
she
hopped
inside
hooting
dolefully
he
closed
the
window
with
an
anxious
glance
at
Professor
Binns
crouched
low
again
and
sped
back
to
his
seat
with
Hedwig
on
his
shoulder
he
regained
his
seat
transferred
Hedwig
to
his
lap
and
made
to
remove
the
letter
tied
to
her
leg
only
then
did
he
realize
that
Hedwigs
feathers
were
oddly
ruffled
some
were
bent
the
wrong
way
and
she
was
holding
one
of
her
wings
at
an
odd
angle
shes
hurt
harry
whispered
bending
his
head
low
over
her
hermione
and
Ron
leaned
in
closer
Hermione
even
put
down
her
quill
look
theres
something
wrong
with
her
wing
hedwig
was
quivering
when
Harry
made
to
touch
the
wing
she
gave
a
little
jump
all
her
feathers
on
end
as
though
she
was
inflating
herself
and
gazed
at
him
reproachfully
professor
Binns
said
Harry
loudly
and
everyone
in
the
class
turned
to
look
at
him
im
not
feeling
well
professor
Binns
raised
his
eyes
from
his
notes
looking
amazed
as
always
to
find
the
room
in
front
of
him
full
of
people
not
feeling
well
he
repeated
hazily
not
at
all
well
said
Harry
firmly
getting
to
his
feet
with
Hedwig
concealed
behind
his
back
think
I
need
to
go
to
the
hospital
wing
yes
said
Professor
Binns
clearly
very
much
wrong-footed
yes
yes
hospital
wing
well
off
you
go
then
Perkins
once
outside
the
room
Harry
returned
Hedwig
to
his
shoulder
and
hurried
off
up
the
corridor
pausing
to
think
only
when
he
was
out
of
sight
of
Binnss
door
his
first
choice
of
somebody
to
cure
Hedwig
would
have
been
Hagrid
of
course
but
as
he
had
no
idea
where
Hagrid
was
his
only
remaining
option
was
to
find
Professor
Grubbly-Plank
and
hope
she
would
help
he
peered
out
of
a
window
at
the
blustery
overcast
grounds
there
was
no
sign
of
her
anywhere
near
Hagrids
cabin
if
she
was
not
teaching
she
was
probably
in
the
staff
room
he
set
off
downstairs
Hedwig
hooting
feebly
as
she
swayed
on
his
shoulder
two
stone
gargoyles
flanked
the
staff-room
door
as
Harry
approached
one
of
them
croaked
you
should
be
in
class
Sonny
Jim
this
is
urgent
said
Harry
curtly
ooooh
urgent
is
it
said
the
other
gargoyle
in
a
high-pitched
voice
well
thats
put
us
in
our
place
hasnt
it
harry
knocked
he
heard
footsteps
then
the
door
opened
and
he
found
himself
face
to
face
with
professor
McGonagall
you
havent
been
given
another
detention
she
said
at
once
her
square
spectacles
flashing
alarmingly
no
Professor
said
Harry
hastily
well
then
why
are
you
out
of
class
its
urgent
apparently
said
the
second
gargoyle
snidely
im
looking
for
Professor
Grubbly-Plank
Harry
explained
its
my
owl
shes
injured
injured
owl
did
you
say
professor
Grubbly-Plank
appeared
at
Professor
McGonagalls
shoulder
smoking
a
pipe
and
holding
a
copy
of
the
Daily
Prophet
yes
said
Harry
lifting
Hedwig
carefully
off
his
shoulder
she
turned
up
after
the
other
post
owls
and
her
wings
all
funny
look
professor
Grubbly-Plank
stuck
her
pipe
firmly
between
her
teeth
and
took
Hedwig
from
Harry
while
Professor
McGonagall
watched
hmm
said
Professor
Grubbly-Plank
her
pipe
waggling
slightly
as
she
talked
looks
like
somethings
attacked
her
cant
think
what
would
have
done
it
though
thestrals
will
sometimes
go
for
birds
of
course
but
Hagrids
got
the
Hogwarts
Thestrals
well-trained
not
to
touch
owls
harry
neither
knew
nor
cared
what
Thestrals
were
he
just
wanted
to
know
that
Hedwig
was
going
to
be
all
right
professor
McGonagall
however
looked
sharply
at
Harry
and
said
Do
you
know
how
far
this
owls
traveled
Potter
er
said
Harry
from
London
I
think
he
met
her
eyes
briefly
and
knew
by
the
way
her
eyebrows
had
joined
in
the
middle
that
she
understood
London
to
mean
number
twelve
Grimmauld
Place
professor
Grubbly-Plank
pulled
a
monocle
out
of
the
inside
of
her
robes
and
screwed
it
into
her
eye
to
examine
Hedwigs
wing
closely
i
should
be
able
to
sort
this
out
if
you
leave
her
with
me
Potter
she
said
she
shouldnt
be
flying
long
distances
for
a
few
days
in
any
case
er
right
thanks
said
Harry
just
as
the
bell
rang
for
break
no
problem
said
Professor
Grubbly-Plank
gruffly
turning
back
into
the
staff
room
just
a
moment
Wilhelmina
said
Professor
McGonagall
potters
letter
oh
yeah
said
Harry
who
had
momentarily
forgotten
the
scroll
tied
to
Hedwigs
leg
professor
grubbly-Plank
handed
it
over
and
then
disappeared
into
the
staff
room
carrying
Hedwig
who
was
staring
at
Harry
as
though
unable
to
believe
he
would
give
her
away
like
this
feeling
slightly
guilty
he
turned
to
go
but
Professor
McGonagall
called
him
back
potter
yes
Professor
she
glanced
up
and
down
the
corridor
there
were
students
coming
from
both
directions
bear
in
mind
she
said
quickly
and
quietly
her
eyes
on
the
scroll
in
his
hand
that
channels
of
communication
in
and
out
of
Hogwarts
may
be
being
watched
wont
you
i
said
Harry
but
the
flood
of
students
rolling
along
the
corridor
was
almost
upon
him
professor
McGonagall
gave
him
a
curt
nod
and
retreated
into
the
staff
room
leaving
Harry
to
be
swept
out
into
the
courtyard
with
the
crowd
he
spotted
Ron
and
Hermione
already
standing
in
a
sheltered
corner
their
cloak
collars
turned
up
against
the
wind
harry
slit
open
the
scroll
as
he
hurried
towards
them
and
found
five
words
in
Siriuss
handwriting
today
same
time
same
place
is
Hedwig
okay
asked
Hermione
anxiously
the
moment
he
was
within
earshot
where
did
you
take
her
asked
Ron
to
Grubbly-Plank
said
Harry
and
I
met
McGonagall
listen
and
he
told
them
what
Professor
McGonagall
had
said
to
his
surprise
neither
of
the
others
looked
shocked
on
the
contrary
they
exchanged
significant
looks
what
said
Harry
looking
from
Ron
to
Hermione
and
back
again
well
I
was
just
saying
to
Ron
what
if
someone
had
tried
to
intercept
Hedwig
i
mean
shes
never
been
hurt
on
a
flight
before
has
she
whos
the
letter
from
anyway
asked
Ron
taking
the
note
from
Harry
snuffles
said
Harry
quietly
same
time
same
place
does
he
mean
the
fire
in
the
common
room
obviously
said
Hermione
also
reading
the
note
she
looked
uneasy
i
just
hope
nobody
else
has
read
this
but
it
was
still
sealed
and
everything
said
Harry
trying
to
convince
himself
as
much
as
her
and
nobody
would
understand
what
it
meant
if
they
didnt
know
where
wed
spoken
to
him
before
would
they
i
dont
know
said
Hermione
anxiously
hitching
h
er
bag
back
over
her
shoulder
as
the
bell
rang
again
it
wouldnt
be
exactly
difficult
to
re-seal
the
scroll
by
magic
and
if
anyones
watching
the
Floo
Network
but
I
dont
really
see
how
we
can
warn
him
not
to
come
without
that
being
intercepted
too
they
trudged
down
the
stone
steps
to
the
dungeons
for
Potions
all
three
of
them
lost
in
thought
but
as
they
reached
the
bottom
of
the
steps
they
were
recalled
to
themselves
by
the
voice
of
draco
Malfoy
who
was
standing
just
outside
Snapes
classroom
door
waving
around
an
official
looking
piece
of
parchment
and
talking
much
louder
than
was
necessary
so
that
they
could
hear
every
word
yeah
Umbridge
gave
the
Slytherin
Quidditch
team
permission
to
continue
playing
straightaway
I
went
to
ask
her
first
thing
this
morning
well
it
was
pretty
much
automatic
I
mean
she
knows
my
father
really
well
hes
always
popping
in
and
out
of
the
Ministry
itll
be
interesting
to
see
whether
Gryffindor
are
allowed
to
keep
playing
wont
it
dont
rise
Hermione
whispered
imploringly
to
Harry
and
Ron
who
were
both
watching
malfoy
faces
set
and
fists
clenched
its
what
he
wants
i
mean
said
Malfoy
raising
his
voice
a
little
more
his
grey
eyes
glittering
malevolently
in
harry
and
Rons
direction
if
its
a
question
of
influence
with
the
Ministry
I
dont
think
theyve
got
much
chance
from
what
my
father
says
theyve
been
looking
for
an
excuse
to
sack
Arthur
weasley
for
years
and
as
for
Potter
my
father
says
its
a
matter
of
time
before
the
Ministry
has
him
carted
off
to
st.
Mungos
apparently
theyve
got
a
special
ward
for
people
whose
brains
have
been
addled
by
magic
malfoy
made
a
grotesque
face
his
mouth
sagging
open
and
his
eyes
rolling
crabbe
and
Goyle
gave
their
usual
grunts
of
laughter
Pansy
Parkinson
shrieked
with
glee
something
collided
hard
with
Harrys
shoulder
knocking
him
sideways
a
split
second
later
he
realized
that
Neville
had
just
charged
past
him
heading
straight
for
Malfoy
neville
no
harry
leapt
forward
and
seized
the
back
of
Nevilles
robes
Neville
struggled
frantically
his
fists
flailing
trying
desperately
to
get
at
Malfoy
who
looked
for
a
moment
extremely
shocked
help
me
harry
flung
at
Ron
managing
to
get
an
arm
around
Nevilles
neck
and
dragging
him
backwards
away
from
the
Slytherins
crabbe
and
Goyle
were
flexing
their
arms
as
they
stepped
in
front
of
Malfoy
ready
for
the
fight
ron
seized
Nevilles
arms
and
together
he
and
Harry
succeeded
in
dragging
Neville
back
into
the
Gryffindor
line
nevilles
face
was
scarlet
the
pressure
Harry
was
exerting
on
his
throat
rendered
him
quite
incomprehensible
but
odd
words
spluttered
from
his
mouth
not
funny
dont
mungos
show
him
the
dungeon
door
opened
snape
appeared
there
his
black
eyes
swept
up
the
Gryffindor
line
to
the
point
where
Harry
and
Ron
were
wrestling
with
Neville
fighting
Potter
Weasley
Longbottom
snape
said
in
his
cold
sneering
voice
ten
points
from
Gryffindor
release
Longbottom
Potter
or
it
will
be
detention
inside
all
of
you
harry
let
go
of
Neville
who
stood
panting
and
glaring
at
him
i
had
to
stop
you
Harry
gasped
picking
up
his
bag
crabbe
and
Goyle
wouldve
torn
you
apart
neville
said
nothing
he
merely
snatched
up
his
own
bag
and
stalked
off
into
the
dungeon
what
in
the
name
of
Merlin
said
Ron
slowly
as
they
followed
Neville
was
that
about
harry
did
not
answer
he
knew
exactly
why
the
subject
of
people
who
were
in
st.
Mungos
because
of
magical
damage
to
their
brains
was
highly
distressing
to
Neville
but
he
had
sworn
to
dumbledore
that
he
would
not
tell
anyone
Nevilles
secret
even
Neville
did
not
know
Harry
knew
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
took
their
usual
seats
at
the
back
of
the
class
pulled
out
parchment
quills
and
their
copies
of
One
Thousand
Magical
Herb
s
and
Fungi
the
class
around
them
was
whispering
about
what
Neville
had
just
done
but
when
Snape
closed
the
dungeon
door
with
an
echoing
bang
everybody
immediately
fell
silent
you
will
notice
said
Snape
in
his
low
sneering
voice
that
we
have
a
guest
with
us
today
he
gestured
towards
the
dim
corner
of
the
dungeon
and
Harry
saw
Professor
Umbridge
sitting
there
clipboard
on
her
knee
he
glanced
sideways
at
Ron
and
Hermione
his
eyebrows
raised
snape
and
Umbridge
the
two
teachers
he
hated
most
it
was
hard
to
decide
which
one
he
wanted
to
triumph
over
the
other
we
are
continuing
with
our
Strengthening
Solution
today
you
will
find
your
mixtures
as
you
left
them
last
lesson
if
correctly
made
they
should
have
matured
well
over
the
weekend
instructions
he
waved
his
wand
again
on
the
board
carry
on
professor
Umbridge
spent
the
first
half
hour
of
the
lesson
making
notes
in
her
corner
harry
was
very
interested
in
hearing
her
question
Snape
so
interested
that
he
was
becoming
careless
with
his
potion
again
salamander
blood
Harry
hermione
moaned
grabbing
his
wrist
to
prevent
him
adding
the
wrong
ingredient
for
the
third
time
not
pomegranate
juice
right
said
Harry
vaguely
putting
down
the
bottle
and
continuing
to
watch
the
corner
umbridge
had
just
got
to
her
feet
ha
he
said
softly
as
she
strode
between
two
lines
of
desks
towards
Snape
who
was
bending
over
Dean
Thomass
cauldron
well
the
class
seem
fairly
advanced
for
their
level
she
said
briskly
to
Snapes
back
though
I
would
question
whether
it
is
advisable
to
teach
them
a
potion
like
the
Strengthening
Solution
think
the
Ministry
would
prefer
it
if
that
was
removed
from
the
syllabus
snape
straightened
up
slowly
and
turned
to
look
at
her
now
how
long
have
you
been
teaching
at
Hogwarts
she
asked
her
quill
poised
over
her
clipboard
fourteen
years
Snape
replied
his
expression
was
unfathomable
harry
watching
him
closely
added
a
few
drops
to
his
potion
it
hissed
menacingly
and
turned
from
turquoise
to
orange
you
applied
first
for
the
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
post
I
believe
professor
Umbridge
asked
Snape
yes
said
Snape
quietly
but
you
were
unsuccessful
snapes
lip
curled
obviously
professor
Umbridge
scribbled
on
her
clipboard
and
you
have
applied
regularly
for
the
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
post
since
you
first
joined
the
school
I
believe
yes
said
Snape
quietly
barely
moving
his
lips
he
looked
very
angry
do
you
have
any
idea
why
Dumbledore
has
consistently
refused
to
appoint
you
asked
umbridge
i
suggest
you
ask
him
said
Snape
jerkily
oh
I
shall
said
Professor
Umbridge
with
a
sweet
smile
i
suppose
this
is
relevant
snape
asked
his
black
eyes
narrowed
oh
yes
said
Professor
Umbridge
yes
the
Ministry
wants
a
thorough
understanding
of
teachers
er
backgrounds
she
turned
away
walked
over
to
Pansy
Parkinson
and
began
questioning
her
about
the
lessons
snape
looked
round
at
Harry
and
their
eyes
met
for
a
second
harry
hastily
dropped
his
gaze
to
his
potion
which
was
now
congealing
foully
and
giving
off
a
strong
smell
of
burned
rubber
no
marks
again
then
Potter
said
Snape
maliciously
emptying
Harrys
cauldron
with
a
wave
of
his
wand
you
will
write
me
an
essay
on
the
correct
composition
of
this
potion
indicating
how
and
why
you
went
wrong
to
be
handed
in
next
lesson
do
you
understand
yes
said
Harry
furiously
snape
had
already
given
them
homework
and
he
had
Quidditch
practice
this
evening
this
would
mean
another
couple
of
sleepless
nights
it
did
not
seem
possible
that
he
had
awoken
that
morning
feeling
very
happy
all
he
felt
now
was
a
fervent
desire
for
this
day
to
end
maybe
Ill
skive
off
Divination
he
said
glumly
as
they
stood
in
the
courtyard
after
lunch
the
wind
whipping
at
the
hems
of
robes
and
brims
of
hats
ill
pretend
to
be
ill
and
do
Snapes
essay
instead
then
I
wont
have
to
stay
up
half
the
night
you
cant
skive
off
Divination
said
Hermione
severely
hark
whos
talking
you
walked
out
of
Divination
you
hate
Trelawney
said
Ron
indignantly
i
dont
hate
her
said
Hermione
loftily
i
just
think
shes
an
absolutely
appalling
teacher
and
a
real
old
fraud
but
Harrys
already
missed
History
of
Magic
and
I
dont
think
he
ought
to
miss
anything
else
today
there
was
too
much
truth
in
this
to
ignore
so
half
an
hour
later
Harry
took
his
seat
in
the
hot
overperfumed
atmosphere
of
the
Divination
classroom
feeling
angry
at
everybody
professor
trelawney
was
yet
again
handing
out
copies
of
The
Dream
Oracle
harry
thought
hed
surely
be
much
better
employed
doing
Snapes
punishment
essay
than
sitting
here
trying
to
find
meaning
in
a
lot
of
made-up
dreams
it
seemed
however
that
he
was
not
the
only
person
in
Divination
who
was
in
a
temper
professor
Trelawney
slammed
a
copy
of
the
Oracle
down
on
the
table
between
Harry
and
Ron
and
swept
away
her
lips
pursed
she
threw
the
next
copy
of
the
Oracle
at
Seamus
and
Dean
narrowly
avoiding
Seamuss
head
and
thrust
the
final
one
into
Nevilles
chest
with
such
force
that
he
slipped
off
his
pouffe
well
carry
on
said
Professor
Trelawney
loudly
her
voice
high-pitched
and
somewhat
hysterical
you
know
what
to
do
or
am
I
such
a
sub-standard
teacher
that
you
have
never
learned
how
to
open
a
book
the
class
stared
perplexedly
at
her
then
at
each
other
harry
however
thought
he
knew
what
was
the
matter
as
Professor
Trelawney
flounced
back
to
the
high-backed
teachers
chair
her
magnified
eyes
full
of
angry
tears
he
leaned
his
head
closer
to
Rons
and
muttered
I
think
shes
got
the
results
of
her
inspection
back
professor
said
Parvati
Patil
in
a
hushed
voice
she
and
Lavender
had
always
rather
admired
professor
Trelawney
professor
is
there
anything
er
wrong
wrong
cried
Professor
Trelawney
in
a
voice
throbbing
with
emotion
certainly
not
i
have
been
insulted
certainly
insinuations
have
been
made
against
me
unfounded
accusations
leveled
but
no
there
is
nothing
wrong
certainly
not
she
took
a
great
shuddering
breath
and
looked
away
from
Parvati
angry
tears
spilling
from
under
her
glasses
i
say
nothing
she
choked
of
sixteen
years
of
devoted
service
it
has
passed
apparently
unnoticed
but
I
shall
not
be
insulted
no
I
shall
not
but
Professor
whos
insulting
you
asked
Parvati
timidly
the
Establishment
said
Professor
Trelawney
in
a
deep
dramatic
wavering
voice
yes
those
with
eyes
too
clouded
by
the
mundane
to
See
as
I
See
to
Know
as
I
Know
of
course
we
Seers
have
always
been
feared
always
persecuted
it
is
alas
our
fate
she
gulped
dabbed
at
her
wet
cheeks
with
the
end
of
her
shawl
then
she
pulled
a
small
embroidered
handkerchief
from
her
sleeve
and
blew
her
nose
very
hard
with
a
sound
like
Peeves
blowing
a
raspberry
ron
sniggered
lavender
shot
him
a
disgusted
look
professor
said
Parvati
do
you
mean
is
it
something
Professor
Umbridge
do
not
speak
to
me
about
that
woman
cried
Professor
Trelawney
leaping
to
her
feet
her
beads
rattling
and
her
spectacles
flashing
kindly
continue
with
your
work
and
she
spent
the
rest
of
the
lesson
striding
among
them
tears
still
leaking
from
behind
her
glasses
muttering
what
sounded
like
threats
under
her
breath
may
well
choose
to
leave
the
indignity
of
it
on
probation
we
shall
see
how
she
dares
you
and
Umbridge
have
got
something
in
common
Harry
told
Hermione
quietly
when
they
met
again
in
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
she
obviously
reckons
Trelawneys
an
old
fraud
too
looks
like
shes
put
her
on
probation
umbridge
entered
the
room
as
he
spoke
wearing
her
black
velvet
bow
and
an
expression
of
great
smugness
good
afternoon
class
good
afternoon
Professor
Umbridge
they
chanted
dully
wands
away
please
but
there
was
no
answering
flurry
of
movement
this
time
nobody
had
bothered
to
take
out
their
wands
please
turn
to
page
thirty-four
of
Defensive
Magical
Theory
and
read
the
third
chapter
entitled
case
for
Non-Offensive
Responses
to
Magical
Attack
there
will
be
no
need
to
talk
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
said
together
under
their
breaths
no
Quidditch
practice
said
Angelina
in
hollow
tones
when
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
entered
the
common
room
after
dinner
that
night
but
I
kept
my
temper
said
Harry
horrified
i
didnt
say
anything
to
her
Angelina
I
swear
I
i
know
I
know
said
Angelina
miserably
she
just
said
she
needed
a
bit
of
time
to
consider
consider
what
said
Ron
angrily
shes
given
the
Slytherins
permission
why
not
us
but
Harry
could
imagine
how
much
Umbridge
was
enjoying
holding
the
threat
of
no
Gryffindor
quidditch
team
over
their
heads
and
could
easily
understand
why
she
would
not
want
to
relinquish
that
weapon
over
them
too
soon
well
said
Hermione
look
on
the
bright
side
at
least
now
youll
have
time
to
do
Snapes
essay
thats
a
bright
side
is
it
snapped
Harry
while
Ron
stared
incredulously
at
Hermione
no
quidditch
practice
and
extra
Potions
harry
slumped
down
into
a
chair
dragged
his
Potions
essay
reluctantly
from
his
bag
and
set
to
work
it
was
very
hard
to
concentrate
even
though
he
knew
Sirius
was
not
due
in
the
fire
until
much
later
he
could
not
help
glancing
into
the
flames
every
few
minutes
just
in
case
there
was
also
an
incredible
amount
of
noise
in
the
room
Fred
and
George
appeared
finally
to
have
perfected
one
type
of
Skiving
Snackbox
which
they
were
taking
turns
to
demonstrate
to
a
cheering
and
whooping
crowd
first
Fred
would
take
a
bite
out
of
the
orange
end
of
a
chew
at
which
he
would
vomit
spectacularly
into
a
bucket
they
had
placed
in
front
of
them
then
he
would
force
down
the
purple
end
of
the
chew
at
which
the
vomiting
would
immediately
cease
lee
Jordan
who
was
assisting
the
demonstration
was
lazily
Vanishing
the
vomit
at
regular
intervals
with
the
same
vanishing
Spell
Snape
kept
using
on
Harrys
potions
what
with
the
regular
sounds
of
retching
cheering
and
the
sound
of
Fred
and
George
taking
advance
orders
from
the
crowd
Harry
was
finding
it
exceptionally
difficult
to
focus
on
the
correct
method
for
Strengthening
Solution
hermione
was
not
helping
matters
the
cheers
and
the
sound
of
vomit
hitting
the
bottom
of
Fred
and
Georges
bucket
were
punctuated
by
her
loud
and
disapproving
sniffs
which
Harry
found
if
anything
more
distracting
just
go
and
stop
them
then
he
said
irritably
after
crossing
out
the
wrong
weight
of
powdered
griffin
claw
for
the
fourth
time
i
cant
theyre
not
technically
doing
anything
wrong
said
Hermione
through
gritted
teeth
theyre
quite
within
their
rights
to
eat
the
foul
things
themselves
and
I
cant
find
a
rule
that
says
the
other
idiots
arent
entitled
to
buy
them
not
unless
theyre
proven
to
be
dangerous
in
some
way
and
it
doesnt
look
as
though
they
are
she
Harry
and
Ron
watched
George
projectile-vomit
into
the
bucket
gulp
down
the
rest
of
the
chew
and
straighten
up
beaming
with
his
arms
wide
to
protracted
applause
you
know
I
dont
get
why
Fred
and
George
only
got
three
OWLs
each
said
Harry
watching
as
Fred
George
and
Lee
collected
gold
from
the
eager
crowd
they
really
know
their
stuff
oh
they
only
know
flashy
stuff
thats
of
no
real
use
to
anyone
said
Hermione
disparagingly
no
real
use
said
Ron
in
a
strained
voice
hermione
theyve
made
about
twenty-six
Galleons
already
it
was
a
long
while
before
the
crowd
around
the
Weasley
twins
dispersed
then
Fred
Lee
and
george
sat
up
counting
their
takings
even
longer
so
it
was
well
past
midnight
when
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
finally
had
the
common
room
to
themselves
at
long
last
Fred
had
closed
the
doorway
to
the
boys
dormitories
behind
him
rattling
his
box
of
Galleons
ostentatiously
so
that
hermione
scowled
harry
who
was
making
very
little
progress
with
his
Potions
essay
decided
to
give
it
up
for
the
night
as
he
put
his
books
away
Ron
who
was
dozing
lightly
in
an
armchair
gave
a
muffled
grunt
awoke
and
looked
blearily
into
the
fire
sirius
he
said
harry
whipped
round
siriuss
untidy
dark
head
was
sitting
in
the
fire
again
hi
he
said
grinning
hi
chorused
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
all
three
kneeling
down
on
the
hearthrug
crookshanks
purred
loudly
and
approached
the
fire
trying
despite
the
heat
to
put
his
face
close
to
Siriuss
howre
things
said
Sirius
not
that
good
said
Harry
as
Hermione
pulled
Crookshanks
back
to
stop
him
singeing
his
whiskers
the
Ministrys
forced
through
another
decree
which
means
were
not
allowed
to
have
Quidditch
teams
or
secret
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
groups
said
Sirius
there
was
a
short
pause
how
did
you
know
about
that
harry
demanded
you
want
to
choose
your
meeting
places
more
carefully
said
Sirius
grinning
still
more
broadly
the
Hogs
Head
I
ask
you
well
it
was
better
than
the
Three
Broomsticks
said
Hermione
defensively
thats
always
packed
with
people
which
means
youd
have
been
harder
to
overhear
said
Sirius
youve
got
a
lot
to
learn
hermione
who
overheard
us
harry
demanded
mundungus
of
course
said
Sirius
and
when
they
all
looked
puzzled
he
laughed
he
was
the
witch
under
the
veil
that
was
Mundungus
harry
said
stunned
what
was
he
doing
in
the
Hogs
Head
what
do
you
think
he
was
doing
said
Sirius
impatiently
keeping
an
eye
on
you
of
course
im
still
being
followed
asked
Harry
angrily
yeah
you
are
said
Sirius
and
just
as
well
isnt
it
if
the
first
thing
youre
going
to
do
on
your
weekend
off
is
organize
an
illegal
defense
group
but
he
looked
neither
angry
nor
worried
on
the
contrary
he
was
looking
at
Harry
with
distinct
pride
why
was
Dung
hiding
from
us
asked
Ron
sounding
disappointed
wedve
liked
tove
seen
him
he
was
banned
from
the
Hogs
Head
twenty
years
ago
said
Sirius
and
that
barmans
got
a
long
memory
we
lost
Moodys
spare
Invisibility
Cloak
when
Sturgis
was
arrested
so
Dungs
been
dressing
as
a
witch
a
lot
lately
anyway
first
of
all
Ron
Ive
sworn
to
pass
on
a
message
from
your
mother
oh
yeah
said
Ron
sounding
apprehensive
she
says
on
no
account
whatsoever
are
you
to
take
part
in
an
illegal
secret
Defense
Against
the
dark
Arts
group
she
says
youll
be
expelled
for
sure
and
your
future
will
be
ruined
she
says
there
will
be
plenty
of
time
to
learn
how
to
defend
yourself
later
and
that
you
are
too
young
to
be
worrying
about
that
right
now
she
also
Siriuss
eyes
turned
to
the
other
two
advises
Harry
and
Hermione
not
to
proceed
with
the
group
though
she
accepts
that
she
has
no
authority
over
either
of
them
and
simply
begs
them
to
remember
that
she
has
their
best
interests
at
heart
she
would
have
written
all
this
to
you
but
if
the
owl
had
been
intercepted
youd
all
have
been
in
real
trouble
and
she
cant
say
it
for
herself
because
shes
on
duty
tonight
on
duty
doing
what
said
Ron
quickly
never
you
mind
just
stuff
for
the
Order
said
Sirius
so
its
fallen
to
me
to
be
the
messenger
and
make
sure
you
tell
her
I
passed
it
all
on
because
I
dont
think
she
trusts
me
to
there
was
another
pause
in
which
Crookshanks
mewing
attempted
to
paw
Siriuss
head
and
ron
fiddled
with
a
hole
in
the
hearthrug
so
you
want
me
to
say
Im
not
going
to
take
part
in
the
Defense
group
he
muttered
finally
me
certainly
not
said
Sirius
looking
surprised
i
think
its
an
excellent
idea
you
do
said
Harry
his
heart
lifting
of
course
I
do
said
Sirius
dyou
think
your
father
and
I
wouldve
lain
down
and
taken
orders
from
an
old
hag
like
Umbridge
but
last
term
all
you
did
was
tell
me
to
be
careful
and
not
take
risks
last
year
all
the
evidence
was
that
someone
inside
Hogwarts
was
trying
to
kill
you
Harry
said
Sirius
impatiently
this
year
we
know
theres
someone
outside
Hogwarts
whod
like
to
kill
us
all
so
I
think
learning
to
defend
yourselves
properly
is
a
very
good
idea
and
if
we
do
get
expelled
hermione
asked
a
quizzical
look
on
her
face
hermione
this
whole
thing
was
your
idea
said
Harry
staring
at
her
i
know
it
was
i
just
wondered
what
Sirius
thought
she
said
shrugging
well
better
expelled
and
able
to
defend
yourselves
than
sitting
safely
in
school
without
a
clue
said
Sirius
hear
hear
said
Harry
and
Ron
enthusiastically
so
said
Sirius
how
are
you
organizing
this
group
where
are
you
meeting
well
thats
a
bit
of
a
problem
now
said
Harry
dunno
where
were
going
to
be
able
to
go
how
about
the
Shrieking
Shack
suggested
Sirius
hey
thats
an
idea
said
Ron
excitedly
but
Hermione
made
a
skeptical
noise
and
all
three
of
them
looked
at
her
Siriuss
head
turning
in
the
flames
well
Sirius
its
just
that
there
were
only
four
of
you
meeting
in
the
Shrieking
Shack
when
you
were
at
school
said
Hermione
and
all
of
you
could
transform
into
animals
and
I
suppose
you
could
all
have
squeezed
under
a
single
Invisibility
Cloak
if
youd
wanted
to
but
there
are
twenty-eight
of
us
and
none
of
us
is
an
Animagus
so
we
wouldnt
need
so
much
an
Invisibility
cloak
as
an
Invisibility
Marquee
fair
point
said
Sirius
looking
slightly
crestfallen
well
Im
sure
youll
come
up
with
somewhere
there
used
to
be
a
pretty
roomy
secret
passageway
behind
that
big
mirror
on
the
fourth
floor
you
might
have
enough
space
to
practice
jinxes
in
there
fred
and
George
told
me
its
blocked
said
Harry
shaking
his
head
caved
in
or
something
oh
said
Sirius
frowning
well
Ill
have
a
think
and
get
back
to
he
broke
off
his
face
was
suddenly
tense
alarmed
he
turned
sideways
apparently
looking
into
the
solid
brick
wall
of
the
fireplace
sirius
said
Harry
anxiously
but
he
had
vanished
harry
gaped
at
the
flames
for
a
moment
then
turned
to
look
at
Ron
and
hermione
why
did
he
hermione
gave
a
horrified
gasp
and
leapt
to
her
feet
still
staring
at
the
fire
a
hand
had
appeared
amongst
the
flames
groping
as
though
to
catch
hold
of
something
a
stubby
short-fingered
hand
covered
in
ugly
old-fashioned
rings
the
three
of
them
ran
for
it
at
the
door
of
the
boys
dormitory
Harry
looked
back
umbridges
hand
was
still
making
snatching
movements
amongst
the
flames
as
though
she
knew
exactly
where
Siriuss
hair
had
been
moments
before
and
was
determined
to
seize
it
chapter
eighteen
dumbledores
Army
umbridge
has
been
reading
your
mail
Harry
theres
no
other
explanation
you
think
Umbridge
attacked
Hedwig
he
said
outraged
im
almost
certain
of
it
said
Hermione
grimly
watch
your
frog
its
escaping
harry
pointed
his
wand
at
the
bullfrog
that
had
been
hopping
hopefully
towards
the
other
side
of
the
table
Accio
and
it
zoomed
gloomily
back
into
his
hand
charms
was
always
one
of
the
best
lessons
in
which
to
enjoy
a
private
chat
there
was
generally
so
much
movement
and
activity
that
the
danger
of
being
overheard
was
very
slight
today
with
the
room
full
of
croaking
bullfrogs
and
cawing
ravens
and
with
a
heavy
downpour
of
rain
clattering
and
pounding
against
the
classroom
windows
Harry
Ron
and
Hermiones
whispered
discussion
about
how
Umbridge
had
nearly
caught
Sirius
went
quite
unnoticed
ive
been
suspecting
this
ever
since
Filch
accused
you
of
ordering
Dungbombs
because
it
seemed
such
a
stupid
lie
Hermione
whispered
i
mean
once
your
letter
had
been
read
it
would
have
been
quite
clear
you
werent
ordering
them
so
you
wouldnt
have
been
in
trouble
at
all
its
a
bit
of
a
feeble
joke
isnt
it
but
then
I
thought
what
if
somebody
just
wanted
an
excuse
to
read
your
mail
well
then
it
would
be
a
perfect
way
for
Umbridge
to
manage
it
tip
off
Filch
let
him
do
the
dirty
work
and
confiscate
the
letter
then
either
find
a
way
of
stealing
it
from
him
or
else
demand
to
see
it
I
dont
think
Filch
would
object
whens
he
ever
stuck
up
for
a
students
rights
harry
youre
squashing
your
frog
harry
looked
down
he
was
indeed
squeezing
his
bullfrog
so
tightly
its
eyes
were
popping
he
replaced
it
hastily
upon
the
desk
it
was
a
very
very
close
call
last
night
said
Hermione
i
just
wonder
if
Umbridge
knows
how
close
it
was
silencio
the
bullfrog
on
which
she
was
practicing
her
Silencing
Charm
was
struck
dumb
mid-croak
and
glared
at
her
reproachfully
if
shed
caught
Snuffles
harry
finished
the
sentence
for
her
Hed
probably
be
back
in
Azkaban
this
morning
he
waved
his
wand
without
really
concentrating
his
bullfrog
swelled
like
a
green
balloon
and
emitted
a
high-pitched
whistle
silencio
said
Hermione
hastily
pointing
her
wand
at
Harrys
frog
which
deflated
silently
before
them
well
he
mustnt
do
it
again
thats
all
i
just
dont
know
how
were
going
to
let
him
know
we
cant
send
him
an
owl
i
dont
reckon
hell
risk
it
again
said
Ron
hes
not
stupid
he
knows
she
nearly
got
him
silencio
the
large
and
ugly
raven
in
front
of
him
let
out
a
derisive
caw
silencio
silencio
the
raven
cawed
more
loudly
its
the
way
youre
moving
your
wand
said
Hermione
watching
Ron
critically
you
dont
want
to
wave
it
its
more
a
sharp
jab
ravens
are
harder
than
frogs
said
Ron
through
clenched
teeth
fine
lets
swap
said
Hermione
seizing
Rons
raven
and
replacing
it
with
her
own
fat
bullfrog
silencio
the
raven
continued
to
open
and
close
its
sharp
beak
but
no
sound
came
out
very
good
Miss
Granger
said
Professor
Flitwicks
squeaky
little
voice
making
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
all
jump
now
let
me
see
you
try
mr.
Weasley
wha
oh
oh
right
said
Ron
very
flustered
er
silencio
he
jabbed
at
the
bullfrog
so
hard
he
poked
it
in
the
eye
the
frog
gave
a
deafening
croak
and
leapt
off
the
desk
it
came
as
no
surprise
to
any
of
them
that
Harry
and
Ron
were
given
additional
practice
of
the
silencing
Charm
for
homework
they
were
allowed
to
remain
inside
over
break
due
to
the
downpour
outside
they
found
seats
in
a
noisy
and
overcrowded
classroom
on
the
first
floor
in
which
Peeves
was
floating
dreamily
up
near
the
chandelier
occasionally
blowing
an
ink
pellet
at
the
top
of
somebodys
head
they
had
barely
sat
down
when
Angelina
came
struggling
towards
them
through
the
groups
of
gossiping
students
ive
got
permission
she
said
to
re-form
the
Quidditch
team
excellent
said
Ron
and
Harry
together
yeah
said
Angelina
beaming
i
went
to
McGonagall
and
I
think
she
might
have
appealed
to
dumbledore
anyway
Umbridge
had
to
give
in
ha
so
I
want
you
down
at
the
pitch
at
seven
oclock
tonight
all
right
because
weve
got
to
make
up
time
you
realize
were
only
three
weeks
away
from
our
first
match
she
squeezed
away
from
them
narrowly
dodged
an
ink
pellet
from
Peeves
which
hit
a
nearby
first-year
instead
and
vanished
from
sight
rons
smile
slipped
slightly
as
he
looked
out
of
the
window
which
was
now
opaque
with
hammering
rain
hope
this
clears
up
whats
up
with
you
Hermione
she
too
was
gazing
at
the
window
but
not
as
though
she
really
saw
it
her
eyes
were
unfocused
and
there
was
a
frown
on
her
face
just
thinking
she
said
still
frowning
at
the
rain-washed
window
about
Siri
Snuffles
said
Harry
no
not
exactly
said
Hermione
slowly
more
wondering
i
suppose
were
doing
the
right
thing
i
think
arent
we
harry
and
Ron
looked
at
each
other
well
that
clears
that
up
said
Ron
it
wouldve
been
really
annoying
if
you
hadnt
explained
yourself
properly
hermione
looked
at
him
as
though
she
had
only
just
realized
he
was
there
i
was
just
wondering
she
said
her
voice
stronger
now
whether
were
doing
the
right
thing
starting
this
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
group
what
said
Harry
and
Ron
together
hermione
it
was
your
idea
in
the
first
place
said
Ron
indignantly
i
know
said
Hermione
twisting
her
fingers
together
but
after
talking
to
Snuffles
but
hes
all
for
it
said
Harry
yes
said
Hermione
staring
at
the
window
again
yes
thats
what
made
me
think
maybe
it
wasnt
a
good
idea
after
all
peeves
floated
over
them
on
his
stomach
peashooter
at
the
ready
automatically
all
three
of
them
lifted
their
bags
to
cover
their
heads
until
he
had
passed
lets
get
this
straight
said
Harry
angrily
as
t
hey
put
their
bags
back
on
the
floor
Sirius
agrees
with
us
so
you
dont
think
we
should
do
it
any
more
hermione
looked
tense
and
rather
miserable
now
staring
at
her
own
hands
she
said
Do
you
honestly
trust
his
judgment
yes
I
do
said
Harry
at
once
hes
always
given
us
great
advice
an
ink
pellet
whizzed
past
them
striking
Katie
Bell
squarely
in
the
ear
hermione
watched
Katie
leap
to
her
feet
and
start
throwing
things
at
Peeves
it
was
a
few
moments
before
Hermione
spoke
again
and
it
sounded
as
though
she
was
choosing
her
words
very
carefully
you
dont
think
he
has
become
sort
of
reckless
since
hes
been
cooped
up
in
Grimmauld
place
you
dont
think
hes
kind
of
living
through
us
what
dyou
mean
through
us
harry
retorted
i
mean
well
I
think
hed
love
to
be
forming
secret
Defense
societies
right
under
the
nose
of
someone
from
the
Ministry
i
think
hes
really
frustrated
at
how
little
he
can
do
where
he
is
so
I
think
hes
keen
to
kind
of
egg
us
on
ron
looked
utterly
perplexed
sirius
is
right
he
said
you
do
sound
just
like
my
mother
hermione
bit
her
lip
and
did
not
answer
the
bell
rang
just
as
Peeves
swooped
down
on
Katie
and
emptied
an
entire
ink
bottle
over
her
head
the
weather
did
not
improve
as
the
day
wore
on
so
that
at
seven
oclock
that
evening
when
harry
and
Ron
went
down
to
the
Quidditch
pitch
for
practice
they
were
soaked
through
within
minutes
their
feet
slipping
and
sliding
on
the
sodden
grass
the
sky
was
a
deep
thundery
grey
and
it
was
a
relief
to
gain
the
warmth
and
light
of
the
changing
rooms
even
if
they
knew
the
respite
was
only
temporary
they
found
Fred
and
George
debating
whether
to
use
one
of
their
own
Skiving
Snackboxes
to
get
out
of
flying
but
I
bet
shed
know
what
wed
done
Fred
said
out
of
the
corner
of
his
mouth
if
only
I
hadnt
offered
to
sell
her
some
Puking
Pastilles
yesterday
we
could
try
the
Fever
Fudge
George
muttered
no
ones
seen
that
yet
does
it
work
enquired
Ron
hopefully
as
the
hammering
of
rain
on
the
roof
intensified
and
wind
howled
around
the
building
well
yeah
said
Fred
your
temperaturell
go
right
up
but
you
get
these
massive
pus-filled
boils
too
said
George
and
we
havent
worked
out
how
to
get
rid
of
them
yet
i
cant
see
any
boils
said
Ron
staring
at
the
twins
no
well
you
wouldnt
said
Fred
darkly
theyre
not
in
a
place
we
generally
display
to
the
public
but
they
make
sitting
on
a
broom
a
right
pain
in
the
all
right
everyone
listen
up
said
Angelina
loudly
emerging
from
the
Captains
office
know
its
not
ideal
weather
but
theres
a
chance
well
be
playing
Slytherin
in
conditions
like
this
so
its
a
good
idea
to
work
out
how
were
going
to
cope
with
them
harry
didnt
you
do
something
to
your
glasses
to
stop
the
rain
fogging
them
up
when
we
played
Hufflepuff
in
that
storm
hermione
did
it
said
Harry
he
pulled
out
his
wand
tapped
his
glasses
and
said
Impervius
i
think
we
all
ought
to
try
that
said
Angelina
if
we
could
just
keep
the
rain
off
our
faces
it
would
really
help
visibility
all
together
come
on
Impervius
okay
lets
go
they
all
stowed
their
wands
back
in
the
inside
pockets
of
their
robes
shouldered
their
brooms
and
followed
Angelina
out
of
the
changing
rooms
they
squelched
through
the
deepening
mud
to
the
middle
of
the
pitch
visibility
was
still
very
poor
even
with
the
Impervius
Charm
light
was
fading
fast
and
curtains
of
rain
were
sweeping
the
grounds
all
right
on
my
whistle
shouted
Angelina
harry
kicked
off
from
the
ground
spraying
mud
in
all
directions
and
shot
upwards
the
wind
pulling
him
slightly
off
course
he
had
no
idea
how
he
was
going
to
see
the
Snitch
in
this
weather
he
was
having
enough
difficulty
seeing
the
one
Bludger
with
which
they
were
practicing
a
minute
into
the
practice
it
almost
unseated
him
and
he
had
to
use
the
Sloth
Grip
Roll
to
avoid
it
unfortunately
Angelina
did
not
see
this
in
fact
she
did
not
appear
to
be
able
to
see
anything
none
of
them
had
a
clue
what
the
others
were
doing
the
wind
was
picking
up
even
at
a
distance
Harry
could
hear
the
swishing
pounding
sounds
of
the
rain
pummeling
the
surface
of
the
lake
angelina
kept
them
at
it
for
nearly
an
hour
before
conceding
defeat
she
led
her
sodden
and
disgruntled
team
back
into
the
changing
rooms
insisting
that
the
practice
had
not
been
a
waste
of
time
though
without
any
real
conviction
in
her
voice
fred
and
George
were
looking
particularly
annoyed
both
were
bandy-legged
and
winced
with
every
movement
harry
could
hear
them
complaining
in
low
voices
as
he
toweled
his
hair
dry
i
think
a
few
of
mine
have
ruptured
said
Fred
in
a
hollow
voice
mine
havent
said
George
through
clenched
teeth
theyre
throbbing
like
mad
feel
bigger
if
anything
ouch
said
Harry
he
pressed
the
towel
to
his
face
his
eyes
screwed
tight
with
pain
the
scar
on
his
forehead
had
seared
again
more
painfully
than
it
had
in
weeks
whats
up
said
several
voices
harry
emerged
from
behind
his
towel
the
changing
room
was
blurred
because
he
was
not
wearing
his
glasses
but
he
could
still
tell
that
everyones
face
was
turned
towards
him
nothing
he
muttered
I
poked
myself
in
the
eye
thats
all
but
he
gave
Ron
a
significant
look
and
the
two
of
them
hung
back
as
the
rest
of
the
team
filed
back
outside
muffled
in
their
cloaks
their
hats
pulled
low
over
their
ears
what
happened
said
Ron
the
moment
Alicia
had
disappeared
through
the
door
was
it
your
scar
harry
nodded
but
looking
scared
Ron
strode
across
to
the
window
and
stared
out
into
the
rain
he
he
cant
be
near
us
now
can
he
no
Harry
muttered
sinking
on
to
a
bench
and
rubbing
his
forehead
hes
probably
miles
away
it
hurt
because
hes
angry
harry
had
not
meant
to
say
that
at
all
and
heard
the
words
as
though
a
stranger
had
spoken
them
yet
knew
at
once
that
they
were
true
he
did
not
know
how
he
knew
it
but
he
did
Voldemort
wherever
he
was
whatever
he
was
doing
was
in
a
towering
temper
did
you
see
him
said
Ron
looking
horrified
did
you
get
a
vision
or
something
harry
sat
quite
still
staring
at
his
feet
allowing
his
mind
and
his
memory
to
relax
in
the
aftermath
of
the
pain
a
confused
tangle
of
shapes
a
howling
rush
of
voices
he
wants
something
done
and
its
not
happening
fast
enough
he
said
again
he
felt
surprised
to
hear
the
words
coming
out
of
his
mouth
and
yet
was
quite
certain
they
were
true
but
how
do
you
know
said
Ron
harry
shook
his
head
and
covered
his
eyes
with
his
hands
pressing
down
upon
them
with
his
palms
little
stars
erupted
in
them
he
felt
Ron
sit
down
on
the
bench
beside
him
and
knew
Ron
was
staring
at
him
is
this
what
it
was
about
last
time
said
Ron
in
a
hushed
voice
when
your
scar
hurt
in
umbridges
office
you-Know-Who
was
angry
harry
shook
his
head
what
is
it
then
harry
was
thinking
himself
back
he
had
been
looking
into
Umbridges
face
his
scar
had
hurt
and
he
had
had
that
odd
feeling
in
his
stomach
a
strange
leaping
feeling
a
happy
feeling
but
of
course
he
had
not
recognized
it
for
what
it
was
as
he
had
been
feeling
so
miserable
himself
last
time
it
was
because
he
was
pleased
he
said
really
pleased
he
thought
something
good
was
going
to
happen
and
the
night
before
we
came
back
to
Hogwarts
he
thought
back
to
the
moment
when
his
scar
had
hurt
so
badly
in
his
and
Rons
bedroom
in
Grimmauld
Place
he
was
furious
he
looked
round
at
Ron
who
was
gaping
at
him
you
could
take
over
from
Trelawney
mate
he
said
in
an
awed
voice
im
not
making
prophecies
said
Harry
no
you
know
what
youre
doing
ron
said
sounding
both
scared
and
impressed
harry
youre
reading
You-Know-Whos
mind
no
said
Harry
shaking
his
head
its
more
like
his
mood
I
suppose
im
just
getting
flashes
of
what
mood
hes
in
dumbledore
said
something
like
this
was
happening
last
year
he
said
that
when
Voldemort
was
near
me
or
when
he
was
feeling
hatred
I
could
tell
well
now
Im
feeling
it
when
hes
pleased
too
there
was
a
pause
the
wind
and
rain
lashed
at
the
building
youve
got
to
tell
someone
said
Ron
i
told
Sirius
last
time
well
tell
him
about
this
time
cant
can
I
said
Harry
grimly
umbridge
is
watching
the
owls
and
the
fires
remember
well
then
Dumbledore
ive
just
told
you
he
already
knows
said
Harry
shortly
getting
to
his
feet
taking
his
cloak
off
his
peg
and
swinging
it
around
him
theres
no
point
telling
him
again
ron
did
up
the
fastening
of
his
own
cloak
watching
Harry
thoughtfully
dumbledored
want
to
know
he
said
harry
shrugged
cmon
weve
still
got
Silencing
Charms
to
practice
they
hurried
back
through
the
dark
grounds
sliding
and
stumbling
up
the
muddy
lawns
not
talking
harry
was
thinking
hard
what
was
it
that
Voldemort
wanted
done
that
was
not
happening
quickly
enough
hes
got
other
plans
plans
he
can
put
into
operation
very
quietly
indeed
stuff
he
can
only
get
by
stealth
like
a
weapon
something
he
didnt
have
last
time
harry
had
not
thought
about
those
words
in
weeks
he
had
been
too
absorbed
in
what
was
going
on
at
Hogwarts
too
busy
dwelling
on
the
ongoing
battles
with
Umbridge
the
injustice
of
all
the
ministry
interference
but
now
they
came
back
to
him
and
made
him
wonder
voldemorts
anger
would
make
sense
if
he
was
no
nearer
to
laying
hands
on
the
weapon
whatever
it
was
had
the
Order
thwarted
him
stopped
him
from
seizing
it
where
was
it
kept
who
had
it
now
mimbulus
mimbletonia
said
Rons
voice
and
Harry
came
back
to
his
senses
just
in
time
to
clamber
through
the
portrait
hole
into
the
common
room
it
appeared
that
Hermione
had
gone
to
bed
early
leaving
Crookshanks
curled
in
a
nearby
chair
and
an
assortment
of
knobbly
knitted
elf
hats
lying
on
a
table
by
the
fire
harry
was
rather
grateful
that
she
was
not
around
because
he
did
not
much
want
to
discuss
his
scar
hurting
and
have
her
urge
him
to
go
to
Dumbledore
too
ron
kept
throwing
him
anxious
glances
but
Harry
pulled
out
his
Charms
books
and
set
to
work
on
finishing
his
essay
though
he
was
only
pretending
to
concentrate
and
by
the
time
Ron
said
he
was
going
up
to
bed
too
he
had
written
hardly
anything
midnight
came
and
went
while
Harry
was
reading
and
rereading
a
passage
about
the
uses
of
scurvy-grass
lovage
and
sneezewort
and
not
taking
in
a
word
of
it
these
plants
are
most
efficacious
in
the
inflaming
of
the
brain
and
are
therefore
much
used
in
Confusing
and
Befuddlement
Draughts
where
the
wizard
is
desirous
of
producing
hot-headedness
and
recklessness
hermione
said
Sirius
was
becoming
reckless
cooped
up
in
Grimmauld
Place
most
efficacious
in
the
inflaming
of
the
brain
and
are
therefore
much
used
the
Daily
Prophet
would
think
his
brain
was
inflamed
if
they
found
out
that
he
knew
what
voldemort
was
feeling
therefore
much
used
in
Confusing
and
Befuddlement
Draughts
confusing
was
the
word
all
right
why
did
he
know
what
Voldemort
was
feeling
what
was
this
weird
connection
between
them
which
Dumbledore
had
never
been
able
to
explain
satisfactorily
where
the
wizard
is
desirous
how
Harry
would
like
to
sleep
producing
hot-headedness
it
was
warm
and
comfortable
in
his
armchair
before
the
fire
with
the
rain
still
beating
heavily
on
the
windowpanes
Crookshanks
purring
and
the
crackling
of
the
flames
the
book
slipped
from
Harrys
slack
grip
and
landed
with
a
dull
thud
on
the
hearthrug
his
head
rolled
sideways
he
was
walking
once
more
along
a
windowless
corridor
his
footsteps
echoing
in
the
silence
as
the
door
at
the
end
of
the
passage
loomed
larger
his
heart
beat
fast
with
excitement
if
he
could
only
open
it
enter
beyond
he
stretched
out
his
hand
his
fingertips
were
inches
from
it
harry
Potter
sir
he
awoke
with
a
start
the
candles
had
all
been
extinguished
in
the
common
room
but
there
was
something
moving
close
by
whozair
said
Harry
sitting
upright
in
his
chair
the
fire
was
almost
out
the
room
very
dark
dobby
has
your
owl
sir
said
a
squeaky
voice
dobby
said
Harry
thickly
peering
through
the
gloom
towards
the
source
of
the
voice
dobby
the
house-elf
was
standing
beside
the
table
on
which
Hermione
had
left
half
a
dozen
of
her
knitted
hats
his
large
pointed
ears
were
now
sticking
out
from
beneath
what
looked
like
all
the
hats
Hermione
had
ever
knitted
he
was
wearing
one
on
top
of
the
other
so
that
his
head
seemed
elongated
by
two
or
three
feet
and
on
the
very
topmost
bobble
sat
Hedwig
hooting
serenely
and
obviously
cured
dobby
volunteered
to
return
Harry
Potters
owl
said
the
elf
squeakily
with
a
look
of
positive
adoration
on
his
face
Professor
Grubbly-Plank
says
she
is
all
well
now
sir
he
sank
into
a
deep
bow
so
that
his
pencil-like
nose
brushed
the
threadbare
surface
of
the
hearthrug
and
hedwig
gave
an
indignant
hoot
and
fluttered
on
to
the
arm
of
Harrys
chair
thanks
Dobby
said
Harry
stroking
Hedwigs
head
and
blinking
hard
trying
to
rid
himself
of
the
image
of
the
door
in
his
dream
it
had
been
very
vivid
surveying
Dobby
more
closely
he
noticed
that
the
elf
was
also
wearing
several
scarves
and
innumerable
socks
so
that
his
feet
looked
far
too
big
for
his
body
er
have
you
been
taking
all
the
clothes
Hermiones
been
leaving
out
oh
no
sir
said
Dobby
happily
dobby
has
been
taking
some
for
Winky
too
sir
yeah
how
is
Winky
asked
Harry
dobbys
ears
drooped
slightly
winky
is
still
drinking
lots
sir
he
said
sadly
his
enormous
round
green
eyes
large
as
tennis
balls
downcast
she
still
does
not
care
for
clothes
Harry
Potter
nor
do
the
other
house-elves
none
of
them
will
clean
Gryffindor
Tower
any
more
not
with
the
hats
and
socks
hidden
everywhere
they
finds
them
insulting
sir
dobby
does
it
all
himself
sir
but
Dobby
does
not
mind
sir
for
he
always
hopes
to
meet
Harry
Potter
and
tonight
sir
he
has
got
his
wish
dobby
sank
into
a
deep
bow
again
but
Harry
Potter
does
not
seem
happy
Dobby
went
on
straightening
up
again
and
looking
timidly
at
Harry
dobby
heard
him
muttering
in
his
sleep
was
Harry
Potter
having
bad
dreams
not
really
bad
said
Harry
yawning
and
rubbing
his
eyes
ive
had
worse
the
elf
surveyed
Harry
out
of
his
vast
orb-like
eyes
then
he
said
very
seriously
his
ears
drooping
Dobby
wishes
he
could
help
Harry
Potter
for
Harry
Potter
set
Dobby
free
and
Dobby
is
much
much
happier
now
harry
smiled
you
cant
help
me
Dobby
but
thanks
for
the
offer
he
bent
and
picked
up
his
Potions
book
hed
have
to
try
to
finish
the
essay
tomorrow
he
closed
the
book
and
as
he
did
so
the
firelight
illuminated
the
thin
white
scars
on
the
back
of
his
hand
the
result
of
his
detentions
with
Umbridge
wait
a
moment
there
is
something
you
can
do
for
me
Dobby
said
Harry
slowly
the
elf
looked
round
beaming
name
it
Harry
Potter
sir
i
need
to
find
a
place
where
twenty-eight
people
can
practice
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
without
being
discovered
by
any
of
the
teachers
especially
Harry
clenched
his
hand
on
the
book
so
that
the
scars
shone
pearly
white
Professor
Umbridge
he
expected
the
elfs
smile
to
vanish
his
ears
to
droop
he
expected
him
to
say
it
was
impossible
or
else
that
he
would
try
to
find
somewhere
but
his
hopes
were
not
high
what
he
had
not
expected
was
for
Dobby
to
give
a
little
skip
his
ears
waggling
cheerfully
and
clap
his
hands
together
dobby
knows
the
perfect
place
sir
he
said
happily
dobby
heard
tell
of
it
from
the
other
house-elves
when
he
came
to
Hogwarts
sir
it
is
known
by
us
as
the
Come
and
Go
Room
sir
or
else
as
the
Room
of
Requirement
why
said
Harry
curiously
because
it
is
a
room
that
a
person
can
only
enter
said
Dobby
seriously
when
they
have
real
need
of
it
sometimes
it
is
there
and
sometimes
it
is
not
but
when
it
appears
it
is
always
equipped
for
the
seekers
needs
dobby
has
used
it
sir
said
the
elf
dropping
his
voice
and
looking
guilty
when
Winky
has
been
very
drunk
he
has
hidden
her
in
the
Room
of
requirement
and
he
has
found
antidotes
to
Butterbeer
there
and
a
nice
elf-sized
bed
to
settle
her
on
while
she
sleeps
it
off
sir
and
Dobby
knows
mr.
Filch
has
found
extra
cleaning
materials
there
when
he
has
run
short
sir
and
and
if
you
really
needed
a
bathroom
said
Harry
suddenly
remembering
something
dumbledore
had
said
at
the
Yule
Ball
the
previous
Christmas
would
it
fill
itself
with
chamber
pots
dobby
expects
so
sir
said
Dobby
nodding
earnestly
it
is
a
most
amazing
room
sir
how
many
people
know
about
it
said
Harry
sitting
up
straighter
in
his
chair
very
few
sir
mostly
people
stumbles
across
it
when
they
needs
it
sir
but
often
they
never
finds
it
again
for
they
do
not
know
that
it
is
always
there
waiting
to
be
called
into
service
sir
it
sounds
brilliant
said
Harry
his
heart
racing
it
sounds
perfect
Dobby
when
can
you
show
me
where
it
is
any
time
Harry
Potter
sir
said
Dobby
looking
delighted
at
Harrys
enthusiasm
we
could
go
now
if
you
like
for
a
moment
Harry
was
tempted
to
go
with
Dobby
he
was
halfway
out
of
his
seat
intending
to
hurry
upstairs
for
his
Invisibility
Cloak
when
not
for
the
first
time
a
voice
very
much
like
hermiones
whispered
in
his
ear
reckless
it
was
after
all
very
late
he
was
exhausted
and
had
snapes
essay
to
finish
not
tonight
Dobby
said
Harry
reluctantly
sinking
back
into
his
chair
this
is
really
important
i
dont
want
to
blow
it
itll
need
proper
planning
listen
can
you
just
tell
me
exactly
where
this
Room
of
Requirement
is
and
how
to
get
in
there
their
robes
billowed
and
swirled
around
them
as
they
splashed
across
the
flooded
vegetable
patch
to
double
Herbology
where
they
could
hardly
hear
what
Professor
Sprout
was
saying
over
the
hammering
of
raindrops
hard
as
hailstones
on
the
greenhouse
roof
the
afternoons
Care
of
magical
Creatures
lesson
was
to
be
relocated
from
the
storm-swept
grounds
to
a
free
classroom
on
the
ground
floor
and
to
their
intense
relief
Angelina
had
sought
out
her
team
at
lunch
to
tell
them
that
Quidditch
practice
was
cancelled
good
said
Harry
quietly
when
she
told
him
because
weve
found
somewhere
to
have
our
first
Defense
meeting
tonight
eight
oclock
seventh
floor
opposite
that
tapestry
of
Barnabas
the
Barmy
being
clubbed
by
those
trolls
can
you
tell
Katie
and
Alicia
she
looked
slightly
taken
aback
but
promised
to
tell
the
others
harry
returned
hungrily
to
his
sausages
and
mash
when
he
looked
up
to
take
a
drink
of
pumpkin
juice
he
found
Hermione
watching
him
what
he
said
thickly
well
its
just
that
Dobbys
plans
arent
always
that
safe
dont
you
remember
when
he
lost
you
all
the
bones
in
your
arm
this
room
isnt
just
some
mad
idea
of
Dobbys
Dumbledore
knows
about
it
too
he
mentioned
it
to
me
at
the
Yule
Ball
hermiones
expression
cleared
dumbledore
told
you
about
it
just
in
passing
said
Harry
shrugging
oh
well
thats
all
right
then
said
Hermione
briskly
and
raised
no
more
objections
together
with
Ron
they
had
spent
most
of
the
day
seeking
out
those
people
who
had
signed
their
names
to
the
list
in
the
Hogs
Head
and
telling
them
where
to
meet
that
evening
somewhat
to
harrys
disappointment
it
was
Ginny
who
managed
to
find
Cho
Chang
and
her
friend
first
however
by
the
end
of
dinner
he
was
confident
that
the
news
had
been
passed
to
every
one
of
the
twenty-five
people
who
had
turned
up
in
the
Hogs
Head
at
half
past
seven
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
left
the
Gryffindor
common
room
Harry
clutching
a
certain
piece
of
aged
parchment
in
his
hand
fifth-years
were
allowed
to
be
out
in
the
corridors
until
nine
oclock
but
all
three
of
them
kept
looking
around
nervously
as
they
made
their
way
along
the
seventh
floor
hold
it
Harry
warned
unfolding
the
piece
of
parchment
at
the
top
of
the
last
staircase
tapping
it
with
his
wand
and
muttering
I
solemnly
swear
that
I
am
up
to
no
good
a
map
of
Hogwarts
appeared
on
the
blank
surface
of
the
parchment
tiny
black
moving
dots
labeled
with
names
showed
where
various
people
were
filch
is
on
the
second
floor
said
Harry
holding
the
map
close
to
his
eyes
and
Mrs
norris
is
on
the
fourth
and
Umbridge
said
Hermione
anxiously
in
her
office
said
Harry
pointing
okay
lets
go
they
hurried
along
the
corridor
to
the
place
Dobby
had
described
to
Harry
a
stretch
of
blank
wall
opposite
an
enormous
tapestry
depicting
Barnabas
the
Barmys
foolish
attempt
to
train
trolls
for
the
ballet
okay
said
Harry
quietly
while
a
moth-eaten
troll
paused
in
his
relentless
clubbing
of
the
would
be
ballet
teacher
to
watch
them
dobby
said
to
walk
past
this
bit
of
wall
three
times
concentrating
hard
on
what
we
need
they
did
so
turning
sharply
at
the
window
just
beyond
the
blank
stretch
of
wall
then
at
the
man-sized
vase
on
its
other
side
ron
had
screwed
up
his
eyes
in
concentration
Hermione
was
whispering
something
under
her
breath
Harrys
fists
were
clenched
as
he
stared
ahead
of
him
we
need
somewhere
to
learn
to
fight
he
thought
just
give
us
a
place
to
practice
somewhere
they
cant
find
us
harry
said
Hermione
sharply
as
they
wheeled
around
after
their
third
walk
past
a
highly
polished
door
had
appeared
in
the
wall
ron
was
staring
at
it
looking
slightly
wary
harry
reached
out
seized
the
brass
handle
pulled
open
the
door
and
led
the
way
into
a
spacious
room
lit
with
flickering
torches
like
those
that
illuminated
the
dungeons
eight
floors
below
the
walls
were
lined
with
wooden
bookcases
and
instead
of
chairs
there
were
large
silk
cushions
on
the
floor
a
set
of
shelves
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
carried
a
range
of
instruments
such
as
sneakoscopes
Secrecy
Sensors
and
a
large
cracked
Foe-Glass
that
Harry
was
sure
had
hung
the
previous
year
in
the
fake
Moodys
office
these
will
be
good
when
were
practicing
Stunning
said
Ron
enthusiastically
prodding
one
of
the
cushions
with
his
foot
and
just
look
at
these
books
said
Hermione
excitedly
running
a
finger
along
the
spines
of
the
large
leather-bound
tomes
a
Compendium
of
Common
Curses
and
their
Counter-Actions
the
Dark
Arts
Outsmarted
self-Defensive
Spellwork
wow
she
looked
around
at
Harry
her
face
glowing
and
he
saw
that
the
presence
of
hundreds
of
books
had
finally
convinced
hermione
that
what
they
were
doing
was
right
harry
this
is
wonderful
theres
everything
we
need
here
and
without
further
ado
she
slid
Jinxes
for
the
Jinxed
from
its
shelf
sank
on
to
the
nearest
cushion
and
began
to
read
there
was
a
gentle
knock
on
the
door
harry
looked
round
ginny
Neville
Lavender
Parvati
and
Dean
had
arrived
whoa
said
Dean
staring
around
impressed
what
is
this
place
harry
began
to
explain
but
before
he
had
finished
more
people
had
arrived
and
he
had
to
start
all
over
again
by
the
time
eight
oclock
arrived
every
cushion
was
occupied
harry
moved
across
to
the
door
and
turned
the
key
protruding
from
the
lock
it
clicked
in
a
satisfyingly
loud
way
and
everybody
fell
silent
looking
at
him
hermione
carefully
marked
her
page
of
Jinxes
for
the
jinxed
and
set
the
book
aside
well
said
Harry
slightly
nervously
this
is
the
place
weve
found
for
practice
sessions
and
youve
er
obviously
found
it
okay
its
fantastic
said
Cho
and
several
people
murmured
their
agreement
its
bizarre
said
Fred
frowning
around
at
it
we
once
hid
from
Filch
in
here
remember
george
but
it
was
just
a
broom
cupboard
then
hey
Harry
whats
this
stuff
asked
Dean
from
the
rear
of
the
room
indicating
the
sneakoscopes
and
the
Foe-Glass
dark
detectors
said
Harry
stepping
between
the
cushions
to
reach
them
basically
they
all
show
when
Dark
wizards
or
enemies
are
around
but
you
dont
want
to
rely
on
them
too
much
they
can
be
fooled
he
gazed
for
a
moment
into
the
cracked
Foe-Glass
shadowy
figures
were
moving
around
inside
it
though
none
was
recognizable
he
turned
his
back
on
it
well
Ive
been
thinking
about
the
sort
of
stuff
we
ought
to
do
first
and
er
He
noticed
a
raised
hand
what
Hermione
i
think
we
ought
to
elect
a
leader
said
Hermione
harrys
leader
said
Cho
at
once
looking
at
Hermione
as
though
she
were
mad
harrys
stomach
did
yet
another
back-flip
yes
but
I
think
we
ought
to
vote
on
it
properly
said
Hermione
unperturbed
it
makes
it
formal
and
it
gives
him
authority
so
everyone
who
thinks
Harry
ought
to
be
our
leader
everybody
put
up
their
hand
even
Zacharias
Smith
though
he
did
it
very
half-heartedly
er
right
thanks
said
Harry
who
could
feel
his
face
burning
and
what
Hermione
i
also
think
we
ought
to
have
a
name
she
said
brightly
her
hand
still
in
the
air
it
would
promote
a
feeling
of
team
spirit
and
unity
dont
you
think
can
we
be
the
Anti-Umbridge
League
said
Angelina
hopefully
or
the
Ministry
of
Magic
are
Morons
Group
suggested
Fred
i
was
thinking
said
Hermione
frowning
at
Fred
more
of
a
name
that
didnt
tell
everyone
what
we
were
up
to
so
we
can
refer
to
it
safely
outside
meetings
the
Defense
Association
said
Cho
the
D
a.
for
short
so
nobody
knows
what
were
talking
about
yeah
the
D
a.s
good
said
Ginny
only
lets
make
it
stand
for
Dumbledores
Army
because
thats
the
Ministrys
worst
fear
isnt
it
there
was
a
good
deal
of
appreciative
murmuring
and
laughter
at
this
all
in
favor
of
the
D
said
Hermione
bossily
kneeling
up
on
her
cushion
to
count
thats
a
majority
motion
passed
she
pinned
the
piece
of
parchment
with
all
of
their
signatures
on
it
on
to
the
wall
and
wrote
across
the
top
in
large
letters
right
said
Harry
when
she
had
sat
down
again
shall
we
get
practicing
then
i
was
thinking
the
first
thing
we
should
do
is
Expelliarmus
you
know
the
Disarming
Charm
i
know
its
pretty
basic
but
Ive
found
it
really
useful
oh
please
said
Zacharias
Smith
rolling
his
eye
s
and
folding
his
arms
i
dont
think
Expelliarmus
is
exactly
going
to
help
us
against
You-Know-Who
do
you
ive
used
it
against
him
said
Harry
quietly
it
saved
my
life
in
June
smith
opened
his
mouth
stupidly
the
rest
of
the
room
was
very
quiet
but
if
you
think
its
beneath
you
you
can
leave
Harry
said
smith
did
not
move
nor
did
anybody
else
okay
said
Harry
his
mouth
slightly
drier
than
usual
with
all
these
eyes
upon
him
I
reckon
we
should
all
divide
into
pairs
and
practice
it
felt
very
odd
to
be
issuing
instructions
but
not
nearly
as
odd
as
seeing
them
followed
everybody
got
to
their
feet
at
once
and
divided
up
predictably
Neville
was
left
partnerless
you
can
practice
with
me
Harry
told
him
right-on
the
count
of
three
then-one
two
three
the
room
was
suddenly
full
of
shouts
of
Expelliarmus
wands
flew
in
all
directions
missed
spells
hit
books
on
shelves
and
sent
them
flying
into
the
air
harry
was
too
quick
for
Neville
whose
wand
went
spinning
out
of
his
hand
hit
the
ceiling
in
a
shower
of
sparks
and
landed
with
a
clatter
on
top
of
a
bookshelf
from
which
Harry
retrieved
it
with
a
Summoning
Charm
glancing
around
he
thought
he
had
been
right
to
suggest
they
practice
the
basics
first
there
was
a
lot
of
shoddy
spellwork
going
on
many
people
were
not
succeeding
in
Disarming
their
opponents
at
all
but
merely
causing
them
to
jump
backwards
a
few
paces
or
wince
as
their
feeble
spell
whooshed
over
them
expelliarmus
said
Neville
and
Harry
caught
unawares
felt
his
wand
fly
out
of
his
hand
i
did
it
said
Neville
gleefully
ive
never
done
it
before
I
did
it
good
one
said
Harry
encouragingly
deciding
not
to
point
out
that
in
a
real
duel
Nevilles
opponent
was
unlikely
to
be
staring
in
the
opposite
direction
with
his
wand
held
loosely
at
his
side
listen
Neville
can
you
take
it
in
turns
to
practice
with
Ron
and
Hermione
for
a
couple
of
minutes
so
I
can
walk
around
and
see
how
the
rest
are
doing
harry
moved
off
into
the
middle
of
the
room
something
very
odd
was
happening
to
Zacharias
smith
every
time
he
opened
his
mouth
to
disarm
Anthony
Goldstein
his
own
wand
would
fly
out
of
his
hand
yet
Anthony
did
not
seem
to
be
making
a
sound
harry
did
not
have
to
look
far
to
solve
the
mystery
Fred
and
George
were
several
feet
from
Smith
and
taking
it
in
turns
to
point
their
wands
at
his
back
sorry
Harry
said
George
hastily
when
Harry
caught
his
eye
couldnt
resist
harry
walked
around
the
other
pairs
trying
to
correct
those
who
were
doing
the
spell
wrong
ginny
was
teamed
with
Michael
Corner
she
was
doing
very
well
whereas
Michael
was
either
very
bad
or
unwilling
to
jinx
her
ernie
Macmillan
was
flourishing
his
wand
unnecessarily
giving
his
partner
time
to
get
in
under
his
guard
the
Creevey
brothers
were
enthusiastic
but
erratic
and
mainly
responsible
for
all
the
books
leaping
off
the
shelves
around
them
Luna
lovegood
was
similarly
patchy
occasionally
sending
Justin
Finch-Fletchleys
wand
spinning
out
of
his
hand
at
other
times
merely
causing
his
hair
to
stand
on
end
okay
stop
harry
shouted
stop
stop
i
need
a
whistle
he
thought
and
immediately
spotted
one
lying
on
top
of
the
nearest
row
of
books
he
caught
it
up
and
blew
hard
everyone
lowered
their
wands
that
wasnt
bad
said
Harry
but
theres
definite
room
for
improvement
zacharias
Smith
glared
at
him
lets
try
again
he
moved
off
around
the
room
again
stopping
here
and
there
to
make
suggestions
slowly
the
general
performance
improved
he
avoided
going
near
Cho
and
her
friend
for
a
while
but
after
walking
twice
around
every
other
pair
in
the
room
felt
he
could
not
ignore
them
any
longer
oh
no
said
Cho
rather
wildly
as
he
approached
expelliarmious
i
mean
Expellimellius
i
oh
sorry
Marietta
her
curly-haired
friends
sleeve
had
caught
fire
Marietta
extinguished
it
with
her
own
wand
and
glared
at
Harry
as
though
it
was
his
fault
you
made
me
nervous
I
was
doing
all
right
before
then
cho
told
Harry
ruefully
that
was
quite
good
Harry
lied
but
when
she
raised
her
eyebrows
he
said
Well
no
it
was
lousy
but
I
know
you
can
do
it
properly
I
was
watching
from
over
there
she
laughed
her
friend
Marietta
looked
at
them
rather
sourly
and
turned
away
dont
mind
her
Cho
muttered
she
doesnt
really
want
to
be
here
but
I
made
her
come
with
me
her
parents
have
forbidden
her
to
do
anything
that
might
upset
Umbridge
you
see
her
mum
works
for
the
Ministry
what
about
your
parents
asked
Harry
well
theyve
forbidden
me
to
get
on
the
wrong
side
of
Umbridge
too
said
Cho
drawing
herself
up
proudly
but
if
they
think
Im
not
going
to
fight
You-Know-Who
after
what
happened
to
Cedric
she
broke
off
looking
rather
confused
and
an
awkward
silence
fell
between
them
Terry
Boots
wand
went
whizzing
past
Harrys
ear
and
hit
Alicia
Spinnet
hard
on
the
nose
well
my
dad
is
very
supportive
of
any
anti-Ministry
action
said
Luna
Lovegood
proudly
from
just
behind
Harry
evidently
she
had
been
eavesdropping
on
his
conversation
while
Justin
Finch-Fletchley
attempted
to
disentangle
himself
from
the
robes
that
had
flown
up
over
his
head
hes
always
saying
hed
believe
anything
of
Fudge
I
mean
the
number
of
goblins
Fudge
has
had
assassinated
and
of
course
he
uses
the
Department
of
Mysteries
to
develop
terrible
poisons
which
he
secretly
feeds
to
anybody
who
disagrees
with
him
and
then
theres
his
Umgubular
slashkilter
dont
ask
Harry
muttered
to
Cho
as
she
opened
her
mouth
looking
puzzled
she
giggled
hey
Harry
Hermione
called
from
the
other
end
of
the
room
have
you
checked
the
time
he
looked
down
at
his
watch
and
was
shocked
to
see
it
was
already
ten
past
nine
which
meant
they
needed
to
get
back
to
their
common
rooms
immediately
or
risk
being
caught
and
punished
by
Filch
for
being
out
of
bounds
he
blew
his
whistle
everybody
stopped
shouting
expelliarmus
and
the
last
couple
of
wands
clattered
to
the
floor
well
that
was
pretty
good
said
Harry
but
weve
overrun
wed
better
leave
it
here
same
time
same
place
next
week
sooner
said
Dean
Thomas
eagerly
and
many
people
nodded
in
agreement
angelina
however
said
quickly
the
Quidditch
seasons
about
to
start
we
need
team
practices
too
lets
say
next
Wednesday
night
then
said
Harry
we
can
decide
on
additional
meetings
then
come
on
wed
better
get
going
he
pulled
out
the
Marauders
Map
again
and
checked
it
carefully
for
signs
of
teachers
on
the
seventh
floor
he
let
them
all
leave
in
threes
and
fours
watching
their
tiny
dots
anxiously
to
see
that
they
returned
safely
to
their
dormitories
the
Hufflepuffs
to
the
basement
corridor
that
also
led
to
the
kitchens
the
Ravenclaws
to
a
tower
on
the
west
side
of
the
castle
and
the
Gryffindors
along
the
corridor
to
the
Fat
Ladys
portrait
that
was
really
really
good
Harry
said
Hermione
when
finally
it
was
just
her
Harry
and
Ron
who
were
left
yeah
it
was
said
Ron
enthusiastically
as
they
slipped
out
of
the
door
and
watched
it
melt
back
into
stone
behind
them
did
you
see
me
disarm
Hermione
Harry
only
once
said
Hermione
stung
i
got
you
loads
more
than
you
got
me
i
did
not
only
get
you
once
I
got
you
at
least
three
times
well
if
youre
counting
the
one
where
you
tripped
over
your
own
feet
and
knocked
the
wand
out
of
my
hand
they
argued
all
the
way
back
to
the
common
room
but
Harry
was
not
listening
to
them
he
had
one
eye
on
the
Marauders
Map
but
he
was
also
thinking
of
Cho
saying
he
made
her
nervous
chapter
nineteen
the
Lion
and
the
Serpent
harry
felt
as
though
he
were
carrying
some
kind
of
talisman
inside
his
chest
over
the
following
two
weeks
a
glowing
secret
that
supported
him
through
Umbridges
classes
and
even
made
it
possible
for
him
to
smile
blandly
as
he
looked
into
her
horrible
bulging
eyes
he
and
the
D
were
resisting
her
under
her
very
nose
doing
the
very
thing
she
and
the
Ministry
most
feared
and
whenever
he
was
supposed
to
be
reading
Wilbert
Slinkhards
book
during
her
lessons
he
dwelled
instead
on
satisfying
memories
of
their
most
recent
meetings
remembering
how
Neville
had
successfully
disarmed
Hermione
how
Colin
Creevey
had
mastered
the
Impediment
Jinx
after
three
meetings
hard
effort
how
Parvati
Patil
had
produced
such
a
good
Reductor
Curse
that
she
had
reduced
the
table
carrying
all
the
Sneakoscopes
to
dust
he
was
finding
it
almost
impossible
to
fix
a
regular
night
of
the
week
for
the
D
a.
meetings
as
they
had
to
accommodate
three
separate
teams
Quidditch
practices
which
were
often
rearranged
due
to
bad
weather
conditions
but
Harry
was
not
sorry
about
this
he
had
a
feeling
that
it
was
probably
better
to
keep
the
timing
of
their
meetings
unpredictable
if
anyone
was
watching
them
it
would
be
hard
to
make
out
a
pattern
hermione
soon
devised
a
very
clever
method
of
communicating
the
time
and
date
of
the
next
meeting
to
all
the
members
in
case
they
needed
to
change
it
at
short
notice
because
it
would
look
suspicious
if
people
from
different
Houses
were
seen
crossing
the
Great
Hall
to
talk
to
each
other
too
often
she
gave
each
of
the
members
of
the
D
a.
a
fake
Galleon
Ron
became
very
excited
when
he
first
saw
the
basket
and
was
convinced
she
was
actually
giving
out
gold
you
see
the
numerals
around
the
edge
of
the
coins
hermione
said
holding
one
up
for
examination
at
the
end
of
their
fourth
meeting
the
coin
gleamed
fat
and
yellow
in
the
light
from
the
torches
on
real
Galleons
thats
just
a
serial
number
referring
to
the
goblin
who
cast
the
coin
on
these
fake
coins
though
the
numbers
will
change
to
reflect
the
time
and
date
of
the
next
meeting
the
coins
will
grow
hot
when
the
date
changes
so
if
youre
carrying
them
in
a
pocket
youll
be
able
to
feel
them
we
take
one
each
and
when
Harry
sets
the
date
of
the
next
meeting
hell
change
the
numbers
on
his
coin
and
because
Ive
put
a
Protean
Charm
on
them
theyll
all
change
to
mimic
his
a
blank
silence
greeted
Hermiones
words
she
looked
around
at
all
the
faces
upturned
to
her
rather
disconcerted
well
I
thought
it
was
a
good
idea
she
said
uncertainly
I
mean
even
if
Umbridge
asked
us
to
turn
out
our
pockets
theres
nothing
fishy
about
carrying
a
Galleon
is
there
but
well
if
you
dont
want
to
use
them
you
can
do
a
Protean
Charm
said
Terry
Boot
yes
said
Hermione
but
thats
thats
newt
standard
that
is
he
said
weakly
oh
said
Hermione
trying
to
look
modest
oh
well
yes
I
suppose
it
is
how
come
youre
not
in
Ravenclaw
he
demanded
staring
at
Hermione
with
something
close
to
wonder
with
brains
like
yours
well
the
Sorting
Hat
did
seriously
consider
putting
me
in
Ravenclaw
during
my
Sorting
said
hermione
brightly
but
it
decided
on
Gryffindor
in
the
end
so
does
that
mean
were
using
the
galleons
there
was
a
murmur
of
assent
and
everybody
moved
forwards
to
collect
one
from
the
basket
harry
looked
sideways
at
Hermione
you
know
what
these
remind
me
of
no
whats
that
the
Death
Eaters
scars
voldemort
touches
one
of
them
and
all
their
scars
burn
and
they
know
theyve
got
to
join
him
well
yes
said
Hermione
quietly
that
is
where
I
got
the
idea
but
youll
notice
I
decided
to
engrave
the
date
on
bits
of
metal
rather
than
on
our
members
skin
yeah
i
prefer
your
way
said
Harry
grinning
as
he
slipped
his
Galleon
into
his
pocket
suppose
the
only
danger
with
these
is
that
we
might
accidentally
spend
them
fat
chance
said
Ron
who
was
examining
his
own
fake
Galleon
with
a
slightly
mournful
air
I
havent
got
any
real
Galleons
to
confuse
it
with
as
the
first
Quidditch
match
of
the
season
Gryffindor
versus
Slytherin
drew
nearer
their
D
meetings
were
put
on
hold
because
Angelina
insisted
on
almost
daily
practices
the
fact
that
the
quidditch
Cup
had
not
been
held
for
so
long
added
considerably
to
the
interest
and
excitement
surrounding
the
forthcoming
game
the
Ravenclaws
and
Hufflepuffs
were
taking
a
lively
interest
in
the
outcome
for
they
of
course
would
be
playing
both
teams
over
the
coming
year
and
the
heads
of
House
of
the
competing
teams
though
they
attempted
to
disguise
it
under
a
decent
pretence
of
sportsmanship
were
determined
to
see
their
own
side
victorious
harry
realized
how
much
Professor
McGonagall
cared
about
beating
Slytherin
when
she
abstained
from
giving
them
homework
in
the
week
leading
up
to
the
match
i
think
youve
got
enough
to
be
getting
on
with
at
the
moment
she
said
loftily
nobody
could
quite
believe
their
ears
until
she
looked
directly
at
Harry
and
Ron
and
said
grimly
Ive
become
accustomed
to
seeing
the
Quidditch
Cup
in
my
study
boys
and
I
really
dont
want
to
have
to
hand
it
over
to
Professor
Snape
so
use
the
extra
time
to
practice
wont
you
snape
was
no
less
obviously
partisan
he
had
booked
the
Quidditch
pitch
for
Slytherin
practice
so
often
that
the
Gryffindors
had
difficulty
getting
on
it
to
play
he
was
also
turning
a
deaf
ear
to
the
many
reports
of
Slytherin
attempts
to
hex
Gryffindor
players
in
the
corridors
when
Alicia
spinnet
turned
up
in
the
hospital
wing
with
her
eyebrows
growing
so
thick
and
fast
they
obscured
her
vision
and
obstructed
her
mouth
Snape
insisted
that
she
must
have
attempted
a
hair-thickening
Charm
on
herself
and
refused
to
listen
to
the
fourteen
eye-witnesses
who
insisted
they
had
seen
the
Slytherin
Keeper
Miles
Bletchley
hit
her
from
behind
with
a
jinx
while
she
worked
in
the
library
harry
felt
optimistic
about
Gryffindors
chances
they
had
after
all
never
lost
to
Malfoys
team
admittedly
Ron
was
still
not
performing
to
Woods
standard
but
he
was
working
extremely
hard
to
improve
his
greatest
weakness
was
a
tendency
to
lose
confidence
after
hed
made
a
blunder
if
he
let
in
one
goal
he
became
flustered
and
was
therefore
likely
to
miss
more
on
the
other
hand
Harry
had
seen
Ron
make
some
truly
spectacular
saves
when
he
was
on
form
during
one
memorable
practice
he
had
hung
one-handed
from
his
broom
and
kicked
the
Quaffle
so
hard
away
from
the
goal
hoop
that
it
soared
the
length
of
the
pitch
and
through
the
center
hoop
at
the
other
end
the
rest
of
the
team
felt
this
save
compared
favorably
with
one
made
recently
by
barry
Ryan
the
Irish
International
Keeper
against
Polands
top
Chaser
Ladislaw
Zamojski
even
Fred
had
said
that
Ron
might
yet
make
him
and
George
proud
and
that
they
were
seriously
considering
admitting
he
was
related
to
them
something
they
assured
him
they
had
been
trying
to
deny
for
four
years
the
only
thing
really
worrying
Harry
was
how
much
Ron
was
allowing
the
tactics
of
the
slytherin
team
to
upset
him
before
they
even
got
on
to
the
pitch
harry
of
course
had
endured
their
snide
comments
for
over
four
years
so
whispers
of
Hey
Potty
I
heard
Warringtons
sworn
to
knock
you
off
your
broom
on
Saturday
far
from
chilling
his
blood
made
him
laugh
warringtons
aims
so
pathetic
Id
be
more
worried
if
he
was
aiming
for
the
person
next
to
me
he
retorted
which
made
Ron
and
Hermione
laugh
and
wiped
the
smirk
off
Pansy
Parkinsons
face
but
Ron
had
never
endured
a
relentless
campaign
of
insults
jeers
and
intimidation
when
slytherins
some
of
them
seventh-years
and
considerably
larger
than
he
was
muttered
as
they
passed
in
the
corridors
Got
your
bed
booked
in
the
hospital
wing
Weasley
he
didnt
laugh
but
turned
a
delicate
shade
of
green
when
Draco
Malfoy
imitated
Ron
dropping
the
Quaffle
which
he
did
whenever
they
came
within
sight
of
each
other
Rons
ears
glowed
red
and
his
hands
shook
so
badly
that
he
was
likely
to
drop
whatever
he
was
holding
at
the
time
too
october
extinguished
itself
in
a
rush
of
howling
winds
and
driving
rain
and
November
arrived
cold
as
frozen
iron
with
hard
frosts
every
morning
and
icy
draughts
that
bit
at
exposed
hands
and
faces
the
skies
and
the
ceiling
of
the
Great
Hall
turned
a
pale
pearly
grey
the
mountains
around
Hogwarts
were
snowcapped
and
the
temperature
in
the
castle
dropped
so
low
that
many
students
wore
their
thick
protective
dragon
skin
gloves
in
the
corridors
between
lessons
the
morning
of
the
match
dawned
bright
and
cold
when
Harry
awoke
he
looked
round
at
Rons
bed
and
saw
him
sitting
bolt
upright
his
arms
around
his
knees
staring
fixedly
into
space
you
all
right
said
Harry
ron
nodded
but
did
not
speak
harry
was
reminded
forcibly
of
the
time
Ron
had
accidentally
put
a
slug-vomiting
Charm
on
himself
he
looked
just
as
pale
and
sweaty
as
he
had
done
then
not
to
mention
as
reluctant
to
open
his
mouth
you
just
need
some
breakfast
Harry
said
bracingly
cmon
the
Great
Hall
was
filling
up
fast
when
they
arrived
the
talk
louder
and
the
mood
more
exuberant
than
usual
as
they
passed
the
Slytherin
table
there
was
an
upsurge
of
noise
harry
looked
round
and
saw
that
in
addition
to
the
usual
green
and
silver
scarves
and
hats
every
one
of
them
was
wearing
a
silver
badge
in
the
shape
of
what
seemed
to
be
a
crown
for
some
reason
many
of
them
waved
at
Ron
laughing
uproariously
harry
tried
to
see
what
was
written
on
the
badges
as
he
walked
by
but
he
was
too
concerned
to
get
Ron
past
their
table
quickly
to
linger
long
enough
to
read
them
they
received
a
rousing
welcome
at
the
Gryffindor
table
where
everyone
was
wearing
red
and
gold
but
far
from
raising
Rons
spirits
the
cheers
seemed
to
sap
the
last
of
his
morale
he
collapsed
on
to
the
nearest
bench
looking
as
though
he
were
facing
his
final
meal
i
mustve
been
mental
to
do
this
he
said
in
a
croaky
whisper
mental
dont
be
thick
said
Harry
firmly
passing
him
a
choice
of
cereals
youre
going
to
be
fine
its
normal
to
be
nervous
im
rubbish
croaked
Ron
im
lousy
i
cant
play
to
save
my
life
what
was
I
thinking
get
a
grip
said
Harry
sternly
look
at
that
save
you
made
with
your
foot
the
other
day
even
fred
and
George
said
it
was
brilliant
ron
turned
a
tortured
face
to
Harry
that
was
an
accident
he
whispered
miserably
i
didnt
mean
to
do
it
I
slipped
off
my
broom
when
none
of
you
were
looking
and
when
I
was
trying
to
get
back
on
I
kicked
the
Quaffle
by
accident
well
said
Harry
recovering
quickly
from
this
unpleasant
surprise
a
few
more
accidents
like
that
and
the
games
in
the
bag
isnt
it
hermione
and
Ginny
sat
down
opposite
them
wearing
red
and
gold
scarves
gloves
and
rosettes
howre
you
feeling
ginny
asked
Ron
who
was
now
staring
into
the
dregs
of
milk
at
the
bottom
of
his
empty
cereal
bowl
as
though
seriously
considering
attempting
to
drown
himself
in
them
hes
just
nervous
said
Harry
well
thats
a
good
sign
I
never
feel
you
perform
as
well
in
exams
if
youre
not
a
bit
nervous
said
Hermione
heartily
hello
said
a
vague
and
dreamy
voice
from
behind
them
harry
looked
up
Luna
Lovegood
had
drifted
over
from
the
Ravenclaw
table
many
people
were
staring
at
her
and
a
few
were
openly
laughing
and
pointing
she
had
managed
to
procure
a
hat
shaped
like
a
life-size
lions
head
which
was
perched
precariously
on
her
head
im
supporting
Gryffindor
said
Luna
pointing
un
necessarily
at
her
hat
look
what
it
does
she
reached
up
and
tapped
the
hat
with
her
wand
it
opened
its
mouth
wide
and
gave
an
extremely
realiztic
roar
that
made
everyone
in
the
vicinity
jump
its
good
isnt
it
said
Luna
happily
i
wanted
to
have
it
chewing
up
a
serpent
to
represent
slytherin
you
know
but
there
wasnt
time
anyway
good
luck
Ronald
she
drifted
away
they
had
not
quite
recovered
from
the
shock
of
Lunas
hat
before
Angelina
came
hurrying
towards
them
accompanied
by
Katie
and
Alicia
whose
eyebrows
had
mercifully
been
returned
to
normal
by
Madam
Pomfrey
when
youre
ready
she
said
were
going
to
go
straight
down
to
the
pitch
check
out
conditions
and
change
well
be
there
in
a
bit
Harry
assured
her
rons
just
got
to
have
some
breakfast
it
became
clear
after
ten
minutes
however
that
Ron
was
not
capable
of
eating
anything
more
and
Harry
thought
it
best
to
get
him
down
to
the
changing
rooms
as
they
rose
from
the
table
hermione
got
up
too
and
taking
Harrys
arm
she
drew
him
to
one
side
dont
let
Ron
see
whats
on
those
Slytherins
badges
she
whispered
urgently
harry
looked
questioningly
at
her
but
she
shook
her
head
warningly
Ron
had
just
ambled
over
to
them
looking
lost
and
desperate
good
luck
Ron
said
Hermione
standing
on
tiptoe
and
kissing
him
on
the
cheek
and
you
harry
ron
seemed
to
come
to
himself
slightly
as
they
walked
back
across
the
Great
Hall
he
touched
the
spot
on
his
face
where
Hermione
had
kissed
him
looking
puzzled
as
though
he
was
not
quite
sure
what
had
just
happened
he
seemed
too
distracted
to
notice
much
around
him
but
Harry
cast
a
curious
glance
at
the
crown-shaped
badges
as
they
passed
the
Slytherin
table
and
this
time
he
made
out
the
words
etched
on
to
them
weasley
Is
Our
King
with
an
unpleasant
feeling
that
this
could
mean
nothing
good
he
hurried
Ron
across
the
entrance
Hall
down
the
stone
steps
and
out
into
the
icy
air
the
frosty
grass
crunched
under
their
feet
as
they
hurried
down
the
sloping
lawns
towards
the
stadium
there
was
no
wind
at
all
and
the
sky
was
a
uniform
pearly
white
which
meant
that
visibility
would
be
good
without
the
drawback
of
direct
sunlight
in
the
eyes
harry
pointed
out
these
encouraging
factors
to
Ron
as
they
walked
but
he
was
not
sure
that
Ron
was
listening
angelina
had
changed
already
and
was
talking
to
the
rest
of
the
team
when
they
entered
harry
and
Ron
pulled
on
their
robes
Ron
attempted
to
do
his
up
back-to-front
for
several
minutes
before
Alicia
took
pity
on
him
and
went
to
help
then
sat
down
to
listen
to
the
pre-match
talk
while
the
babble
of
voices
outside
grew
steadily
louder
as
the
crowd
came
pouring
out
of
the
castle
towards
the
pitch
okay
Ive
only
just
found
out
the
final
line-up
for
Slytherin
said
Angelina
consulting
a
piece
of
parchment
last
years
Beaters
Derrick
and
Bole
have
left
but
it
looks
as
though
Montagues
replaced
them
with
the
usual
gorillas
rather
than
anyone
who
can
fly
particularly
well
theyre
two
blokes
called
Crabbe
and
goyle
I
dont
know
much
about
them
we
do
said
Harry
and
Ron
together
well
they
dont
look
bright
enough
to
tell
one
end
of
a
broom
from
the
other
said
Angelina
pocketing
her
parchment
but
then
I
was
always
surprised
Derrick
and
Bole
managed
to
find
their
way
on
to
the
pitch
without
signposts
crabbe
and
Goyle
are
in
the
same
mould
Harry
assured
her
they
could
hear
hundreds
of
footsteps
mounting
the
banked
benches
of
the
spectators
stands
some
people
were
singing
though
Harry
could
not
make
out
the
words
he
was
starting
to
feel
nervous
but
he
knew
his
butterflies
were
as
nothing
compared
to
Rons
who
was
clutching
his
stomach
and
staring
straight
ahead
again
his
jaw
set
and
his
complexion
pale
grey
its
time
said
Angelina
in
a
hushed
voice
looking
at
her
watch
cmon
everyone
good
luck
the
team
rose
shouldered
their
brooms
and
marched
in
single
file
out
of
the
changing
room
and
into
the
dazzling
sunlight
a
roar
of
sound
greeted
them
in
which
Harry
could
still
hear
singing
though
it
was
muffled
by
the
cheers
and
whistles
the
Slytherin
team
was
standing
waiting
for
them
they
too
were
wearing
those
silver
crownshaped
badges
the
new
Captain
Montague
was
built
along
the
same
lines
as
Dudley
Dursley
with
massive
forearms
like
hairy
hams
behind
him
lurked
Crabbe
and
Goyle
almost
as
large
blinking
stupidly
in
the
sunlight
swinging
their
new
Beaters
bats
malfoy
stood
to
one
side
the
sunlight
gleaming
on
his
white-blond
head
he
caught
Harrys
eye
and
smirked
tapping
the
crown-shaped
badge
on
his
chest
captains
shake
hands
ordered
the
referee
Madam
Hooch
as
Angelina
and
Montague
reached
each
other
harry
could
tell
that
Montague
was
trying
to
crush
Angelinas
fingers
though
she
did
not
wince
mount
your
brooms
madam
Hooch
placed
her
whistle
in
her
mouth
and
blew
the
balls
were
released
and
the
fourteen
players
shot
upwards
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
Harry
saw
Ron
streak
off
towards
the
goal
hoops
harry
zoomed
higher
dodging
a
Bludger
and
set
off
on
a
wide
lap
of
the
pitch
gazing
around
for
a
glint
of
gold
on
the
other
side
of
the
stadium
draco
Malfoy
was
doing
exactly
the
same
and
its
Johnson
Johnson
with
the
Quaffle

Bell
Katie
Bell
of
Gryffindor
reverse-passes
to
Alicia
Spinnet
and
Spinnets
away
lee
Jordans
commentary
rang
through
the
stadium
and
Harry
listened
as
hard
as
he
could
through
the
wind
whistling
in
his
ears
and
the
din
of
the
crowd
all
yelling
and
booing
and
singing
dodges
Warrington
avoids
a
Bludger
close
call
Alicia
and
the
crowd
are
loving
this
just
listen
to
them
whats
that
theyre
singing
and
as
Lee
paused
to
listen
the
song
rose
loud
and
clear
from
the
sea
of
green
and
silver
in
the
slytherin
section
of
the
stands
weasley
cannot
save
a
thing
He
cannot
block
a
single
ring
Thats
why
Slytherins
all

our
King
weasley

born
in
a
bin
He
always
lets
the
Quaffle
in
Weasley
will
make
sure
we
win
weasley
is
our
King
and
Alicia
passes
back
to
Angelina
lee
shouted
and
as
Harry
swerved
his
insides
boiling
at
what
he
had
just
heard
he
knew
Lee
was
trying
to
drown
out
the
words
of
the
song
come
on
now
Angelina
looks
like
shes
got
just
the
Keeper
to
beat
she
shoots
she
aaaah
bletchley
the
Slytherin
Keeper
had
saved
the
goal
he
threw
the
Quaffle
to
Warrington
who
sped
off
with
it
zig-zagging
in
between
Alicia
and
Katie
the
singing
from
below
grew
louder
and
louder
as
he
drew
nearer
and
nearer
Ron
weasley
is
our
King
Weasley
is
our
King
He
always
lets
the
Quaffle
in
Weasley
is
our
King
harry
could
not
help
himself
abandoning
his
search
for
the
Snitch
he
wheeled
around
to
watch
ron
a
lone
figure
at
the
far
end
of
the
pitch
hovering
before
the
three
goal
hoops
while
the
massive
Warrington
pelted
towards
him
and
its
Warrington
with
the
Quaffle
Warrington
heading
for
goal
hes
out
of
Bludger
range
with
just
the
Keeper
ahead
a
great
swell
of
song
rose
from
the
Slytherin
stands
below
weasley
cannot
save
a
thing
He
cannot
block
a
single
ring
so
its
the
first
test
for
new
Gryffindor
Keeper
Weasley
brother
of
Beaters
Fred
and
George
and
a
promising
new
talent
on
the
team
come
on
Ron
but
the
scream
of
delight
came
from
the
Slytherins
end
Ron
had
dived
wildly
his
arms
wide
and
the
Quaffle
had
soared
between
them
straight
through
Rons
central
hoop
slytherin
score
came
Lees
voice
amid
the
cheering
and
booing
from
the
crowds
below
so
thats
ten-nil
to
Slytherin
bad
luck
Ron
the
Slytherins
sang
even
louder
weasley
was
born
in
A
bin
he
always
lets
the
quaffle
in
and
Gryffindor
back
in
possession
and
its
Katie
Bell
tanking
up
the
pitch
cried
Lee
valiantly
though
the
singing
was
now
so
deafening
that
he
could
hardly
make
himself
heard
above
it
weasley
will
make
sure
we
win
weasley
is
our
king
harry
what
are
you
doing
screamed
Angelina
soaring
past
him
to
keep
up
with
katie
get
going
harry
realized
he
had
been
stationary
in
midair
for
over
a
minute
watching
the
progress
of
the
match
without
sparing
a
thought
for
the
whereabouts
of
the
Snitch
horrified
he
went
into
a
dive
and
started
circling
the
pitch
again
staring
around
trying
to
ignore
the
chorus
now
thundering
through
the
stadium
weasley
is
our
king
weasley
is
our
king
there
was
no
sign
of
the
Snitch
anywhere
he
looked
Malfoy
was
still
circling
the
stadium
just
as
he
was
they
passed
one
another
midway
around
the
pitch
going
in
opposite
directions
and
harry
heard
Malfoy
singing
loudly
weasley
was
born
in
A
bin
and
its
Warrington
again
bellowed
Lee
who
passes
to
Pucey
Puceys
off
past
Spinnet
come

now
Angelina
you
can
take
him
turns
out
you
cant
but
nice
Bludger
from
Fred
weasley
I
mean
George
Weasley
oh
who
cares
one
of
them
anyway
and
Warrington
drops
the
Quaffle
and
Katie
Bell
er
drops
it
too
so
thats
Montague
with
the
Quaffle
Slytherin
captain
Montague
takes
the
Quaffle
and
hes
off
up
the
pitch
come
on
now
Gryffindor
block
him
harry
zoomed
around
the
end
of
the
stadium
behind
the
Slytherin
goal
hoops
willing
himself
not
to
look
at
what
was
going
on
at
Rons
end
as
he
sped
past
the
Slytherin
Keeper
he
heard
bletchley
singing
along
with
the
crowd
below
weasley
cannot
save
A
thing
and
Puceys
dodged
Alicia
again
and
hes
heading
straight
for
goal
stop
it
Ron
harry
did
not
have
to
look
to
see
what
had
happened
there
was
a
terrible
groan
from
the
gryffindor
end
coupled
with
fresh
screams
and
applause
from
the
Slytherins
looking
down
harry
saw
the
pug-faced
Pansy
Parkinson
right
at
the
front
of
the
stands
her
back
to
the
pitch
as
she
conducted
the
Slytherin
supporters
who
were
roaring
thats
why
slytherins
all
sing
weasley
isour
king
but
twenty-nil
was
nothing
there
was
still
time
for
Gryffindor
to
catch
up
or
catch
the
Snitch
few
goals
and
they
would
be
in
the
lead
as
usual
Harry
assured
himself
bobbing
and
weaving
through
the
other
players
in
pursuit
of
something
shiny
that
turned
out
to
be
Montagues
watchstrap
but
Ron
let
in
two
more
goals
there
was
an
edge
of
panic
in
Harrys
desire
to
find
the
Snitch
now
if
he
could
just
get
it
soon
and
finish
the
game
quickly
and
Katie
Bell
of
Gryffindor
dodges
Pucey
ducks
Montague
nice
swerve
Katie
and
she
throws
to
Johnson
Angelina
Johnson
takes
the
Quaffle
shes
past
Warrington
shes
heading
for
goal
come
on
now
Angelina
gryffindor
score
its
forty-ten
forty-ten
to
Slytherin
and
pucey
has
the
Quaffle
harry
could
hear
Lunas
ludicrous
lion
hat
roaring
amidst
the
Gryffindor
cheers
and
felt
heartened
only
thirty
points
in
it
that
was
nothing
they
could
pull
back
easily
harry
ducked
a
bludger
that
Crabbe
had
sent
rocketing
in
his
direction
and
resumed
his
frantic
scouring
of
the
pitch
for
the
Snitch
keeping
one
eye
on
Malfoy
in
case
he
showed
signs
of
having
spotted
it
but
malfoy
like
him
was
continuing
to
soar
around
the
stadium
searching
fruitlessly
Pucey
throws
to
Warrington
Warrington
to
Montague
Montague
back
to
Pucey
Johnson
intervenes
Johnson
takes
the
Quaffle
Johnson
to
Bell
this
looks
good
I
mean
bad
Bells
hit
by
a
Bludger
from
Goyle
of
Slytherin
and
its
Pucey
in
possession
weasley
was
born
in
A
bin
he
always
lets
the
quaffle
in
weasley
will
make
sure
we
win
but
Harry
had
seen
it
at
last
the
tiny
fluttering
Golden
Snitch
was
hovering
feet
from
the
ground
at
the
Slytherin
end
of
the
pitch
he
dived
in
a
matter
of
seconds
Malfoy
was
streaking
out
of
the
sky
on
Harrys
left
a
green
and
silver
blur
lying
flat
on
his
broom
the
Snitch
skirted
the
foot
of
one
of
the
goal
hoops
and
scooted
off
towards
the
other
side
of
the
stands
its
change
of
direction
suited
Malfoy
who
was
nearer
Harry
pulled
his
Firebolt
around
he
and
Malfoy
were
now
neck
and
neck
feet
from
the
ground
Harry
lifted
his
right
hand
from
his
broom
stretching
towards
the
snitch
to
his
right
Malfoys
arm
extended
too
was
reaching
groping
it
was
over
in
two
breathless
desperate
windswept
seconds
Harrys
fingers
closed
around
the
tiny
struggling
ball
Malfoys
fingernails
scrabbled
the
back
of
Harrys
hand
hopelessly
Harry
pulled
his
broom
upwards
holding
the
struggling
ball
in
his
hand
and
the
Gryffindor
spectators
screamed
their
approval
they
were
saved
it
did
not
matter
that
Ron
had
let
in
those
goals
nobody
would
remember
as
long
as
Gryffindor
had
won
wham
a
Bludger
hit
Harry
squarely
in
the
small
of
the
back
and
he
flew
forwards
off
his
broom
luckily
he
was
only
five
or
six
feet
above
the
ground
having
dived
so
low
to
catch
the
Snitch
but
he
was
winded
all
the
same
as
he
landed
flat
on
his
back
on
the
frozen
pitch
he
heard
madam
Hoochs
shrill
whistle
an
uproar
in
the
stands
compounded
of
catcalls
angry
yells
and
jeering
a
thud
then
Angelinas
frantic
voice
are
you
all
right
course
I
am
said
Harry
grimly
taking
her
hand
and
allowing
her
to
pull
him
to
his
feet
madam
Hooch
was
zooming
towards
one
of
the
Slytherin
players
above
him
though
he
could
not
see
who
it
was
from
this
angle
it
was
that
thug
Crabbe
said
Angelina
angrily
he
whacked
the
Bludger
at
you
the
moment
he
saw
youd
got
the
Snitch
but
we
won
Harry
we
won
harry
heard
a
snort
from
behind
him
and
turned
around
still
holding
the
Snitch
tightly
in
his
hand
Draco
Malfoy
had
landed
close
by
white-faced
with
fury
he
was
still
managing
to
sneer
saved
Weasleys
neck
havent
you
he
said
to
Harry
ive
never
seen
a
worse
Keeper
but
then
he
was
born
in
a
bin
did
you
like
my
lyrics
Potter
harry
didnt
answer
he
turned
away
to
meet
the
rest
of
the
team
who
were
now
landing
one
by
one
yelling
and
punching
the
air
in
triumph
all
except
Ron
who
had
dismounted
from
his
broom
over
by
the
goalposts
and
seemed
to
be
making
his
way
slowly
back
to
the
changing
rooms
alone
we
wanted
to
write
another
couple
of
verses
malfoy
called
as
Katie
and
Alicia
hugged
Harry
but
we
couldnt
find
rhymes
for
fat
and
ugly
we
wanted
to
sing
about
his
mother
see
talk
about
sour
grapes
said
Angelina
casting
Malfoy
a
disgusted
look
we
couldnt
fit
in
useless
loser
either
for
his
father
you
know
fred
and
George
had
realized
what
Malfoy
was
talking
about
halfway
through
shaking
Harrys
hand
they
stiffened
looking
round
at
Malfoy
leave
it
said
Angelina
at
once
taking
Fred
by
the
arm
leave
it
Fred
let
him
yell
hes
just
sore
he
lost
the
jumped-up
little
but
you
like
the
Weasleys
dont
you
Potter
said
Malfoy
sneering
spend
holidays
there
and
everything
dont
you
cant
see
how
you
stand
the
stink
but
I
suppose
when
youve
been
dragged
up
by
Muggles
even
the
Weasleys
hovel
smells
okay
harry
grabbed
hold
of
George
meanwhile
it
was
taking
the
combined
efforts
of
Angelina
alicia
and
Katie
to
stop
Fred
leaping
on
Malfoy
who
was
laughing
openly
harry
looked
around
for
Madam
Hooch
but
she
was
still
berating
Crabbe
for
his
illegal
Sludger
attack
or
perhaps
said
Malfoy
leering
as
he
backed
away
you
can
remember
what
your
mothers
house
stank
like
Potter
and
Weasleys
pigsty
reminds
you
of
it
harry
was
not
aware
of
releasing
George
all
he
knew
was
that
a
second
later
both
of
them
were
sprinting
towards
Malfoy
he
had
completely
forgotten
that
all
the
teachers
were
watching
all
he
wanted
to
do
was
cause
Malfoy
as
much
pain
as
possible
with
no
time
to
draw
out
his
wand
he
merely
drew
back
the
fist
clutching
the
Snitch
and
sank
it
as
hard
as
he
could
into
Malfoys
stomach
harry
harry
george
no
he
could
hear
girls
voices
screaming
Malfoy
yelling
George
swearing
a
whistle
blowing
and
the
bellowing
of
the
crowd
around
him
but
he
did
not
care
not
until
somebody
in
the
vicinity
yelled
Impedimenta
and
he
was
knocked
over
backwards
by
the
force
of
the
spell
did
he
abandon
the
attempt
to
punch
every
inch
of
Malfoy
he
could
reach
what
do
you
think
youre
doing
screamed
Madam
Hooch
as
Harry
leapt
to
his
feet
it
seemed
to
have
been
her
who
had
hit
him
with
the
Impediment
Jinx
she
was
holding
her
whistle
in
one
hand
and
a
wand
in
the
other
her
broom
lay
abandoned
several
feet
away
malfoy
was
curled
up
on
the
ground
whimpering
and
moaning
his
nose
bloody
George
was
sporting
a
swollen
lip
Fred
was
still
being
forcibly
restrained
by
the
three
Chasers
and
Crabbe
was
cackling
in
the
background
ive
never
seen
behavior
like
it
back
up
to
the
castle
both
of
you
and
straight
to
your
Head
of
Houses
office
go
now
harry
and
George
turned
on
their
heels
and
marched
off
the
pitch
both
panting
neither
saying
a
word
to
the
other
the
howling
and
jeering
of
the
crowd
grew
fainter
and
fainter
until
they
reached
the
Entrance
Hall
where
they
could
hear
nothing
except
the
sound
of
their
own
footsteps
harry
became
aware
that
something
was
still
struggling
in
his
right
hand
the
knuckles
of
which
he
had
bruised
against
Malfoys
jaw
looking
down
he
saw
the
Snitchs
silver
wings
protruding
from
between
his
fingers
struggling
for
release
they
had
barely
reached
the
door
of
Professor
McGonagalls
office
when
she
came
marching
along
the
corridor
behind
them
she
was
wearing
a
Gryffindor
scarf
but
tore
it
from
her
throat
with
shaking
hands
as
she
strode
towards
them
looking
livid
in
she
said
furiously
pointing
to
the
door
harry
and
George
entered
she
strode
around
behind
her
desk
and
faced
them
quivering
with
rage
as
she
threw
the
Gryffindor
scarf
aside
on
to
the
floor
well
she
said
i
have
never
seen
such
a
disgraceful
exhibition
two
on
one
explain
yourselves
malfoy
provoked
us
said
Harry
stiffly
provoked
you
shouted
Professor
McGonagall
slamming
a
fist
on
to
her
desk
so
that
her
tartan
tin
slid
sideways
off
it
and
burst
open
littering
the
floor
with
Ginger
Newts
hed
just
lost
hadnt
he
of
course
he
wanted
to
provoke
you
but
what
on
earth
he
can
have
said
that
justified
what
you
two
he
insulted
my
parents
snarled
George
and
Harrys
mother
but
instead
of
leaving
it
to
Madam
Hooch
to
sort
out
you
two
decided
to
give
an
exhibition
of
muggle
dueling
did
you
bellowed
Professor
McGonagall
have
you
any
idea
what
youve
hem
hem
harry
and
George
both
wheeled
round
dolores
Umbridge
was
standing
in
the
doorway
wrapped
in
a
green
tweed
cloak
that
greatly
enhanced
her
resemblance
to
a
giant
toad
and
was
smiling
in
the
horrible
sickly
ominous
way
that
Harry
had
come
to
associate
with
imminent
misery
may
I
help
Professor
McGonagall
asked
Professor
Umbridge
in
her
most
poisonously
sweet
voice
blood
rushed
into
Professor
McGonagalls
face
help
she
repeated
in
a
constricted
voice
what
do
you
mean
help
professor
Umbridge
moved
forwards
into
the
office
still
smiling
her
sickly
smile
why
I
thought
you
might
be
grateful
for
a
little
extra
authority
harry
would
not
have
been
surprised
to
see
sparks
fly
from
Professor
McGonagalls
nostrils
you
thought
wrong
she
said
turning
her
back
on
Umbridge
now
you
two
had
better
listen
closely
i
do
not
care
what
provocation
Malfoy
offered
you
I
do
not
care
if
he
insulted
every
family
member
you
possess
your
behavior
was
disgusting
and
I
am
giving
each
of
you
a
weeks
worth
of
detentions
do
not
look
at
me
like
that
Potter
you
deserve
it
and
if
either
of
you
ever
hem
hem
professor
McGonagall
closed
her
eyes
as
though
praying
for
patience
as
she
turned
her
face
towards
Professor
Umbridge
again
yes
i
think
they
deserve
rather
more
than
detentions
said
Umbridge
smiling
still
more
broadly
professor
McGonagalls
eyes
flew
open
but
unfortunately
she
said
with
an
attempt
at
a
reciprocal
smile
that
made
her
look
as
though
she
had
lockjaw
it
is
what
I
think
that
counts
as
they
are
in
my
House
Dolores
well
actually
Minerva
simpered
Professor
Umbridge
I
think
youll
find
that
what
I
think
does
count
now
where
is
it
cornelius
just
sent
it
i
mean
she
gave
a
false
little
laugh
as
she
rummaged
in
her
handbag
the
Minister
just
sent
it
ah
yes
she
had
pulled
out
a
piece
of
parchment
which
she
now
unfurled
clearing
her
throat
fussily
before
starting
to
read
what
it
said
hem
hem
educational
Decree
Number
twenty-five
not
another
one
exclaimed
Professor
McGonagall
violently
well
yes
said
Umbridge
still
smiling
as
a
matter
of
fact
Minerva
it
was
you
who
made
me
see
that
we
needed
a
further
amendment
you
remember
how
you
overrode
me
when
I
was
unwilling
to
allow
the
Gryffindor
Quidditch
team
to
re-form
how
you
took
the
case
to
dumbledore
who
insisted
that
the
team
be
allowed
to
play
well
now
I
couldnt
have
that
contacted
the
Minister
at
once
and
he
quite
agreed
with
me
that
the
High
Inquisitor
has
to
have
the
power
to
strip
pupils
of
privileges
or
she
that
is
to
say
I
would
have
less
authority
than
common
teachers
and
you
see
now
dont
you
Minerva
how
right
I
was
in
attempting
to
stop
the
Gryffindor
team
re-forming
dreadful
tempers
anyway
I
was
reading
out
our
amendment
hem
hem
high
Inquisitor
will
henceforth
have
supreme
authority
over
all
punishments
sanctions
and
removal
of
privileges
pertaining
to
the
students
of
Hogwarts
and
the
power
to
alter
such
punishments
sanctions
and
removals
of
privileges
as
may
have
been
ordered
by
other
staff
members
signed
Cornelius
Fudge
Minister
for
Magic
Order
of
Merlin
First
class
etc
etc
she
rolled
up
the
parchment
and
put
it
back
into
her
handbag
still
smiling
so
i
really
think
I
will
have
to
ban
these
two
from
playing
Quidditch
ever
again
she
said
looking
from
Harry
to
George
and
back
again
harry
felt
the
Snitch
fluttering
madly
in
his
hand
ban
us
he
said
and
his
voice
sounded
strangely
distant
from
playing
ever
again
yes
mr.
Potter
I
think
a
lifelong
ban
ought
to
do
the
trick
said
Umbridge
her
smile
widening
still
further
as
she
watched
him
struggle
to
comprehend
what
she
had
said
you
and
mr.
Weasley
here
and
I
think
to
be
safe
this
young
mans
twin
ought
to
be
stopped
too
if
his
teammates
had
not
restrained
him
I
feel
sure
he
would
have
attacked
young
mr.
Malfoy
as
well
i
will
want
their
broomsticks
confiscated
of
course
I
shall
keep
them
safely
in
my
office
to
make
sure
there
is
no
infringement
of
my
ban
but
I
am
not
unreasonable
Professor
McGonagall
she
continued
turning
back
to
Professor
McGonagall
who
was
now
standing
as
still
as
though
carved
from
ice
staring
at
her
the
rest
of
the
team
can
continue
playing
I
saw
no
signs
of
violence
from
any
of
them
well
good
afternoon
to
you
and
with
a
look
of
the
utmost
satisfaction
Umbridge
left
the
room
leaving
a
horrified
silence
in
her
wake
banned
said
Angelina
in
a
hollow
voice
late
that
evening
in
the
common
room
banned
no
seeker
and
no
Beaters
what
on
earth
are
we
going
to
do
it
did
not
feel
as
though
they
had
won
the
match
at
all
everywhere
Harry
looked
there
were
disconsolate
and
angry
faces
the
team
themselves
were
slumped
around
the
fire
all
apart
from
ron
who
had
not
been
seen
since
the
end
of
the
match
its
just
so
unfair
said
Alicia
numbly
i
mean
what
about
Crabbe
and
that
Bludger
he
hit
after
the
whistle
had
been
blown
has
she
banned
him
no
said
Ginny
miserably
she
and
Hermione
were
sitting
on
either
side
of
Harry
he
just
got
lines
I
heard
Montague
laughing
about
it
at
dinner
and
banning
Fred
when
he
didnt
even
do
anything
said
Alicia
furiously
pummeling
her
knee
with
her
fist
its
not
my
fault
I
didnt
said
Fred
with
a
very
ugly
look
on
his
face
I
wouldve
pounded
the
little
scumbag
to
a
pulp
if
you
three
hadnt
been
holding
me
back
harry
stared
miserably
at
the
dark
window
snow
was
falling
the
Snitch
he
had
caught
earlier
was
now
zooming
around
and
around
the
common
room
people
were
watching
its
progress
as
though
hypnotized
and
Crookshanks
was
leaping
from
chair
to
chair
trying
to
catch
it
im
going
to
bed
said
Angelina
getting
slowly
t
o
her
feet
maybe
this
will
all
turn
out
to
have
been
a
bad
dream
maybe
Ill
wake
up
tomorrow
and
find
we
havent
played
yet
she
was
soon
followed
by
Alicia
and
Katie
fred
and
George
sloped
off
to
bed
some
time
later
glowering
at
everyone
they
passed
and
Ginny
went
not
long
after
that
only
Harry
and
hermione
were
left
beside
the
fire
have
you
seen
Ron
hermione
asked
in
a
low
voice
harry
shook
his
head
i
think
hes
avoiding
us
said
Hermione
where
d
o
you
think
he
but
at
that
precise
moment
there
was
a
creaking
sound
behind
them
as
the
Fat
Lady
swung
forwards
and
Ron
came
clambering
through
the
portrait
hole
he
was
very
pale
indeed
and
there
was
snow
in
his
hair
when
he
saw
Harry
and
Hermione
he
stopped
dead
in
his
tracks
where
have
you
been
said
Hermione
anxiously
springing
up
walking
Ron
mumbled
he
was
still
wearing
his
Quidditch
things
you
look
frozen
said
Hermione
come
and
sit
down
ron
walked
to
the
fireside
and
sank
into
the
chair
furthest
from
Harrys
not
looking
at
him
the
stolen
Snitch
zoomed
over
their
heads
im
sorry
Ron
mumbled
looking
at
his
feet
what
for
said
Harry
for
thinking
I
can
play
Quidditch
said
Ron
im
going
to
resign
first
thing
tomorrow
if
you
resign
said
Harry
testily
therell
only
be
three
players
left
on
the
team
and
when
Ron
looked
puzzled
he
said
Ive
been
given
a
lifetime
ban
sove
Fred
and
George
what
ron
yelped
hermione
told
him
the
full
story
Harry
could
not
bear
to
tell
it
again
when
she
had
finished
ron
looked
more
anguished
than
ever
this
is
all
my
fault
you
didnt
make
me
punch
Malfoy
said
Harry
angrily
if
I
wasnt
so
terrible
at
Quidditch
its
got
nothing
to
do
with
that
it
was
that
song
that
wound
me
up
it
wouldve
wound
anyone
up
hermione
got
up
and
walked
to
the
window
away
from
the
argument
watching
the
snow
swirling
down
against
the
pane
look
drop
it
will
you
harry
burst
out
its
bad
enough
without
you
blaming
yourself
for
everything
ron
said
nothing
but
sat
gazing
miserably
at
the
damp
hem
of
his
robes
after
a
while
he
said
in
a
dull
voice
This
is
the
worst
Ive
ever
felt
in
my
life
join
the
club
said
Harry
bitterly
well
said
Hermione
her
voice
trembling
slightly
i
can
think
of
one
thing
that
might
cheer
you
both
up
oh
yeah
said
Harry
skeptically
yeah
said
Hermione
turning
away
from
the
pitch-black
snow-flecked
window
a
broad
smile
spreading
across
her
face
hagrids
back
chapter
twenty
hagrids
Tale
harry
sprinted
up
to
the
boys
dormitories
to
fetch
the
Invisibility
Cloak
and
the
Marauders
map
from
his
trunk
he
was
so
quick
that
he
and
Ron
were
ready
to
leave
at
least
five
minutes
before
Hermione
hurried
back
down
from
the
girls
dormitories
wearing
scarf
gloves
and
one
of
her
own
knobbly
elf
hats
well
its
cold
out
there
she
said
defensively
as
Ron
clicked
his
tongue
impatiently
they
crept
through
the
portrait
hole
and
covered
themselves
hastily
in
the
Cloak
Ron
had
grown
so
much
he
now
needed
to
crouch
to
prevent
his
feet
showing
then
moving
slowly
and
cautiously
they
proceeded
down
the
many
staircases
pausing
at
intervals
to
check
on
the
map
for
signs
of
Filch
or
Mrs
norris
they
were
lucky
they
saw
nobody
but
Nearly
Headless
Nick
who
was
gliding
along
absent-mindedly
humming
something
that
sounded
horribly
like
weasley
is
our
King
they
crept
across
the
Entrance
Hall
and
out
into
the
silent
snowy
grounds
with
a
great
leap
of
his
heart
Harry
saw
little
golden
squares
of
light
ahead
and
smoke
coiling
up
from
Hagrids
chimney
he
set
off
at
a
quick
march
the
other
two
jostling
and
bumping
along
behind
him
they
crunched
excitedly
through
the
thickening
snow
until
at
last
they
reached
the
wooden
front
door
when
Harry
raised
his
fist
and
knocked
three
times
a
dog
started
barking
frantically
inside
hagrid
its
us
harry
called
through
the
keyhole
shoulda
known
said
a
gruff
voice
they
beamed
at
each
other
under
the
Cloak
they
could
tell
by
Hagrids
voice
that
he
was
pleased
bin
home
three
seconds
out
the
way
Fang
out
the
way
yeh
dozy
dog
the
bolt
was
drawn
back
the
door
creaked
open
and
Hagrids
head
appeared
in
the
gap
hermione
screamed
merlins
beard

said
Hagrid
hastily
staring
wildly
over
their
heads
under
that
cloak

sorry
hermione
gasped
as
the
three
of
them
squeezed
past
Hagrid
into
the
house
and
pulled
the
Cloak
off
themselves
so
he
could
see
them
i
just
oh
Hagrid

nuthin

said
Hagrid
hastily
shutting
the
door
behind
them
and
hurrying
to
close
all
the
curtains
but
Hermione
continued
to
gaze
up
at
him
in
horror
hagrids
hair
was
matted
with
congealed
blood
and
his
left
eye
had
been
reduced
to
a
puffy
slit
amid
a
mass
of
purple
and
black
bruising
there
were
many
cuts
on
his
face
and
hands
some
of
them
still
bleeding
and
he
was
moving
gingerly
which
made
Harry
suspect
broken
ribs
it
was
obvious
that
he
had
only
just
got
home
a
thick
black
traveling
cloak
lay
over
the
back
of
a
chair
and
a
haversack
large
enough
to
carry
several
small
children
leaned
against
the
wall
inside
the
door
hagrid
himself
twice
the
size
of
a
normal
man
was
now
limping
over
to
the
fire
and
placing
a
copper
kettle
over
it
what
happened
to
you
harry
demanded
while
Fang
danced
around
them
all
trying
to
lick
their

Hagrid
firmly

cuppa

of

instead

Pomfrey
Hagrid
said
Hermione
anxiously
some
of
those
cuts

said
Hagrid
repressively
he
walked
across
to
the
enormous
wooden
table
that
stood
in
the
middle
of
his
cabin
and
twitched
aside
a
tea
towel
that
had
been
lying
on
it
underneath
was
a
raw
bloody
green-tinged
steak
slightly
larger
than
the
average
car
tire
youre

Hagrid
said
Ron
leaning
in
for
a
closer
look

looks
poisonous

sposed
ter
look
like
that
its
dragon
meat
Hagrid
said
an
I
didn
get
it
ter

he
picked
up
the
steak
and
slapped
it
over
the
left
side
of
his
face
greenish
blood
trickled
down
into
his
beard
as
he
gave
a
soft
moan
of
satisfaction
thas

with

dragon
steak
and
it
slid
squelchily
on
to
his
chest

said
Hagrid
catching
the
steak
before

reached
his
belt

slapping

back
over
his

Hagrid
surveying

sternly
with
the
eye
that

not
hidden
by
the
steak

of
obvious
said
Ron
harry
nodded
hagrid
glared
at
them
then
snorted
threw
the
steak
back
on
to
the
table
and
strode
over
to
the
kettle
which
was
now
whistling
never

kids

as

sat
down
at
the
table
hagrid
set

Ron

Hagrid
darkly

steak
a
little
so
that

bruising

Dementors
hagrid
choked
in
his
mug
and
dropped
his
steak
at
the
same
time
a
large
quantity
of
spit
tea
and
dragon
blood
was
sprayed
over
the
table
as
Hagrid
coughed
and
spluttered
and
the
steak
slid
with
a
soft
splat
on
to
the
floor
whadda

Hagrid

open
eye
harry

right
back
an
expression
of
innocent
determination
on
his
face
oh

Hagrid
said
in
a
resigned
voice
he
bent
down
and
tugged
the
dragon
steak
out
of
Fangs
mouth
oh
Hagrid
dont
its
not
hygien
Hermione
began
but
Hagrid
had
already
slapped
the
meat
back
over
his
swollen
eye
he
took
another
fortifying
gulp
of
tea
then
said
Well

after

ended
madame
Maxime
went
with
you
then
hermione
interjected
yeah
thas
righ
said
Hagrid
and
a
softened
expression
appeared
on
the
few
inches
of
face
that
were
not
obscured
by
beard
or
green
steak
yeah
it
was
jus
the
pair
of
us
an
Ill
tell
yeh
this
shes
not
afraid
of
roughin
it
Olympe
yeh
know
shes
a
fine
well-dressed
woman
an
knowin
where
we
was
goin
I
wondered
ow
shed
feel
abou
clamberin
over
boulders
an
sleepin
in
caves
an
tha
bu
she
never
complained
once
you
knew
where
you
were
going
harry
repeated
you
knew
where
the
giants
were
well
Dumbledore
knew
an
he
told
us
said
Hagrid
are
they
hidden
asked
Ron
is
it
a
secret
where
they
are
not
really
said
Hagrid
shaking
his
shaggy
head
its
jus
that
mos
wizards
aren
bothered
where
they
ares
long
as
its
a
good
long
way
away
but
where
they
ares
very
difficult
ter
get
ter
fer
humans
anyway
so
we
needed
Dumbledores
instructions
took
us
abou
a
month
ter
get
there
a
month
said
Ron
as
though
he
had
never
heard
o
f
a
journey
lasting
such
a
ridiculously
long
time
but
why
couldnt
you
just
grab
a
Portkey
or
something
there
was
an
odd
expression
in
Hagrids
unobscured
eye
as
he
surveyed
Ron
it
was
almost
pitying
were
bein
watched
Ron
he
said
gruffly
what
dyou
mean
yeh
don
understand
said
Hagrid
the
Ministrys
keepin
an
eye
on
Dumbledore
an
anyone
they
reckons
in
league
with
im
an
we
know
about
that
said
Harry
quickly
keen
to
hear
the
rest
of
Hagrids
story
we
know
about
the
Ministry
watching
Dumbledore
so
you
couldnt
use
magic
to
get
there
asked
Ron
looking
thunderstruck
you
had
to
act
like
muggles
all
the
way
well
not
exactly
all
the
way
said
Hagrid
cagily
we
jus
had
ter
be
careful
cause
Olympe
an
me
we
stick
out
a
bit
ron
made
a
stifled
noise
somewhere
between
a
snort
and
a
sniff
and
hastily
took
a
gulp
of
tea
so
were
not
hard
ter
follow
we
was
pretendin
we
was
goin
on
holiday
together
so
we
got
inter
France
an
we
made
like
we
was
headin
fer
where
Olympes
school
is
cause
we
knew
we
was
bein
tailed
by
someone
from
the
Ministry
we
had
to
go
slow
cause
Im
not
really
sposed
ter
use
magic
an
we
knew
the
Ministryd
be
lookin
fer
a
reason
ter
run
us
in
but
we
managed
ter
give
the
berk
tailin
us
the
slip
round
abou
Dee-John
ooooh
Dijon
said
Hermione
excitedly
ive
been
there
on
holiday
did
you
see
she
fell
silent
at
the
look
on
Rons
face
we
chanced
a
bit
o
magic
after
that
an
it
wasn
a
bad
journey
ran
inter
a
couple
o
mad
trolls
on
the
Polish
border
an
I
had
a
sligh
disagreement
with
a
vampire
in
a
pub
in
Minsk
bu
apart
from
tha
couldnta
bin
smoother
an
then
we
reached
the
place
an
we
started
trekkin
up
through
the
mountains
lookin
fer
signs
of
em
we
had
ter
lay
off
the
magic
once
we
got
near
em
partly
cause
they
don
like
wizards
an
we
didn
want
ter
put
their
backs
up
too
soon
an
partly
cause
Dumbledore
had
warned
us
You
know-Who
was
bound
ter
be
after
the
giants
an
all
said
it
was
odds
on
hed
sent
a
messenger
off
ter
them
already
told
us
ter
be
very
careful
of
drawin
attention
ter
ourselves
as
we
got
nearer
in
case
there
was
Death
Eaters
around
hagrid
paused
for
a
long
draught
of
tea
go
on
said
Harry
urgently
found
em
said
Hagrid
baldly
went
over
a
ridge
one
nigh
an
there
they
was
spread
ou
underneath
us
little
fires
burnin
below
an
huge
shadows
it
was
like
watchin
bits
o
the
mountain
movin
how
big
are
they
asked
Ron
in
a
hushed
voice
bout
twenty
feet
said
Hagrid
casually
some
o
the
bigger
ones
mighta
bin
twenty-five
and
how
many
were
there
asked
Harry
i
reckon
abou
seventy
or
eighty
said
Hagrid
is
that
all
said
Hermione
yep
said
Hagrid
sadly
eighty
left
an
there
was
loads
once
musta
bin
a
hundred
diffrent
tribes
from
all
over
the
world
bu
theyve
bin
dyin
out
fer
ages
wizards
killed
a
few
o
course
bu
mostly
they
killed
each
other
an
now
theyre
dyin
out
faster
than
ever
theyre
not
made
ter
live
bunched
up
together
like
tha
dumbledore
says
its
our
fault
it
was
the
wizards
who
forced
em
to
go
an
made
em
live
a
good
long
way
from
us
an
they
had
no
choice
bu
ter
stick
together
fer
their
own
protection
so
said
Harry
you
saw
them
and
then
what
well
we
waited
till
morning
didn
want
ter
go
sneakin
up
on
em
in
the
dark
fer
our
own
safety
said
Hagrid
bout
three
in
the
mornin
they
fell
asleep
jus
where
they
was
sittin
we
didn
dare
sleep
fer
one
thing
we
wanted
ter
make
sure
none
of
em
woke
up
an
came
up
where
we
were
an
fer
another
the
snorin
was
unbelievable
caused
an
avalanche
near
mornin
anyway
once
it
was
light
we
wen
down
ter
see
em
just
like
that
said
Ron
looking
awestruck
you
just
walked
right
into
a
giant
camp
well
Dumbledored
told
us
how
ter
do
it
said
Hagrid
give
the
Gurg
gifts
show
some
respect
yeh
know
give
the
what
gifts
asked
Harry
oh
the
Gurg
means
the
chief
how
could
you
tell
which
one
was
the
Gurg
asked
Ron
hagrid
grunted
in
amusement
no
problem
he
said
he
was
the
biggest
the
ugliest
an
the
laziest
sittin
there
waitin
ter
be
brought
food
by
the
others
dead
goats
an
such
like
name
o
Karkus
id
put
him
at
twenty-two
twenty-three
feet
an
the
weight
o
a
couple
o
bull
elephants
skin
like
rhino
hide
an
all
and
you
just
walked
up
to
him
said
Hermione
breathlessly
well
down
ter
him
where
he
was
lyin
in
the
valley
they
was
in
this
dip
between
four
pretty
high
mountains
see
beside
a
mountain
lake
an
Karkus
was
lyin
by
the
lake
roarin
at
the
others
ter
feed
him
an
his
wife
olympe
an
I
went
down
the
mountainside
but
didnt
they
try
and
kill
you
when
they
saw
you
asked
Ron
incredulously
it
was
defnitely
on
some
o
their
minds
said
Ha
grid
shrugging
but
we
did
what
Dumbledore
told
us
ter
do
which
was
ter
hold
our
gift
up
high
an
keep
our
eyes
on
the
Gurg
an
ignore
the
others
so
thas
what
we
did
an
the
rest
of
em
went
quiet
an
watched
us
pass
an
we
got
right
up
ter
Karkuss
feet
an
we
bowed
an
put
our
present
down
in
front
o
him
what
do
you
give
a
giant
asked
Ron
eagerly
food
nah
he
can
get
food
all
righ
fer
himself
said
Hagrid
we
took
him
magic
giants
like
magic
jus
don
like
us
usin
it
against
em
anyway
that
firs
day
we
gave
im
a
branch
o
Gubraithian
fire
hermione
said
Wow
softly
but
Harry
and
Ron
both
frowned
in
puzzlement
a
branch
of
everlasting
fire
said
Hermione
irritably
you
ought
to
know
that
by
now
professor
Flitwicks
mentioned
it
at
least
twice
in
class
well
anyway
said
Hagrid
quickly
intervening
before
Ron
could
answer
back
Dumbledored
bewitched
this
branch
to
burn
fer
evermore
which
isn
somethin
any
wizard
could
do
an
so
I
lies
it
down
in
the
snow
by
Karkuss
feet
and
says
A
gift
to
the
Gurg
of
the
giants
from
Albus
Dumbledore
who
sends
his
respectful
greetings
and
what
did
Karkus
say
asked
Harry
eagerly
nothin
said
Hagrid
didn
speak
English
youre
kidding
didn
matter
said
Hagrid
imperturbably
Dumbledore
had
warned
us
tha
migh
happen
karkus
knew
enough
to
yell
fer
a
couple
o
giants
who
knew
our
lingo
an
they
translated
fer
us
and
did
he
like
the
present
asked
Ron
oh
yeah
it
went
down
a
storm
once
they
understood
what
it
was
said
Hagrid
turning
his
dragon
steak
over
to
press
the
cooler
side
to
his
swollen
eye
very
pleased
so
then
I
said
dumbledore
asks
the
Gurg
to
speak
with
his
messenger
when
he
returns
tomorrow
with
another
gift
why
couldnt
you
speak
to
them
that
day
asked
Hermione
dumbledore
wanted
us
ter
take
it
very
slow
said
Hagrid
let
em
see
we
kept
our
promises
well
come
back
tomorrow
with
another
present
an
then
we
do
come
back

firs
present
an
find
out
its
a
good
one
an
get
em
eager
fer
more
in
any
case
giants
like
Karkus
overload
em
with
information
an
theyll
kill
yeh
jus
to
simplify
things
so
we
bowed
outta
the
way
an
went
off
an
found
ourselves
a
nice
little
cave
ter
spend
that
night
in
an
the
followin
mornin
we
went
back
an
this
time
we
found
Karkus
sittin
up
waitin
fer
us
lookin
all
eager
and
you
talked
to
him
oh
yeah
firs
we
presented
him
with
a
nice
battle
helmet
goblin-made
an
indestructible
yeh
know
an
then
we
sat
down
an
we
talked
what
did
he
say
not
much
said
Hagrid
listened
mostly
bu
there
were
good
signs
hed
heard
o
dumbledore
heard
hed
argued
against
the
killin
o
the
last
giants
in
Britain
karkus
seemed
ter
be
quite
intrested
in
what
Dumbledore
had
ter
say
an
a
few
o
the
others
specially
the
ones
who
had
some
English
they
gathered
round
an
listened
too
we
were
hopeful
when
we
left
that
day
promised
ter
come
back
next
mornin
with
another
present
bu
that
night
it
all
wen
wrong
what
dyou
mean
said
Ron
quickly
well
like
I
say
theyre
not
meant
ter
live
together
giants
said
Hagrid
sadly
not
in
big
groups
like
that
they
can
help
themselves
they
half
kill
each
other
every
few
weeks
the
men
fight
each
other
an
the
women
fight
each
other
the
remnants
of
the
old
tribes
fight
each
other
an
thats
even
without
squabbles
over
food
an
the
best
fires
an
sleepin
spots
yehd
think
seein
as
how
their
whole
race
is
abou
finished
theyd
lay
off
each
other
bu
hagrid
sighed
deeply
that
night
a
fight
broke
out
we
saw
it
from
the
mouth
of
our
cave
lookin
down
on
the
valley
went
on
fer
hours
yeh
wouldn
believe
the
noise
an
when
the
sun
came
up
the
snow
was
scarlet
an
his
head
was
lyin
at
the
bottom
o
the
lake
whose
head
gasped
Hermione
karkuss
said
Hagrid
heavily
there
was
a
new
Gurg
Golgomath
he
sighed
deeply
well
we
hadn
bargained
on
a
new
Gurg
two
days
after
wed
made
friendly
contact
with
the
firs
one
an
we
had
a
funny
feelin
Golgomath
wouldn
be
so
keen
ter
listen
to
us
bu
we
had
ter
try
you
went
to
speak
to
him
asked
Ron
incredulously
after
youd
watched
him
rip
off
another
giants
head
course
we
did
said
Hagrid
we
hadn
gone
all
that
way
ter
give
up
after
two
days
we
wen
down
with
the
next
present
wed
meant
ter
give
ter
Karkus
i
knew
it
was
no

Id
opened
me
mouth
he
was
sitting
there
wearin
Karkuss
helmet
leerin
at
us
as
we
got
nearer
hes
massive
one
o
the
biggest
ones
there

an
a
necklace
o

great
roll
o
dragon
skin
an
said

fer
the
Gurg
of
the
giants
Nex

I

hangin
upside-down
in
the
air
by

feet
two
of
his
mates
had
grabbed
me
hermione
clapped
her
hands
to
her
mouth
how
did
you
get
out
of
that
asked
Harry

if
Olympe
hadn

said
Hagrid
she
pulled
out
her
wand
an
did
some
o
the
fastes
spellwork
Ive
ever
seen
ruddy
marvellous
hit
the
two
holdin
me
right
in
the
eyes
with
Conjunctivitus
Curses
an
they
dropped
me
straightaway
bu
we
were
in
trouble
then
cause
wed
used
magic
against
em
an
thats
what
giants
hate
abou
wizards
we
had
ter
leg
it
an
we
knew
there
was
no
way
we
was
going
ter
be
able
ter
march
inter
the
camp
again
blimey
Hagrid
said
Ron
quietly
so
how
come
its
taken
you
so
long
to
get
home
if
you
were
only
there
for
three
days
asked
hermione
we
didn
leave
after
three
days
said
Hagrid
looking
outraged
dumbledore
was
relyin
on
us
but
youve
just
said
there
was
no
way
you
could
go
back
not
by
daylight
we
couldn
no
we
just
had
ter
rethink
a
bit
spent
a
couple
o
days
lyin
low
up
in
the
cave
an
watchin
an
wha
we
saw
wasn
good
did
he
rip
off
more
heads
asked
Hermione
sounding
squeamish
no
said
Hagrid
I
wish
he
had
what
dyou
mean
i
mean
we
soon
found
out
he
didn
object
ter
all
wizards
just
us
death
Eaters
said
Harry
quickly
yep
said
Hagrid
darkly
couple
of
em
were
visitin
him
evry
day
bringin
gifts
ter
the
gurg
an
he
wasn
dangling
them
upside-down
how
dyou
know
they
were
Death
Eaters
said
Ron
because
I
recognized
one
of
em
Hagrid
growled
macnair
remember
him
bloke
they
sent
ter
kill
Buckbeak
maniac
he
is
likes
killin
as
much
as
Golgomath
no
wonder
they
were
gettin
on
so
well
so
Macnairs
persuaded
the
giants
to
join
You-Know-Who
said
Hermione
desperately
hold
yer
Hippogriffs
I
haven
finished
me
story
yet
said
Hagrid
indignantly
who
considering
he
had
not
wanted
to
tell
them
anything
in
the
first
place
now
seemed
to
be
rather
enjoying
himself
me
an
Olympe
talked
it
over
an
we
agreed
jus
cause
the
Gurg
looked
like
favorin
You-Know-Who
didn
mean
all
of
em
would
we
had
ter
try
an
persuade
some
o
the
others
the
ones
who
hadn
wanted
Golgomath
as
Gurg
how
could
you
tell
which
ones
they
were
asked
Ron
well
they
were
the
ones
bein
beaten
to
a
pulp
weren
they
said
Hagrid
patiently
the
ones
with
any
sense
were
keepin
outta
Golgomaths
way
hidin
out
in
caves
roun
the
gully
jus
like
we
were
so
we
decided
wed
go
pokin
round
the
caves
by
night
an
see
if
we
couldn
persuade
a
few
o
them
you
went
poking
around
dark
caves
looking
for
giants
said
Ron
with
awed
respect
in
his
voice
well
it
wasn
the
giants
who
worried
us
most
said
Hagrid
we
were
more
concerned
abou
the
Death
Eaters
dumbledore
had
told
us
before
we
wen
not
ter
tangle
with
em
if
we
could
avoid
it
an
the
trouble
was
they
knew
we
was
around
spect
Golgomath
told
em
abou
us
at
night
when
the
giants
were
sleepin
an
we
wanted
ter
be
creepin
inter
the
caves
Macnair
an
the
other
one
were
sneakin
round
the
mountains
lookin
fer
us
i
was
hard
put
to
stop
olympe
jumpin
out
at
em
said
Hagrid
the
corners
of
his
mouth
lifting
his
wild
beard
she
was
rarin
ter
attack
em
shes
somethin
when
shes
roused
Olympe
fiery
yeh
know
spect
its
the
French
in
her
hagrid
gazed
misty-eyed
into
the
fire
harry
allowed
him
thirty
seconds
of
reminiscence
before
clearing
his
throat
loudly
so
what
happened
did
you
ever
get
near
any
of
the
other
giants
what
oh
oh
yeah
we
did
yeah
on
the
third
night
after
Karkus
was
killed
we
crept
outta
the
cave
wed
bin
hidin
in
an
headed
back
down
inter
the
gully
keepin
our
eyes
skinned
fer
the
Death
Eaters
got
inside
a
few
o
the
caves
no
go
then
in
abou
the
sixth

Ron

Kneazle
said
Hagrid
didnt
they
attack
you
when

Hermione

Hagrid
but
they
was
badly
hurt
all

o

Golgomaths

bit
of
English
an
e
translated
fer
the
others

ter

too
badly
so
we

wounded

reckon

abou
six
or
seven

poin

Ron
eagerly
well

not

going
to
come
over
here
and
start
fighting
You-Know-Who
with
us
but
Hermione
said
What

Hagrid
hagrid
looked
at
her
sadly
golgomaths
lot
raided
the
caves
the
ones
tha

didn
wan
no
more
ter
to
do
with
us
after
that
so
so

any
giants

said
Ron
looking
disappointed
nope
said
Hagrid
heaving
a
deep
sigh
as
he
turned
over
his
steak
and
applied
the
cooler
side
to
his
face
but
we
did
wha
we
meant
ter
do

snow
was
filling
up
the
window
now
harry
became
aware
that
the
knees
of
his
robes
were
soaked
through
Fang
was
drooling
with
his
head
in
Harrys
lap
hagrid
said
Hermione
quietly
after
a
while
mmm

sign
of
did
you
hear
anything
about
your
your
mother
while
you

hagrids
unobscured
eye
rested
upon
her
and
Hermione
looked
rather
scared
im
sorry

Hagrid
grunted
died
years
ago
they
told
me
oh

said
Hermione
in
a
very
small
voice
hagrid
shrugged
his
massive
shoulders
no
need
he
said
shortly
cant
remember
her
much
wasn
a
great
mother
they
were
silent
again
hermione
glanced
nervously
at
Harry
and
Ron
plainly
wanting
them
to
speak
but
you
still
havent
explained
how
you
got
in
this
state
Hagrid
Ron
said
gesturing
towards
hagrids
bloodstained
face
or
why
youre
back
so
late
said
Harry
sirius
says
Madame
Maxime
got
back
ages
ago
who
attacked
you
said
Ron
i
haven
bin
attacked
said
Hagrid
emphatically
i
but
the
rest
of
his
words
were
drowned
in
a
sudden
outbreak
of
rapping
on
the
door
hermione
gasped
her
mug
slipped
through
her
fingers
and
smashed
on
the
floor
Fang
yelped
all
four
of
them
stared
at
the
window
beside
the
doorway
the
shadow
of
somebody
small
and
squat
rippled
across
the
thin
curtain
its
her
ron
whispered
get
under
here
harry
said
quickly
seizing
the
Invisibility
Cloak
he
whirled
it
over
himself
and
Hermione
while
Ron
tore
around
the
table
and
dived
under
the
Cloak
as
well
huddled
together
they
backed
away
into
a
corner
fang
was
barking
madly
at
the
door
hagrid
looked
thoroughly
confused
hagrid
hide
our
mugs
hagrid
seized
Harry
and
Rons
mugs
and
shoved
them
under
the
cushion
in
Fangs
basket
fang
was
now
leaping
up
at
the
door
Hagrid
pushed
him
out
of
the
way
with
his
foot
and
pulled
it
open
professor
Umbridge
was
standing
in
the
doorway
wearing
her
green
tweed
cloak
and
a
matching
hat
with
earflaps
lips
pursed
she
leaned
back
so
as
to
see
Hagrids
face
she
barely
reached
his
navel
so
she
said
slowly
and
loudly
as
though
speaking
to
somebody
deaf
youre
Hagrid
are
you
without
waiting
for
an
answer
she
strolled
into
the
room
her
bulging
eyes
rolling
in
every
direction
get
away
she
snapped
waving
her
handbag
at
Fang
who
had
bounded
up
to
her
and
was
attempting
to
lick
her
face
er
I
don
want
ter
be
rude
said
Hagrid
staring
at
her
but
who
the
ruddy
hell
are
you
my
name
is
Dolores
Umbridge
her
eyes
were
sweeping
the
cabin
twice
they
stared
directly
into
the
corner
where
Harry
stood
sandwiched
between
Ron
and
Hermione
dolores
Umbridge
hagrid
said
sounding
thoroughly
confused
i
thought
you
were
one
o
them
Ministry
don
you
work
with
Fudge
i
was
Senior
Undersecretary
to
the
Minister
yes
said
Umbridge
now
pacing
around
the
cabin
taking
in
every
tiny
detail
within
from
the
haversack
against
the
wall
to
the
abandoned
traveling
cloak
i
am
now
the
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
teacher
thas
brave
of
yeh
said
Hagrid
theres
not
manyd
take
tha
job
any
more
and
Hogwarts
High
Inquisitor
said
Umbridge
giving
no
sign
that
she
had
heard
him
whas
that
said
Hagrid
frowning
precisely
what
I
was
going
to
ask
said
Umbridge
pointing
at
the
broken
shards
of
china
on
the
floor
that
had
been
Hermiones
mug
oh
said
Hagrid
with
a
most
unhelpful
glance
towards
the
corner
where
Harry
Ron
and
hermione
stood
hidden
oh
tha
was
was
Fang
he
broke
a
mug
so
I
had
ter
use
this
one
instead
hagrid
pointed
to
the
mug
from
which
he
had
been
drinking
one
hand
still
clamped
over
the
dragon
steak
pressed
to
his
eye
umbridge
stood
facing
him
now
taking
in
every
detail
of
his
appearance
instead
of
the
cabins
i
heard
voices
she
said
quietly
i
was
talkin
ter
Fang
said
Hagrid
stoutly
and
was
he
talking
back
to
you
well
in
a
manner
o
speakin
said
Hagrid
looking
uncomfortable
i
sometimes
say
Fangs
near
enough
human
there
are
three
sets
of
footprints
in
the
snow
leading
from
the
castle
doors
to
your
cabin
said
umbridge
sleekly
hermione
gasped
Harry
clapped
a
hand
over
her
mouth
luckily
Fang
was
sniffing
loudly
around
the
hem
of
Professor
Umbridges
robes
and
she
did
not
appear
to
have
heard
well
I
ony
jus
got
back
said
Hagrid
waving
an
enormous
hand
at
the
haversack
maybe
someone
came
ter
call
earlier
an
I
missed
em
there
are
no
footsteps
leading
away
from
your
cabin
door
well
I
i
don
know
why
thatd
be
said
Hagrid
tugging
nervously
at
his
beard
and
again
glancing
towards
the
corner
where
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
stood
as
though
asking
for
help
erm
umbridge
wheeled
round
and
strode
the
length
of
the
cabin
looking
around
carefully
she
bent
and
peered
under
the
bed
she
opened
Hagrids
cupboards
she
passed
within
two
inches
of
where
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
stood
pressed
against
the
wall
Harry
actually
pulled
in
his
stomach
as
she
walked
by
after
looking
carefully
inside
the
enormous
cauldron
Hagrid
used
for
cooking
she
wheeled
round
again
and
said
What
has
happened
to
you
how
did
you
sustain
those
injuries
hagrid
hastily
removed
the
dragon
steak
from
his
face
which
in
Harrys
opinion
was
a
mistake
because
the
black
and
purple
bruising
all
around
his
eye
was
now
clearly
visible
not
to
mention
the
large
amount
of
fresh
and
congealed
blood
on
his
face
oh
I
had
a
bit
of
an
accident
he
said
lamely
what
sort
of
accident
i
I
tripped

repeated
coolly

Ive
had
a
bit
of
a
ride
on
one
o
them
an
it
was
where
have
you
been
asked
Umbridge
cutting
coolly
through
Hagrids
babbling
whereve
I
been
yes
she
said

two
months
ago

teacher

me
any
information
as

your
whereabouts
you
left
no
address
where
have
you
been
there
was
a
pause
in
which
Hagrid
stared
at
her
with
his
newly
uncovered
eye
harry
could
almost
hear
his
brain
working
furiously
i
Ive
been
away
for
me
health
he
said
for
your
health
repeated
Professor
Umbridge
her
eyes
traveled
over
Hagrids
discolored
and
swollen
face
dragon
blood
dripped
gently
and
silently
on
to
his
waistcoat
i
see
yeah
said
Hagrid
bit
o
o
fresh
air
yeh
know
yes
as
gamekeeper
fresh
air
must
be
so
difficult
to
come
by
said
Umbridge
sweetly
the
small
patch
of
Hagrids
face
that
was
not
black
or
purple
flushed
well
change
o
scene
yeh
know
mountain
scenery
said
Umbridge
swiftly
she
knows
Harry
thought
desperately
mountains
hagrid
repeated
clearly
thinking
fast
nope
South
o
France
fer

bit
o
sun
an
an
sea
really
said
Umbridge
you
dont
have
much
of
a
tan
yeah
well
sensitive
skin
said
Hagrid
attempting
an
ingratiating
smile
harry
noticed
that
two
of
his
teeth
had
been
knocked
out
umbridge
looked
at
him
coldly
his
smile
faltered
then
she
hoisted
her
handbag
a
little
higher
into
the
crook
of
her
arm
and
said
I
shall
of
course
be
informing
the
Minister
of
your
late
return
righ
said
Hagrid
nodding
you
ought
to
know
too
that
as
High
Inquisitor
it
is
my
unfortunate
but
necessary
duty
to
inspect
my
fellow
teachers
so
I
daresay
we
shall
meet
again
soon
enough
she
turned
sharply
and
marched
back
to
the
door
youre
inspectin
us
hagrid
repeated
blankly
looking
after
her
oh
yes
said
Umbridge
softly
looking
back
at
him
with
her
hand
on
the
door
handle
the
ministry
is
determined
to
weed
out
unsatisfactory
teachers
Hagrid
goodnight
she
left
closing
the
door
behind
her
with
a
snap
harry
made
to
pull
off
the
Invisibility
Cloak
but
Hermione
seized
his
wrist
not
yet
she
breathed
in
his
ear
she
might
not
be
gone
yet
hagrid
seemed
to
be
thinking
the
same
way
he
stumped
across
the
room
and
pulled
back
the
curtain
an
inch
or
so
shes
goin
back
ter
the
castle
he
said
in
a
low
voice
blimey

said
Harry
pulling
off
the
Cloak
trelawneys
on
probation
already

Hagrid
asked
Hermione

load

Hagrid
enthusiastically
scooping
up

dragon

from

table

slapping
it
over
his
eye
again

Hermione
tentatively

Hagrid
happily

Hagrid
said
Hermione
urgently
dropping
all
pretence
Professor
Umbridge

happy
if

too
dangerous

Hagrid

genially
bemused

look
after

hagrid
youve

Hermione
a
note
of
real
desperation
in
her
voice
umbridge
is
looking
for
any
excuse
to
get
rid
of
teachers
she
thinks
are
too
close
to
Dumbledore
please
Hagrid
teach
us
something
dull
thats
bound
to
come
up
in
our
owl
but
Hagrid
merely
yawned
widely
and
cast
a
one-eyed
look
of
longing
towards
the
vast
bed
in
the
corner
lisen
its
bin
a
long
day
an
its
late
he
said
patting
Hermione
gently
on
the
shoulder
so
that
her
knees
gave
way
and
hit
the
floor
with
a
thud
oh
sorry
He
pulled
her
back
up
by
the
neck
of
her
robes
look
don
you
go
worryin
abou
me
I
promise

Ive

the
castle
an
don
forget
ter
wipe

footprints
out
behind
yeh
i
dunno
if
you
got
through
to
him
said
Ron
a
sho
rt
while
later
when
having
checked
that
the
coast
was
clear
they
walked
back
up
to
the
castle
through
the
thickening
snow
leaving
no
trace
behind
them
due
to
the
Obliteration
Charm
Hermione
was
performing
as
they
went
then
Ill
go
back
again
tomorrow
said
Hermione
determinedly
ill
plan
his
lessons
for
him
if
I
have
to
i
dont
care
if
she
throws
out
Trelawney
but
shes
not
getting
rid
of
Hagrid
chapter
twenty-one
the
Eye
of
the
Snake
hermione
ploughed
her
way
back
to
Hagrids
cabin
through
two
feet
of
snow
on
Sunday
morning
harry
and
Ron
wanted
to
go
with
her
but
their
mountain
of
homework
had
reached
an
alarming
height
again
so
they
remained
grudgingly
in
the
common
room
trying
to
ignore
the
gleeful
shouts
drifting
up
from
the
grounds
outside
where
students
were
enjoying
themselves
skating
on
the
frozen
lake
tobogganing
and
worst
of
all
bewitching
snowballs
to
zoom
up
to
gryffindor
Tower
and
rap
hard
on
the
windows
oy
bellowed
Ron
finally
losing
patience
and
sticking
his
head
out
of
the
window
I
am
a
prefect
and
if
one
more
snowball
hits
this
window
ouch
he
withdrew
his
head
sharply
his
face
covered
in
snow
its
Fred
and
George
he
said
bitterly
slamming
the
window
behind
him
gits
hermione
returned
from
Hagrids
just
before
lunch
shivering
slightly
her
robes
damp
to
the
knees
so
said
Ron
looking
up
when
she
entered
got
all
his
lessons
planned
for
him
well
I
tried
she
said
dully
sinking
into
a
chair
beside
Harry
she
pulled
out
her
wand
and
gave
it
a
complicated
little
wave
so
that
hot
air
streamed
out
of
the
tip
she
then
pointed
this
at
her
robes
which
began
to
steam
as
they
dried
out
he
wasnt
even
there
when
I
arrived
I
was
knocking
for
at
least
half
an
hour
and
then
he
came
stumping
out
of
the
Forest
harry
groaned
the
Forbidden
Forest
was
teeming
with
the
kind
of
creatures
most
likely
to
get
hagrid
the
sack
whats
he
keeping
in
there
did
he
say
he
asked
no
said
Hermione
miserably
he
says
he
wants
them
to
be
a
surprise
i
tried
to
explain
about
umbridge
but
he
just
doesnt
get
it
he
kept
saying
nobody
in
their
right
mind
would
rather
study
Knarls
than
Chimaeras
oh
I
dont
think
hes
got
a
Chimaera
she
added
at
the
appalled
look
on
Harry
and
Rons
faces
but
thats
not
for
lack
of
trying
from
what
he
said
about
how
hard
it
is
to
get
eggs
i
dont
know
how
many
times
I
told
him
hed
be
better
off
following
grubbly-Planks
plan
I
honestly
dont
think
he
listened
to
half
of
what
I
said
hes
in
a
bit
of
a
funny
mood
you
know
he
still
wont
say
how
he
got
all
those
injuries
hagrids
reappearance
at
the
staff
table
at
breakfast
next
day
was
not
greeted
by
enthusiasm
from
all
students
some
like
Fred
George
and
Lee
roared
with
delight
and
sprinted
up
the
aisle
between
the
Gryffindor
and
Hufflepuff
tables
to
wring
Hagrids
enormous
hand
others
like
parvati
and
Lavender
exchanged
gloomy
looks
and
shook
their
heads
harry
knew
that
many
of
them
preferred
Professor
Grubbly-Planks
lessons
and
the
worst
of
it
was
that
a
very
small
unbiased
part
of
him
knew
that
they
had
good
reason
Grubbly-Planks
idea
of
an
interesting
class
was
not
one
where
there
was
a
risk
that
somebody
might
have
their
head
ripped
off
it
was
with
a
certain
amount
of
apprehension
that
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
headed
down
to
hagrids
on
Tuesday
heavily
muffled
against
the
cold
harry
was
worried
not
only
about
what
hagrid
might
have
decided
to
teach
them
but
also
about
how
the
rest
of
the
class
particularly
malfoy
and
his
cronies
would
behave
if
Umbridge
was
watching
them
however
the
High
Inquisitor
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
as
they
struggled
through
the
snow
towards
Hagrid
who
stood
waiting
for
them
on
the
edge
of
the
Forest
he
did
not
present
a
reassuring
sight
the
bruises
that
had
been
purple
on
Saturday
night
were
now
tinged
with
green
and
yellow
and
some
of
his
cuts
still
seemed
to
be
bleeding
harry
could
not
understand
this
had
hagrid
perhaps
been
attacked
by
some
creature
whose
venom
prevented
the
wounds
it
inflicted
from
healing
as
though
to
complete
the
ominous
picture
Hagrid
was
carrying
what
looked
like
half
a
dead
cow
over
his
shoulder
were
workin
in
here
today
hagrid
called
happily
to
the
approaching
students
jerking
his
head
back
at
the
dark
trees
behind
him
bit
more
sheltered
anyway
they
prefer
the
dark
what
prefers
the
dark
harry
heard
Malfoy
say
sharply
to
Crabbe
and
Goyle
a
trace
of
panic
in
his
voice
what
did
he
say
prefers
the
dark
did
you
hear
harry
remembered
the
only
other
occasion
on
which
Malfoy
had
entered
the
Forest
before
now
he
had
not
been
very
brave
then
either
he
smiled
to
himself
after
the
Quidditch
match
anything
that
caused
Malfoy
discomfort
was
all
right
with
him
ready
said
Hagrid
cheerfully
looking
around
at
the
class
right
well
Ive
bin
savin
a
trip
inter
the
Forest
fer
yer
fifth
year
thought
wed
go
an
see
these
creatures
in
their
natural
habitat
now
what
were
studyin
today
is
pretty
rare
I
reckon
Im
probably
the
ony
person
in
Britain
whos
managed
ter
train
em
and
youre
sure
theyre
trained
are
you
said
Malfoy
the
panic
in
his
voice
even
more
pronounced
only
it
wouldnt
be
the
first
time
youd
brought
wild
stuff
to
class
would
it
the
Slytherins
murmured
agreement
and
a
few
Gryffindors
looked
as
though
they
thought
malfoy
had
a
fair
point
too
course
theyre
trained
said
Hagrid
scowling
and
hoisting
the
dead
cow
a
little
higher
on
his
shoulder
so
what
happened
to
your
face
then
demanded
Malfoy
mind
yer
own
business
said
Hagrid
angrily
now
if
yehve
finished
askin
stupid
questions
follow
me
he
turned
and
strode
straight
into
the
Forest
nobody
seemed
much
disposed
to
follow
harry
glanced
at
Ron
and
Hermione
who
sighed
but
nodded
and
the
three
of
them
set
off
after
Hagrid
leading
the
rest
of
the
class
they
walked
for
about
ten
minutes
until
they
reached
a
place
where
the
trees
stood
so
closely
together
that
it
was
as
dark
as
twilight
and
there
was
no
snow
at
all
on
the
ground
with
a
grunt
hagrid
deposited
his
half
a
cow
on
the
ground
stepped
back
and
turned
to
face
his
class
most
of
whom
were
creeping
from
tree
to
tree
towards
him
peering
around
nervously
as
though
expecting
to
be
set
upon
at
any
moment
gather
roun
gather
roun
Hagrid
encouraged
now
theyll
be
attracted
by
the
smell
o
the
meat
but
Im
goin
ter
give
em
a
call
anyway
cause
theyll
like
ter
know
its
me
he
turned
shook
his
shaggy
head
to
get
the
hair
out
of
his
face
and
gave
an
odd
shrieking
cry
that
echoed
through
the
dark
trees
like
the
call
of
some
monstrous
bird
nobody
laughed
most
of
them
looked
too
scared
to
make
a
sound
hagrid
gave
the
shrieking
cry
again
a
minute
passed
in
which
the
class
continued
to
peer
nervously
over
their
shoulders
and
around
trees
for
a
first
glimpse
of
whatever
it
was
that
was
coming
and
then
as
Hagrid
shook
his
hair
back
for
a
third
time
and
expanded
his
enormous
chest
Harry
nudged
Ron
and
pointed
into
the
black
space
between
two
gnarled
yew
trees
a
pair
of
blank
white
shining
eyes
were
growing
larger
through
the
gloom
and
a
moment
later
the
dragonish
face
neck
and
then
skeletal
body
of
a
great
black
winged
horse
emerged
from
the
darkness
it
surveyed
the
class
for
a
few
seconds
swishing
its
long
black
tail
then
bowed
its
head
and
began
to
tear
flesh
from
the
dead
cow
with
its
pointed
fangs
a
great
wave
of
relief
broke
over
Harry
here
at
last
was
proof
that
he
had
not
imagined
these
creatures
that
they
were
real
Hagrid
knew
about
them
too
he
looked
eagerly
at
Ron
but
Ron
was
still
staring
around
into
the
trees
and
after
a
few
seconds
he
whispered
Why
doesnt
Hagrid
call
again
most
of
the
rest
of
the
class
were
wearing
expressions
as
confused
and
nervously
expectant
as
rons
and
were
still
gazing
everywhere
but
at
the
horse
standing
feet
from
them
there
were
only
two
other
people
who
seemed
to
be
able
to
see
them
a
stringy
Slytherin
boy
standing
just
behind
Goyle
was
watching
the
horse
eating
with
an
expression
of
great
distaste
on
his
face
and
neville
whose
eyes
were
following
the
swishing
progress
of
the
long
black
tail
oh
an
here
comes
another
one
said
Hagrid
proudly
as
a
second
black
horse
appeared
out
of
the
dark
trees
folded
its
leathery
wings
closer
to
its
body
and
dipped
its
head
to
gorge
on
the
meat
now
put
yer
hands
up
who
can
see
em
immensely
pleased
to
feel
that
he
was
at
last
going
to
understand
the
mystery
of
these
horses
harry
raised
his
hand
hagrid
nodded
at
him
yeah
yeah
I
knew
youd
be
able
ter
Harry
he
said
seriously
an
you
too
Neville
eh
an
excuse
me
said
Malfoy
in
a
sneering
voice
but
what
exactly
are
we
supposed
to
be
seeing
for
an
answer
Hagrid
pointed
at
the
cow
carcass
on
the
ground
the
whole
class
stared
at
it
for
a
few
seconds
then
several
people
gasped
and
Parvati
squealed
harry
understood
why
bits
of
flesh
stripping
themselves
away
from
the
bones
and
vanishing
into
thin
air
had
to
look
very
odd
indeed
whats
doing
it
parvati
demanded
in
a
terrified
voice
retreating
behind
the
nearest
tree
whats
eating
it
thestrals
said
Hagrid
proudly
and
Hermione
gave
a
soft
Oh
of
comprehension
at
Harrys
shoulder
hogwarts
has
got
a
whole
herd
of
em
in
here
now
who
knows
but
theyre
really
really
unlucky
interrupted
Parvati
looking
alarmed
theyre
supposed
to
bring
all
sorts
of
horrible
misfortune
on
people
who
see
them
professor
Trelawney
told
me
once
no
no

said
Hagrid
chuckling

Apparate
an
heres
another
couple
look
two
more
horses
came
quietly
out
of
the
trees
one
of
them
passing
very
close
to
Parvati
who
shivered
and
pressed
herself
closer
to
the
tree
saying
I
think
I
felt
something
I
think
its
near
me
don
worry

said
Hagrid
patiently

hermione
raised
her
hand

Hagrid

at
her

only
people

can
see
Thestrals
she
said

people
who
have
seen

exactly

Hagrid
solemnly
ten
points
ter
Gryffindor
now
Thestrals
hem
hem
professor
Umbridge
had
arrived
she
was
standing
a
few
feet
away
from
Harry
wearing
her
green
hat
and
cloak
again
her
clipboard
at
the
ready
hagrid
who
had
never
heard
Umbridges
fake
cough
before
was
gazing
in
some
concern
at
the
closest
Thestral
evidently
under
the
impression
that
it
had
made
the
sound
hem
hem
oh
hello
hagrid
said
smiling
having
located
the
source
of
the
noise
you
received
the
note
I
sent
to
your
cabin
this
morning
said
Umbridge
in
the
same
loud
slow
voice
she
had
used
with
him
earlier
as
though
she
were
addressing
somebody
both
foreign
and
very
slow
telling
you
that
I
would
be
inspecting
y
our
lesson
oh

said
Hagrid
brightly
glad

place

well
as
you
can
see
or
I
dunno
can

Professor
Umbridge
loudly
cupping
her
hand
around

ear

a
little
confused
er
Thestrals
he
said
loudly

winged
horses

he
flapped
his
gigantic
arms
hopefully
professor
Umbridge
raised
her
eyebrows
at
him
and
muttered
as
she
made
a
note
on
her
clipboard
Has
to
resort
to
crude
sign
language
well
anyway
said
Hagrid
turning
back
to
the
class
and
looking
slightly
flustered
erm
what
was
I
sayin
appears
to
have
poor
short
term
memory
muttered
Umbridge
loudly
enough
for
everyone
to
hear
her
draco
Malfoy
looked
as
though
Christmas
had
come
a
month
early
hermione
on
the
other
hand
had
turned
scarlet
with
suppressed
rage
oh
yeah
said
Hagrid
throwing
an
uneasy
glance
at
Umbridges
clipboard
but
ploughing
on
valiantly
yeah
I
was
gonna
tell
yeh
how
come
we
got
a
herd
yeah
so
we
started
off
with
a
male
an
five
females
this
one
he
patted
the
fir
st
horse
to
have
appeared
name
o
Tenebrus
hes
my
special
favorite
firs
one
born
here
in
the
Forest
are
you
aware
Umbridge
said
loudly
interrupting
him
that
the
Ministry
of
Magic
has
classified
Thestrals
as
dangerous
harrys
heart
sank
like
a
stone
but
Hagrid
merely
chuckled
thestrals
aren
dangerous
all
righ
they
might
take
a
bite
outta
yeh
if
yeh
really
annoy
them
shows
signs
of
pleasure
at
idea
of
violence
muttered
Umbridge
scribbling
on
her
clipboard
again
no
come
on
said
Hagrid
looking
a
little
anxious
now
i
mean
a
dogll
bite
if
yeh
bait
it
won
it
but
Thestrals
have
jus
got
a
bad
reputation
because
o
the
death
thing
people
used
ter
think
they
were
bad
omens
didn
they
jus
didn
understand
did
they
umbridge
did
not
answer
she
finished
writing
her
last
note
then
looked
up
at
Hagrid
and
said
again
very
loudly
and
slowly
Please
continue
teaching
as
usual
i
am
going
to
walk
she
mimed
walking
Malfoy
and
Pansy
Parkinson
were
having
silent
fits
of
laughter
among
the
students
she
pointed
around
at
individual
members
of
the
class
and
ask
them
questions
she
pointed
at
her
mouth
to
indicate
talking
hagrid
stared
at
her
clearly
at
a
complete
loss
to
understand
why
she
was
acting
as
though
he
did
not
understand
normal
English
hermione
had
tears
of
fury
in
her
eyes
now
you
hag
you
evil
hag
she
whispered
as
Umbridge
walked
towards
Pansy
Parkinson
i
know
what
youre
doing
you
awful
twisted
vicious
erm
anyway
said
Hagrid
clearly
struggling
to
regain
the
flow
of
his
lesson
so
Thestrals
yeah
well
theres
loads
o
good
stuff
abou
them
do
you
find
said
Professor
Umbridge
in
a
ringing
voice
to
Pansy
Parkinson
that
you
are
able
to
understand
Professor
Hagrid
when
he
talks
just
like
Hermione
Pansy
had
tears
in
her
eyes
but
these
were
tears
of
laughter
indeed
her
answer
was
almost
incoherent
because
she
was
trying
to
suppress
her
giggles
no
because
well
it
sounds
like
grunting
a
lot
of
the
time
umbridge
scribbled
on
her
clipboard
the
few
unbruised
bits
of
Hagrids
face
flushed
but
he
tried
to
act
as
though
he
had
not
heard
Pansys
answer
er
yeah
good
stuff
abou
Thestrals
well
once
theyre
tamed
like
this
lot
yehll
never
be
lost
again
mazin
sense
o
direction
jus
tell
em
where
yeh
want
ter
go
assuming
they
can
understand
you
of
course
said
Malfoy
loudly
and
Pansy
Parkinson
collapsed
in
a
fit
of
renewed
giggles
professor
Umbridge
smiled
indulgently
at
them
and
then
turned
to
Neville
you
can
see
the
Thestrals
Longbottom
can
you
she
said
neville
nodded
who
did
you
see
die
she
asked
her
tone
indifferent
my
my
grandad
said
Neville
and
what
do
you
think
of
them
she
said
waving
her
stubby
hand
at
the
horses
who
by
now
had
stripped
a
great
deal
of
the
carcass
down
to
bone
erm
said
Neville
nervously
with
a
glance
at
Hagrid
well
theyre
er
okay
students
are
too
intimidated
to
admit
they
are
frightened
muttered
umbridge
making
another
note
on
her
clipboard
no
said
Neville
looking
upset
no
Im
not
scared
of
them
its
quite
all
right
said
Umbridge
patting
Neville
on
the
shoulder
with
what
she
evidently
intended
to
be
an
understanding
smile
though
it
looked
more
like
a
leer
to
Harry
well
Hagrid
she
turned
to
look
up
at
him
again
speaking
once
more
in
that
loud
slow
voice
I
think
Ive
got
enough
to
be
getting
along
with
you
will
receive
she
mimed
taking
something
from
the
air
in
front
of
her
the
results
of
your
inspection
she
pointed
at
the
clipboard
in
ten
days
time
she
held
up
ten
stubby
little
fingers
then
her
smile
wider
and
more
toadlike
than
ever
before
beneath
her
green
hat
she
bustled
from
their
midst
leaving
Malfoy
and
Pansy
Parkinson
in
fits
of
laughter
Hermione
actually
shaking
with
fury
and
Neville
looking
confused
and
upset
that
foul
lying
twisting
old
gargoyle
stormed
Hermione
half
an
hour
later
as
they
made
their
way
back
up
to
the
castle
through
the
channels
they
had
made
earlier
in
the
snow
you
see
what
shes
up
to
its
her
thing
about
half-breeds
all
over
again
shes
trying
to
make
out
Hagrids
some
kind
of
dimwitted
troll
just
because
he
had
a
giantess
for
a
mother
and
oh
its
not
fair
that
really
wasnt
a
bad
lesson
at
all
I
mean
all
right
if
it
had
been
Blast-Ended
Skrewts
again
but
Thestrals
are
fine
in
fact
for
Hagrid
theyre
really
good
umbridge
said
theyre
dangerous
said
Ron
well
its
like
Hagrid
said
they
can
look
after
themselves
said
Hermione
impatiently
and
I
suppose
a
teacher
like
Grubbly-Plank
wouldnt
usually
show
them
to
us
before
newt
level
but
well
they
are
very
interesting
arent
they
the
way
some
people
can
see
them
and
some
cant
wish
I
could
do
you
harry
asked
her
quietly
she
looked
suddenly
horrorstruck
oh
Harry
Im
sorry
no
of
course
I
dont
that
was
a
really
stupid
thing
to
say
its
okay
he
said
quickly
dont
worry
im
surprised
so
many
people
could
see
them
said
Ron
three
in
a
class
yeah
Weasley
we
were
just
wondering
said
a
malicious
voice
unheard
by
any
of
them
in
the
muffling
snow
Malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
were
walking
along
right
behind
them
dyou
reckon
if
you
saw
someone
snuff
it
youd
be
able
to
see
the
Quaffle
better
he
Crabbe
and
Goyle
roared
with
laughter
as
they
pushed
past
on
their
way
to
the
castle
then
broke
into
a
chorus
of
Weasley
is
our
King
rons
ears
turned
scarlet
ignore
them
just
ignore
them
intoned
Hermione
pulling
out
her
wand
and
performing
the
charm
to
produce
hot
air
again
so
that
she
could
melt
them
an
easier
path
through
the
untouched
snow
between
them
and
the
greenhouses
december
arrived
bringing
with
it
more
snow
and
a
positive
avalanche
of
homework
for
the
fifth-years
ron
and
Hermiones
prefect
duties
also
became
more
and
more
onerous
as
Christmas
approached
they
were
called
upon
to
supervise
the
decoration
of
the
castle
You
try
putting
up
tinsel
when
Peeves
has
got
the
other
end
and
is
trying
to
strangle
you
with
it
said
Ron
to
watch
over
first
and
second-years
spending
their
break-times
inside
because
of
the
bitter
cold
And
theyre
cheeky
little
snot-rags
you
know
we
definitely
werent
that
rude
when
we
were
in
first
year
said
Ron
and
to
patrol
the
corridors
in
shifts
with
Argus
Filch
who
suspected
that
the
holiday
spirit
might
show
itself
in
an
outbreak
of
wizard
duels
Hes
got
dung
for
brains
that
one
said
Ron
furiously
they
were
so
busy
that
Hermione
had
even
stopped
knitting
elf
hats
and
was
fretting
that
she
was
down
to
her
last
three
all
those
poor
elves
I
havent
set
free
yet
having
to
stay
here
over
Christmas
because
there
arent
enough
hats
harry
who
had
not
had
the
heart
to
tell
her
that
Dobby
was
taking
everything
she
made
bent
lower
over
his
History
of
Magic
essay
in
any
case
he
did
not
want
to
think
about
Christmas
for
the
first
time
in
his
school
career
he
very
much
wanted
to
spend
the
holidays
away
from
hogwarts
between
his
Quidditch
ban
and
worry
about
whether
or
not
Hagrid
was
going
to
be
put
on
probation
he
felt
highly
resentful
towards
the
place
at
the
moment
the
only
thing
he
really
looked
forward
to
were
the
D
a.
meetings
and
they
would
have
to
stop
over
the
holidays
as
nearly
everybody
in
the
D
a.
would
be
spending
the
time
with
their
families
hermione
was
going
skiing
with
her
parents
something
that
greatly
amused
Ron
who
had
never
heard
of
muggles
strapping
narrow
strips
of
wood
on
to
their
feet
to
slide
down
mountains
ron
was
going
home
to
The
Burrow
harry
endured
several
days
of
envy
before
Ron
said
in
response
to
harry
asking
him
how
he
was
going
to
get
home
for
Christmas
But
youre
coming
too
didnt
I
say
mum
wrote
and
told
me
to
invite
you
weeks
ago
hermione
rolled
her
eyes
but
Harrys
spirits
soared
the
thought
of
Christmas
at
The
Burrow
was
truly
wonderful
though
slightly
marred
by
Harrys
guilty
feeling
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
spend
the
holiday
with
Sirius
he
wondered
whether
he
could
possibly
persuade
Mrs
weasley
to
invite
his
godfather
for
the
festivities
even
though
he
doubted
whether
Dumbledore
would
permit
Sirius
to
leave
Grimmauld
Place
anyway
he
could
not
help
but
think
Mrs
weasley
might
not
want
him
they
were
so
often
at
loggerheads
sirius
had
not
contacted
Harry
at
all
since
his
last
appearance
in
the
fire
and
although
Harry
knew
that
with
Umbridge
on
constant
watch
it
would
be
unwise
to
attempt
to
contact
him
he
did
not
like
to
think
of
Sirius
alone
in
his
mothers
old
house
perhaps
pulling
a
lonely
cracker
with
Kreacher
harry
arrived
early
in
the
Room
of
Requirement
for
the
last
D
a.
meeting
before
the
holidays
andwas
very
glad
he
had
because
when
the
lamps
burst
into
light
he
saw
that
Dobby
had
taken
it
upon
himself
to
decorate
the
place
for
Christmas
he
could
tell
the
elf
had
done
it
because
nobody
else
would
have
strung
a
hundred
golden
baubles
from
the
ceiling
each
showing
a
picture
of
Harrys
face
and
bearing
the
legend
have
A
very
harry
christmas
harry
had
only
just
managed
to
get
the
last
of
them
down
before
the
door
creaked
open
and
Luna
love
good
entered
looking
as
dreamy
as
always
hello
she
said
vaguely
looking
around
at
what
remained
of
the
decorations
these
are
nice
did
you
put
them
up
no
said
Harry
it
was
Dobby
the
house-elf
mistletoe
said
Luna
dreamily
pointing
at
a
large
clump
of
white
berries
placed
almost
over
harrys
head
he
jumped
out
from
under
it
good
thinking
said
Luna
very
seriously
its
often
infested
with
Nargles
harry
was
saved
the
necessity
of
asking
what
Nargles
were
by
the
arrival
of
Angelina
Katie
and
alicia
all
three
of
them
were
breathless
and
looked
very
cold
well
said
Angelina
dully
pulling
off
her
cloak
and
throwing
it
into
a
corner
weve
finally
replaced
you
replaced
me
said
Harry
blankly
you
and
Fred
and
George
she
said
impatiently
weve
got
another
Seeker
who
said
Harry
quickly
ginny
Weasley
said
Katie
harry
gaped
at
her
yeah
I
know
said
Angelina
pulling
out
her
wand
and
flexing
her
arm
but
shes
pretty
good
actually
nothing
on
you
of
course
she
said
throwing
him
a
very
dirty
look
but
as
we
cant
have
you
harry
bit
back
the
retort
he
was
longing
to
utter
did
she
imagine
for
a
second
that
he
did
not
regret
his
expulsion
from
the
team
a
hundred
times
more
than
she
did
and
what
about
the
Beaters
he
asked
trying
to
keep
his
voice
even
andrew
Kirke
said
Alicia
without
enthusiasm
and
Jack
Sloper
neither
of
them
are
brilliant
but
compared
to
the
rest
of
the
idiots
who
turned
up
the
arrival
of
Ron
Hermione
and
Neville
brought
this
depressing
discussion
to
an
end
and
within
five
minutes
the
room
was
full
enough
to
prevent
Harry
seeing
Angelinas
burning
reproachful
looks
okay
he
said
calling
them
all
to
order
i
thought
this
evening
we
should
just
go
over
the
things
weve
done
so
far
because
its
the
last
meeting
before
the
holidays
and
theres
no
point
starting
anything
new
right
before
a
three-week
break
were
not
doing
anything
new
said
Zacharias
Smith
in
a
disgruntled
whisper
loud
enough
to
carry
through
the
room
if
Id
known
that
I
wouldnt
have
come
were
all
really
sorry
Harry
didnt
tell
you
then
said
Fred
loudly
several
people
sniggered
harry
saw
Cho
laughing
and
felt
the
familiar
swooping
sensation
in
his
stomach
as
though
he
had
missed
a
step
going
downstairs
we
can
practice
in
pairs
said
Harry
well
start
with
the
Impediment
Jinx
for
ten
minutes
then
we
can
get
out
the
cushions
and
try
Stunning
again
they
all
divided
up
obediently
Harry
partnered
Neville
as
usual
the
room
was
soon
full
of
intermittent
cries
of
Impedimenta
people
froze
f
or
a
minute
or
so
during
which
their
partner
would
stare
aimlessly
around
the
room
watching
other
pairs
at
work
then
would
unfreeze
and
take
their
turn
at
the
jinx
neville
had
improved
beyond
all
recognition
after
a
while
when
Harry
had
unfrozen
three
times
in
a
row
he
had
Neville
join
Ron
and
Hermione
again
so
that
he
could
walk
around
the
room
and
watch
the
others
when
he
passed
Cho
she
beamed
at
him
he
resisted
the
temptation
to
walk
past
her
several
more
times
after
ten
minutes
on
the
Impediment
Jinx
they
laid
out
cushions
all
over
the
floor
and
started
practicing
Stunning
again
space
was
really
too
confined
to
allow
them
all
to
work
this
spell
at
once
half
the
group
observed
the
others
for
a
while
then
swapped
over
harry
felt
himself
positively
swelling
with
pride
as
he
watched
them
all
true
Neville
did
Stun
padma
Patil
rather
than
Dean
at
whom
he
had
been
aiming
but
it
was
a
much
closer
miss
than
usual
and
everybody
else
had
made
enormous
progress
at
the
end
of
an
hour
Harry
called
a
halt
youre
getting
really
good
he
said
beaming
around
at
them
when
we
get
back
from
the
holidays
we
can
start
doing
some
of
the
big
stuff
maybe
even
Patronuses
there
was
a
murmur
of
excitement
the
room
began
to
clear
in
the
usual
twos
and
threes
most
people
wished
Harry
a
Happy
Christmas
as
they
went
feeling
cheerful
he
collected
up
the
cushions
with
Ron
and
Hermione
and
stacked
them
neatly
away
ron
and
Hermione
left
before
he
did
he
hung
back
a
little
because
Cho
was
still
there
and
he
was
hoping
to
receive
a
Merry
christmas
from
her
no
you
go
on
he
heard
her
say
to
her
friend
Marietta
and
his
heart
gave
a
jolt
that
seemed
to
take
it
into
the
region
of
his
Adams
apple
he
pretended
to
be
straightening
the
cushion
pile
he
was
quite
sure
they
were
alone
now
and
waited
for
her
to
speak
instead
he
heard
a
hearty
sniff
he
turned
and
saw
Cho
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
tears
pouring
down
her
face
wha
he
didnt
know
what
to
do
she
was
simply
standing
there
crying
silently
whats
up
he
said
feebly
she
shook
her
head
and
wiped
her
eyes
on
her
sleeve
im
sorry
she
said
thickly
i
suppose
its
just
learning
all
this
stuff
it
just
makes
me
wonder
whether
if
hed
known
it
all
hed
still
be
alive
harrys
heart
sank
right
back
past
its
usual
spot
and
settled
somewhere
around
his
navel
he
ought
to
have
known
she
wanted
to
talk
about
Cedric
he
did
know
this
stuff
Harry
said
heavily
he
was
really
good
at
it
or
he
could
never
have
got
to
the
middle
of
that
maze
but
if
Voldemort
really
wants
to
kill
you
you
dont
stand
a
chance
she
hiccoughed
at
the
sound
of
Voldemorts
name
but
stared
at
Harry
without
flinching
you
survived
when
you
were
just
a
baby
she
said
quietly
yeah
well
said
Harry
wearily
moving
towards
the
door
I
dunno
why
nor
does
anyone
else
so
its
nothing
to
be
proud
of
oh
dont
go
said
Cho
sounding
tearful
again
im
really
sorry
to
get
all
upset
like
this
didnt
mean
to
she
hiccoughed
again
she
was
very
pretty
even
when
her
eyes
were
red
and
puffy
harry
felt
thoroughly
miserable
hed
have
been
so
pleased
with
just
a
Merry
Christmas
i
know
it
must
be
horrible
for
you
she
said
mop
ping
her
eyes
on
her
sleeve
again
me
mentioning
Cedric
when
you
saw
him
die
i
suppose
you
just
want
to
forget
about
it
harry
did
not
say
anything
to
this
it
was
quite
true
but
he
felt
heartless
saying
it
youre
a
r-really
good
teacher
you
know
said
Cho
with
a
watery
smile
ive
never
been
able
to
Stun
anything
before
thanks
said
Harry
awkwardly
they
looked
at
each
other
for
a
long
moment
harry
felt
a
burning
desire
to
run
from
the
room
and
at
the
same
time
a
complete
inability
to
move
his
feet
mistletoe
said
Cho
quietly
pointing
at
the
ceiling
over
his
head
yeah
said
Harry
his
mouth
was
very
dry
its
probably
full
of
Nargles
though
what
are
Nargles
no
idea
said
Harry
she
had
moved
closer
his
brain
seemed
to
have
been
Stunned
youd
have
to
ask
Loony
luna
I
mean
cho
made
a
funny
noise
halfway
between
a
sob
and
a
laugh
she
was
even
nearer
to
him
now
he
could
have
counted
the
freckles
on
her
nose
i
really
like
you
Harry
he
could
not
think
a
tingling
sensation
was
spreading
through
him
paralysing
his
arms
legs
and
brain
she
was
much
too
close
he
could
see
every
tear
clinging
to
her
eyelashes
he
returned
to
the
common
room
half
an
hour
later
to
find
Hermione
and
Ron
in
the
best
seats
by
the
fire
nearly
everybody
else
had
gone
to
bed
hermione
was
writing
a
very
long
letter
she
had
already
filled
half
a
roll
of
parchment
which
was
dangling
from
the
edge
of
the
table
ron
was
lying
on
the
hearthrug
trying
to
finish
his
Transfiguration
homework
what
kept
you
he
asked
as
Harry
sank
into
the
armchair
next
to
Hermiones
harry
didnt
answer
he
was
in
a
state
of
shock
half
of
him
wanted
to
tell
Ron
and
Hermione
what
had
just
happened
but
the
other
half
wanted
to
take
the
secret
with
him
to
the
grave
are
you
all
right
Harry
hermione
asked
peering
at
him
over
the
tip
of
her
quill
harry
gave
a
half-hearted
shrug
in
truth
he
didnt
know
whether
he
was
all
right
or
not
whats
up
said
Ron
hoisting
himself
up
on
his
elbow
to
get
a
clearer
view
of
Harry
whats
happened
harry
didnt
quite
know
how
to
set
about
telling
them
and
still
wasnt
sure
whether
he
wanted
to
just
as
he
had
decided
not
to
say
anything
Hermione
took
matters
out
of
his
hands
is
it
Cho
she
asked
in
a
businesslike
way
did
she
corner
you
after
the
meeting
numbly
surprised
Harry
nodded
ron
sniggered
breaking
off
when
Hermione
caught
his
eye
so
er
what
did
she
want
he
asked
in
a
mock
casual
voice
she
Harry
began
rather
hoarsely
he
cleared
his
throat
and
tried
again
she
er
did
you
kiss
asked
Hermione
briskly
ron
sat
up
so
fast
he
sent
his
ink
bottle
flying
all
over
the
rug
disregarding
this
completely
he
stared
avidly
at
Harry
well
he
demanded
harry
looked
from
Rons
expression
of
mingled
curiosity
and
hilarity
to
Hermiones
slight
frown
and
nodded
ha
ron
made
a
triumphant
gesture
with
his
fist
and
went
into
a
raucous
peal
of
laughter
that
made
several
timid-looking
second-years
over
beside
the
window
jump
a
reluctant
grin
spread
over
harrys
face
as
he
watched
Ron
rolling
around
on
the
hearthrug
hermione
gave
Ron
a
look
of
deep
disgust
and
returned
to
her
letter
well
ron
said
finally
looking
up
at
Harry
how
was
it
harry
considered
for
a
moment
wet
he
said
truthfully
ron
made
a
noise
that
might
have
indicated
jubilation
or
disgust
it
was
hard
to
tell
because
she
was
crying
Harry
continued
heavily
oh
said
Ron
his
smile
fading
slightly
are
you
that
bad
at
kissing
dunno
said
Harry
who
hadnt
considered
this
and
immediately
felt
rather
worried
maybe
I
am
of
course
youre
not
said
Hermione
absently
still
scribbling
away
at
her
letter
how
do
you
know
said
Ron
very
sharply
because
Cho
spends
half
her
time
crying
these
days
said
Hermione
vaguely
she
does
it
at
mealtimes
in
the
loos
all
over
the
place
youd
think
a
bit
of
kissing
would
cheer
her
up
said
Ron
grinning
ron
said
Hermione
in
a
dignified
voice
dipping
the
point
of
her
quill
into
her
inkpot
you
are
the
most
insensitive
wart
I
have
ever
had
the
misfortune
to
meet
whats
that
supposed
to
mean
said
Ron
indignantly
what
sort
of
person
cries
while
someones
kissing
them
yeah
said
Harry
slightly
desperately
who
does
hermione
looked
at
the
pair
of
them
with
an
almost
pitying
expression
on
her
face
dont
you
understand
how
Chos
feeling
at
the
moment
she
asked
no
said
Harry
and
Ron
together
hermione
sighed
and
laid
down
her
quill
well
obviously
shes
feeling
very
sad
because
of
Cedric
dying
then
I
expect
shes
feeling
confused
because
she
liked
Cedric
and
now
she
likes
Harry
and
she
cant
work
out
who
she
likes
best
then
shell
be
feeling
guilty
thinking
its
an
insult
to
Cedrics
memory
to
be
kissing
harry
at
all
and
shell
be
worrying
about
what
everyone
else
might
say
about
her
if
she
starts
going
out
with
Harry
and
she
probably
cant
work
out
what
her
feelings
towards
Harry
are
anyway
because
he
was
the
one
who
was
with
Cedric
when
Cedric
died
so
thats
all
very
mixed
up
and
painful
oh
and
shes
afraid
shes
going
to
be
thrown
off
the
Ravenclaw
Quidditch
team
because
shes
been
flying
so
badly
a
slightly
stunned
silence
greeted
the
end
of
this
speech
then
Ron
said
One
person
cant
feel
all
that
at
once
theyd
explode
just
because
youve
got
the
emotional
range
of
a
teaspoon
doesnt
mean
we
all
have
said
hermione
nastily
picking
up
her
quill
again
she
was
the
one
who
started
it
said
Harry
i
wouldntve
she
just
sort
of
came
at
me
and
next
thing
shes
crying
all
over
me
I
didnt
know
what
to
do
dont
blame
you
mate
said
Ron
looking
alarmed
at
the
very
thought
you
just
had
to
be
nice
to
her
said
Hermione
looking
up
anxiously
you
were
werent
you
well
said
Harry
an
unpleasant
heat
creeping
up
his
face
I
sort
of
patted
her
on
the
back
a
bit
hermione
looked
as
though
she
was
restraining
herself
from
rolling
her
eyes
with
extreme
difficulty
well
I
suppose
it
could
have
been
worse
she
said
are
you
going
to
see
her
again
ill
have
to
wont
I
said
Harry
weve
got
D
a.
meetings
havent
we
you
know
what
I
mean
said
Hermione
impatiently
harry
said
nothing
hermiones
words
opened
up
a
whole
new
vista
of
frightening
possibilities
he
tried
to
imagine
going
somewhere
with
Cho
Hogsmeade
perhaps
and
being
alone
with
her
for
hours
at
a
time
of
course
she
would
have
been
expecting
him
to
ask
her
out
after
what
had
just
happened
the
thought
made
his
stomach
clench
painfully
oh
well
said
Hermione
distantly
buried
in
her
letter
once
more
youll
have
plenty
of
opportunities
to
ask
her
what
if
he
doesnt
want
to
ask
her
said
Ron
who
had
been
watching
Harry
with
an
unusually
shrewd
expression
on
his
face
dont
be
silly
said
Hermione
vaguely
Harrys
liked
her
for
ages
havent
you
Harry
he
did
not
answer
yes
he
had
liked
Cho
for
ages
but
whenever
he
had
imagined
a
scene
involving
the
two
of
them
it
had
always
featured
a
Cho
who
was
enjoying
herself
as
opposed
to
a
Cho
who
was
sobbing
uncontrollably
into
his
shoulder
whore
you
writing
the
novel
to
anyway
ron
asked
Hermione
trying
to
read
the
bit
of
parchment
now
trailing
on
the
floor
hermione
hitched
it
up
out
of
sight
viktor
krum
how
many
other
Viktors
do
we
know
ron
said
nothing
but
looked
disgruntled
they
sat
in
silence
for
another
twenty
minutes
Ron
finishing
his
Transfiguration
essay
with
many
snorts
of
impatience
and
crossings-out
Hermione
writing
steadily
to
the
very
end
of
the
parchment
rolling
it
up
carefully
and
sealing
it
and
Harry
staring
into
the
fire
wishing
more
than
anything
that
Siriuss
head
would
appear
there
and
give
him
some
advice
about
girls
but
the
fire
merely
crackled
lower
and
lower
until
the
red-hot
embers
crumbled
into
ash
and
looking
around
Harry
saw
that
they
were
yet
again
the
last
ones
in
the
common
room
well
night
said
Hermione
yawning
widely
as
she
set
off
up
the
girls
staircase
what
does
she
see
in
Krum
ron
demanded
as
he
and
Harry
climbed
the
boys
stairs
well
said
Harry
considering
the
matter
I
spose
hes
older
isnt
he
and
hes
an
international
Quidditch
player
yeah
but
apart
from
that
said
Ron
sounding
aggravated
i
mean
hes
a
grouchy
git
isnt
he
bit
grouchy
yeah
said
Harry
whose
thoughts
were
still
on
Cho
they
pulled
off
their
robes
and
put
on
pajamass
in
silence
Dean
Seamus
and
Neville
were
already
asleep
harry
put
his
glasses
on
his
bedside
table
and
got
into
bed
but
did
not
pull
the
hangings
closed
around
his
four-poster
instead
he
stared
at
the
patch
of
starry
sky
visible
through
the
window
next
to
Nevilles
bed
if
he
had
known
this
time
last
night
that
in
twenty-four
hours
time
he
would
have
kissed
Cho
Chang
night
grunted
Ron
from
somewhere
to
his
right
night
said
Harry
maybe
next
time
if
there
was
a
next
time
shed
be
a
bit
happier
he
ought
to
have
asked
her
out
she
had
probably
been
expecting
it
and
was
now
really
angry
with
him
or
was
she
lying
in
bed
still
crying
about
Cedric
he
did
not
know
what
to
think
hermiones
explanation
had
made
it
all
seem
more
complicated
rather
than
easier
to
understand
thats
what
they
should
teach
us
here
he
thought
turning
over
on
to
his
side
how
girls
brains
work
itd
be
more
useful
than
Divination
anyway
neville
snuffled
in
his
sleep
an
owl
hooted
somewhere
out
in
the
night
harry
dreamed
he
was
back
in
the
D
a.
room
cho
was
accusing
him
of
luring
her
there
under
false
pretences
she
said
he
had
promised
her
a
hundred
and
fifty
Chocolate
Frog
Cards
if
she
showed
up
harry
protested
cho
shouted
Cedric
gave
me
loads
of
Chocolate
Frog
Cards
look
and
she
pulled
out
fistfuls
of
Cards
from
in
side
her
robes
and
threw
them
into
the
air
then
she
turned
into
Hermione
who
said
You
did
promise
her
you
know
Harry
i
think
youd
better
give
her
something
else
instead
how
about
your
Firebolt
and
Harry
was
protesting
that
he
could
not
give
Cho
his
Firebolt
because
Umbridge
had
it
and
anyway
the
whole
thing
was
ridiculous
hed
only
come
to
the
D
a.
room
to
put
up
some
Christmas
baubles
shaped
like
Dobbys
head
the
dream
changed
his
body
felt
smooth
powerful
and
flexible
he
was
gliding
between
shining
metal
bars
across
dark
cold
stone
he
was
flat
against
the
floor
sliding
along
on
his
belly
it
was
dark
yet
he
could
see
objects
around
him
shimmering
in
strange
vibrant
colors
he
was
turning
his
head
at
first
glance
the
corridor
was
empty
but
no
a
man
was
sitting
on
the
floor
ahead
his
chin
drooping
on
to
his
chest
his
outline
gleaming
in
the
dark
harry
put
out
his
tongue
he
tasted
the
mans
scent
on
the
air
he
was
alive
but
drowsy
sitting
in
front
of
a
door
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
harry
longed
to
bite
the
man
but
he
must
master
the
impulse
he
had
more
important
work
to
do
but
the
man
was
stirring
a
silver
Cloak
fell
from
his
legs
as
he
jumped
to
his
feet
and
Harry
saw
his
vibrant
blurred
outline
towering
above
him
saw
a
wand
withdrawn
from
a
belt
he
had
no
choice
he
reared
high
from
the
floor
and
struck
once
twice
three
times
plunging
his
fangs
deeply
into
the
mans
flesh
feeling
his
ribs
splinter
beneath
his
jaws
feeling
the
warm
gush
of
blood
the
man
was
yelling
in
pain
then
he
fell
silent
he
slumped
backwards
against
the
wall
blood
was
splattering
on
to
the
floor
his
forehead
hurt
terribly
it
was
aching
fit
to
burst
harry
harry
he
opened
his
eyes
every
inch
of
his
body
was
covered
in
icy
sweat
his
bed
covers
were
twisted
all
around
him
like
a
strait-jacket
he
felt
as
though
a
white-hot
poker
were
being
applied
to
his
forehead
harry
ron
was
standing
over
him
looking
extremely
frightened
there
were
more
figures
at
the
foot
of
harrys
bed
he
clutched
his
head
in
his
hands
the
pain
was
blinding
him
he
rolled
right
over
and
vomited
over
the
edge
of
the
mattress
hes
really
ill
said
a
scared
voice
should
we
call
someone
harry
harry
he
had
to
tell
Ron
it
was
very
important
that
he
tell
him
taking
great
gulps
of
air
Harry
pushed
himself
up
in
bed
willing
himself
not
to
throw
up
again
the
pain
half-blinding
him
your
dad
he
panted
his
chest
heaving
your
dads
been
attacked
what
said
Ron
uncomprehendingly
your
dad
hes
been
bitten
its
serious
there
was
blood
everywhere
im
going
for
help
said
the
same
scared
voice
and
Harry
heard
footsteps
running
out
of
the
dormitory
harry
mate
said
Ron
uncertainly
you
you
were
just
dreaming
no
said
Harry
furiously
it
was
crucial
that
Ron
understand
it
wasnt
a
dream
not
an
ordinary
dream
i
was
there
I
saw
it
i
did
it
he
could
hear
Seamus
and
Dean
muttering
but
did
not
care
the
pain
in
his
forehead
was
subsiding
slightly
though
he
was
still
sweating
and
shivering
feverishly
he
retched
again
and
ron
leapt
backwards
out
of
the
way
harry
youre
not
well
he
said
shakily
nevilles
gone
for
help
im
fine
harry
choked
wiping
his
mouth
on
his
p
yjamas
and
shaking
uncontrollably
theres
nothing
wrong
with
me
its
your
dad
youve
got
to
worry
about
we
need
to
find
out
where
he
is
hes
bleeding
like
mad
I
was
it
was
a
huge
snake
he
tried
to
get
out
of
bed
but
Ron
pushed
him
back
into
it
Dean
and
Seamus
were
still
whispering
somewhere
nearby
whether
one
minute
passed
or
ten
Harry
did
not
know
he
simply
sat
there
shaking
feeling
the
pain
recede
very
slowly
from
his
scar
then
there
were
hurried
footsteps
coming
up
the
stairs
and
he
heard
Nevilles
voice
again
over
here
Professor
professor
McGonagall
came
hurrying
into
the
dormitory
in
her
tartan
dressing
gown
her
glasses
perched
lopsidedly
on
the
bridge
of
her
bony
nose
what
is
it
Potter
where
does
it
hurt
he
had
never
been
so
pleased
to
see
her
it
was
a
member
of
the
Order
of
the
Phoenix
he
needed
now
not
someone
fussing
over
him
and
prescribing
useless
potions
its
Rons
dad
he
said
sitting
up
again
hes
been
attacked
by
a
snake
and
its
serious
I
saw
it
happen
what
do
you
mean
you
saw
it
happen
said
Professor
McGonagall
her
dark
eyebrows
contracting
i
dont
know
i
was
asleep
and
then
I
was
there
you
mean
you
dreamed
this
no
said
Harry
angrily
would
none
of
them
understand
i
was
having
a
dream
at
first
about
something
completely
different
something
stupid
and
then
this
interrupted
it
it
was
real
I
didnt
imagine
it
mr.
Weasley
was
asleep
on
the
floor
and
he
was
attacked
by
a
gigantic
snake
there
was
a
load
of
blood
he
collapsed
someones
got
to
find
out
where
he
is
professor
McGonagall
was
gazing
at
him
through
her
lopsided
spectacles
as
though
horrified
at
what
she
was
seeing
im
not
lying
and
Im
not
mad
harry
told
her
his
voice
rising
to
a
shout
i
tell
you
I
saw
it
happen
i
believe
you
Potter
said
Professor
McGonagall
curtly
put
on
your
dressing
gown
were
going
to
see
the
Headmaster
chapter
twenty-two
st.
Mungos
Hospital
for
Magical
Maladies
and
Injuries
harry
was
so
relieved
she
was
taking
him
seriously
that
he
did
not
hesitate
but
jumped
out
of
bed
at
once
pulled
on
his
dressing
gown
and
pushed
his
glasses
back
on
to
his
nose
weasley
you
ought
to
come
too
said
Professor
McGonagall
they
followed
Professor
McGonagall
past
the
silent
figures
of
Neville
Dean
and
Seamus
out
of
the
dormitory
down
the
spiral
stairs
into
the
common
room
through
the
portrait
hole
and
off
along
the
Fat
Ladys
moonlit
corridor
harry
felt
as
though
the
panic
inside
him
might
spill
over
at
any
moment
he
wanted
to
run
to
yell
for
Dumbledore
mr.
Weasley
was
bleeding
as
they
walked
along
so
sedately
and
what
if
those
fangs
Harry
tried
hard
not
to
think
my
fangs
had
been
poisonous
they
passed
Mrs
Norris
who
turned
her
lamplike
eyes
upon
them
and
hissed
faintly
but
Professor
McGonagall
said
Shoo
mrs
Norris
slunk
away
into
the
shadows
and
in
a
few
minutes
they
had
reached
the
stone
gargoyle
guarding
the
entrance
to
Dumbledores
office
fizzing
Whizzbee
said
Professor
McGonagall
the
gargoyle
sprang
to
life
and
leapt
aside
the
wall
behind
it
split
in
two
to
reveal
a
stone
staircase
that
was
moving
continually
upwards
like
a
spiral
escalator
the
three
of
them
stepped
on
to
the
moving
stairs
the
wall
closed
behind
them
with
a
thud
and
they
were
moving
upwards
in
tight
circles
until
they
reached
the
highly
polished
oak
door
with
the
brass
knocker
shaped
like
a
griffin
though
it
was
now
well
past
midnight
there
were
voices
coming
from
inside
the
room
a
positive
babble
of
them
it
sounded
as
though
Dumbledore
was
entertaining
at
least
a
dozen
people
professor
McGonagall
rapped
three
times
with
the
griffin
knocker
and
the
voices
ceased
abruptly
as
though
someone
had
switched
them
all
off
the
door
opened
of
its
own
accord
and
Professor
mcGonagall
led
Harry
and
Ron
inside
the
room
was
in
half-darkness
the
strange
silver
instruments
standing
on
tables
were
silent
and
still
rather
than
whirring
and
emitting
puffs
of
smoke
as
they
usually
did
the
portraits
of
old
headmasters
and
headmistresses
covering
the
walls
were
all
snoozing
in
their
frames
behind
the
door
a
magnificent
red
and
gold
bird
the
size
of
a
swan
dozed
on
its
perch
with
its
head
under
its
wing
oh
its
you
Professor
McGonagall
and
ah
dumbledore
was
sitting
in
a
high-backed
chair
behind
his
desk
he
leaned
forward
into
the
pool
of
candlelight
illuminating
the
papers
laid
out
before
him
he
was
wearing
a
magnificently
embroidered
purple
and
gold
dressing
gown
over
a
snowy
white
nightshirt
but
seemed
wideawake
his
penetrating
light
blue
eyes
fixed
intently
upon
Professor
McGonagall
professor
Dumbledore
Potter
has
had
a
well
a
nightmare
said
Professor
McGonagall
he
says
it
wasnt
a
nightmare
said
Harry
quickly
professor
McGonagall
looked
round
at
Harry
frowning
slightly
very
well
then
Potter
you
tell
the
Headmaster
about
it
well
I
was
asleep
said
Harry
and
even
in
his
terror
and
his
desperation
to
make
dumbledore
understand
he
felt
slightly
irritated
that
the
Headmaster
was
not
looking
at
him
but
examining
his
own
interlocked
fingers
but
it
wasnt
an
ordinary
dream
it
was
real
i
saw
it
happen
he
took
a
deep
breath
Rons
dad
mr.
Weasley
has
been
attacked
by
a
giant
snake
the
words
seemed
to
reverberate
in
the
air
after
he
had
said
them
sounding
slightly
ridiculous
even
comic
there
was
a
pause
in
which
Dumbledore
leaned
back
and
stared
meditatively
at
the
ceiling
ron
looked
from
Harry
to
Dumbledore
white-faced
and
shocked
how
did
you
see
this
dumbledore
asked
quietly
still
not
looking
at
Harry
well
i
dont
know
said
Harry
rather
angrily
what
did
it
matter
inside
my
head
I
suppose
you
misunderstand
me
said
Dumbledore
still
in
the
same
calm
tone
i
mean
can
you
remember
er
where
you
were
positioned
as
you
watched
this
attack
happen
were
you
perhaps
standing
beside
the
victim
or
else
looking
down
on
the
scene
from
above
this
was
such
a
curious
question
that
Harry
gaped
at
Dumbledore
it
was
almost
as
though
he
knew
i
was
the
snake
he
said
i
saw
it
all
from
the
snakes
point
of
view
nobody
else
spoke
for
a
moment
then
Dumbledore
now
looking
at
Ron
who
was
still
wheyfaced
asked
in
a
new
and
sharper
voice
Is
Arthur
seriously
injured
yes
said
Harry
emphatically
why
were
they
all
so
slow
on
the
uptake
did
they
not
realize
how
much
a
person
bled
when
fangs
that
long
pierced
their
side
and
why
could
Dumbledore
not
do
him
the
courtesy
of
looking
at
him
but
Dumbledore
stood
up
so
quickly
it
made
Harry
jump
and
addressed
one
of
the
old
portraits
hanging
very
near
the
ceiling
everard
he
said
sharply
and
you
too
Dilys
a
sallow-faced
wizard
with
a
short
black
bangs
and
an
elderly
witch
with
long
silver
ringlets
in
the
frame
beside
him
both
of
whom
seemed
to
have
been
in
the
deepest
of
sleeps
opened
their
eyes
immediately
you
were
listening
said
Dumbledore
the
wizard
nodded
the
witch
said
Naturally
the
man
has
red
hair
and
glasses
said
Dumbledore
everard
you
will
need
to
raise
the
alarm
make
sure
he
is
found
by
the
right
people
both
nodded
and
moved
sideways
out
of
their
frames
but
instead
of
emerging
in
neighboring
pictures
as
usually
happened
at
Hogwarts
neither
reappeared
one
frame
now
contained
nothing
but
a
backdrop
of
dark
curtain
the
other
a
handsome
leather
armchair
harry
noticed
that
many
of
the
other
headmasters
and
mistresses
on
the
walls
though
snoring
and
drooling
most
convincingly
kept
sneaking
peeks
at
him
from
under
their
eyelids
and
he
suddenly
understood
who
had
been
talking
when
they
had
knocked
everard
and
Dilys
were
two
of
Hogwartss
most
celebrated
Heads
Dumbledore
said
now
sweeping
around
Harry
Ron
and
Professor
McGonagall
to
approach
the
magnificent
sleeping
bird
on
his
perch
beside
the
door
their
renown
is
such
that
both
have
portraits
hanging
in
other
important
wizarding
institutions
as
they
are
free
to
move
between
their
own
portraits
they
can
tell
us
what
may
be
happening
elsewhere
but
mr.
Weasley
could
be
anywhere
said
Harry
please
sit
down
all
three
of
you
said
Dumbledore
as
though
Harry
had
not
spoken
Everard
and
Dilys
may
not
be
back
for
several
minutes
professor
McGonagall
if
you
could
draw
up
extra
chairs
professor
McGonagall
pulled
her
wand
from
the
pocket
of
her
dressing
gown
and
waved
it
three
chairs
appeared
out
of
thin
air
straight-backed
and
wooden
quite
unlike
the
comfortable
chintz
armchairs
that
Dumbledore
had
conjured
up
at
Harrys
hearing
harry
sat
down
watching
dumbledore
over
his
shoulder
dumbledore
was
now
stroking
Fawkess
plumed
golden
head
with
one
finger
the
phoenix
awoke
immediately
he
stretched
his
beautiful
head
high
and
observed
Dumbledore
through
bright
dark
eyes
we
will
need
Dumbledore
said
very
quietly
to
the
bird
a
warning
there
was
a
flash
of
fire
and
the
phoenix
had
gone
dumbledore
now
swooped
down
upon
one
of
the
fragile
silver
instruments
whose
function
Harry
had
never
known
carried
it
over
to
his
desk
sat
down
facing
them
again
and
tapped
it
gently
with
the
tip
of
his
wand
the
instrument
tinkled
into
life
at
once
with
rhythmic
clinking
noises
tiny
puffs
of
pale
green
smoke
issued
from
the
minuscule
silver
tube
at
the
top
dumbledore
watched
the
smoke
closely
his
brow
furrowed
after
a
few
seconds
the
tiny
puffs
became
a
steady
stream
of
smoke
that
thickened
and
coiled
in
the
air
a
serpents
head
grew
out
of
the
end
of
it
opening
its
mouth
wide
harry
wondered
whether
the
instrument
was
confirming
his
story
he
looked
eagerly
at
dumbledore
for
a
sign
that
he
was
right
but
Dumbledore
did
not
look
up
naturally
naturally
murmured
Dumbledore
apparently
to
himself
still
observing
the
stream
of
smoke
without
the
slightest
sign
of
surprise
but
in
essence
divided
harry
could
make
neither
head
nor
tail
of
this
question
the
smoke
serpent
however
split
itself
instantly
into
two
snakes
both
coiling
and
undulating
in
the
dark
air
with
a
look
of
grim
satisfaction
Dumbledore
gave
the
instrument
another
gentle
tap
with
his
wand
the
clinking
noise
slowed
and
died
and
the
smoke
serpents
grew
faint
became
a
formless
haze
and
vanished
dumbledore
replaced
the
instrument
on
its
spindly
little
table
harry
saw
many
of
the
old
headmasters
in
the
portraits
follow
him
with
their
eyes
then
realizing
that
Harry
was
watching
them
hastily
pretend
to
be
sleeping
again
harry
wanted
to
ask
what
the
strange
silver
instrument
was
for
but
before
he
could
do
so
there
was
a
shout
from
the
top
of
the
wall
to
their
right
the
wizard
called
Everard
had
reappeared
in
his
portrait
panting
slightly
dumbledore
what
news
said
Dumbledore
at
once
i
yelled
until
someone
came
running
said
the
wizard
who
was
mopping
his
brow
on
the
curtain
behind
him
said
Id
heard
something
moving
downstairs
they
werent
sure
whether
to
believe
me
but
went
down
to
check
you
know
there
are
no
portraits
down
there
to
watch
from
anyway
they
carried
him
up
a
few
minutes
later
he
doesnt
look
good
hes
covered
in
blood
I
ran
along
to
Elfrida
Craggs
portrait
to
get
a
good
view
as
they
left
good
said
Dumbledore
as
Ron
made
a
convulsive
movement
i
take
it
Dilys
will
have
seen
him
arrive
then
and
moments
later
the
silver-ringleted
witch
had
reappeared
in
her
picture
too
she
sank
coughing
into
her
armchair
and
said
Yes
theyve
taken
him
to
st.
Mungos
Dumbledore
they
carried
him
past
my
portrait
he
looks
bad
thank
you
said
Dumbledore
he
looked
round
at
Professor
McGonagall
minerva
I
need
you
to
go
and
wake
the
other
Weasley
children
of
course
professor
McGonagall
got
up
and
moved
swiftly
to
the
door
harry
cast
a
sideways
glance
at
ron
who
was
looking
terrified
and
Dumbledore
what
about
Molly
said
Professor
McGonagall
pausing
at
the
door
that
will
be
a
job
for
Fawkes
when
he
has
finished
keeping
a
lookout
for
anybody
approaching
said
Dumbledore
but
she
may
already
know
that
excellent
clock
of
hers
harry
knew
Dumbledore
was
referring
to
the
clock
that
told
not
the
time
but
the
whereabouts
and
conditions
of
the
various
Weasley
family
members
and
with
a
pang
he
thought
that
Mr
weasleys
hand
must
even
now
be
pointing
atmortal
peril
but
it
was
very
late
mrs
weasley
was
probably
asleep
not
watching
the
clock
harry
felt
cold
as
he
remembered
Mrs
weasleys
boggart
turning
into
mr.
Weasleys
lifeless
body
his
glasses
askew
blood
running
down
his
face
but
mr.
Weasley
wasnt
going
to
die
he
couldnt
dumbledore
was
now
rummaging
in
a
cupboard
behind
Harry
and
Ron
he
emerged
from
it
carrying
a
blackened
old
kettle
which
he
placed
carefully
on
his
desk
he
raised
his
wand
and
murmured
Portus
for
a
moment
the
kettle
trembled
glowing
with
an
odd
blue
light
then
it
quivered
to
rest
as
solidly
black
as
ever
dumbledore
marched
over
to
another
portrait
this
time
of
a
clever-looking
wizard
with
a
pointed
beard
who
had
been
painted
wearing
the
Slytherin
colors
of
green
and
silver
and
was
apparently
sleeping
so
deeply
that
he
could
not
hear
Dumbledores
voice
when
he
attempted
to
rouse
him
phineas
phineas
the
subjects
of
the
portraits
lining
the
room
were
no
longer
pretending
to
be
asleep
they
were
shifting
around
in
their
frames
the
better
to
watch
what
was
happening
when
the
clever-looking
wizard
continued
to
feign
sleep
some
of
them
shouted
his
name
too
phineas
phineas
phineas
he
could
not
pretend
any
longer
he
gave
a
theatrical
jerk
and
opened
his
eyes
wide
did
someone
call
i
need
you
to
visit
your
other
portrait
again
Phineas
said
Dumbledore
ive
got
another
message
visit
my
other
portrait
said
Phineas
in
a
reedy
voice
giving
a
long
fake
yawn
his
eyes
traveling
around
the
room
and
focusing
on
Harry
oh
no
Dumbledore
I
am
too
tired
tonight
something
about
Phineass
voice
was
familiar
to
Harry
where
had
he
heard
it
before
but
before
he
could
think
the
portraits
on
the
surrounding
walls
broke
into
a
storm
of
protest
insubordination
sir
roared
a
corpulent
red-nosed
wizard
brandishing
his
fists
dereliction
of
duty
we
are
honor-bound
to
give
service
to
the
present
Headmaster
of
Hogwarts
cried
a
fraillooking
old
wizard
whom
Harry
recognized
as
Dumbledores
predecessor
Armando
Dippet
shame
on
you
Phineas
shall
I
persuade
him
Dumbledore
called
a
gimlet-eyed
witch
raising
an
unusually
thick
wand
that
looked
not
unlike
a
birch
rod
oh
very
well
said
the
wizard
called
Phineas
eyeing
the
wand
with
mild
apprehension
though
he
may
well
have
destroyed
my
picture
by
now
hes
done
away
with
most
of
the
family
sirius
knows
not
to
destroy
your
portrait
said
Dumbledore
and
Harry
realized
immediately
where
he
had
heard
Phineass
voice
before
issuing
from
the
apparently
empty
frame
in
his
bedroom
in
Grimmauld
Place
you
are
to
give
him
the
message
that
Arthur
Weasley
has
been
gravely
injured
and
that
his
wife
children
and
Harry
Potter
will
be
arriving
at
his
house
shortly
do
you
understand
arthur
Weasley
injured
wife
and
children
and
Harry
Potter
coming
to
stay
repeated
Phineas
in
a
bored
voice
yes
yes
very
well
he
sloped
away
into
the
frame
of
the
portrait
and
disappeared
from
view
at
the
very
moment
the
study
door
opened
again
fred
George
and
Ginny
were
ushered
inside
by
Professor
McGonagall
all
three
of
them
looking
dishevelled
and
shocked
still
in
their
night
things
harry
whats
going
on
asked
Ginny
who
looked
frightened
professor
McGonagall
says
you
saw
Dad
get
hurt
your
father
has
been
injured
in
the
course
of
his
work
for
the
Order
of
the
Phoenix
said
dumbledore
before
Harry
could
speak
he
has
been
taken
to
st.
Mungos
Hospital
for
Magical
maladies
and
Injuries
i
am
sending
you
back
to
Siriuss
house
which
is
much
more
convenient
for
the
hospital
than
The
Burrow

meet
your
mother
there
howre

asked
Fred
looking
shaken
floo
powder
no
said
Dumbledore
Floo
powder

not
safe
at
the
moment
the
Network
is
being
watched
you
will
be
taking
a
Portkey
he
indicated
the
old
kettle
lying
innocently
on
his
desk
we
are
just
waiting
for
Phineas
Nigellus
to
report
back
i
want
to
be
sure
that
the
coast
is
clear
before
sending
you
there
was
a
flash
of
flame
in
the
very
middle
of
the
office
leaving
behind
a
single
golden
feather
that
floated
gently
to
the
floor
it
is
Fawkess
warning
said
Dumbledore
catching
the
feather
as
it
fell
professor
Umbridge
must
know
youre
out
of
your
beds
minerva
go
and
head
her
off
tell
her
any
story
professor
McGonagall
was
gone
in
a
swish
of
tartan
he
says
hell
be
delighted
said
a
bored
voice
behind
Dumbledore
the
wizard
called
Phineas
had
reappeared
in
front
of
his
Slytherin
banner
my
great-great-grandson
has
always
had
an
odd
taste
in
house-guests
come
here
then
Dumbledore
said
to
Harry
and
the
Weasleys
and
quickly
before
anyone
else
joins
us
harry
and
the
others
gathered
around
Dumbledores
desk
you
have
all
used
a
Portkey
before
asked
Dumbledore
and
they
nodded
each
reaching
out
to
touch
some
part
of
the
blackened
kettle
good
on
the
count
of
three
then
one
two
it
happened
in
a
fraction
of
a
second
in
the
infinitesimal
pause
before
Dumbledore
said
three
harry
looked
up
at
him
they
were
very
close
together
and
Dumbledores
clear
blue
gaze
moved
from
the
Portkey
to
Harrys
face
at
once
Harrys
scar
burned
white-hot
as
though
the
old
wound
had
burst
open
again
and
unbidden
unwanted
but
terrifyingly
strong
there
rose
within
Harry
a
hatred
so
powerful
he
felt
for
that
instant
he
would
like
nothing
better
than
to
strike
to
bite
to
sink
his
fangs
into
the
man
before
him
three
harry
felt
a
powerful
jerk
behind
his
navel
the
ground
vanished
from
beneath
his
feet
his
hand
was
glued
to
the
kettle
he
was
banging
into
the
others
as
they
all
sped
forwards
in
a
swirl
of
colors
and
a
rush
of
wind
the
kettle
pulling
them
onwards
until
his
feet
hit
the
ground
so
hard
his
knees
buckled
the
kettle
clattered
to
the
ground
and
somewhere
close
at
hand
a
voice
said
back
again
the
blood-traitor
brats
is
it
true
their
fathers
dying
out
roared
a
second
voice
harry
scrambled
to
his
feet
and
looked
around
they
had
arrived
in
the
gloomy
basement
kitchen
of
number
twelve
Grimmauld
Place
the
only
sources
of
light
were
the
fire
and
one
guttering
candle
which
illuminated
the
remains
of
a
solitary
supper
kreacher
was
disappearing
through
the
door
to
the
hall
looking
back
at
them
malevolently
as
he
hitched
up
his
loincloth
Sirius
was
hurrying
towards
them
all
looking
anxious
he
was
unshaven
and
still
in
his
day
clothes
there
was
also
a
slightly
mundungus-like
whiff
of
stale
drink
about
him
whats
going
on
he
said
stretching
out
a
hand
to
help
Ginny
up
phineas
Nigellus
said
arthurs
been
badly
injured
ask
Harry
said
Fred
yeah
I
want
to
hear
this
for
myself
said
George
the
twins
and
Ginny
were
staring
at
him
kreachers
footsteps
had
stopped
on
the
stairs
outside
it
was
Harry
began
this
was
even
worse
than
telling
McGonagall
and
Dumbledore
i
had
a
a
kind
of
vision
and
he
told
them
all
that
he
had
seen
though
he
altered
the
story
so
that
it
sounded
as
though
he
had
watched
from
the
sidelines
as
the
snake
attacked
rather
than
from
behind
the
snakes
own
eyes
ron
who
was
still
very
white
gave
him
a
fleeting
look
but
did
not
speak
when
Harry
had
finished
Fred
George
and
Ginny
continued
to
stare
at
him
for
a
moment
harry
did
not
know
whether
he
was
imagining
it
or
not
but
he
fancied
there
was
something
accusatory
in
their
looks
well
if
they
were
going
to
blame
him
just
for
seeing
the
attack
he
was
glad
he
had
not
told
them
that
he
had
been
inside
the
snake
at
the
time
is
Mum
here
said
Fred
turning
to
Sirius
she
probably
doesnt
even
know
whats
happened
yet
said
Sirius
the
important
thing
was
to
get
you
away
before
Umbridge
could
interfere
i
expect
Dumbledores
letting
Molly
know
now
weve
got
to
go
to
st.
Mungos
said
Ginny
urgently
she
looked
around
at
her
brothers
they
were
of
course
still
in
their
pajamass
sirius
can
you
lend
us
cloaks
or
anything
hang
on
you
cant
go
tearing
off
to
st.
Mungos
said
Sirius
course
we
can
go
to
st.
Mungos
if
we
want
said
Fred
with
a
mulish
expression
hes
our
dad
and
how
are
you
going
to
explain
how
you
knew
Arthur
was
attacked
before
the
hospital
even
let
his
wife
know
what
does
that
matter
said
George
hotly
it
matters
because
we
dont
want
to
draw
attention
to
the
fact
that
Harry
is
having
visions
of
things
that
are
happening
hundreds
of
miles
away
said
Sirius
angrily
have
you
any
idea
what
the
Ministry
would
make
of
that
information
fred
and
George
looked
as
though
they
could
not
care
less
what
the
Ministry
made
of
anything
ron
was
still
ashen-faced
and
silent
ginny
said
Somebody
else
could
have
told
us
we
could
have
heard
it
somewhere
other
than
harry
like
who
said
Sirius
impatiently
listen
your
dads
been
hurt
while
on
duty
for
the
Order
and
the
circumstances
are
fishy
enough
without
his
children
knowing
about
it
seconds
after
it
happened
you
could
seriously
damage
the
Orders
we
dont
care
about
the
dumb
Order
shouted
Fred
its
our
dad
dying
were
talking
about
yelled
George
your
father
knew
what
he
was
getting
into
and
he
wont
thank
you
for
messing
things
up
for
the
order
said
Sirius
equally
angry
this
is
how
it
is
this
is
why
youre
not
in
the
Order
you
dont
understand
there
are
things
worth
dying
for
easy
for
you
to
say
stuck
here
bellowed
Fred
i
dont
see
you
risking
your
neck
the
little
color
remaining
in
Siriuss
face
drained
from
it
he
looked
for
a
moment
as
though
he
would
quite
like
to
hit
Fred
but
when
he
spoke
it
was
in
a
voice
of
determined
calm
i
know
its
hard
but
weve
all
got
to
act
as
though
we
dont
know
anything
yet
weve
got
to
stay
put
at
least
until
we
hear
from
your
mother
all
right
fred
and
George
still
looked
mutinous
ginny
however
took
a
few
steps
over
to
the
nearest
chair
and
sank
into
it
harry
looked
at
Ron
who
made
a
funny
movement
somewhere
between
a
nod
and
a
shrug
and
they
sat
down
too
the
twins
glared
at
Sirius
for
another
minute
then
took
seats
either
side
of
Ginny
thats
right
said
Sirius
encouragingly
come
on
lets
all
lets
all
have
a
drink
while
were
waiting
accio
Butterbeer
he
raised
his
wand
as
he
spoke
and
half
a
dozen
bottles
came
flying
towards
them
out
of
the
pantry
skidded
along
the
table
scattering
the
debris
of
Sinuss
meal
and
stopped
neatly
in
front
of
the
six
of
them
they
all
drank
and
for
a
while
the
only
sounds
were
those
of
the
crackling
of
the
kitchen
fire
and
the
soft
thud
of
their
bottles
on
the
table
harry
was
only
drinking
to
have
something
to
do
with
his
hands
his
stomach
was
full
of
horrible
hot
bubbling
guilt
they
would
not
be
here
if
it
were
not
for
him
they
would
all
still
be
asleep
in
bed
and
it
was
no
good
telling
himself
that
by
raising
the
alarm
he
had
ensured
that
mr.
Weasley
was
found
because
there
was
also
the
in
escapable
business
of
it
being
he
who
had
attacked
mr.
Weasley
in
the
first
place
dont
be
stupid
you
havent
got
fangs
he
told
himself
trying
to
keep
calm
though
the
hand
on
his
Butterbeer
bottle
was
shaking
you
were
lying
in
bed
you
werent
attacking
anyone
but
then
what
just
happened
in
Dumbledores
office
he
asked
himself
i
felt
like
I
wanted
to
attack
Dumbledore
too
he
put
the
bottle
down
a
little
harder
than
he
meant
to
and
it
slopped
over
on
to
the
table
no
one
took
any
notice
then
a
burst
of
fire
in
midair
illuminated
the
dirty
plates
in
front
of
them
and
as
they
gave
cries
of
shock
a
scroll
of
parchment
fell
with
a
thud
on
to
the
table
accompanied
by
a
single
golden
phoenix
tail
feather
fawkes
said
Sirius
at
once
snatching
up
the
parchment
thats
not
Dumbledores
writing
it
must
be
a
message
from
your
mother
here
he
thrust
the
letter
into
Georges
hand
who
ripped
it
open
and
read
aloud
Dad
is
still
alive
am
setting
out
for
st.
Mungos
now
stay
where
you
are
i
will
send
news
as
soon
as
I
can
mum
george
looked
around
the
table
still
alive
he
said
slowly
but
that
makes
it
sound
he
did
not
need
to
finish
the
sentence
it
sounded
to
Harry
too
as
though
mr.
Weasley
was
hovering
somewhere
between
life
and
death
still
exceptionally
pale
Ron
stared
at
the
back
of
his
mothers
letter
as
though
it
might
speak
words
of
comfort
to
him
fred
pulled
the
parchment
out
of
Georges
hands
and
read
it
for
himself
then
looked
up
at
Harry
who
felt
his
hand
shaking
on
his
Butterbeer
bottle
again
and
clenched
it
more
tightly
to
stop
the
trembling
if
Harry
had
ever
sat
through
a
longer
night
than
this
one
he
could
not
remember
it
sirius
suggested
once
without
any
real
conviction
that
they
all
go
to
bed
but
the
Weasleys
looks
of
disgust
were
answer
enough
they
mostly
sat
in
silence
around
the
table
watching
the
candle
wick
sinking
lower
and
lower
into
liquid
wax
occasionally
raising
a
bottle
to
their
lips
speaking
only
to
check
the
time
to
wonder
aloud
what
was
happening
and
to
reassure
each
other
that
if
there
was
bad
news
they
would
know
straightaway
for
Mrs
weasley
must
long
since
have
arrived
at
st.
Mungos
fred
fell
into
a
doze
his
head
lolling
sideways
on
to
his
shoulder
ginny
was
curled
like
a
cat
on
her
chair
but
her
eyes
were
open
Harry
could
see
them
reflecting
the
firelight
ron
was
sitting
with
his
head
in
his
hands
whether
awake
or
asleep
it
was
impossible
to
tell
harry
and
Sirius
looked
at
each
other
every
so
often
intruders
upon
the
family
grief
waiting
waiting
at
ten
past
five
in
the
morning
by
Rons
watch
the
kitchen
door
swung
open
and
Mrs
weasley
entered
the
kitchen
she
was
extremely
pale
but
when
they
all
turned
to
look
at
her
Fred
Ron
and
Harry
half
rising
from
their
chairs
she
gave
a
wan
smile
hes
going
to
be
all
right
she
said
her
voice
weak
with
tiredness
hes
sleeping
we
can
all
go
and
see
him
later
bills
sitting
with
him
now
hes
going
to
take
the
morning
off
work
fred
fell
back
into
his
chair
with
his
hands
over
his
face
george
and
Ginny
got
up
walked
swiftly
over
to
their
mother
and
hugged
her
ron
gave
a
very
shaky
laugh
and
downed
the
rest
of
his
Butterbeer
in
one
breakfast
said
Sirius
loudly
and
joyfully
jumping
to
his
feet
wheres
that
accursed
house-elf
kreacher
kreacher
but
Kreacher
did
not
answer
the
summons
oh
forget
it
then
muttered
Sirius
counting
the
people
in
front
of
him
so
its
breakfast
for
lets
see
seven
bacon
and
eggs
I
think
and
some
tea
and
toast
harry
hurried
over
to
the
stove
to
help
he
did
not
want
to
intrude
on
the
Weasleys
happiness
and
he
dreaded
the
moment
when
Mrs
weasley
would
ask
him
to
recount
his
vision
however
he
had
barely
taken
plates
from
the
dresser
when
Mrs
weasley
lifted
them
out
of
his
hands
and
pulled
him
into
a
hug
i
dont
know
what
would
have
happened
if
it
hadnt
been
for
you
Harry
she
said
in
a
muffled
voice
they
might
not
have
found
Arthur
for
hours
and
then
it
would
have
been
too
late
but
thanks
to
you
hes
alive
and
Dumbledores
been
able
to
think
up
a
good
cover
story
for
Arthur
being
where
he
was
youve
no
idea
what
trouble
he
would
have
been
in
otherwise
look
at
poor
sturgis
harry
could
hardly
bear
her
gratitude
but
fortunately
she
soon
released
him
to
turn
to
Sirius
and
thank
him
for
looking
after
her
children
through
the
night
sirius
said
he
was
very
pleased
to
have
been
able
to
help
and
hoped
they
would
all
stay
with
him
as
long
as
mr.
Weasley
was
in
hospital
oh
Sirius
Im
so
grateful
they
think
hell
be
there
a
little
while
and
it
would
be
wonderful
to
be
nearer
of
course
that
might
mean
were
here
for
Christmas
the
more
the
merrier
said
Sirius
with
such
obvious
sincerity
that
Mrs
weasley
beamed
at
him
threw
on
an
apron
and
began
to
help
with
breakfast
sirius
Harry
muttered
unable
to
stand
it
a
moment
longer
can
I
have
a
quick
word
er
now
he
walked
into
the
dark
pantry
and
Sirius
followed
without
preamble
Harry
told
his
godfather
every
detail
of
the
vision
he
had
had
including
the
fact
that
he
himself
had
been
the
snake
who
had
attacked
mr.
Weasley
when
he
paused
for
breath
Sirius
said
Did
you
tell
Dumbledore
this
yes
said
Harry
impatiently
but
he
didnt
tell
me
what
it
meant
well
he
doesnt
tell
me
anything
any
more
im
sure
he
would
have
told
you
if
it
was
anything
to
worry
about
said
Sirius
steadily
but
thats
not
all
said
Harry
in
a
voice
only
a
little
above
a
whisper
sirius
I
i
think
Im
going
mad
back
in
Dumbledores
office
just
before
we
took
the
Portkey
for
a
couple
of
seconds
there
I
thought
I
was
a
snake
I
felt
like
one
my
scar
really
hurt
when
I
was
looking
at
dumbledore
Sirius
I
wanted
to
attack
him
he
could
only
see
a
sliver
of
Siriuss
face
the
rest
was
in
darkness
it
must
have
been
the
aftermath
of
the
vision
thats
all
said
Sirius
you
were
still
thinking
of
the
dream
or
whatever
it
was
and
it
wasnt
that
said
Harry
shaking
his
head
it
was
like
something
rose
up
inside
me
like
theres
a
snake
inside
me
you
need
to
sleep
said
Sirius
firmly
youre
going
to
have
breakfast
then
go
upstairs
to
bed
and
after
lunch
you
can
go
and
see
Arthur
with
the
others
youre
in
shock
Harry
youre
blaming
yourself
for
something
you
only
witnessed
and
its
lucky
you
did
witness
it
or
Arthur
might
have
died
just
stop
worrying
he
clapped
Harry
on
the
shoulder
and
left
the
pantry
leaving
Harry
standing
alone
in
the
dark
everyone
but
Harry
spent
the
rest
of
the
morning
sleeping
he
went
up
to
the
bedroom
he
and
ron
had
shared
over
the
last
few
weeks
of
summer
but
while
Ron
crawled
into
bed
and
was
asleep
within
minutes
Harry
sat
fully
clothed
hunched
against
the
cold
metal
bars
of
the
bedstead
keeping
himself
deliberately
uncomfortable
determined
not
to
fall
into
a
doze
terrified
that
he
might
become
the
serpent
again
in
his
sleep
and
wake
to
find
that
he
had
attacked
Ron
or
else
slithered
through
the
house
after
one
of
the
others
when
Ron
woke
up
Harry
pretended
to
have
enjoyed
a
refreshing
nap
too
their
trunks
arrived
from
Hogwarts
while
they
were
eating
lunch
so
they
could
dress
as
Muggles
for
the
trip
to
St
mungos
everybody
except
Harry
was
riotously
happy
and
talkative
as
they
changed
out
of
their
robes
into
jeans
and
sweatshirts
when
Tonks
and
Mad-Eye
turned
up
to
escort
them
across
london
they
greeted
them
gleefully
laughing
at
the
bowler
hat
Mad-Eye
was
wearing
at
an
angle
to
conceal
his
magical
eye
and
assuring
him
truthfully
that
Tonks
whose
hair
was
short
and
bright
pink
again
would
attract
far
less
attention
on
the
Underground
tonks
was
very
interested
in
Harrys
vision
of
the
attack
on
mr.
Weasley
something
Harry
was
not
remotely
interested
in
discussing
there
isnt
any
Seer
blood
in
your
family
is
there
she
enquired
curiously
as
they
sat
side
by
side
on
a
train
rattling
towards
the
heart
of
the
city
no
said
Harry
thinking
of
Professor
Trelawney
and
feeling
insulted
no
said
Tonks
musingly
no
I
suppose
its
not
really
prophecy
youre
doing
is
it
i
mean
youre
not
seeing
the
future
youre
seeing
the
present
its
odd
isnt
it
useful
though
harry
didnt
answer
fortunately
they
got
out
at
the
next
stop
a
station
in
the
very
heart
of
london
and
in
the
bustle
of
leaving
the
train
he
was
able
to
allow
Fred
and
George
to
get
between
himself
and
Tonks
who
was
leading
the
way
they
all
followed
her
up
the
escalator
moody
clunking
along
at
the
back
of
the
group
his
bowler
tilted
low
and
one
gnarled
hand
stuck
in
between
the
buttons
of
his
coat
clutching
his
wand
harry
thought
he
sensed
the
concealed
eye
staring
hard
at
him
trying
to
avoid
any
more
questions
about
his
dream
he
asked
Mad-Eye
where
st.
Mungos
was
hidden
not
far
from
here
grunted
Moody
as
they
stepped
out
into
the
wintry
air
on
a
broad
store-lined
street
packed
with
Christmas
shoppers
he
pushed
Harry
a
little
ahead
of
him
and
stumped
along
just
behind
Harry
knew
the
eye
was
rolling
in
all
directions
under
the
tilted
hat
wasnt
easy
to
find
a
good
location
for
a
hospital
nowhere
in
Diagon
Alley
was
big
enough
and
we
couldnt
have
it
underground
like
the
Ministry
wouldnt
be
healthy
in
the
end
they
managed
to
get
hold
of
a
building
up
here
theory
was
sick
wizards
could
come
and
go
and
just
blend
in
with
the
crowd
he
seized
Harrys
shoulder
to
prevent
them
being
separated
by
a
gaggle
of
shoppers
plainly
intent
on
nothing
but
making
it
into
a
nearby
shop
full
of
electrical
gadgets
here
we
go
said
Moody
a
moment
later
they
had
arrived
outside
a
large
old-fashioned
red-brick
department
store
called
Purge
dowse
Ltd
the
place
had
a
shabby
miserable
air
the
window
displays
consisted
of
a
few
chipped
dummies
with
their
wigs
askew
standing
at
random
and
modelling
fashions
at
least
ten
years
out
of
date
large
signs
on
all
the
dusty
doors
read
Closed
for
Refurbishment
harry
distinctly
heard
a
large
woman
laden
with
plastic
shopping
bags
say
to
her
friend
as
they
passed
itsnever
open
that
place
right
said
Tonks
beckoning
them
towards
a
window
displaying
nothing
but
a
particularly
ugly
female
dummy
its
false
eyelashes
were
hanging
off
and
it
was
modelling
a
green
nylon
pinafore
dress
everybody
ready
they
nodded
clustering
around
her
moody
gave
Harry
another
shove
between
the
shoulder
blades
to
urge
him
forward
and
Tonks
leaned
close
to
the
glass
looking
up
at
the
very
ugly
dummy
her
breath
steaming
up
the
glass
wotcher
were
here
to
see
Arthur
weasley
harry
thought
how
absurd
it
was
for
Tonks
to
expect
the
dummy
to
hear
her
talking
so
quietly
through
a
sheet
of
glass
with
buses
rumbling
along
behind
her
and
all
the
racket
of
a
street
full
of
shoppers
then
he
reminded
himself
that
dummies
couldnt
hear
anyway
next
second
his
mouth
opened
in
shock
as
the
dummy
gave
a
tiny
nod
and
beckoned
with
its
jointed
finger
and
tonks
had
seized
Ginny
and
Mrs
weasley
by
the
elbows
stepped
right
through
the
glass
and
vanished
fred
George
and
Ron
stepped
after
them
harry
glanced
around
at
the
jostling
crowd
not
one
of
them
seemed
to
have
a
glance
to
spare
for
window
displays
as
ugly
as
those
of
Purge
Dowse
ltd
nor
did
any
of
them
seem
to
have
noticed
that
six
people
had
just
melted
into
thin
air
in
front
of
them
cmon
growled
Moody
giving
Harry
yet
another
poke
in
the
back
and
together
they
stepped
forward
through
what
felt
like
a
sheet
of
cool
water
emerging
quite
warm
and
dry
on
the
other
side
there
was
no
sign
of
the
ugly
dummy
or
the
space
where
she
had
stood
they
were
in
what
seemed
to
be
a
crowded
reception
area
where
rows
of
witches
and
wizards
sat
upon
rickety
wooden
chairs
some
looking
perfectly
normal
and
perusing
out-of-date
copies
of
WitchWeekly
others
sporting
gruesome
disfigurements
such
as
elephant
trunks
or
extra
hands
sticking
out
of
their
chests
the
room
was
scarcely
less
quiet
than
the
street
outside
for
many
of
the
patients
were
making
very
peculiar
noises
a
sweaty-faced
witch
in
the
center
of
the
front
row
who
was
fanning
herself
vigorously
with
a
copy
of
the
Daily
Prophet
kept
letting
off
a
high-pitched
whistle
as
steam
came
pouring
out
of
her
mouth
a
grubby-looking
warlock
in
the
corner
clanged
like
a
bell
every
time
he
moved
and
with
each
clang
his
head
vibrated
horribly
so
that
he
had
to
seize
himself
by
the
ears
to
hold
it
steady
witches
and
wizards
in
lime-green
robes
were
walking
up
and
down
the
rows
asking
questions
and
making
notes
on
clipboards
like
Umbridges
harry
noticed
the
emblem
embroidered
on
their
chests
a
wand
and
bone
crossed
are
they
doctors
he
asked
Ron
quietly
doctors
said
Ron
looking
startled
those
Muggle
nutters
that
cut
people
up
nah
theyre
healers
over
here
called
Mrs
weasley
above
the
renewed
c
langing
of
the
warlock
in
the
corner
and
they
followed
her
to
the
queue
in
front
of
a
plump
blonde
witch
seated
at
a
desk
marked
Enquiries
the
wall
behind
her
was
covered
in
notices
and
posters
saying
things
like
A
clean
cauldron
keeps
potions
from
becoming
poisons
and
antidotes
are
anti-donts
unless
approved
by
A
qualified
healer
there
was
also
a
large
portrait
of
a
witch
with
long
silver
ringlets
which
was
labelled
dilys
Derwent
st.
Mungos
Healer
headmistress
of
Hogwarts
School
of
Witchcraft
and
Wizardry
dilys
was
eyeing
the
Weasley
party
closely
as
though
counting
them
when
Harry
caught
her
eye
she
gave
a
tiny
wink
walked
sideways
out
of
her
portrait
and
vanished
meanwhile
at
the
front
of
the
queue
a
young
wizard
was
performing
an
odd
on-the-spot
jig
and
trying
in
between
yelps
of
pain
to
explain
his
predicament
to
the
witch
behind
the
desk
its
these
ouch
shoes
my
brother
gave
me
ow
theyre
eating
my
ouch

look
at
them
there
must
be
some

of
aargh
jinx
on
them
and
I
cant
aaaaargh

he
hopped
from
one
foot
to
the
other
as
though
dancing
on
hot
coals
the
shoes
dont
prevent
you
reading
do
they
said
the
blonde
witch
irritably
pointing
at
a

sign
to
the
left
of
her
desk

next
as
the

hobbled
and
pranced

out

the

the

dismissively

a

next
a
harassed-looking
wizard
was
holding
his
small
daughter
tightly
by
the
ankle
while
she
flapped
around
his
head
using
the
immensely
large
feathery
wings
that
had
sprouted
right
out
through
the
back
of
her
romper
suit
fourth

said
the
witch
in
a
bored
voice
without
asking
and
the
man
disappeared
through
the
double
doors
beside
the
desk
holding
his
daughter
like
an
oddly
shaped
balloon
next
mrs
weasley
moved
forward
to
the
desk
hello
she
said
my
husband
Arthur
Weasley
was
supposed
to
be
moved
to
a
different
ward
this
morning
could
you
tell
us
arthur
Weasley
said
the
witch
running
her
finger
down
a
long
list
in

of
her
yes
first
floor
second
door
on
the
right
Dai
Llewellyn
Ward
thank
you
said
Mrs
weasley
come
on
you
lot
they
followed
her
through
the
double
doors
and
along
the
narrow
corridor
beyond
which
was
lined
with
more
portraits
of
famous
Healers
and
lit
by
crystal
bubbles
full
of
candles
that
floated
up
on
the
ceiling
looking
like
giant
soapsuds
more
witches
and
wizards
in
lime-green
robes
walked
in
and
out
of
the
doors
they
passed
a
foul-smelling
yellow
gas
wafted
into
the
passageway
as
they
passed
one
door
and
every
now
and
then
they
heard
distant
wailing
they
climbed
a
flight
of
stairs
and
entered
the
Creature-Induced
Injuries
corridor
where
the
second
door
on
the
right
bore
the
words
Dangerous
Dai
Llewellyn
Ward
Serious
Bites
underneath
this
was
a
card
in
a
brass
holder
on
which
had
been
handwrittenHealer-in-Charge

Pye
well
wait
outside
Molly
Tonks
said
arthur
wont
want
too
many
visitors
at
once
it
ought
to
be
just
the
family
first
mad-Eye
growled
his
approval
of
this
idea
and
set
himself
with
his
back
against
the
corridor
wall
his
magical
eye
spinning
in
all
directions
harry
drew
back
too
but
Mrs
weasley
reached
out
a
hand
and
pushed
him
through
the
door
saying
Dont
be
silly
Harry
Arthur
wants
to
thank
you
the
ward
was
small
and
rather
dingy
as
the
only
window
was
narrow
and
set
high
in
the
wall
facing
the
door
most
of
the
light
came
from
more
shining
crystal
bubbles
clustered
in
the
middle
of
the
ceiling
the
walls
were
of
panelled
oak
and
there
was
a
portrait
of
a
rather
vicious-looking
wizard
on
the
wall
captioned
Urquhart
Rackharrow
Inventor
of
the
entrail-expelling
Curse
there
were
only
three
patients
mr.
Weasley
was
occupying
the
bed
at
the
far
end
of
the
ward
beside
the
tiny
window
harry
was
pleased
and
relieved
to
see
that
he
was
propped
up
on
several
pillows
and
reading
the
Daily
Prophet
by
the
solitary
ray
of
sunlight
falling
on
to
his
bed
he
looked
up
as
they
walked
towards
him
and
seeing
who
it
was
beamed
hello
he
called
throwing
the
Prophet
aside
bill
just
left
Molly
had
to
get
back
to
work
but
he
says
hell
drop
in
on
you
later
how
are
you
Arthur
asked
Mrs
weasley
bending
down
to
kiss
his
cheek
and
looking
anxiously
into
his
face
youre
still
looking
a
bit
peaky
i
feel
absolutely
fine
said
mr.
Weasley
brightly
holding
out
his
good
arm
to
give
Ginny
a
hug
if
they
could
only
take
the
bandages
off
Id
be
f
it
to
go
home
why
cant
they
take
them
off
Dad
asked
Fred
well
I
start
bleeding
like
mad
every
time
they
try
said
mr.
Weasley
cheerfully
reaching
across
for
his
wand
which
lay
on
his
bedside
cabinet
and
waving
it
so
that
six
extra
chairs
appeared
at
his
bedside
to
seat
them
all
it
seems
there
was
some
rather
unusual
kind
of
poison
in
that
snakes
fangs
that
keeps
wounds
open
theyre
sure
theyll
find
an
antidote
though
they
say
theyve
had
much
worse
cases
than
mine
and
in
the
meantime
I
just
have
to
keep
taking
a
blood-Replenishing
Potion
every
hour
but
that
fellow
over
there
he
said
dropping
his
voice
and
nodding
towards
the
bed
opposite
in
which
a
man
lay
looking
green
and
sickly
and
staring
at
the
ceiling
bitten
by
a
werewolf
poor
chap
no
cure
at
all
a
werewolf
whispered
Mrs
weasley
looking
alarmed
is
he
safe
in
a
public
ward
shouldnt
he
be
in
a
private
room
its
two
weeks
till
full
moon
mr.
Weasley
reminded
her
quietly
theyve
been
talking
to
him
this
morning
the
Healers
you
know
trying
to
persuade
him
hell
be
able
to
lead
an
almost
normal
life
i
said
to
him
didnt
mention
names
of
course
but
I
said
I
knew
a
werewolf
personally
very
nice
man
who
finds
the
condition
quite
easy
to
manage
what
did
he
say
asked
George
said
hed
give
me
another
bite
if
I
didnt
shut
up
said
mr.
Weasley
sadly
and
that
woman
over
there
he
indicated
the
only
other
occupied
bed
which
was
right
beside
the
door
wont
tell
the
Healers
what
bit
her
which
makes
us
all
think
it
must
have
been
something
she
was
handling
illegally
whatever
it
was
took
a
real
chunk
out
of
her
legvery
nasty
smell
when
they
take
off
the
dressings
so
you
going
to
tell
us
what
happened
Dad
asked
Fred
pulling
his
chair
closer
to
the
bed
well
you
already
know
dont
you
said
mr.
Weasley
with
a
significant
smile
at
Harry
its
very
simple
Id
had
a
very
long
day
dozed
off
got
sneaked
up
on
and
bitten
is
it
in
the
Prophet
you
being
attacked
asked
Fred
indicating
the
newspaper
mr.
Weasley
had
cast
aside
no
of
course
not
said
mr.
Weasley
with
a
slightly
bitter
smile
the
Ministry
wouldnt
want
everyone
to
know
a
dirty
great
serpent
got
arthur
mrs
weasley
warned
him
got
er
me
mr.
Weasley
said
hastily
though
Harry
was
quite
sure
that
was
not
what
he
had
meant
to
say
so
where
were
you
when
it
happened
Dad
asked
George
thats
my
business
said
mr.
Weasley
though
with
a
small
smile
he
snatched
up
the
Daily
prophe
shook
it
open
again
and
said
I
was
just
reading
about
Willy
Widdershinss
arrest
when
you
arrived
you
know
Willy
turned
out
to
be
behind
those
regurgitating
toilets
back
in
the
summer
one
of
his
jinxes
backfired
the
toilet
exploded
and
they
found
him
lying
unconscious
in
the
wreckage
covered
from
head
to
foot
in
when
you
say
you
were
on
duty
Fred
interrupted
in
a
low
voice
what
were
you
doing
you
heard
your
father
whispered
Mrs
weasley
we
are
not
discussing
this
here
go
on
about
willy
Widdershins
Arthur
well
dont
ask
me
how
but
he
actually
got
off
the
toilet
charge
said
mr.
Weasley
grimly
can
only
suppose
gold
changed
hands
you
were
guarding
it
werent
you
said
George
quietly
the
weapon
the
thing
You-Know
whos
after
george
be
quiet
snapped
Mrs
weasley
anyway
said
mr.
Weasley
in
a
raised
voice
this
time
Willys
been
caught
selling
biting
doorknobs
to
Muggles
and
I
dont
think
hell
be
able
to
worm
his
way
out
of
it
because
according
to
this
article
two
Muggles
have
lost
fingers
and
are
now
in
st.
Mungos
for
emergency
bone
re-growth
and
memory
modification
just
think
of
it
Muggles
in
st.
Mungos
wonder
which
ward
theyre
in
and
he
looked
eagerly
around
as
though
hoping
to
see
a
signpost
didnt
you
say
You-Know-Whos
got
a
snake
Harry
asked
Fred
looking
at
his
father
for
a
reaction
a
massive
one
you
saw
it
the
night
he
returned
didnt
you
thats
enough
said
Mrs
weasley
crossly
mad-Eye
and
Tonks
are
outside
Arthur
they
want
to
come
and
see
you
and
you
lot
can
wait
outside
she
added
to
her
children
and
Harry
you
can
come
and
say
goodbye
afterwards
go
on
they
trooped
back
into
the
corridor
mad-Eye
and
Tonks
went
in
and
closed
the
door
of
the
ward
behind
them
fred
raised
his
eyebrows
fine
he
said
coolly
rummaging
in
his
pockets
be
like
that
dont
tell
us
anything
looking
for
these
said
George
holding
out
what
looked
like
a
tangle
of
flesh-colored
string
you
read
my
mind
said
Fred
grinning
lets
see
if
st.
Mungos
puts
Imperturbable
Charms
on
its
ward
doors
shall
we
he
and
George
disentangled
the
string
and
separated
five
Extendable
Ears
from
each
other
fred
and
George
handed
them
around
harry
hesitated
to
take
one
go
on
Harry
take
it
you
saved
Dads
life
if
anyones
got
the
right
to
eavesdrop
on
him
its
you
grinning
in
spite
of
himself
Harry
took
the
end
of
the
string
and
inserted
it
into
his
ear
as
the
twins
had
done
okay
go
fred
whispered
the
flesh-colored
strings
wriggled
like
long
skinny
worms
and
snaked
under
the
door
at
first
harry
could
hear
nothing
then
he
jumped
as
he
heard
Tonks
whispering
as
clearly
as
though
she
were
standing
right
beside
him
they
searched
the
whole
area
but
couldnt
find
the
snake
anywhere
it
just
seems
to
have
vanished
after
it
attacked
you
Arthur
but
You-Know-Who
cant
have
expected
a
snake
to
get
in
can
he
i
reckon
he
sent
it
as
a
lookout
growled
Moody
cause
hes
not
had
any
luck
so
far
has
he
no
I
reckon
hes
trying
to
get
a
clearer
picture
of
what
hes
facing
and
if
Arthur
hadnt
been
there
the
beast
wouldve
had
a
lot
more
time
to
look
around
so
Potter
says
he
saw
it
all
happen
yes
said
Mrs
weasley
she
sounded
rather
uneasy
you
know
Dumbledore
seems
almost
to
have
been
waiting
for
Harry
to
see
something
like
this
yeah
well
said
Moody
theres
something
funny
about
the
Potter
kid
we
all
know
that
dumbledore
seemed
worried
about
Harry
when
I
spoke
to
him
this
morning
whispered
Mrs
weasley
course
hes
worried
growled
Moody
the
boys
seeing
things
from
inside
You-Know-Whos
snake
obviously
Potter
doesnt
realize
what
that
means
but
if
You-Know-Whos
possessing
him
harry
pulled
the
Extendable
Ear
out
of
his
own
his
heart
hammering
very
fast
and
heat
rushing
up
his
face
he
looked
around
at
the
others
they
were
all
staring
at
him
the
strings
still
trailing
from
their
ears
looking
suddenly
fearful
chapter
twenty-three
christmas
on
the
Closed
Ward
was
this
why
Dumbledore
would
no
longer
meet
Harrys
eyes
did
he
expect
to
see
Voldemort
staring
out
of
them
afraid
perhaps
that
their
vivid
green
might
turn
suddenly
to
scarlet
with
catlike
slits
for
pupils
harry
remembered
how
the
snakelike
face
of
Voldemort
had
once
forced
itself
out
of
the
back
of
Professor
Quirrells
head
and
ran
his
hand
over
the
back
of
his
own
wondering
what
it
would
feel
like
if
Voldemort
burst
out
of
his
skull
he
felt
dirty
contaminated
as
though
he
were
carrying
some
deadly
germ
unworthy
to
sit
on
the
underground
train
back
from
the
hospital
with
innocent
clean
people
whose
minds
and
bodies
were
free
of
the
taint
of
Voldemort
he
had
not
merely
seen
the
snake
he
hadbeen
the
snake
he
knew
it
now
a
truly
terrible
thought
then
occurred
to
him
a
memory
bobbing
to
the
surface
of
his
mind
one
that
made
his
insides
writhe
and
squirm
like
serpents
whats
he
after
apart
from
followers
stuff
he
can
only
get
by
stealth
like
a
weapon
something
he
didnt
have
last
time
im
the
weapon
Harry
thought
and
it
was
as
though
poison
were
pumping
through
his
veins
chilling
him
bringing
him
out
in
a
sweat
as
he
swayed
with
the
train
through
the
dark
tunnel
im
the
one
Voldemorts
trying
to
use
thats
why
theyve
got
guards
around
me
everywhere
I
go
its
not
for
my
protection
its
for
other
peoples
only
its
not
working
they
cant
have
someone
on
me
all
the
time
at
Hogwarts
i
did
attack
mr.
Weasley
last
night
it
was
me
voldemort
made
me
do
it
and
he
could
be
inside
me
listening
to
my
thoughts
right
now
are
you
all
right
Harry
dear
whispered
Mrs
wea
sley
leaning
across
Ginny
to
speak
to
him
as
the
train
rattled
along
through
its
dark
tunnel
you
dont
look
very
well
are
you
feeling
sick
they
were
all
watching
him
he
shook
his
head
violently
and
stared
up
at
an
advertisement
for
home
insurance
harry
dear
are
you
sure
youre
all
right
said
Mrs
weasley
in
a
worried
voice
as
they
walked
around
the
unkempt
patch
of
grass
in
the
middle
of
Grimmauld
Place
you
look
ever
so
pale
are
you
sure
you
slept
this
morning
you
go
upstairs
to
bed
right
now
and
you
can
have
a
couple
of
hours
of
sleep
before
dinner
all
right
he
nodded
here
was
a
ready-made
excuse
not
to
talk
to
any
of
the
others
which
was
precisely
what
he
wanted
so
when
she
opened
the
front
door
he
hurried
straight
past
the
trolls-leg
umbrella
stand
up
the
stairs
and
into
his
and
Rons
bedroom
here
he
began
to
pace
up
and
down
past
the
two
beds
and
Phineas
Nigelluss
empty
picture
frame
his
brain
teeming
and
seething
with
questions
and
ever
more
dreadful
ideas
how
had
he
become
a
snake
perhaps
he
was
an
Animagus
no
he
couldnt
be
he
would
know
perhapsVoldemort
was
an
Animagus
yes
thought
Harry
that
would
fit
he
would
turn
into
a
snake
of
course
and
when
hes
possessing
me
then
we
both
transform
that
still
doesnt
explain
how
I
got
to
London
and
back
to
my
bed
in
the
space
of
about
five
minutes
but
then
Voldemorts
about
the
most
powerful
wizard
in
the
world
apart
from
Dumbledore
its
probably
no
problem
at
all
to
him
to
transport
people
like
that
and
then
with
a
terrible
stab
of
panic
he
thoughtbut
this
is
insane
if
Voldemorts
possessing
me
Im
giving
him
a
clear
view
into
the
Headquarter
s
of
the
Order
of
the
Phoenix
right
now
hell
know
whos
in
the
Order
and
where
Sirius
is
and
Ive
heard
loads
of
stuff
I
shouldnt
have
everything
Sirius
told
me
the
first
night
I
was
here
there
was
only
one
thing
for
it
he
would
have
to
leave
Grimmauld
Place
straightaway
he
would
spend
Christmas
at
Hogwarts
without
the
others
which
would
keep
them
safe
over
the
holidays
at
least
but
no
that
wouldnt
do
there
were
still
plenty
of
people
at
Hogwarts
to
maim
and
injure
what
if
it
was
Seamus
Dean
or
Neville
next
time
he
stopped
his
pacing
and
stood
staring
at
Phineas
Nigelluss
empty
frame
a
leaden
sensation
was
settling
in
the
pit
of
his
stomach
he
had
no
alternative
he
was
going
to
have
to
return
to
Privet
Drive
cut
himself
off
from
other
wizards
entirely
well
if
he
had
to
do
it
he
thought
there
was
no
point
hanging
around
trying
with
all
his
might
not
to
think
how
the
Dursleys
were
going
to
react
when
they
found
him
on
their
doorstep
six
months
earlier
than
they
had
expected
he
strode
over
to
his
trunk
slammed
the
lid
shut
and
locked
it
then
glanced
around
automatically
for
Hedwig
before
remembering
that
she
was
still
at
hogwarts
well
her
cage
would
be
one
less
thing
to
carry
he
seized
one
end
of
his
trunk
and
had
dragged
it
halfway
towards
the
door
when
a
snide
voice
said
Running
away
are
we
he
looked
around
phineas
Nigellus
had
appeared
on
the
canvas
of
his
portrait
and
was
leaning
against
the
frame
watching
Harry
with
an
amused
expression
on
his
face
not
running
away
no
said
Harry
shortly
dragging
his
trunk
a
few
more
feet
across
the
room
i
thought
said
Phineas
Nigellus
stroking
his
pointed
beard
that
to
belong
in
Gryffindor
house
you
were
supposed
to
be
brave
it
looks
to
me
as
though
you
would
have
been
better
off
in
my
own
house
we
Slytherins
are
brave
yes
but
not
stupid
for
instance
given
the
choice
we
will
always
choose
to
save
our
own
necks
its
not
my
own
neck
Im
saving
said
Harry
tersely
tugging
the
trunk
over
a
patch
of
particularly
uneven
moth-eaten
carpet
right
in
front
of
the
door
oh
I
see
said
Phineas
Nigellus
still
stroking
his
beard
this
is
no
cowardly
flight
you
are
being
noble
harry
ignored
him
his
hand
was
on
the
doorknob
when
Phineas
Nigellus
said
lazily
I
have
a
message
for
you
from
Albus
Dumbledore
harry
span
round
what
is
it
stay
where
you
are
i
havent
moved
said
Harry
his
hand
still
upon
the
doorknob
so
whats
the
message
i
have
just
given
it
to
you
dolt
said
Phineas
Ni
gellus
smoothly
dumbledore
says
Stay
where
you
are
why
said
Harry
eagerly
dropping
the
end
of
his
trunk
why
does
he
want
me
to
stay
what
else
did
he
say
nothing
whatsoever
said
Phineas
Nigellus
raising
a
thin
black
eyebrow
as
though
he
found
harry
impertinent
harrys
temper
rose
to
the
surface
like
a
snake
rearing
from
long
grass
he
was
exhausted
he
was
confused
beyond
measure
he
had
experienced
terror
relief
then
terror
again
in
the
last
twelve
hours
and
still
Dumbledore
did
not
want
to
talk
to
him
so
thats
it
is
it
he
said
loudly
stay
where
you
a
re
thats
all
anyone
could
tell
me
after
I
got
attacked
by
those
Dementors
too
just
stay
put
while
the
grown-ups
sort
it
out
Harry
we
wont
bother
telling
you
anything
though
because
your
tiny
little
brain
might
not
be
able
to
cope
with
it
you
know
said
Phineas
Nigellus
even
more
loudly
than
Harry
this
is
precisely
why
I
loathed
being
a
teacher
young
people
are
so
infernally
convinced
that
they
are
absolutely
right
about
everything
has
it
not
occurred
to
you
my
poor
puffed-up
popinjay
that
there
might
be
an
excellent
reason
why
the
Headmaster
of
Hogwarts
is
not
confiding
every
tiny
detail
of
his
plans
to
you
have
you
never
paused
while
feeling
hard-done-by
to
note
that
following
Dumbledores
orders
has
never
yet
led
you
into
harm
no.
No
like
all
young
people
you
are
quite
sure
that
you
alone
feel
and
think
you
alone
recognize
danger
you
alone
are
the
only
one
clever
enough
to
realize
what
the
Dark
Lord
may
be
planning
he
is
planning
something
to
do
with
me
then
said
Harry
swiftly
did
I
say
that
said
Phineas
Nigellus
idly
examining
his
silk
gloves
now
if
you
will
excuse
me
I
have
better
things
to
do
than
listen
to
adolescent
agonising
good-day
to
you
and
he
strolled
to
the
edge
of
his
frame
and
out
of
sight
fine
go
then
harry
bellowed
at
the
empty
frame
and
tell
Dumbledore
thanks
for
nothing
the
empty
canvas
remained
silent
fuming
Harry
dragged
his
trunk
back
to
the
foot
of
his
bed
then
threw
himself
face
down
on
the
moth-eaten
covers
his
eyes
shut
his
body
heavy
and
aching
he
felt
as
though
he
had
journeyed
for
miles
and
miles
it
seemed
impossible
that
less
than
twenty-four
hours
ago
Cho
Chang
had
been
approaching
him
under
the
mistletoe
he
was
so
tired
he
was
scared
to
sleep
yet
he
did
not
know
how
long
he
could
fight
it
dumbledore
had
told
him
to
stay
that
must
mean
he
was
allowed
to
sleep
but
he
was
scared
what
if
it
happened
again
he
was
sinking
into
shadows
it
was
as
though
a
film
in
his
head
had
been
waiting
to
start
he
was
walking
down
a
deserted
corridor
towards
a
plain
black
door
past
rough
stone
walls
torches
and
an
open
doorway
on
to
a
flight
of
stone
steps
leading
downstairs
on
the
left
he
reached
the
black
door
but
could
not
open
it
he
stood
gazing
at
it
desperate
for
entry
something
he
wanted
with
all
his
heart
lay
beyond
a
prize
beyond
his
dreams
if
only
his
scar
would
stop
prickling
then
he
would
be
able
to
think
more
clearly
harry
said
Rons
voice
from
far
far
away
Mum
says
dinners
ready
but
shell
save
you
something
if
you
want
to
stay
in
bed
harry
opened
his
eyes
but
Ron
had
already
left
the
room
he
doesnt
want
to
be
on
his
own
with
me
Harry
thought
not
after
what
he
heard
Moody
say
he
supposed
none
of
them
would
want
him
there
any
more
now
that
they
knew
what
was
inside
him
he
would
not
go
down
to
dinner
he
would
not
inflict
his
company
on
them
he
turned
over
on
to
his
other
side
and
after
a
while
dropped
back
off
to
sleep
he
woke
much
later
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
his
insides
aching
with
hunger
and
Ron
snoring
in
the
next
bed
squinting
around
the
room
he
saw
the
dark
outline
of
Phineas
Nigellus
standing
again
in
his
portrait
and
it
occurred
to
Harry
that
Dumbledore
had
probably
sent
Phineas
Nigellus
to
watch
over
him
in
case
he
attacked
somebody
else
the
feeling
of
being
unclean
intensified
he
half-wished
he
had
not
obeyed
Dumbledore
if
this
was
how
life
was
going
to
be
for
him
in
Grimmauld
Place
from
now
on
maybe
he
would
be
better
off
in
Privet
Drive
after
all
everybody
else
spent
the
following
morning
putting
up
Christmas
decorations
harry
could
not
remember
Sirius
ever
being
in
such
a
good
mood
he
was
actually
singing
carols
apparently
delighted
that
he
was
to
have
company
over
Christmas
harry
could
hear
his
voice
echoing
up
through
the
floor
in
the
cold
drawing
room
where
he
was
sitting
alone
watching
the
sky
growing
whiter
outside
the
windows
threatening
snow
all
the
time
feeling
a
savage
pleasure
that
he
was
giving
the
others
the
opportunity
to
keep
talking
about
him
as
they
were
bound
to
be
doing
when
he
heard
Mrs
weasley
calling
his
name
softly
u
p
the
stairs
around
lunchtime
he
retreated
further
upstairs
and
ignored
her
around
six
oclock
in
the
evening
the
doorbell
rang
and
Mrs
black
started
screaming
again
assuming
that
Mundungus
or
some
other
Order
member
had
come
to
call
Harry
merely
settled
himself
more
comfortably
against
the
wall
of
Buckbeaks
room
where
he
was
hiding
trying
to
ignore
how
hungry
he
felt
as
he
fed
dead
rats
to
the
Hippogriff
it
came
as
a
slight
shock
when
somebody
hammered
hard
on
the
door
a
few
minutes
later
i
know
youre
in
there
said
Hermiones
voice
will
you
please
come
out
i
want
to
talk
to
you
what
are
you
doing
here
harry
asked
her
pulling
open
the
door
as
Buckbeak
resumed
his
scratching
at
the
straw-strewn
floor
for
any
fragments
of
rat
he
may
have
dropped
i
thought
you
were
skiing
with
your
mum
and
dad
well
to
tell
the
truth
skiings
not
really
my
thing
said
Hermione
so
Ive
come
here
for
christmas
there
was
snow
in
her
hair
and
her
face
was
pink
with
cold
but
dont
tell
Ron
told
him
its
really
good
because
he
kept
laughing
so
much
mum
and
Dad
are
a
bit
disappointed
but
Ive
told
them
that
everyone
who
is
serious
about
the
exams
is
staying
at
hogwarts
to
study
they
want
me
to
do
well
theyll
understand
anyway
she
said
briskly
lets
go
to
your
bedroom
Rons
mum
has
lit
a
fire
in
there
and
shes
sent
up
sandwiches
harry
followed
her
back
to
the
second
floor
when
he
entered
the
bedroom
he
was
rather
surprised
to
see
both
Ron
and
Ginny
waiting
for
them
sitting
on
Rons
bed
i
came
on
the
Knight
Bus
said
Hermione
airily
pulling
off
her
jacket
before
Harry
had
time
to
speak
dumbledore
told
me
what
had
happened
first
thing
this
morning
but
I
had
to
wait
for
term
to
end
officially
before
setting
off
umbridge
is
already
livid
that
you
lot
disappeared
right
under
her
nose
even
though
Dumbledore
told
her
mr.
Weasley
was
in
st.
Mungos
and
hed
given
you
all
permission
to
visit
so
she
sat
down
next
to
Ginny
and
the
two
girls
and
Ron
all
looked
up
at
Harry
howre
you
feeling
asked
Hermione
fine
said
Harry
stiffly
oh
dont
lie
Harry
she
said
impatiently
ron
and
Ginny
say
youve
been
hiding
from
everyone
since
you
got
back
from
st.
Mungos
they
do
do
they
said
Harry
glaring
at
Ron
and
Ginny
ron
looked
down
at
his
feet
but
ginny
seemed
quite
unabashed
well
you
have
she
said
and
you
wont
look
at
any
of
us
its
you
lot
who
wont
look
at
me
said
Harry
ang
rily
maybe
youre
taking
it
in
turns
to
look
and
keep
missing
each
other
suggested
Hermione
the
corners
of
her
mouth
twitching
very
funny
snapped
Harry
turning
away
oh
stop
feeling
all
misunderstood
said
Hermione
sharply
look
the
others
have
told
me
what
you
overheard
last
night
on
the
Extendable
Ears
yeah
growled
Harry
his
hands
deep
in
his
pockets
as
he
watched
the
snow
now
falling
thickly
outside
all
been
talking
about
me
have
you
well
Im
getting
used
to
it
we
wanted
to
talk
to
you
Harry
said
Ginny
but
as
youve
been
hiding
ever
since
we
got
back
i
didnt
want
anyone
to
talk
to
me
said
Harry
w
ho
was
feeling
more
and
more
nettled
well
that
was
a
bit
stupid
of
you
said
Ginny
angrily
seeing
as
you
dont
know
anyone
but
me
whos
been
possessed
by
You-Know-Who
and
I
can
tell
you
how
it
feels
harry
remained
quite
still
as
the
impact
of
these
words
hit
him
then
he
wheeled
round
i
forgot
he
said
lucky
you
said
Ginny
coolly
im
sorry
Harry
said
and
he
meant
it
so
so
do
you
think
Im
being
possessed
then
well
can
you
remember
everything
youve
been
doing
ginny
asked
are
there
big
blank
periods
where
you
dont
know
what
youve
been
up
to
harry
racked
his
brains
no
he
said
then
You-Know-Who
hasnt
ever
possessed
you
said
Ginny
simply
when
he
did
it
to
me
I
couldnt
remember
what
Id
been
doing
for
hours
at
a
time
id
find
myself
somewhere
and
not
know
how
I
got
there
harry
hardly
dared
believe
her
yet
his
heart
was
lightening
almost
in
spite
of
himself
that
dream
I
had
about
your
dad
and
the
snake
though
harry
youve
had
these
dreams
before
Hermione
said
you
had
flashes
of
what
Voldemort
was
up
to
last
year
this
was
different
said
Harry
shaking
his
head
i
was
inside
that
snake
it
was
like
I
was
the
snake
what
if
Voldemort
somehow
transported
me
to
London
one
day
said
Hermione
sounding
thoroughly
exasperated
youll
read
Hogwarts
A
History
and
perhaps
it
will
remind
you
that
you
cant
Apparate
or
Disapparate
inside
Hogwarts
even
voldemort
couldnt
just
make
you
fly
out
of
your
dormitory
Harry
you
didnt
leave
your
bed
mate
said
Ron
i
saw
you
thrashing
around
in
your
sleep
for
at
least
a
minute
before
we
could
wake
you
up
harry
started
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
again
thinking
what
they
were
all
saying
was
not
only
comforting
it
made
sense
without
really
thinking
he
took
a
sandwich
from
the
plate
on
the
bed
and
crammed
it
hungrily
into
his
mouth
im
not
the
weapon
after
all
thought
Harry
his
heart
swelled
with
happiness
and
relief
and
he
felt
like
joining
in
as
they
heard
Sirius
tramping
past
their
door
towards
Buckbeaks
room
singing
God
Rest
Ye
Merry
Hippogriffs
at
the
top
of
his
voice
how
could
he
have
dreamed
of
returning
to
Privet
Drive
for
Christmas
siriuss
delight
at
having
the
house
full
again
and
especially
at
having
Harry
back
was
infectious
he
was
no
longer
their
sullen
host
of
the
summer
now
he
seemed
determined
that
everyone
should
enjoy
themselves
as
much
if
not
more
than
they
would
have
done
at
Hogwarts
and
he
worked
tirelessly
in
the
run-up
to
Christmas
Day
cleaning
and
decorating
with
their
help
so
that
by
the
time
they
all
went
to
bed
on
Christmas
Eve
the
house
was
barely
recognisable
the
tarnished
chandeliers
were
no
longer
hung
with
cobwebs
but
with
garlands
of
holly
and
gold
and
silver
streamers
magical
snow
glittered
in
heaps
over
the
threadbare
carpets
a
great
Christmas
tree
obtained
by
Mundungus
and
decorated
with
live
fairies
blocked
Siriuss
family
tree
from
view
and
even
the
stuffed
elf-heads
on
the
hall
wall
wore
Father
Christmas
hats
and
beards
harry
awoke
on
Christmas
morning
to
find
a
stack
of
presents
at
the
foot
of
his
bed
and
Ron
already
halfway
through
opening
his
own
rather
larger
pile
good
haul
this
year
he
informed
Harry
through
a
cloud
of
paper
thanks
for
the
Broom
compass
its
excellent
beats
Hermiones
she
got
me
a
homework
planner
harry
sorted
through
his
presents
and
found
one
with
Hermiones
handwriting
on
it
she
had
given
him
too
a
book
that
resembled
a
diary
except
that
it
said
things
like
Do
it
today
or
later
you'll
pay
every
time
he
opend
a
page
sirius
and
Lupin
had
given
Harry
a
set
of
excellent
books
entitled
Practical
Defensive
Magic
and
its
Use
Against
the
Dark
Arts
which
had
superb
moving
color
illustrations
of
all
the
counterjinxes
and
hexes
it
described
harry
flicked
through
the
first
volume
eagerly
he
could
see
it
was
going
to
be
highly
useful
in
his
plans
for
the
D
hagrid
had
sent
a
furry
brown
wallet
that
had
fangs
which
were
presumably
supposed
to
be
an
anti-theft
device
but
unfortunately
prevented
Harry
putting
any
money
in
without
getting
his
fingers
ripped
off
tonkss
present
was
a
small
working
model
of
a
Firebolt
which
Harry
watched
fly
around
the
room
wishing
he
still
had
his
full-size
version
Ron
had
given
him
an
enormous
box
of
Every-Flavour
Beans
mr.
and
Mrs
weasley
the
usual
hand-knitted
jumper
and
some
mince
pies
and
Dobby
a
truly
dreadful
painting
that
Harry
suspected
had
been
done
by
the
elf
himself
he
had
just
turned
it
upsidedown
to
see
whether
it
looked
better
that
way
when
with
a
loudcrack
Fred
and
George
apparated
at
the
foot
of
his
bed
merry
Christmas
said
George
dont
go
downstairs
for
a
bit
why
not
said
Ron
mums
crying
again
said
Fred
heavily
percy
sent
back
his
Christmas
jumper
without
a
note
added
George
hasnt
asked
how
Dad
is
or
visited
him
or
anything
we
tried
to
comfort
her
said
Fred
moving
around
the
bed
to
look
at
Harrys
portrait
told
her
Percys
nothing
more
than
a
humungous
pile
of
rat
droppings
didnt
work
said
George
helping
himself
to
a
Chocolate
Frog
so
Lupin
took
over
best
let
him
cheer
her
up
before
we
go
down
for
breakfast
I
reckon
whats
that
supposed
to
be
anyway
asked
Fred
squinting
at
Dobbys
painting
looks
like
a
gibbon
with
two
black
eyes
its
Harry
said
George
pointing
at
the
back
of
the
picture
says
so
on
the
back
good
likeness
said
Fred
grinning
harry
threw
his
new
homework
diary
at
him
it
hit
the
wall
opposite
and
fell
to
the
floor
where
it
said
happily
If
youve
dotted
the
is
and
crossed
the
ts
then
you
may
do
whatever
you
please
they
got
up
and
dressed
they
could
hear
the
various
inhabitants
of
the
house
calling
Merry
christmas
to
one
another
on
their
way
downstairs
they
met
Hermione
thanks
for
the
book
Harry
she
said
happily
ive
been
wanting
that
New
Theory
of
numerology
for
ages
and
that
perfumes
really
unusual
Ron
no
problem
said
Ron
whos
that
for
anyway
he
added
nodding
at
the
neatly
wrapped
present
she
was
carrying
kreacher
said
Hermione
brightly
it
had
better
not
be
clothes
ron
warned
her
you
know
what
Sirius
said
Kreacher
knows
too
much
we
cant
set
him
free
it
isnt
clothes
said
Hermione
although
if
I
had
my
way
Id
certainly
give
him
something
to
wear
other
than
that
filthy
old
rag
no
its
a
patchwork
quilt
I
thought
it
would
brighten
up
his
bedroom
what
bedroom
said
Harry
dropping
his
voice
to
a
whisper
as
they
were
passing
the
portrait
of
Siriuss
mother
well
Sirius
says
its
not
so
much
a
bedroom
more
a
kind
of
den
said
Hermione
apparently
he
sleeps
under
the
boiler
in
that
cupboard
off
the
kitchen
mrs
weasley
was
the
only
person
in
the
basement
when
they
arrived
there
she
was
standing
at
the
stove
and
sounded
as
though
she
had
a
bad
head
cold
as
she
wished
them
Merry
Christmas
and
they
all
averted
their
eyes
so
is
this
Kreachers
bedroom
said
Ron
strolling
over
to
a
dingy
door
in
the
corner
opposite
the
pantry
harry
had
never
seen
it
open
yes
said
Hermione
now
sounding
a
little
nervous
er
i
think
wed
better
knock
ron
rapped
on
the
door
with
his
knuckles
but
there
was
no
reply
he
must
be
sneaking
around
upstairs
he
said
and
without
further
ado
pulled
open
the
door
urgh
harry
peered
inside
most
of
the
cupboard
was
taken
up
with
a
very
large
and
old-fashioned
boiler
but
in
the
foots
space
underneath
the
pipes
Kreacher
had
made
himself
something
that
looked
like
a
nest
a
jumble
of
assorted
rags
and
smelly
old
blankets
were
piled
on
the
floor
and
the
small
dent
in
the
middle
of
it
showed
where
Kreacher
curled
up
to
sleep
every
night
here
and
there
among
the
material
were
stale
bread
crusts
and
mouldy
old
bits
of
cheese
in
a
far
corner
glinted
small
objects
and
coins
that
Harry
guessed
Kreacher
had
saved
magpie-like
from
siriuss
purge
of
the
house
and
he
had
also
managed
to
retrieve
the
silver-framed
family
photographs
that
Sirius
had
thrown
away
over
the
summer
their
glass
might
be
shattered
but
still
the
little
black-and-white
people
inside
them
peered
up
at
him
haughtily
including
he
felt
a
little
jolt
in
his
stomach
the
dark
heavy-lidded
woman
whose
trial
he
had
witnessed
in
dumbledores
Pensieve
Bellatrix
Lestrange
by
the
looks
of
it
hers
was
Kreachers
favorite
photograph
he
had
placed
it
to
the
fore
of
all
the
others
and
had
mended
the
glass
clumsily
with
spellotape
i
think
Ill
just
leave
his
present
here
said
Hermione
laying
the
package
neatly
in
the
middle
of
the
depression
in
the
rags
and
blankets
and
closing
the
door
quietly
hell
find
it
later
thatll
be
fine
come
to
think
of
it
said
Sirius
emerging
from
the
pantry
carrying
a
large
turkey
as
they
closed
the
cupboard
door
has
anyone
actually
seen
Kreacher
lately
i
havent
seen
him
since
the
night
we
came
back
here
said
Harry
you
were
ordering
him
out
of
the
kitchen
yeah
said
Sirius
frowning
you
know
I
think
thats
the
last
time
I
saw
him
too
he
must
be
hiding
upstairs
somewhere
he
couldnt
have
left
could
he
said
Harry
i
mean
when
you
said
out
maybe
he
thought
you
meant
get
out
of
the
house
no
no
house-elves
cant
leave
unless
theyre
given
clothes
theyre
tied
to
their
familys
house
said
Sirius
they
can
leave
the
house
if
they
really
want
to
Harry
contradicted
him
dobby
did
he
left
the
Malfoys
to
give
me
warnings
two
years
ago
he
had
to
punish
himself
afterwards
but
he
still
managed
it
sirius
looked
slightly
disconcerted
for
a
moment
then
said
Ill
look
for
him
later
I
expect
Ill
find
him
upstairs
crying
his
eyes
out
over
my
mothers
old
bloomers
or
something
of
course
he
might
have
crawled
into
the
airing
cupboard
and
died
but
I
mustnt
get
my
hopes
up
fred
George
and
Ron
laughed
Hermione
however
looked
reproachful
once
they
had
eaten
their
Christmas
lunch
the
Weasleys
Harry
and
Hermione
were
planning
to
pay
mr.
Weasley
another
visit
escorted
by
Mad-Eye
and
Lupin
mundungus
turned
up
in
time
for
Christmas
pudding
and
trifle
having
managed
to
borrow
a
car
for
the
occasion
as
the
underground
did
not
run
on
Christmas
Day
the
car
which
Harry
doubted
very
much
had
been
taken
with
the
knowledge
or
consent
of
it's
owner
had
had
a
similar
Enlarging
Spell
put
upon
it
as
the
weasley's
old
Ford
Anglia
although
normally
proportioned
outside
ten
people
with
Mundungus
driving
were
able
to
fit
into
it
quite
comfortably
mrs
weasley
hesitated
before
getting
inside
Harry
knew
her
disapproval
of
Mundungus
was
battling
with
her
dislike
of
traveling
without
magic
but
finally
the
cold
outside
and
her
childrens
pleading
triumphed
and
she
settled
herself
into
the
back
seat
between
Fred
and
Bill
with
good
grace
the
journey
to
st.
Mungos
was
quite
quick
as
there
was
very
little
traffic
on
the
roads
a
small
trickle
of
witches
and
wizards
was
creeping
furtively
up
the
otherwise
deserted
street
to
visit
the
hospital
harry
and
the
others
got
out
of
the
car
and
Mundungus
drove
off
around
the
corner
to
wait
for
them
they
strolled
casually
towards
the
window
where
the
dummy
in
green
nylon
stood
then
one
by
one
stepped
through
the
glass
the
reception
area
looked
pleasantly
festive
the
crystal
orbs
that
illuminated
st.
Mungos
had
been
colored
red
and
gold
to
become
gigantic
glowing
Christmas
baubles
holly
hung
around
every
doorway
and
shining
white
Christmas
trees
covered
in
magical
snow
and
icicles
glittered
in
every
corner
each
one
topped
with
a
gleaming
gold
star
it
was
less
crowded
than
the
last
time
they
had
been
there
although
halfway
across
the
room
Harry
found
himself
shunted
aside
by
a
witch
with
a
walnut
jammed
up
her
left
nostril
family
argument
eh
smirked
the
blonde
witch
behind
the
desk
youre
the
third
Ive
seen
today
spell
Damage
fourth
floor
they
found
mr.
Weasley
propped
up
in
bed
with
the
remains
of
his
turkey
dinner
on
a
tray
on
his
lap
and
a
rather
sheepish
expression
on
his
face
everything
all
right
Arthur
asked
Mrs
weasley
after
they
had
all
greeted
mr.
Weasley
and
handed
over
their
presents
fine
fine
said
mr.
Weasley
a
little
too
heartily
you
er
havent
seen
Healer
smethwyck
have
you
no
said
Mrs
weasley
suspiciously
why
nothing
nothing
said
mr.
Weasley
airily
starting
to
unwrap
his
pile
of
gifts
well
everyone
had
a
good
day
what
did
you
all
get
for
Christmas
oh
Harry
this
is
absolutely
wonderful
for
he
had
just
opened
Harrys
gift
of
fuse-wire
and
screwdrivers
mrs
weasley
did
not
seem
entirely
satisfied
with
mr.
Weasleys
answer
as
her
husband
leaned
over
to
shake
Harrys
hand
she
peered
at
the
bandaging
under
his
nightshirt
arthur
she
said
with
a
snap
in
her
voice
like
a
mousetrap
youve
had
your
bandages
changed
why
have
you
had
your
bandages
changed
a
day
early
Arthur
they
told
me
they
wouldnt
need
doing
until
tomorrow
what
said
mr.
Weasley
looking
rather
frightened
and
pulling
the
bed
covers
higher
up
his
chest
no
no
its
nothing
its
I
he
seemed
to
deflate
under
Mrs
weasleys
piercing
gaze
well
now
dont
get
upset
Molly
but
Augustus
Pye
had
an
idea
hes
the
Trainee
Healer
you
know
lovely
young
chap
and
very
interested
in
um
complementary
medicine
i
mean
some
of
these
old
Muggle
remedies
well
theyre
called
stitches
Molly
and
they
work
very
well
on
on
Muggle
wounds
mrs
weasley
let
out
an
ominous
noise
somewhere
between
a
shriek
and
a
snarl
lupin
strolled
away
from
the
bed
and
over
to
the
werewolf
who
had
no
visitors
and
was
looking
rather
wistfully
at
the
crowd
around
mr.
Weasley
Bill
muttered
something
about
getting
himself
a
cup
of
tea
and
Fred
and
George
leapt
up
to
accompany
him
grinning
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
said
Mrs
weasley
her
voice
growing
louder
with
every
word
and
apparently
unaware
that
her
fellow
visitors
were
scurrying
for
cover
that
you
have
been
messing
about
with
Muggle
remedies
not
messing
about
Molly
dear
said
mr.
Weasley
imploringly
it
was
just
just
something
Pye
and
I
thought
wed
try
only
most
unfortunately
well
with
these
particular
kinds
of
wounds
it
doesnt
seem
to
work
as
well
as
wed
hoped
meaning
well
well
I
dont
know
whether
you
know
what
what
stitches
are
it
sounds
as
though
youve
been
trying
to
sew
your
skin
back
together
said
Mrs
weasley
with
a
snort
of
mirthless
laughter
but
even
you
Arthur
wouldnt
be
that
stupid
i
fancy
a
cup
of
tea
too
said
Harry
jumping
to
his
feet
hermione
Ron
and
Ginny
almost
sprinted
to
the
door
with
him
as
it
swung
closed
behind
them
they
heard
Mrs
weasley
shriek
what
do
you
mean
th
ats
the
general
idea
typical
Dad
said
Ginny
shaking
her
head
as
they
set
off
up
the
corridor
stitches
i
ask
you
well
you
know
they
do
work
well
on
non-magical
wounds
said
Hermione
fairly
i
suppose
something
in
that
snakes
venom
dissolves
them
or
something
i
wonder
where
the
tearoom
is
fifth
floor
said
Harry
remembering
the
sign
over
the
welcome
witchs
desk
they
walked
along
the
corridor
through
a
set
of
double
doors
and
found
a
rickety
staircase
lined
with
more
portraits
of
brutal-looking
Healers
as
they
climbed
it
the
various
Healers
called
out
to
them
diagnosing
odd
complaints
and
suggesting
horrible
remedies
ron
was
seriously
affronted
when
a
medieval
wizard
called
out
that
he
clearly
had
a
bad
case
of
spattergroit
and
whats
that
supposed
to
be
he
asked
angrily
as
the
Healer
pursued
him
through
six
more
portraits
shoving
the
occupants
out
of
the
way
tis
a
most
grievous
affliction
of
the
skin
young
master
that
will
leave
you
pockmarked
and
more
gruesome
even
than
you
are
now
watch
who
youre
calling
gruesome
said
Ron
his
ears
turning
red
the
only
remedy
is
to
take
the
liver
of
a
toad
bind
it
tight
about
your
throat
stand
naked
at
the
full
moon
in
a
barrel
of
eels
eyes
i
have
not
got
spattergroit
but
the
unsightly
blemishes
upon
your
visage
young
master
theyre
freckles
said
Ron
furiously
now
get
back
in
your
own
picture
and
leave
me
alone
he
rounded
on
the
others
who
were
all
keeping
determinedly
straight
faces
what
floors
this
i
think
its
the
fifth
said
Hermione
nah
its
the
fourth
said
Harry
one
more
but
as
he
stepped
on
to
the
landing
he
came
to
an
abrupt
halt
staring
at
the
small
window
set
into
the
double
doors
that
marked
the
start
of
a
corridor
signposted
spell
damage
a
man
was
peering
out
at
them
all
with
his
nose
pressed
against
the
glass
he
had
wavy
blond
hair
bright
blue
eyes
and
a
broad
vacant
smile
that
revealed
dazzlingly
white
teeth
blimey
said
Ron
also
staring
at
the
man
oh
my
goodness
said
Hermione
suddenly
sounding
breathless
professor
Lockhart
their
ex-Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
teacher
pushed
open
the
doors
and
moved
towards
them
wearing
a
long
lilac
dressing
gown
well
hello
there
he
said
i
expect
youd
like
my
autograph
would
you
hasnt
changed
much
has
he
harry
muttered
to
Ginny
who
grinned
er
how
are
you
Professor
said
Ron
sounding
slightly
guilty
it
had
been
Rons
malfunctioning
wand
that
had
damaged
Professor
Lockharts
memory
so
badly
that
he
had
landed
in
st.
Mungos
in
the
first
place
though
as
Lockhart
had
been
attempting
to
permanently
wipe
Harry
and
Rons
memories
at
the
time
Harrys
sympathy
was
limited
im
very
well
indeed
thank
you
said
Lockhart
exuberantly
pulling
a
rather
battered
peacockfeather
quill
from
his
pocket
now
how
many
autographs
would
you
like
i
can
do
joined-up
writing
now
you
know
er
we
dont
want
any
at
the
moment
thanks
said
Ron
raising
his
eyebrows
at
Harry
who
asked
Professor
should
you
be
wandering
around
the
corridors
shouldnt
you
be
in
a
ward
the
smile
faded
slowly
from
Lockharts
face
for
a
few
moments
he
gazed
intently
at
Harry
then
he
said
Havent
we
met
er
yeah
we
have
said
Harry
you
used
to
teach
us
at
Hogwarts
remember
teach
repeated
Lockhart
looking
faintly
unsettled
me
did
I
and
then
the
smile
reappeared
upon
his
face
so
suddenly
it
was
rather
alarming
taught
you
everything
you
know
I
expect
did
I
well
how
about
those
autographs
then
shall
we
say
a
round
dozen
you
can
give
them
to
all
your
little
friends
then
and
nobody
will
be
left
out
but
just
then
a
head
poked
out
of
a
door
at
the
far
end
of
the
corridor
and
a
voice
called
gilderoy
you
naughty
boy
where
have
you
wandered
off
to
a
motherly-looking
Healer
wearing
a
tinsel
wreath
in
her
hair
came
bustling
up
the
corridor
smiling
warmly
at
Harry
and
the
others
oh
Gilderoy
youve
got
visitors
how
lovely
and
on
Christmas
Day
too
do
you
know
he
never
gets
visitors
poor
lamb
and
I
cant
think
why
hes
such
a
sweetie
arent
you
were
doing
autographs
gilderoy
told
the
Healer
with
another
glittering
smile
they
want
loads
of
them
wont
take
no
for
an
answer
i
just
hope
weve
got
enough
photographs
listen
to
him
said
the
Healer
taking
Lockharts
arm
and
beaming
fondly
at
him
as
though
he
were
a
precocious
two-year-old
he
was
rather
well
known
a
few
years
ago
we
very
much
hope
that
this
liking
for
giving
autographs
is
a
sign
that
his
memory
might
be
starting
to
come
back
will
you
step
this
way
hes
in
a
closed
ward
you
know
he
must
have
slipped
out
while
I
was
bringing
in
the
Christmas
presents
the
doors
usually
kept
locked
not
that
hes
dangerous
but
she
lowered
her
voice
to
a
whisper
hes
a
bit
of
a
danger
to
himself
bless
him
doesnt
know
who
he
is
you
see
wanders
off
and
cant
remember
how
to
get
back
it
is
nice
of
you
to
have
come
to
see
him
er
said
Ron
gesturing
uselessly
at
the
floor
above
actually
we
were
just
er
but
the
Healer
was
smiling
expectantly
at
them
and
Rons
feeble
mutter
of
going
to
have
a
cup
of
tea
trailed
away
into
nothingness
they
looked
at
each
other
helplessly
then
followed
lockhart
and
his
Healer
along
the
corridor
lets
not
stay
long
Ron
said
quietly
the
Healer
pointed
her
wand
at
the
door
of
the
Janus
Thickey
Ward
and
muttered
Alohomora
the
door
swung
open
and
she
led
the
way
inside
keeping
a
firm
grasp
on
Gilderoys
arm
until
she
had
settled
him
into
an
armchair
beside
his
bed
this
is
our
long-term
residents
ward
she
informed
Harry
Ron
Hermione
and
Ginny
in
a
low
voice
for
permanent
spell
damage
you
know
of
course
with
intensive
remedial
potions
and
charms
and
a
bit
of
luck
we
can
produce
some
improvement
gilderoy
does
seem
to
be
getting
back
some
sense
of
himself
and
weve
seen
a
real
improvement
in
mr.
Bode
he
seems
to
be
regaining
th
e
power
of
speech
very
well
though
he
isnt
speaking
any
language
we
recognize
yet
well
I
must
finish
giving
out
the
Christmas
presents
Ill
leave
you
all
to
chat
harry
looked
around
the
ward
bore
unmistakable
signs
of
being
a
permanent
home
to
its
residents
they
had
many
more
personal
effects
around
their
beds
than
in
mr.
Weasleys
ward
the
wall
around
Gilderoys
headboard
for
instance
was
papered
with
pictures
of
himself
all
beaming
toothily
and
waving
at
the
new
arrivals
he
had
autographed
many
of
them
to
himself
in
disjointed
childish
writing
the
moment
he
had
been
deposited
in
his
chair
by
the
Healer
gilderoy
pulled
a
fresh
stack
of
photographs
towards
him
seized
a
quill
and
started
signing
them
all
feverishly
you
can
put
them
in
envelopes
he
said
to
Ginny
throwing
the
signed
pictures
into
her
lap
one
by
one
as
he
finished
them
i
am
not
forgotten
you
know
no
I
still
receive
a
very
great
deal
of
fan
mail
gladys
Gudgeon
writes
weekly
i
just
wish
I
knew
why
he
paused
looking
faintly
puzzled
then
beamed
again
and
returned
to
his
signing
with
renewed
vigour
i
suspect
it
is
simply
my
good
looks
a
sallow-skinned
mournful-looking
wizard
lay
in
the
bed
opposite
staring
at
the
ceiling
he
was
mumbling
to
himself
and
seemed
quite
unaware
of
anything
around
him
two
beds
along
was
a
woman
whose
entire
head
was
covered
in
fur
Harry
remembered
something
similar
happening
to
Hermione
during
their
second
year
although
fortunately
the
damage
in
her
case
had
not
been
permanent
at
the
far
end
of
the
ward
flowery
curtains
had
been
drawn
around
two
beds
to
give
the
occupants
and
their
visitors
some
privacy
here
you
are
Agnes
said
the
Healer
brightly
to
the
furry-faced
woman
handing
her
a
small
pile
of
Christmas
presents
see
not
forgotten
are
you
and
your
sons
sent
an
owl
to
say
hes
visiting
tonight
so
thats
nice
isnt
it
agnes
gave
several
loud
barks
and
look
Broderick
youve
been
sent
a
potted
plant
and
a
lovely
calendar
with
a
different
fancy
Hippogriff
for
each
month
theyll
brighten
things
up
wont
they
said
the
Healer
bustling
along
to
the
mumbling
man
setting
a
rather
ugly
plant
with
long
swaying
tentacles
on
the
bedside
cabinet
and
fixing
the
calendar
to
the
wall
with
her
wand
and
oh
Mrs
longbottom
are
you
leaving
already
harrys
head
span
round
the
curtains
had
been
drawn
back
from
the
two
beds
at
the
end
of
the
ward
and
two
visitors
were
walking
back
down
the
aisle
between
the
beds
a
formidable-looking
old
witch
wearing
a
long
green
dress
a
moth-eaten
fox
fur
and
a
pointed
hat
decorated
with
what
was
unmistakeably
a
stuffed
vulture
and
trailing
behind
her
looking
thoroughly
depressed
neville
with
a
sudden
rush
of
understanding
Harry
realized
who
the
people
in
the
end
beds
must
be
he
cast
around
wildly
for
some
means
of
distracting
the
others
so
that
Neville
could
leave
the
ward
unnoticed
and
unquestioned
but
Ron
had
also
looked
up
at
the
sound
of
the
name
Longbottom
and
before
Harry
could
stop
him
had
called
out
Neville
neville
jumped
and
cowered
as
though
a
bullet
had
narrowly
missed
him
its
us
Neville
said
Ron
brightly
getting
to
h
i
s
feet
have
you
seen
lockharts
here
whove
you
been
visiting
friends
of
yours
Neville
dear
said
Nevilles
grandmother
graciously
bearing
down
upon
them
all
neville
looked
as
though
he
would
rather
be
anywhere
in
the
world
but
here
a
dull
purple
flush
was
creeping
up
his
plump
face
and
he
was
not
making
eye
contact
with
any
of
them
ah
yes
said
his
grandmother
looking
closely
at
Harry
and
sticking
out
a
shrivelled
clawlike
hand
for
him
to
shake
yes
yes
I
know
who
you
are
of
course
neville
speaks
most
highly
of
you
er
thanks
said
Harry
shaking
hands
neville
did
not
look
at
him
but
surveyed
his
own
feet
the
color
deepening
in
his
face
all
the
while
and
you
two
are
clearly
Weasleys
Mrs
longbottom
continued
proffering
her
hand
regally
to
ron
and
Ginny
in
turn
yes
I
know
your
parents
not
well
of
course
but
fine
people
fine
people
and
you
must
be
Hermione
Granger
hermione
looked
rather
startled
that
Mrs
longbottom
knew
her
name
but
shook
hands
all
the
same
yes
Nevilles
told
me
all
about
you
helped
him
out
of
a
few
sticky
spots
havent
you
hes
a
good
boy
she
said
casting
a
sternly
appraising
look
down
her
rather
bony
nose
at
Neville
but
he
hasnt
got
his
fathers
talent
Im
afraid
to
say
and
she
jerked
her
head
in
the
direction
of
the
two
beds
at
the
end
of
the
ward
so
that
the
stuffed
vulture
on
her
hat
trembled
alarmingly
what
said
Ron
looking
amazed
Harry
wanted
to
stamp
on
Rons
foot
but
that
sort
of
thing
is
much
harder
to
bring
off
unnoticed
when
youre
wearing
jeans
rather
than
robes
Is
that
your
dad
down
the
end
Neville
whats
this
said
Mrs
longbottom
sharply
havent
you
told
your
friends
about
your
parents
Neville
neville
took
a
deep
breath
looked
up
at
the
ceiling
and
shook
his
head
harry
could
not
remember
ever
feeling
sorrier
for
anyone
but
he
could
not
think
of
any
way
of
helping
Neville
out
of
the
situation
well
its
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
said
Mrs
longbottom
angrily
you
should
be
proud
neville
proud
they
didnt
give
their
health
and
their
sanity
so
their
only
son
would
be
ashamed
of
them
you
know
im
not
ashamed
said
Neville
very
faintly
still
looking
anywhere
but
at
Harry
and
the
others
ron
was
now
standing
on
tiptoe
to
look
over
at
the
inhabitants
of
the
two
beds
well
youve
got
a
funny
way
of
showing
it
said
Mrs
longbottom
my
son
and
his
wife
she
said
turning
haughtily
to
Harry
Ron
Hermione
and
Ginny
were
tortured
into
insanity
by
You
Know-Whos
followers
hermione
and
Ginny
both
clapped
their
hands
over
their
mouths
ron
stopped
craning
his
neck
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
Nevilles
parents
and
looked
mortified
they
were
Aurors
you
know
and
very
well
respected
within
the
wizarding
community
Mrs
longbottom
went
on
highly
gifted
the
pair
of
them
i
yes
Alice
dear
what
is
it
nevilles
mother
had
come
edging
down
the
ward
in
her
nightdress
she
no
longer
had
the
plump
happy-looking
face
Harry
had
seen
in
Moodys
old
photograph
of
the
original
Order
of
the
Phoenix
her
face
was
thin
and
worn
now
her
eyes
seemed
overlarge
and
her
hair
which
had
turned
white
was
wispy
and
dead-looking
she
did
not
seem
to
want
to
speak
or
perhaps
she
was
not
able
to
but
she
made
timid
motions
towards
Neville
holding
something
in
her
outstretched
hand
again
said
Mrs
longbottom
sounding
slightly
weary
very
well
Alice
dear
very
well
neville
take
it
whatever
it
is
but
Neville
had
already
stretched
out
his
hand
into
which
his
mother
dropped
an
empty
droobles
Best
Blowing
Gum
wrapper
very
nice
dear
said
Nevilles
grandmother
in
a
falsely
cheery
voice
patting
his
mother
on
the
shoulder
but
Neville
said
quietly
Thanks
Mum
his
mother
tottered
away
back
up
the
ward
humming
to
herself
neville
looked
around
at
the
others
his
expression
defiant
as
though
daring
them
to
laugh
but
Harry
did
not
think
hed
ever
found
anything
less
funny
in
his
life
well
wed
better
get
back
sighed
Mrs
Longbottom
drawing
on
long
green
gloves
very
nice
to
have
met
you
all
neville
put
that
wrapper
in
the
bin
she
must
have
given
you
enough
of
them
to
paper
your
bedroom
by
now
but
as
they
left
Harry
was
sure
he
saw
Neville
slip
the
candy
wrapper
into
his
pocket
the
door
closed
behind
them
i
never
knew
said
Hermione
who
looked
tearful
nor
did
I
said
Ron
rather
hoarsely
nor
me
whispered
Ginny
they
all
looked
at
Harry
i
did
he
said
glumly
dumbledore
told
me
but
I
promised
I
wouldnt
tell
anyone
thats
what
Bellatrix
Lestrange
got
sent
to
Azkaban
for
using
the
Cruciatus
Curse
on
Nevilles
parents
until
they
lost
their
minds
bellatrix
Lestrange
did
that
whispered
Hermione
horrified
that
woman
Kreachers
got
a
photo
of
in
his
den
there
was
a
long
silence
broken
by
Lockharts
angry
voice
look
I
didnt
learn
joined-up
writing
for
nothing
you
know
chapter
twenty-four
occlumency
kreacher
it
transpired
had
been
lurking
in
the
attic
sirius
said
he
had
found
him
up
there
covered
in
dust
no
doubt
looking
for
more
relics
of
the
Black
family
to
hide
in
his
cupboard
though
Sirius
seemed
satisfied
with
this
story
it
made
Harry
uneasy
kreacher
seemed
to
be
in
a
better
mood
on
his
reappearance
his
bitter
muttering
had
subsided
somewhat
and
he
submitted
to
orders
more
docilely
than
usual
though
once
or
twice
Harry
caught
the
house-elf
staring
at
him
avidly
but
always
looking
quickly
away
whenever
he
saw
that
Harry
had
noticed
harry
did
not
mention
his
vague
suspicions
to
Sirius
whose
cheerfulness
was
evaporating
fast
now
that
Christmas
was
over
as
the
date
of
their
departure
back
to
Hogwarts
drew
nearer
he
became
more
and
more
prone
to
what
Mrs
weasley
call
ed
fits
of
the
sullens
in
which
he
would
become
taciturn
and
grumpy
often
withdrawing
to
Buckbeaks
room
for
hours
at
a
time
his
gloom
seeped
through
the
house
oozing
under
doorways
like
some
noxious
gas
so
that
all
of
them
became
infected
by
it
harry
didnt
want
to
leave
Sirius
again
with
only
Kreacher
for
company
in
fact
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
was
not
looking
forward
to
returning
to
Hogwarts
going
back
to
school
would
mean
placing
himself
once
again
under
the
tyranny
of
Dolores
Umbridge
who
had
no
doubt
managed
to
force
through
another
dozen
decrees
in
their
absence
there
was
no
Quidditch
to
look
forward
to
now
that
he
had
been
banned
there
was
every
likelihood
that
their
burden
of
homework
would
increase
as
the
exams
drew
even
nearer
and
Dumbledore
remained
as
remote
as
ever
in
fact
if
it
hadnt
been
for
the
D
a.
Harry
thought
he
might
have
begged
Sirius
to
let
him
leave
Hogwarts
and
remain
in
Grimmauld
Place
then
on
the
very
last
day
of
the
holidays
something
happened
that
made
Harry
positively
dread
his
return
to
school
harry
dear
said
Mrs
weasley
poking
her
head
in
to
his
and
Rons
bedroom
where
the
pair
of
them
were
playing
wizard
chess
watched
by
Hermione
Ginny
and
Crookshanks
could
you
come
down
to
the
kitchen
professor
Snape
would
like
a
word
with
you
harry
did
not
immediately
register
what
she
had
said
one
of
his
castles
was
engaged
in
a
violent
tussle
with
a
pawn
of
Rons
and
he
was
egging
it
on
enthusiastically
squash
him
squash
him
hes
only
a
pawn
you
idiot
sorry
Mrs
weasley
what
did
you
say
professor
Snape
dear
in
the
kitchen
hed
like
a
word
harrys
mouth
fell
open
in
horror
he
looked
around
at
Ron
Hermione
and
Ginny
all
of
whom
were
gaping
back
at
him
crookshanks
whom
Hermione
had
been
restraining
with
difficulty
for
the
past
quarter
of
an
hour
leapt
gleefully
on
to
the
board
and
set
the
pieces
running
for
cover
squealing
at
the
top
of
their
voices
snape
said
Harry
blankly
professor
Snape
dear
said
Mrs
weasley
reprovingly
now
come
on
quickly
he
says
he
cant
stay
long
whats
he
want
with
you
said
Ron
looking
unnerved
as
Mrs
weasley
withdrew
from
the
room
you
havent
done
anything
have
you
no
said
Harry
indignantly
racking
his
brains
to
think
what
he
could
have
done
that
would
make
Snape
pursue
him
to
Grimmauld
Place
had
his
last
piece
of
homework
perhaps
earned
a
T
a
minute
or
two
later
he
pushed
open
the
kitchen
door
to
find
Sirius
and
Snape
both
seated
at
the
long
kitchen
table
glaring
in
opposite
directions
the
silence
between
them
was
heavy
with
mutual
dislike
a
letter
lay
open
on
the
table
in
front
of
Sirius
er
said
Harry
to
announce
his
presence
snape
looked
around
at
him
his
face
framed
between
curtains
of
greasy
black
hair
sit
down
Potter
you
know
said
Sirius
loudly
leaning
back
on
his
rear
chair
legs
and
speaking
to
the
ceiling
I
think
Id
prefer
it
if
you
didnt
give
orders
here
Snape
its
my
house
you
see
an
ugly
flush
suffused
Snapes
pallid
face
harry
sat
down
in
a
chair
beside
Sirius
facing
Snape
across
the
table
i
was
supposed
to
see
you
alone
Potter
said
Snape
the
familiar
sneer
curling
his
mouth
but
black
im
his
godfather
said
Sirius
louder
than
ever
i
am
here
on
Dumbledores
orders
said
Snape
whose
voice
by
contrast
was
becoming
more
and
more
quietly
waspish
but
by
all
means
stay
Black
I
know
you
like
to
feel
involved
whats
that
supposed
to
mean
said
Sirius
letting
his
chair
fall
back
on
to
all
four
legs
with
a
loud
bang
merely
that
I
am
sure
you
must
feel
ah
frustrated
by
the
fact
that
you
can
do
nothing
useful
snape
laid
a
delicate
stress
on
the
word
for
the
Order
it
was
Siriuss
turn
to
flush
snapes
lip
curled
in
triumph
as
he
turned
to
Harry
the
Headmaster
has
sent
me
to
tell
you
Potter
that
it
is
his
wish
for
you
to
study
Occlumency
this
term
study
what
said
Harry
blankly
snapes
sneer
became
more
pronounced
occlumency
Potter
the
magical
Defense
of
the
mind
against
external
penetration
an
obscure
branch
of
magic
but
a
highly
useful
one
harrys
heart
began
to
pump
very
fast
indeed
defense
against
external
penetration
but
he
was
not
being
possessed
they
had
all
agreed
on
that
why
do
I
have
to
study
Occlu
thing
he
blurted
out
because
the
Headmaster
thinks
it
a
good
idea
said
Snape
smoothly
you
will
receive
private
lessons
once
a
week
but
you
will
not
tell
anybody
what
you
are
doing
least
of
all
Dolores
umbridge
you
understand
yes
said
Harry
whos
going
to
be
teaching
me
snape
raised
an
eyebrow
i
am
he
said
harry
had
the
horrible
sensation
that
his
insides
were
melting
extra
lessons
with
Snape
what
on
earth
had
he
done
to
deserve
this
he
looked
quickly
round
at
Sirius
for
support
why
cant
Dumbledore
teach
Harry
asked
Sirius
aggressively
why
you
i
suppose
because
it
is
a
headmasters
privilege
to
delegate
less
enjoyable
tasks
said
Snape
silkily
i
assure
you
I
did
not
beg
for
the
job
he
got
to
his
feet
i
will
expect
you
at
six
oclock
on
Monday
evening
Potter
my
office
if
anybody
asks
you
are
taking
remedial
Potions
nobody
who
has
seen
you
in
my
classes
could
deny
you
need
them
he
turned
to
leave
his
black
traveling
cloak
billowing
behind
him
wait
a
moment
said
Sirius
sitting
up
straighter
in
his
chair
snape
turned
back
to
face
them
sneering
i
am
in
rather
a
hurry
Black
unlike
you
I
do
not
have
unlimited
leisure
time
ill
get
to
the
point
then
said
Sirius
standing
up
he
was
rather
taller
than
Snape
who
Harry
noticed
balled
his
fist
in
the
pocket
of
his
cloak
over
what
Harry
was
sure
was
the
handle
of
his
wand
if
I
hear
youre
using
these
Occlumency
lessons
to
give
Harry
a
hard
time
youll
have
me
to
answer
to
how
touching
Snape
sneered
but
surely
you
have
noticed
that
Potter
is
very
like
his
father
yes
I
have
said
Sirius
proudly
well
then
youll
know
hes
so
arrogant
that
criticism
simply
bounces
off
him
Snape
said
sleekly
sirius
pushed
his
chair
roughly
aside
and
strode
around
the
table
towards
Snape
pulling
out
his
wand
as
he
went
snape
whipped
out
his
own
they
were
squaring
up
to
each
other
Sirius
looking
livid
Snape
calculating
his
eyes
darting
from
Siriuss
wand-tip
to
his
face
sirius
said
Harry
loudly
but
Sirius
appeared
not
to
hear
him
ive
warned
you
Snivellus
said
Sirius
his
face
barely
a
foot
from
Snapes
I
dont
care
if
dumbledore
thinks
youve
reformed
I
know
better
oh
but
why
dont
you
tell
him
so
whispered
Snape
or
are
you
afraid
he
might
not
take
very
seriously
the
advice
of
a
man
who
has
been
hiding
inside
his
mothers
house
for
six
months
tell
me
how
is
Lucius
Malfoy
these
days
i
expect
hes
delighted
his
lapdogs
working
at
hogwarts
isnt
he
speaking
of
dogs
said
Snape
softly
did
you
know
that
Lucius
Malfoy
recognized
you
last
time
you
risked
a
little
jaunt
outside
clever
idea
Black
getting
yourself
seen
on
a
safe
station
platform
gave
you
a
cast-iron
excuse
not
to
leave
your
hidey-hole
in
future
didnt
it
sirius
raised
his
wand
no
harry
yelled
vaulting
over
the
table
and
trying
to
get
in
between
them
sirius
dont
are
you
calling
me
a
coward
roared
Sirius
trying
to
push
Harry
out
of
the
way
but
Harry
would
not
budge
why
yes
I
suppose
I
am
said
Snape
harry
get
out
of
it
snarled
Sirius
pushing
him
aside
with
his
free
hand
the
kitchen
door
opened
and
the
entire
Weasley
family
plus
Hermione
came
inside
all
looking
very
happy
with
mr.
Weasley
walking
proudly
in
thei
r
midst
dressed
in
a
pair
of
striped
pajamass
covered
by
a
mackintosh
cured
he
announced
brightly
to
the
kitchen
at
large
completely
cured
he
and
all
the
other
Weasleys
froze
on
the
threshold
gazing
at
the
scene
in
front
of
them
which
was
also
suspended
in
mid-action
both
Sirius
and
Snape
looking
towards
the
door
with
their
wands
pointing
into
each
others
faces
and
Harry
immobile
between
them
a
hand
stretched
out
to
each
trying
to
force
them
apart
merlins
beard
said
mr.
Weasley
the
smile
slidin
g
off
his
face
whats
going
on
here
both
Sirius
and
Snape
lowered
their
wands
harry
looked
from
one
to
the
other
each
wore
an
expression
of
utmost
contempt
yet
the
unexpected
entrance
of
so
many
witnesses
seemed
to
have
brought
them
to
their
senses
snape
pocketed
his
wand
turned
on
his
heel
and
swept
back
across
the
kitchen
passing
the
Weasleys
without
comment
at
the
door
he
looked
back
six
oclock
Monday
evening
Potter
and
he
was
gone
sirius
glared
after
him
his
wand
at
his
side
whats
been
going
on
asked
mr.
Weasley
again
nothing
Arthur
said
Sirius
who
was
breathing
heavily
as
though
he
had
just
run
a
long
distance
just
a
friendly
little
chat
between
two
old
school
friends
with
what
looked
like
an
enormous
effort
he
smiled
so
youre
cured
thats
great
news
really
great
yes
isnt
it
said
Mrs
weasley
leading
her
husb
and
forward
to
a
chair
healer
Smethwyck
worked
his
magic
in
the
end
found
an
antidote
to
whatever
that
snakes
got
in
its
fangs
and
arthurs
learned
his
lesson
about
dabbling
in
Muggle
medicine
havent
you
dear
she
added
rather
menacingly
yes
Molly
dear
said
mr.
Weasley
meekly
that
nights
meal
should
have
been
a
cheerful
one
with
mr.
Weasley
back
amongst
them
harry
could
tell
Sirius
was
trying
to
make
it
so
yet
when
his
godfather
was
not
forcing
himself
to
laugh
loudly
at
Fred
and
Georges
jokes
or
offering
everyone
more
food
his
face
fell
back
into
a
moody
brooding
expression
harry
was
separated
from
him
by
Mundungus
and
Mad-Eye
who
had
dropped
in
to
offer
mr.
Weasley
their
congratulations
he
wanted
to
talk
to
Sirius
to
tell
him
he
shouldnt
listen
to
a
word
Snape
said
that
Snape
was
goading
him
deliberately
and
that
the
rest
of
them
didnt
think
Sirius
was
a
coward
for
doing
as
Dumbledore
told
him
and
remaining
in
grimmauld
Place
but
he
had
no
opportunity
to
do
so
and
eyeing
the
ugly
look
on
Siriuss
face
harry
wondered
occasionally
whether
he
would
have
dared
to
mention
it
even
if
he
had
the
chance
instead
he
told
Ron
and
Hermione
under
his
voice
about
having
to
take
Occlumency
lessons
with
Snape
dumbledore
wants
to
stop
you
having
those
dreams
about
Voldemort
said
Hermione
at
once
well
you
wont
be
sorry
not
to
have
them
any
more
will
you
extra
lessons
with
Snape
said
Ron
sounding
aghast
id
rather
have
the
nightmares
they
were
to
return
to
Hogwarts
on
the
Knight
Bus
the
following
day
escorted
once
again
by
tonks
and
Lupin
both
of
whom
were
eating
breakfast
in
the
kitchen
when
Harry
Ron
and
hermione
came
down
next
morning
the
adults
seemed
to
have
been
mid-way
through
a
whispered
conversation
as
Harry
opened
the
door
all
of
them
looked
round
hastily
and
fell
silent
after
a
hurried
breakfast
they
all
pulled
on
jackets
and
scarves
against
the
chilly
grey
January
morning
harry
had
an
unpleasant
constricted
sensation
in
his
chest
he
did
not
want
to
say
goodbye
to
Sirius
he
had
a
bad
feeling
about
this
parting
he
didnt
know
when
they
would
next
see
each
other
and
he
felt
it
was
incumbent
upon
him
to
say
something
to
Sirius
to
stop
him
doing
anything
stupid
Harry
was
worried
that
Snapes
accusation
of
cowardice
had
stung
Sirius
so
badly
he
might
even
now
be
planning
some
foolhardy
trip
beyond
Grimmauld
Place
before
he
could
think
of
what
to
say
however
Sirius
had
beckoned
him
to
his
side
i
want
you
to
take
this
he
said
quietly
thrusting
a
badly
wrapped
package
roughly
the
size
of
a
paperback
book
into
Harrys
hands
what
is
it
harry
asked
a
way
of
letting
me
know
if
Snapes
giving
you
a
hard
time
no
dont
open
it
in
here
said
sirius
with
a
wary
look
at
Mrs
weasley
who
was
trying
to
persuade
the
twins
to
wear
handknitted
mittens
i
doubt
Molly
would
approve
but
I
want
you
to
use
it
if
you
need
me
all
right
okay
said
Harry
stowing
the
package
away
in
the
inside
pocket
of
his
jacket
but
he
knew
he
would
never
use
whatever
it
was
it
would
not
be
he
Harry
who
lured
Sirius
from
his
place
of
safety
no
matter
how
foully
Snape
treated
him
in
their
forthcoming
Occlumency
classes
lets
go
then
said
Sirius
clapping
Harry
on
the
shoulder
and
smiling
grimly
and
before
harry
could
say
anything
else
they
were
heading
upstairs
stopping
before
the
heavily
chained
and
bolted
front
door
surrounded
by
Weasleys
goodbye
Harry
take
care
said
Mrs
weasley
hugg
ing
him
see
you
Harry
and
keep
an
eye
out
for
snakes
for
me
said
mr.
Weasley
genially
shaking
his
hand
right
yeah
said
Harry
distractedly
it
was
his
last
chance
to
tell
Sirius
to
be
careful
he
turned
looked
into
his
godfathers
face
and
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
but
before
he
could
do
so
Sirius
was
giving
him
a
brief
one-armed
hug
and
saying
gruffly
Look
after
yourself
harry
next
moment
Harry
found
himself
being
shunted
out
into
the
icy
winter
air
with
Tonks
today
heavily
disguised
as
a
tall
tweedy
woman
with
iron-grey
hair
chivvying
him
down
the
steps
the
door
of
number
twelve
slammed
shut
behind
them
they
followed
Lupin
down
the
front
steps
as
he
reached
the
pavement
Harry
looked
round
number
twelve
was
shrinking
rapidly
as
those
on
either
side
of
it
stretched
sideways
squeezing
it
out
of
sight
one
blink
later
it
had
gone
come
on
the
quicker
we
get
on
the
bus
the
better
said
Tonks
and
Harry
thought
there
was
nervousness
in
the
glance
she
threw
around
the
square
lupin
flung
out
his
right
arm
bang
a
violently
purple
triple-decker
bus
had
appeared
out
of
thin
air
in
front
of
them
narrowly
avoiding
the
nearest
lamppost
which
jumped
backwards
out
of
its
way
a
thin
pimply
jug-eared
youth
in
a
purple
uniform
leapt
down
on
to
the
pavement
and
said
welcome
to
the
yes
yes
we
know
thank
you
said
Tonks
swiftly
on
on
get
on
and
she
shoved
Harry
forwards
towards
the
steps
past
the
conductor
who
goggled
at
Harry
as
he
passed
ere
its
Arry
if
you
shout
his
name
I
will
curse
you
into
oblivion
muttered
Tonks
menacingly
now
shunting
ginny
and
Hermione
forwards
ive
always
wanted
to
go
on
this
thing
said
Ron
happily
joining
Harry
on
board
and
looking
around
it
had
been
evening
the
last
time
Harry
had
traveled
by
Knight
Bus
and
its
three
decks
had
been
full
of
brass
bedsteads
now
in
the
early
morning
it
was
crammed
with
an
assortment
of
mismatched
chairs
grouped
haphazardly
around
windows
some
of
these
appeared
to
have
fallen
over
when
the
bus
stopped
abruptly
in
Grimmauld
Place
a
few
witches
and
wizards
were
still
getting
to
their
feet
grumbling
and
somebodys
shopping
bag
had
slid
the
length
of
the
bus
an
unpleasant
mixture
of
frogspawn
cockroaches
and
custard
creams
was
scattered
all
over
the
floor
looks
like
well
have
to
split
up
said
Tonks
briskly
looking
around
for
empty
chairs
fred
george
and
Ginny
if
you
just
take
those
seats
at
the
back
remus
can
stay
with
you
she
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
proceeded
up
to
the
very
top
deck
where
there
were
two
unoccupied
chairs
at
the
very
front
of
the
bus
and
two
at
the
back
stan
Shunpike
the
conductor
followed
Harry
and
Ron
eagerly
to
the
back
heads
turned
as
Harry
passed
and
when
he
sat
down
he
saw
all
the
faces
flick
back
to
the
front
again
as
Harry
and
Ron
handed
Stan
eleven
Sickles
each
the
bus
set
off
again
swaying
ominously
it
rumbled
around
Grimmauld
Place
weaving
on
and
off
the
pavement
then
with
another
tremendous
bang
they
were
all
flung
backwards
Rons
chair
toppled
right
over
and
pigwidgeon
who
had
been
on
his
lap
burst
out
of
his
cage
and
flew
twittering
wildly
up
to
the
front
of
the
bus
where
he
fluttered
down
on
to
Hermiones
shoulder
instead
harry
who
had
narrowly
avoided
falling
by
seizing
a
candle
bracket
looked
out
of
the
window
they
were
now
speeding
down
what
appeared
to
be
a
motorway
just
outside
Birmingham
said
Stan
happily
answe
ring
Harrys
unasked
question
as
Ron
struggled
up
from
the
floor
you

he
handed
over
their
tickets
and
continued
to
gaze
enthralled
at
Harry
apparently
Stan
did
not
care
how
nutty
somebody
was
if
they
were
famous
enough
to
be
in
the
paper
the
Knight
Bus
swayed
alarmingly
overtaking
a
line
of
cars
on
the
inside
looking
towards
the
front
of
the
bus
harry
saw
Hermione
cover
her
eyes
with
her
hands
Pigwidgeon
swaying
happily
on
her
shoulder
bang
chairs
slid
backwards
again
as
the
Knight
Bus
jumped
from
the
Birmingham
motorway
to
a
quiet
country
lane
full
of
hairpin
bends
hedgerows
on
either
side
of
the
road
were
leaping
out
of
their
way
as
they
mounted
the
verges
from
here
they
moved
to
a
main
street
in
the
middle
of
a
busy
town
then
to
a
viaduct
surrounded
by
tall
hills
then
to
a
windswept
road
between
high-rise
flats
each
time
with
a
loud
bang
ive
changed
my
mind
muttered
Ron
picking
himse
lf
up
from
the
floor
for
the
sixth
time
I
never
want
to
ride
on
this
thing
again
listen
its
Ogwarts
stop
after
this
said
Stan
brightly
swaying
towards
them
that
bossy
woman
up
front
oo
got
on
with
you
shes
given
us
a
little
tip
to
move
you
up
the
queue
were
just
gonna
let
Madam
Marsh
off
first
though
there
was
more
retching
from
downstairs
followed
by
a
horrible
spattering
sound
shes
not
feeling
er
best
a
few
minutes
later
the
Knight
Bus
screeched
to
a
halt
outside
a
small
pub
which
squeezed
itself
out
of
the
way
to
avoid
a
collision
they
could
hear
Stan
ushering
the
unfortunate
Madam
marsh
out
of
the
bus
and
the
relieved
murmurings
of
her
fellow
passengers
on
the
second
deck
the
bus
moved
on
again
gathering
speed
until
bang
they
were
rolling
through
a
snowy
Hogsmeade
harry
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
Hogs
Head
down
its
side
street
the
severed
boars
head
sign
creaking
in
the
wintry
wind
flecks
of
snow
hit
the
large
window
at
the
front
of
the
bus
at
last
they
rolled
to
a
halt
outside
the
gates
to
Hogwarts
lupin
and
Tonks
helped
them
off
the
bus
with
their
luggage
then
got
off
to
say
goodbye
harry
glanced
up
at
the
three
decks
of
the
Knight
Bus
and
saw
all
the
passengers
staring
down
at
them
noses
flat
against
the
windows
youll
be
safe
once
youre
in
the
grounds
said
Tonks
casting
a
careful
eye
around
at
the
deserted
road
have
a
good
term
okay
look
after
yourselves
said
Lupin
shaking
hands
all
round
and
reaching
Harry
last
and
listen
he
lowered
his
voice
while
the
rest
of
the
m
exchanged
last-minute
goodbyes
with
tonks
Harry
I
know
you
dont
like
Snape
but
he
is
a
superb
Occlumens
and
we
all
Sirius
included
want
you
to
learn
to
protect
yourself
so
work
hard
all
right
yeah
all
right
said
Harry
heavily
looking
up
into
Lupins
prematurely
lined
face
see
you
then
the
six
of
them
struggled
up
the
slippery
drive
towards
the
castle
dragging
their
trunks
hermione
was
already
talking
about
knitting
a
few
elf
hats
before
bedtime
harry
glanced
back
when
they
reached
the
oaken
front
doors
the
Knight
Bus
had
already
gone
and
he
half-wished
given
what
was
coming
the
following
evening
that
he
was
still
on
board
harry
spent
most
of
the
next
day
dreading
the
evening
his
morning
double-Potions
lesson
did
nothing
to
dispel
his
trepidation
as
Snape
was
as
unpleasant
as
ever
his
mood
was
further
lowered
by
the
D
a.
members
constantly
approaching
him
in
the
corridors
between
classes
askinghopefully
if
there
would
be
a
meeting
that
night
ill
let
you
know
in
the
usual
way
when
the
next
one
is
Harry
said
over
and
over
again
but
I
cant
do
it
tonight
Ive
got
to
go
to
er
remedial
Potions
you
take
remedial
Potions
asked
Zacharias
Smith
superciliously
having
cornered
Harry
in
the
Entrance
Hall
after
lunch
good
Lord
you
must
be
terrible
snape
doesnt
usually
give
extra
lessons
does
he
as
Smith
strode
away
in
an
annoyingly
buoyant
fashion
Ron
glared
after
him
shall
I
jinx
him
i
can
still
get
him
from
here
he
said
raising
his
wand
and
taking
aim
between
Smiths
shoulder
blades
forget
it
said
Harry
dismally
its
what
everyones
going
to
think
isnt
it
that
Im
really
stup
hi
Harry
said
a
voice
behind
him
he
turned
round
and
found
Cho
standing
there
oh
said
Harry
as
his
stomach
leapt
uncomfortably
hi
well
be
in
the
library
Harry
said
Hermione
firmly
as
she
seized
Ron
above
the
elbow
and
dragged
him
off
towards
the
marble
staircase
had
a
good
Christmas
asked
Cho
yeah
not
bad
said
Harry
mine
was
pretty
quiet
said
Cho
for
some
reason
she
was
looking
rather
embarrassed
erm

another
Hogsmeade
trip
next
month
did
you
see
the
notice
what
oh
no
I
havent
checked
the
noticeboard
since
I
got
back
yes
its
on
Valentines
Day
right
said
Harry
wondering
why
she
was
telling
him
this
well
I
suppose
you
want
to
only
if
you
do
she
said
eagerly
harry
stared
he
had
been
about
to
say
I
suppose
you
want
to
know
when
the
next
D
a.
meetingis
but
her
response
did
not
seem
to
fit
i
er
he
said
oh
its
okay
if
you
dont
she
said
looking
mortified
dont
worry
i
Ill
see
you
around
she
walked
away
harry
stood
staring
after
her
his
brain
working
frantically
then
something
clunked
into
place
cho
hey
cho
he
ran
after
her
catching
her
halfway
up
the
marble
staircase
er
dyou
want
to
come
into
Hogsmeade
with
me
on
Valentines
Day
oooh
yes
she
said
blushing
crimson
and
beaming
at
him
right
well
thats
settled
then
said
Harry
and
feeling
that
the
day
was
not
going
to
be
a
complete
loss
after
all
he
headed
off
to
the
library
to
pick
up
Ron
and
Hermione
before
their
afternoon
lessons
walking
in
a
rather
bouncy
way
himself
by
six
oclock
that
evening
however
even
the
glow
of
having
successfully
asked
out
Cho
chang
could
not
lighten
the
ominous
feelings
that
intensified
with
every
step
Harry
took
towards
snapes
office
he
paused
outside
the
door
when
he
reached
it
wishing
he
were
almost
anywhere
else
then
taking
a
deep
breath
he
knocked
and
entered
the
shadowy
room
was
lined
with
shelves
bearing
hundreds
of
glass
jars
in
which
slimy
bits
of
animals
and
plants
were
suspended
in
variously
colored
potions
in
one
corner
stood
the
cupboard
full
of
ingredients
that
Snape
had
once
accused
Harry
not
without
reason
of
robbing
harrys
attention
was
drawn
towards
the
desk
however
where
a
shallow
stone
basin
engraved
with
runes
and
symbols
lay
in
a
pool
of
candlelight
harry
recognized
it
at
once
it
was
dumbledores
Pensieve
wondering
what
on
earth
it
was
doing
there
he
jumped
when
Snapes
cold
voice
came
out
of
the
shadows
shut
the
door
behind
you
Potter
harry
did
as
he
was
told
with
the
horrible
feeling
that
he
was
imprisoning
himself
when
he
turned
back
into
the
room
Snape
had
moved
into
the
light
and
was
pointing
silently
at
the
chair
opposite
his
desk
harry
sat
down
and
so
did
Snape
his
cold
black
eyes
fixed
unblinkingly
upon
harry
dislike
etched
in
every
line
of
his
face
well
Potter
you
know
why
you
are
here
he
said
the
Headmaster
has
asked
me
to
teach
you
occlumency
i
can
only
hope
that
you
prove
more
adept
at
it
than
at
Potions
right
said
Harry
tersely
this
may
not
be
an
ordinary
class
Potter
said
Snape
his
eyes
narrowed
malevolently
but
I
am
still
your
teacher
and
you
will
therefore
call
me
sir
or
professor
at
all
times
yes
sir
said
Harry
snape
continued
to
survey
him
through
narrowed
eyes
for
a
moment
then
said
Now
occlumency
as
I
told
you
back
in
your
dear
godfathers
kitchen
this
branch
of
magic
seals
the
mind
against
magical
intrusion
and
influence
and
why
does
Professor
Dumbledore
think
I
need
it
sir
said
Harry
looking
directly
into
snapes
eyes
and
wondering
whether
Snape
would
answer
snape
looked
back
at
him
for
a
moment
and
then
said
contemptuously
Surely
even
you
could
have
worked
that
out
by
now
Potter
the
Dark
Lord
is
highly
skilled
at
Legilimency
whats
that
sir
it
is
the
ability
to
extract
feelings
and
memories
from
another
persons
mind
he
can
read
minds
said
Harry
quickly
his
worst
fears
confirmed
you
have
no
subtlety
Potter
said
Snape
his
dark
eyes
glittering
you
do
not
understand
fine
distinctions
it
is
one
of
the
shortcomings
that
makes
you
such
a
lamentable
potion-maker
snape
paused
for
a
moment
apparently
to
savor
the
pleasure
of
insulting
Harry
before
continuing
only
Muggles
talk
of
mind-reading
the
mind
is
not
a
book
to
be
opened
at
will
and
examined
at
leisure
thoughts
are
not
etched
on
the
inside
of
skulls
to
be
perused
by
any
invader
the
mind
is
a
complex
and
many-layered
thing
Potter
or
at
least
most
minds
are
he
smirked
it
is
true
however
that
those
who
have
mastered
Legilimency
are
able
under
certain
conditions
to
delve
into
the
minds
of
their
victims
and
to
interpret
their
findings
correctly
the
Dark
Lord
for
instance
almost
always
knows
when
somebody
is
lying
to
him
only
those
skilled
at
Occlumency
are
able
to
shut
down
those
feelings
and
memories
that
contradict
the
lie
and
so
can
utter
falsehoods
in
his
presence
without
detection
whatever
Snape
said
Legilimency
sounded
like
mind-reading
to
Harry
and
he
didnt
like
the
sound
of
it
at
all
so
he
could
know
what
were
thinking
right
now
sir
the
Dark
Lord
is
at
a
considerable
distance
and
the
walls
and
grounds
of
Hogwarts
are
guarded
by
many
ancient
spells
and
charms
to
ensure
the
bodily
and
mental
safety
of
those
who
dwell
within
them
said
Snape
time
and
space
matter
in
magic
Potter
eye
contact
is
often
essential
to
Legilimency
well
then
why
do
I
have
to
learn
Occlumency
snape
eyed
Harry
tracing
his
mouth
with
one
long
thin
finger
as
he
did
so
the
usual
rules
do
not
seem
to
apply
with
you
Potter
the
curse
that
failed
to
kill
you
seems
to
have
forged
some
kind
of
connection
between
you
and
the
Dark
Lord
the
evidence
suggests
that
at
times
when
your
mind
is
most
relaxed
and
vulnerable
when
you
are
asleep
for
instance
you
are
sharing
the
Dark
Lords
thoughts
and
emotions
the
Headmaster
thinks
it
inadvisable
for
this
to
continue
he
wishes
me
to
teach
you
how
to
close
your
mind
to
the
Dark
Lord
harrys
heart
was
pumping
fast
again
none
of
this
added
up
but
why
does
Professor
Dumbledore
want
to
stop
it
he
asked
abruptly
i
dont
like
it
much
but
its
been
useful
hasnt
it
i
mean
i
saw
that
snake
attack
mr.
Weasley
and
if
I
hadnt
professor
Dumbledore
wouldnt
have
been
able
to
save
him
would
he
sir
snape
stared
at
Harry
for
a
few
moments
still
tracing
his
mouth
with
his
finger
when
he
spoke
again
it
was
slowly
and
deliberately
as
though
he
weighed
every
word
it
appears
that
the
Dark
Lord
has
been
unaware
of
the
connection
between
you
and
himself
until
very
recently
up
till
now
it
seems
that
you
have
been
experiencing
his
emotions
and
sharing
his
thoughts
without
his
being
any
the
wiser
however
the
vision
you
had
shortly
before
Christmas
the
one
with
the
snake
and
mr.
Weasley
do
not
interrupt
me
Potter
said
Snape
in
a
dangerous
voice
as
I
was
saying
the
vision
you
had
shortly
before
Christmas
represented
such
a
powerful
incursion
upon
the
Dark
Lords
thoughts
i
saw
inside
the
snakes
head
not
his
i
thought
I
just
told
you
not
to
interrupt
me
Potter
but
Harry
did
not
care
if
Snape
was
angry
at
last
he
seemed
to
be
getting
to
the
bottom
of
this
business
he
had
moved
forwards
in
his
chair
so
that
without
realizing
it
he
was
perched
on
the
very
edge
tense
as
though
poised
for
flight
how
come
I
saw
through
the
snakes
eyes
if
its
Voldemorts
thoughts
Im
sharing
do
not
say
the
Dark
Lords
name
spat
Snape
there
was
a
nasty
silence
they
glared
at
each
other
across
the
Pensieve
professor
Dumbledore
says
his
name
said
Harry
quietly
dumbledore
is
an
extremely
powerful
wizard
Snape
muttered
while
he
may
feel
secure
enough
to
use
the
name
the
rest
of
us
he
rubbed
his
left
forearm
apparently
unconsciously
on
the
spot
where
Harry
knew
the
Dark
Mark
was
burned
into
his
skin
i
just
wanted
to
know
Harry
began
again
forcing
his
voice
back
to
politeness
why
you
seem
to
have
visited
the
snakes
mind
because
that
was
where
the
Dark
Lord
was
at
that
particular
moment
snarled
Snape
he
was
possessing
the
snake
at
the
time
and
so
you
dreamed
you
were
inside
it
too
and
Vol
he
realized
I
was
there
it
seems
so
said
Snape
coolly
how
do
you
know
said
Harry
urgently
is
this
just
Professor
Dumbledore
guessing
or
i
told
you
said
Snape
rigid
in
his
chair
his
eyes
slits
to
call
me
sir
yes
sir
said
Harry
impatiently
but
how
do
you
know
it
is
enough
that
we
know
said
Snape
repressively
the
important
point
is
that
the
Dark
Lord
is
now
aware
that
you
are
gaining
access
to
his
thoughts
and
feelings
he
has
also
deduced
that
the
process
is
likely
to
work
in
reverse
that
is
to
say
he
has
realized
that
he
might
be
able
to
access
your
thoughts
and
feelings
in
return
and
he
might
try
and
make
me
do
things
asked
Harry
sir
he
added
hurriedly
he
might
said
Snape
sounding
cold
and
unconcerned
which
brings
us
back
to
Occlumency
snape
pulled
out
his
wand
from
an
inside
pocket
of
his
robes
and
Harry
tensed
in
his
chair
but
snape
merely
raised
the
wand
to
his
temple
and
placed
its
tip
into
the
greasy
roots
of
his
hair
when
he
withdrew
it
some
silvery
substance
came
away
stretching
from
temple
to
wand
like
a
thick
gossamer
strand
which
broke
as
he
pulled
the
wand
away
from
it
and
fell
gracefully
into
the
Pensieve
where
it
swirled
silvery-white
neither
gas
nor
liquid
twice
more
Snape
raised
the
wand
to
his
temple
and
deposited
the
silvery
substance
into
the
stone
basin
then
without
offering
any
explanation
of
his
behavior
he
picked
up
the
Pensieve
carefully
removed
it
to
a
shelf
out
of
their
way
and
returned
to
face
Harry
with
his
wand
held
at
the
ready
stand
up
and
take
out
your
wand
Potter
harry
got
to
his
feet
feeling
nervous
they
faced
each
other
with
the
desk
between
them
you
may
use
your
wand
to
attempt
to
disarm
me
or
defend
yourself
in
any
other
way
you
can
think
of
said
Snape
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
harry
asked
eyeing
Snapes
wand
apprehensively
i
am
about
to
attempt
to
break
into
your
mind
said
Snape
softly
we
are
going
to
see
how
well
you
resist
i
have
been
told
that
you
have
already
shown
aptitude
at
resisting
the
Imperius
Curse
you
will
find
that
similar
powers
are
needed
for
this
brace
yourself
now
legilimens
snape
had
struck
before
Harry
was
ready
before
he
had
even
begun
to
summon
any
force
of
resistance
the
office
swam
in
front
of
his
eyes
and
vanished
image
after
image
was
racing
through
his
mind
like
a
flickering
film
so
vivid
it
blinded
him
to
his
surroundings
he
was
five
watching
Dudley
riding
a
new
red
bicycle
and
his
heart
was
bursting
with
jealousy
he
was
nine
and
Ripper
the
bulldog
was
chasing
him
up
a
tree
and
the
Dursleys
were
laughing
below
on
the
lawn
he
was
sitting
under
the
Sorting
Hat
and
it
was
telling
him
he
would
do
well
in
Slytherin
hermione
was
lying
in
the
hospital
wing
her
face
covered
with
thick
black
hair
a
hundred
Dementors
were
closing
in
on
him
beside
the
dark
lake
cho
chang
was
drawing
nearer
to
him
under
the
mistletoe
no
said
a
voice
inside
Harrys
head
as
the
memory
of
Cho
drew
nearer
youre
not
watching
that
youre
not
watching
it
its
private
he
felt
a
sharp
pain
in
his
knee
snapes
office
had
come
back
into
view
and
he
realized
that
he
had
fallen
to
the
floor
one
of
his
knees
had
collided
painfully
with
the
leg
of
Snapes
desk
he
looked
up
at
Snape
who
had
lowered
his
wand
and
was
rubbing
his
wrist
there
was
an
angry
weal
there
like
a
scorch
mark
did
you
mean
to
produce
a
Stinging
Hex
asked
Snape
coolly
no
said
Harry
bitterly
getting
up
from
the
floor
i
thought
not
said
Snape
watching
him
closely
you
let
me
get
in
too
far
you
lost
control
did
you
see
everything
I
saw
harry
asked
unsure
whether
he
wanted
to
hear
the
answer
flashes
of
it
said
Snape
his
lip
curling
to
whom
did
the
dog
belong
my
Aunt
Marge
Harry
muttered
hating
Snape
well
for
a
first
attempt
that
was
not
as
poor
as
it
might
have
been
said
Snape
raising
his
wand
once
more
you
managed
to
stop
me
eventually
though
you
wasted
time
and
energy
shouting
you
must
remain
focused
repel
me
with
your
brain
and
you
will
not
need
to
resort
to
your
wand
im
trying
said
Harry
angrily
but
youre
not
telling
me
how
manners
Potter
said
Snape
dangerously
now
I
want
you
to
close
your
eyes
harry
threw
him
a
filthy
look
before
doing
as
he
was
told
he
did
not
like
the
idea
of
standing
there
with
his
eyes
shut
while
Snape
faced
him
carrying
a
wand
clear
your
mind
Potter
said
Snapes
cold
voice
let
go
of
all
emotion
but
Harrys
anger
at
Snape
continued
to
pound
through
his
veins
like
venom
let
go
of
his
anger
he
could
as
easily
detach
his
legs
youre
not
doing
it
Potter
you
will
need
more
discipline
than
this
focus
now
harry
tried
to
empty
his
mind
tried
not
to
think
or
remember
or
feel
lets
go
again
on
the
count
of
three
one
two
three
Legilimens
a
great
black
dragon
was
rearing
in
front
of
him
his
father
and
mother
were
waving
at
him
out
of
an
enchanted
mirror
cedric
Diggory
was
lying
on
the
ground
with
blank
eyes
staring
at
him
nooooooo
harry
was
on
his
knees
again
his
face
buried
in
his
hands
his
brain
aching
as
though
someone
had
been
trying
to
pull
it
from
his
skull
get
up
said
Snape
sharply
get
up
you
are
not
trying
you
are
making
no
effort
you
are
allowing
me
access
to
memories
you
fear
handing
me
weapons
harry
stood
up
again
his
heart
thumping
wildly
as
though
he
had
really
just
seen
Cedric
dead
in
the
graveyard
snape
looked
paler
than
usual
and
angrier
though
not
nearly
as
angry
as
Harry
was
i
am
making
an
effort
he
said
through
clenched
teeth
i
told
you
to
empty
yourself
of
emotion
yeah
well
Im
finding
that
hard
at
the
moment
Harry
snarled
then
you
will
find
yourself
easy
prey
for
the
Dark
Lord
said
Snape
savagely
fools
who
wear
their
hearts
proudly
on
their
sleeves
who
cannot
control
their
emotions
who
wallow
in
sad
memories
and
allow
themselves
to
be
provoked
so
easily
weak
people
in
other
words
they
stand
no
chance
against
his
powers
he
will
penetrate
your
mind
with
absurd
ease
Potter
i
am
not
weak
said
Harry
in
a
low
voice
fury
now
pumping
through
him
so
that
he
thought
he
might
attack
Snape
in
a
moment
then
prove
it
master
yourself
spat
Snape
control
your
anger
discipline
your
mind
we
shall
try
again
get
ready
now
legilimens
he
was
watching
Uncle
Vernon
hammering
the
letterbox
shut
a
hundred
Dementors
were
drifting
across
the
lake
in
the
grounds
towards
him
he
was
running
along
a
windowless
passage
with
mr.
Weasley
they
were
drawing
nearer
to
the
plain
black
door
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
harry
expected
to
go
through
it
but
mr.
Weasley
led
him
off
to
the
left
down
a
flight
of
stone
steps
i
know
i
know
he
was
on
all
fours
again
on
Snapes
office
floor
his
scar
was
prickling
unpleasantly
but
the
voice
that
had
just
issued
from
his
mouth
was
triumphant
he
pushed
himself
up
again
to
find
snape
staring
at
him
his
wand
raised
it
looked
as
though
this
time
Snape
had
lifted
the
spell
before
Harry
had
even
tried
to
fight
back
what
happened
then
Potter
he
asked
eyeing
Harry
intently
i
saw
I
remembered
Harry
panted
ive
just
realized
realized
what
asked
Snape
sharply
harry
did
not
answer
at
once
he
was
still
savoring
the
moment
of
blinding
realization
as
he
rubbed
his
forehead
he
had
been
dreaming
about
a
windowless
corridor
ending
in
a
locked
door
for
months
without
once
realizing
that
it
was
a
real
place
now
seeing
the
memory
again
he
knew
that
all
along
he
had
been
dreaming
about
the
corridor
down
which
he
had
run
with
mr.
Weasley
on
the
twelfth
of
august
as
they
hurried
to
the
courtrooms
in
the
Ministry
it
was
the
corridor
leading
to
the
department
of
Mysteries
and
mr.
Weasley
had
been
there
the
night
that
he
had
been
attacked
by
voldemorts
snake
he
looked
up
at
Snape
whats
in
the
Department
of
Mysteries
what
did
you
say
snape
asked
quietly
and
Harry
saw
with
deep
satisfaction
that
Snape
was
unnerved
i
said
whats
in
the
Department
of
Mysteries
sir
harry
said
and
why
said
Snape
slowly
would
you
ask
such
a
thing
because
said
Harry
watching
Snapes
face
closely
that
corridor
Ive
just
seen
Ive
been
dreaming
about
it
for
months
Ive
just
recognized
it
it
leads
to
the
Department
of
Mysteries
and
I
think
Voldemort
wants
something
from
i
have
told
you
not
to
say
the
Dark
Lords
name
they
glared
at
each
other
harrys
scar
seared
again
but
he
did
not
care
snape
looked
agitated
but
when
he
spoke
again
he
sounded
as
though
he
was
trying
to
appear
cool
and
unconcerned
there
are
many
things
in
the
Department
of
Mysteries
Potter
few
of
which
you
would
understand
and
none
of
which
concern
you
do
I
make
myself
plain
yes
Harry
said
still
rubbing
his
prickling
scar
which
was
becoming
more
painful
i
want
you
back
here
same
time
on
Wednesday
we
will
continue
work
then
fine
said
Harry
he
was
desperate
to
get
out
of
Snapes
office
and
find
Ron
and
Hermione
you
are
to
rid
your
mind
of
all
emotion
every
night
before
sleep
empty
it
make
it
blank
and
calm
you
understand
yes
said
Harry
who
was
barely
listening
and
be
warned
Potter
i
shall
know
if
you
have
not
practiced
right
Harry
mumbled
he
picked
up
his
schoolbag
swung
it
over
his
shoulder
and
hurried
towards
the
office
door
as
he
opened
it
he
glanced
back
at
Snape
who
had
his
back
to
Harry
and
was
scooping
his
own
thoughts
out
of
the
Pensieve
with
the
tip
of
his
wand
and
replacing
them
carefully
inside
his
own
head
harry
left
without
another
word
closing
the
door
carefully
behind
him
his
scar
still
throbbing
painfully
harry
found
Ron
and
Hermione
in
the
library
where
they
were
working
on
Umbridges
most
recent
ream
of
homework
other
students
nearly
all
of
them
fifth-years
sat
at
lamp-lit
tables
nearby
noses
close
to
books
quills
scratching
feverishly
while
the
sky
outside
the
mullioned
windows
grew
steadily
blacker
the
only
other
sound
was
the
slight
squeaking
of
one
of
Madam
pinces
shoes
as
the
librarian
prowled
the
aisles
menacingly
breathing
down
the
necks
of
those
touching
her
precious
books
harry
felt
shivery
his
scar
was
still
aching
he
felt
almost
feverish
when
he
sat
down
opposite
Ron
and
Hermione
he
caught
sight
of
himself
in
the
window
opposite
he
was
very
white
and
his
scar
seemed
to
be
showing
up
more
clearly
than
usual
how
did
it
go
hermione
whispered
and
then
looking
concerned
are
you
all
right
Harry
yeah
fine
i
dunno
said
Harry
impatiently
wincing
as
pain
shot
through
his
scar
again
listen
ive
just
realized
something
and
he
told
them
what
he
had
just
seen
and
deduced
so
so
are
you
saying
whispered
Ron
as
Madam
Pince
swept
past
squeaking
slightly
that
the
weapon
the
thing
You-Know-Whos
after
is
in
the
Ministry
of
Magic
in
the
Department
of
Mysteries
its
got
to
be
H
arry
whispered
i
saw
that
door
when
your
dad
took
me
down
to
the
courtrooms
for
my
hearing
and
its
definitely
the
same
one
he
was
guarding
when
the
snake
bit
him
hermione
let
out
a
long
slow
sigh
of
course
she
breathed
of
course
what
said
Ron
rather
impatiently
ron
think
about
it
sturgis
Podmore
was
trying
to
get
through
a
door
at
the
Ministry
of
magic
it
must
have
been
that
one
its
too
much
of
a
coincidence
how
come
Sturgis
was
trying
to
break
in
when
hes
on
our
side
said
Ron
well
I
dont
know
Hermione
admitted
that
is
a
bit
odd
so
whats
in
the
Department
of
Mysteries
harry
asked
Ron
has
your
dad
ever
mentioned
anything
about
it
i
know
they
call
the
people
who
work
in
there
Unspeakablessaid
Ron
frowning
because
no
one
really
seems
to
know
what
they
do
weird
place
to
have
a
weapon
its
not
weird
at
all
it
makes
perfect
sense
said
Hermione
it
will
be
something
top
secret
that
the
Ministry
has
been
developing
I
expect
harry
are
you
sure
youre
all
right
for
Harry
had
just
run
both
his
hands
hard
over
his
forehead
as
though
trying
to
iron
it
yeah
fine
he
said
lowering
his
hands
which
we
re
trembling
i
just
feel
a
bit
i
dont
like
Occlumency
much
i
expect
anyone
would
feel
shaky
if
theyd
had
their
mind
attacked
over
and
over
again
said
hermione
sympathetically
look
lets
get
back
to
the
common
room
well
be
a
bit
more
comfortable
there
but
the
common
room
was
packed
and
full
of
shrieks
of
laughter
and
excitement
Fred
and
george
were
demonstrating
their
latest
bit
of
joke
shop
merchandise
headless
Hats
shouted
George
as
Fred
waved
a
pointed
hat
decorated
with
a
fluffy
pink
feather
at
the
watching
students
two
Galleons
each
watch
Fred
now
fred
swept
the
hat
on
to
his
head
beaming
for
a
second
he
merely
looked
rather
stupid
then
both
hat
and
head
vanished
several
girls
screamed
but
everyone
else
was
roaring
with
laughter
and
off
again
shouted
George
and
Freds
hand
groped
for
a
moment
in
what
seemed
to
be
thin
air
over
his
shoulder
then
his
head
reappeared
as
he
swept
the
pink-feathered
hat
from
it
how
do
those
hats
work
then
said
Hermione
distracted
from
her
homework
and
watching
fred
and
George
closely
i
mean
obviously
its
some
kind
of
Invisibility
Spell
but
its
rather
clever
to
have
extended
the
field
of
invisibility
beyond
the
boundaries
of
the
charmed
object
id
imagine
the
charm
wouldnt
have
a
very
long
life
though
harry
did
not
answer
he
was
feeling
ill
im
going
to
have
to
do
this
tomorrow
he
muttered
pushing
the
books
he
had
just
taken
out
of
his
bag
back
inside
it
well
write
it
in
your
homework
planner
then
said
Hermione
encouragingly
so
you
dont
forget
harry
and
Ron
exchanged
looks
as
he
reached
into
his
bag
withdrew
the
planner
and
opened
it
tentatively
dont
leave
it
till
later
you
big
second-rater
chided
the
book
as
Harry
scribbled
down
umbridges
homework
hermione
beamed
at
it
i
think
Ill
go
to
bed
said
Harry
stuffing
the
homework
planner
back
into
his
bag
and
making
a
mental
note
to
drop
it
in
the
fire
the
first
opportunity
he
got
he
walked
across
the
common
room
dodging
George
who
tried
to
put
a
Headless
Hat
on
him
and
reached
the
peace
and
cool
of
the
stone
staircase
to
the
boys
dormitories
he
was
feeling
sick
again
just
as
he
had
the
night
he
had
had
the
vision
of
the
snake
but
thought
that
if
he
could
just
lie
down
for
a
while
he
would
be
all
right
he
opened
the
door
of
his
dormitory
and
was
one
step
inside
it
when
he
experienced
pain
so
severe
he
thought
that
someone
must
have
sliced
into
the
top
of
his
head
he
did
not
know
where
he
was
whether
he
was
standing
or
lying
down
he
did
not
even
know
his
own
name
maniacal
laughter
was
ringing
in
his
ears
he
was
happier
than
he
had
been
in
a
very
long
time
jubilant
ecstatic
triumphant
a
wonderful
wonderful
thing
had
happened
harry
harry
someone
had
hit
him
around
the
face
the
insane
laughter
was
punctuated
with
a
cry
of
pain
the
happiness
was
draining
out
of
him
but
the
laughter
continued
he
opened
his
eyes
and
as
he
did
so
he
became
aware
that
the
wild
laughter
was
coming
out
of
his
own
mouth
the
moment
he
realized
this
it
died
away
Harry
lay
panting
on
the
floor
staring
up
at
the
ceiling
the
scar
on
his
forehead
throbbing
horribly
ron
was
bending
over
him
looking
very
worried
what
happened
he
said
dunno
harry
gasped
sitting
up
again
hes
really
happy
really
happy
you-Know-Who
is
something
goods
happened
mumbled
Harry
he
was
shaking
as
badly
as
he
had
done
after
seeing
the
snake
attack
mr.
Weasley
and
felt
very
sick
something
hes
been
hoping
for
the
words
came
just
as
they
had
back
in
the
Gryffindor
changing
room
as
though
a
stranger
was
speaking
them
through
Harrys
mouth
yet
he
knew
they
were
true
he
took
deep
breaths
willing
himself
not
to
vomit
all
over
Ron
he
was
very
glad
that
Dean
and
Seamus
were
not
here
to
watch
this
time
hermione
told
me
to
come
and
check
on
you
said
Ron
in
a
low
voice
helping
Harry
to
his
feet
she
says
your
Defenses
will
be
low
at
the
moment
after
Snapes
been
fiddling
around
with
your
mind
still
I
suppose
itll
help
in
the
long
run
wont
it
he
looked
doubtfully
at
Harry
as
he
helped
him
towards
his
bed
harry
nodded
without
any
conviction
and
slumped
back
on
his
pillows
aching
all
over
from
having
fallen
to
the
floor
so
often
that
evening
his
scar
still
prickling
painfully
he
could
not
help
feeling
that
his
first
foray
into
Occlumency
had
weakened
his
minds
resistance
rather
than
strengthening
it
and
he
wondered
with
a
feeling
of
great
trepidation
what
had
happened
to
make
Lord
Voldemort
the
happiest
he
had
been
in
fourteen
years
chapter
twenty-five
the
Beetle
at
Bay
harrys
question
was
answered
the
very
next
morning
when
Hermiones
DailyProphet
arrived
she
smoothed
it
out
gazed
for
a
moment
at
the
front
page
and
gave
a
yelp
that
caused
everyone
in
the
vicinity
to
stare
at
her
what
said
Harry
and
Ron
together
for
an
answer
she
spread
the
newspaper
on
the
table
in
front
of
them
and
pointed
at
ten
blackand
white
photographs
that
filled
the
whole
of
the
front
page
nine
showing
wizards
faces
and
the
tenth
a
witchs
some
of
the
people
in
the
photographs
were
silently
jeering
others
were
tapping
their
fingers
on
the
frame
of
their
pictures
looking
insolent
each
picture
was
captioned
with
a
name
and
the
crime
for
which
the
person
had
been
sent
to
Azkaban
antonin
Dolohov
read
the
legend
beneath
a
wizard
with
a
long
pale
twisted
face
who
was
sneering
up
at
Harry
convicted
of
the
brutal
murders
of
Gideon
and
Fabian
Prewett
augustus
Rookwood
said
the
caption
beneath
a
pockmarked
man
with
greasy
hair
who
was
leaning
against
the
edge
of
his
picture
looking
bored
convicted
of
leaking
Ministry
of
Magic
secrets
to
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
but
Harrys
eyes
were
drawn
to
the
picture
of
the
witch
her
face
had
leapt
out
at
him
the
moment
he
had
seen
the
page
she
had
long
dark
hair
that
looked
unkempt
and
straggly
in
the
picture
though
he
had
seen
it
sleek
thick
and
shining
she
glared
up
at
him
through
heavily
lidded
eyes
an
arrogant
disdainful
smile
playing
around
her
thin
mouth
like
Sirius
she
retained
vestiges
of
great
good
looks
but
something
perhaps
Azkaban
had
taken
most
of
her
beauty
bellatrix
Lestrange
convicted
of
the
torture
and
permanent
incapacitation
of
Frank
and
Alice
longbottom
hermione
nudged
Harry
and
pointed
at
the
headline
over
the
pictures
which
Harry
concentrating
on
Bellatrix
had
not
yet
read
mass
breakout
from
azkaban
ministry
fears
black
is
rallying
point
for
old
death
eaters
black
said
Harry
loudly
not
shh
whispered
Hermione
desperately
not
so
loud
just
read
it
the
Ministry
of
Magic
announced
late
last
night
that
there
has
been
a
mass
breakout
from
azkaban
speaking
to
reporters
in
his
private
office
Cornelius
Fudge
Minister
for
Magic
confirmed
that
ten
high-security
prisoners
escaped
in
the
early
hours
of
yesterday
evening
and
that
he
has
already
informed
the
Muggle
Prime
Minister
of
the
dangerous
nature
of
these
individuals
we
find
ourselves
most
unfortunately
in
the
same
position
we
were
two
and
a
half
years
ago
when
the
murderer
Sirius
Black
escaped
said
Fudge
last
night
nor
do
we
think
the
two
breakouts
are
unrelated
an
escape
of
this
magnitude
suggests
outside
help
and
we
must
remember
that
Black
as
the
first
person
ever
to
break
out
of
Azkaban
would
be
ideally
placed
to
help
others
follow
in
his
footsteps
we
think
it
likely
that
these
individuals
who
include
Blacks
cousin
Bellatrix
Lestrange
have
rallied
around
Black
as
their
leader
we
are
however
doing
all
we
can
to
round
up
the
criminals
and
we
beg
the
magical
community
to
remain
alert
and
cautious
on
no
account
should
any
of
these
individuals
be
approached
there
you
are
Harry
said
Ron
looking
awestruck
thats
why
he
was
happy
last
night
i
dont
believe
this
snarled
Harry
Fudge
is
blaming
the
breakout
on
Sirius
what
other
options
does
he
have
said
Hermione
bitterly
he
can
hardly
say
everyone
dumbledore
warned
me
this
might
happen
the
Azkaban
guards
have
joined
Lord
Voldemort
stop
whimpering
Ron
now
Voldemorts
worst
supporters
have
broken
out
too
i
mean
hes
spent
a
good
six
months
telling
everyone
you
and
Dumbledore
are
liars
hasnt
he
hermione
ripped
open
the
newspaper
and
began
to
read
the
report
inside
while
Harry
looked
around
the
Great
Hall
he
could
not
understand
why
his
fellow
students
were
not
looking
scared
or
at
least
discussing
the
terrible
piece
of
news
on
the
front
page
but
very
few
of
them
took
the
newspaper
every
day
like
Hermione
there
they
all
were
talking
about
homework
and
Quidditch
and
who
knew
what
other
rubbish
when
outside
these
walls
ten
more
Death
Eaters
had
swollen
voldemorts
ranks
he
glanced
up
at
the
staff
table
it
was
a
different
story
there
Dumbledore
and
Professor
mcGonagall
were
deep
in
conversation
both
looking
extremely
grave
professor
Sprout
had
the
Prophet
propped
against
a
bottle
of
ketchup
and
was
reading
the
front
page
with
such
concentration
that
she
was
not
noticing
the
gentle
drip
of
egg
yolk
falling
into
her
lap
from
her
stationary
spoon
meanwhile
at
the
far
end
of
the
table
Professor
Umbridge
was
tucking
into
a
bowl
of
porridge
for
once
her
pouchy
toads
eyes
were
not
sweeping
the
Great
Hall
looking
for
misbehaving
students
she
scowled
as
she
gulped
down
her
food
and
every
now
and
then
she
shot
a
malevolent
glance
up
the
table
to
where
Dumbledore
and
McGonagall
were
talking
so
intently
oh
my
said
Hermione
wonderingly
still
staring
at
the
newspaper
what
now
said
Harry
quickly
he
was
feeling
jumpy
its
horrible
said
Hermione
looking
shaken
she
fold
ed
back
page
ten
of
the
newspaper
and
handed
it
to
Harry
and
Ron
tragic
demise
of
ministry
of
magic
worker
st.
Mungos
Hospital
promised
a
full
inquiry
last
night
after
Ministry
of
Magic
worker
Broderick
Bode
was
discovered
dead
in
his
bed
strangled
by
a
potted-plant
healers
called
to
the
scene
were
unable
to
revive
mr.
Bode
who
had
been
injured
in
a
workplace
accident
some
weeks
prior
to
his
death
healer
Miriam
Strout
who
was
in
charge
of
mr.
Bodes
ward
at
the
time
of
the
incident
has
been
suspended
on
full
pay
and
was
unavailable
for
comment
yesterday
but
a
spokeswizard
for
the
hospital
said
in
a
statement
st.
Mungos
deeply
regrets
the
death
of
mr.
Bode
whose
health
was
improving
steadily
prior
to
this
tragic
accident
we
have
strict
guidelines
on
the
decorations
permitted
on
our
wards
but
it
appears
that
Healer
strout
busy
over
the
Christmas
period
overlooked
the
dangers
of
the
plant
on
mr.
Bodes
bedside
table
as
his
speech
and
mobility
improved
Healer
Strout
encouraged
mr.
Bode
to
look
after
the
plant
himself
unaware
that
it
was
not
an
innocent
Flitterbloom
but
a
cutting
of
Devils
snare
which
when
touched
by
the
convalescent
mr.
Bode
throttled
him
instantly
st.
Mungos
is
as
yet
unable
to
account
for
the
presence
of
the
plant
on
the
ward
and
asks
any
witch
or
wizard
with
information
to
come
forward
bode
said
Ron
bode
it
rings
a
bell
we
saw
him
Hermione
whispered
in
st.
Mungos
remember
he
was
in
the
bed
opposite
lockharts
just
lying
there
staring
at
the
ceiling
and
we
saw
the
Devils
Snare
arrive
she
the
healer
said
it
was
a
Christmas
present
harry
looked
back
at
the
story
a
feeling
of
horror
was
rising
like
bile
in
his
throat
how
come
we
didnt
recognize
Devils
Snare
weve
seen
it
before
we
couldve
stopped
this
from
happening
who
expects
Devils
Snare
to
turn
up
in
a
hospital
disguised
as
a
pot
plant
said
Ron
sharply
its
not
our
fault
whoever
sent
it
to
the
bloke
is
to
blame
they
must
be
a
real
prat
why
didnt
they
check
what
they
were
buying
oh
come
on
Ron
said
Hermione
shakily
i
dont
think
anyone
could
put
Devils
Snare
in
a
pot
and
not
realize
it
tries
to
kill
whoever
touches
it
this
this
was
murder
a
clever
murder
as
well
if
the
plant
was
sent
anonymously
hows
anyone
ever
going
to
find
out
who
did
it
harry
was
not
thinking
about
Devils
Snare
he
was
remembering
taking
the
lift
down
to
the
ninth
level
of
the
Ministry
on
the
day
of
his
hearing
and
the
sallow-faced
man
who
had
got
in
on
the
atrium
level
i
met
Bode
he
said
slowly
i
saw
him
at
the
Ministry
with
your
dad
rons
mouth
fell
open
ive
heard
Dad
talk
about
him
at
home
he
was
an
Unspeakable
he
worked
in
the
Department
of
Mysteries
they
looked
at
each
other
for
a
moment
then
Hermione
pulled
the
newspaper
back
towards
her
closed
it
glared
for
a
moment
at
the
pictures
of
the
ten
escaped
Death
Eaters
on
the
front
then
leapt
to
her
feet
where
are
you
going
said
Ron
startled
to
send
a
letter
said
Hermione
swinging
her
bag
on
to
her
shoulder
it
well
I
dont
know
whether
but
its
worth
trying
and
Im
the
only
one
who
can
i
hate
it
when
she
does
that
grumbled
Ron
as
he
and
Harry
got
up
from
the
table
and
made
their
own
slower
way
out
of
the
Great
Hall
would
it
kill
her
to
tell
us
what
shes
up
to
for
once
itd
take
her
about
ten
more
seconds
hey
Hagrid
hagrid
was
standing
beside
the
doors
into
the
Entrance
Hall
waiting
for
a
crowd
of
Ravenclaws
to
pass
he
was
still
as
heavily
bruised
as
he
had
been
on
the
day
he
had
come
back
from
his
mission
to
the
giants
and
there
was
a
new
cut
right
across
the
bridge
of
his
nose
all
righ
you
two
he
said
trying
to
muster
a
smile
but
managing
only
a
kind
of
pained
grimace
are
you
okay
Hagrid
asked
Harry
following
him
as
he
lumbered
after
the
Ravenclaws
fine
fine
said
Hagrid
with
a
feeble
assumption
of
airiness
he
waved
a
hand
and
narrowly
missed
concussing
a
frightened-looking
Professor
Vector
who
was
passing
jus
busy
yeh
know
usual
stuff
lessons
ter
prepare
couple
o
salamanders
got
scale
rot
an
Im
on
probation
he
mumbled
youre
on
probation
said
Ron
very
loudly
so
that
many
of
the
passing
students
looked
around
curiously
sorry
I
mean
youre
on
probation
he
whispered
yeah
said
Hagrid
sno
moren
I
expected
ter
tell
yeh
the
truth
yeh
migh
notve
picked
up
on
it
bu
that
inspection
didn
go
too
well
yeh
know
anyway
he
sighed
deeply
bes
go
an
rub
a
bit
more
chilli
powder
on
them
salamanders
or
their
tailsll
be
hangin
off
em
next
see
yeh
Harry
ron
he
trudged
away
out
of
the
front
doors
and
down
the
stone
steps
into
the
damp
grounds
harry
watched
him
go
wondering
how
much
more
bad
news
he
could
stand
the
fact
that
Hagrid
was
now
on
probation
became
common
knowledge
within
the
school
over
the
next
few
days
but
to
Harrys
indignation
hardly
anybody
appeared
to
be
upset
about
it
indeed
some
people
Draco
Malfoy
prominent
among
them
seemed
positively
gleeful
as
for
the
freakish
death
of
an
obscure
Department
of
Mysteries
employee
in
st.
Mungos
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
seemed
to
be
the
only
people
who
knew
or
cared
there
was
only
one
topic
of
conversation
in
the
corridors
now
the
ten
escaped
Death
Eaters
whose
story
had
finally
filtered
through
the
school
from
those
few
people
who
read
the
newspapers
rumors
were
flying
that
some
of
the
convicts
had
been
spotted
in
Hogsmeade
that
they
were
supposed
to
be
hiding
out
in
the
Shrieking
Shack
and
that
they
were
going
to
break
into
Hogwarts
just
as
Sirius
Black
had
once
done
those
who
came
from
wizarding
families
had
grown
up
hearing
the
names
of
these
Death
Eaters
spoken
with
almost
as
much
fear
as
Voldemorts
the
crimes
they
had
committed
during
the
days
of
Voldemorts
reign
of
terror
were
legendary
there
were
relatives
of
their
victims
among
the
hogwarts
students
who
now
found
themselves
the
unwilling
objects
of
a
gruesome
sort
of
reflected
fame
as
they
walked
the
corridors
Susan
Bones
whose
uncle
aunt
and
cousins
had
all
died
at
the
hands
of
one
of
the
ten
said
miserably
during
Herbology
that
she
now
had
a
good
idea
what
it
felt
like
to
be
Harry
and
I
dont
know
how
you
stand
it
its
horrible
she
said
bluntly
dumping
far
too
much
dragon
manure
on
her
tray
of
Screechsnap
seedlings
causing
them
to
wriggle
and
squeak
in
discomfort
it
was
true
that
Harry
was
the
subject
of
much
renewed
muttering
and
pointing
in
the
corridors
these
days
yet
he
thought
he
detected
a
slight
difference
in
the
tone
of
the
whisperers
voices
they
sounded
curious
rather
than
hostile
now
and
once
or
twice
he
was
sure
he
overheard
snatches
of
conversation
that
suggested
that
the
speakers
were
not
satisfied
with
the
Prophets
version
of
how
and
why
ten
Death
Eaters
had
managed
to
break
out
of
the
Azkaban
fortress
in
their
confusion
and
fear
these
doubters
now
seemed
to
be
turning
to
the
only
other
explanation
available
to
them
the
one
that
Harry
and
Dumbledore
had
been
expounding
since
the
previous
year
it
was
not
only
the
students
mood
that
had
changed
it
was
now
quite
common
to
come
across
two
or
three
teachers
conversing
in
low
urgent
whispers
in
the
corridors
breaking
off
their
conversations
the
moment
they
saw
students
approaching
they
obviously
cant
talk
freely
in
the
staff
room
any
more
said
Hermione
in
a
low
voice
as
she
Harry
and
Ron
passed
Professors
McGonagall
Flitwick
and
Sprout
huddled
together
outside
the
Charms
classroom
one
day
not
with
Umbridge
there
reckon
they
know
anything
new
said
Ron
gazing
back
over
his
shoulder
at
the
three
teachers
if
they
do
were
not
going
to
hear
about
it
are
we
said
Harry
angrily
not
after
Decree
what
number
are
we
on
now
for
new
notices
had
appeared
on
the
house
noticeboards
the
morning
after
news
of
the
Azkaban
breakout
by
order
of
the
high
inquisitorof
hogwarts
teachers
are
hereby
banned
from
giving
students
any
information
that
is
not
strictly
related
to
the
subjects
they
are
paid
to
teach
the
above
is
in
accordance
with
Educational
Decree
Number
twenty-six
signed
Dolores
Jane
Umbridge
High
Inquisitor
this
latest
Decree
had
been
the
subject
of
a
great
number
of
jokes
among
the
students
lee
jordan
had
pointed
out
to
Umbridge
that
by
the
terms
of
the
new
rule
she
was
not
allowed
to
tell
fred
and
George
off
for
playing
Exploding
Snap
in
the
back
of
the
class
exploding
Snaps
got
nothing
to
do
with
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
Professor
thats
not
information
relating
to
your
subject
when
Harry
next
saw
Lee
the
back
of
his
hand
was
bleeding
rather
badly
harry
recommended
essence
of
Murtlap
harry
had
thought
the
breakout
from
Azkaban
might
have
humbled
Umbridge
a
little
that
she
might
have
been
abashed
at
the
catastrophe
that
had
occurred
right
under
the
nose
of
her
beloved
fudge
it
seemed
however
to
have
only
intensified
her
furious
desire
to
bring
every
aspect
of
life
at
Hogwarts
under
her
personal
control
she
seemed
determined
at
the
very
least
to
achieve
a
sacking
before
long
and
the
only
question
was
whether
it
would
be
Professor
Trelawney
or
hagrid
who
went
first
every
single
Divination
and
Care
of
Magical
Creatures
lesson
was
now
conducted
in
the
presence
of
Umbridge
and
her
clipboard
she
lurked
by
the
fire
in
the
heavily
perfumed
tower
room
interrupting
Professor
Trelawneys
increasingly
hysterical
talks
with
difficult
questions
about
ornithomancy
and
heptomology
insisting
that
she
predicted
students
answers
before
they
gave
them
and
demanding
that
she
demonstrate
her
skill
at
the
crystal
ball
the
tea
leaves
and
the
rune
stones
in
turn
harry
thought
Professor
Trelawney
might
soon
crack
under
the
strain
several
times
he
passed
her
in
the
corridors
in
itself
a
very
unusual
occurrence
as
she
generally
remained
in
her
tower
room
muttering
wildly
to
herself
wringing
her
hands
and
shooting
terrified
glances
over
her
shoulder
and
all
the
while
giving
off
a
powerful
smell
of
cooking
sherry
if
he
had
not
been
so
worried
about
Hagrid
he
would
have
felt
sorry
for
her
but
if
one
of
them
was
to
be
ousted
from
their
job
there
could
be
only
one
choice
for
Harry
as
to
who
should
remain
unfortunately
Harry
could
not
see
that
Hagrid
was
putting
up
a
better
show
than
Trelawney
though
he
seemed
to
be
following
Hermiones
advice
and
had
shown
them
nothing
more
frightening
than
a
Crup
a
creature
indistinguishable
from
a
Jack
Russell
terrier
except
for
its
forked
tail
since
before
Christmas
he
too
seemed
to
have
lost
his
nerve
he
was
oddly
distracted
and
jumpy
during
lessons
losing
the
thread
of
what
he
was
saying
to
the
class
answering
questions
wrongly
and
all
the
time
glancing
anxiously
at
Umbridge
he
was
also
more
distant
with
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
than
he
had
ever
been
before
and
had
expressly
forbidden
them
to
visit
him
after
dark
if
she
catches
yeh
itll
be
all
of
our
necks
on
the
line
he
told
them
flatly
and
with
no
desire
to
do
anything
that
might
jeoparize
his
job
further
they
abstained
from
walking
down
to
his
hut
in
the
evenings
it
seemed
to
Harry
that
Umbridge
was
steadily
depriving
him
of
everything
that
made
his
life
at
hogwarts
worth
living
visits
to
Hagrids
house
letters
from
Sirius
his
Firebolt
and
Quidditch
he
took
his
revenge
the
only
way
he
could
by
redoubling
his
efforts
for
the
D
harry
was
pleased
to
see
that
all
of
them
even
Zacharias
Smith
had
been
spurred
on
to
work
harder
than
ever
by
the
news
that
ten
more
Death
Eaters
were
now
on
the
loose
but
in
nobody
was
this
improvement
more
pronounced
than
in
Neville
the
news
of
his
parents
attackers
escape
had
wrought
a
strange
and
even
slightly
alarming
change
in
him
he
had
not
once
mentioned
his
meeting
with
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
on
the
closed
ward
in
st.
Mungos
and
taking
their
lead
from
him
they
had
kept
quiet
about
it
too
nor
had
he
said
anything
on
the
subject
of
Bellatrix
and
her
fellow
torturers
escape
in
fact
Neville
barely
spoke
during
the
D
meetings
any
more
but
worked
relentlessly
on
every
new
jinx
and
counter-curse
Harry
taught
them
his
plump
face
screwed
up
in
concentration
apparently
indifferent
to
injuries
or
accidents
and
working
harder
than
anyone
else
in
the
room
he
was
improving
so
fast
it
was
quite
unnerving
and
when
Harry
taught
them
the
Shield
Charm
a
means
of
deflecting
minor
jinxes
so
that
they
rebounded
upon
the
attacker
only
Hermione
mastered
the
charm
faster
than
Neville
harry
would
have
given
a
great
deal
to
be
making
as
much
progress
at
Occlumency
as
Neville
was
making
during
the
D
a.
meetings
harrys
sessions
with
Snape
which
had
started
badly
enough
were
not
improving
on
the
contrary
Harry
felt
he
was
getting
worse
with
every
lesson
before
he
had
started
studying
Occlumency
his
scar
had
prickled
occasionally
usually
during
the
night
or
else
following
one
of
those
strange
flashes
of
Voldemorts
thoughts
or
mood
that
he
experienced
every
now
and
then
nowadays
however
his
scar
hardly
ever
stopped
prickling
and
he
often
felt
lurches
of
annoyance
or
cheerfulness
that
were
unrelated
to
what
was
happening
to
him
at
the
time
which
were
always
accompanied
by
a
particularly
painful
twinge
from
his
scar
he
had
the
horrible
impression
that
he
was
slowly
turning
into
a
kind
of
aerial
that
was
tuned
in
to
tiny
fluctuations
in
Voldemorts
mood
and
he
was
sure
he
could
date
this
increased
sensitivity
firmly
from
his
first
Occlumency
lesson
with
Snape
what
was
more
he
was
now
dreaming
about
walking
down
the
corridor
towards
the
entrance
to
the
Department
of
Mysteries
almost
every
night
dreams
which
always
culminated
in
him
standing
longingly
in
front
of
the
plain
black
door
maybe
its
a
bit
like
an
illness
said
Hermione
looking
concerned
when
Harry
confided
in
her
and
Ron
a
fever
or
something
it
has
to
get
worse
before
it
gets
better
the
lessons
with
Snape
are
making
it
worse
said
Harry
flatly
im
getting
sick
of
my
scar
hurting
and
Im
getting
bored
with
walking
down
that
corridor
every
night
he
rubbed
his
forehead
angrily
i
just
wish
the
door
would
open
Im
sick
of
standing
staring
at
it
thats
not
funny
said
Hermione
sharply
dumbledore
doesnt
want
you
to
have
dreams
about
that
corridor
at
all
or
he
wouldnt
have
asked
Snape
to
teach
you
Occlumency
youre
just
going
to
have
to
work
a
bit
harder
in
your
lessons
i
am
working
said
Harry
nettled
you
try
it
some
time
Snape
trying
to
get
inside
your
head
its
not
a
bundle
of
laughs
you
know
maybe
said
Ron
slowly
maybe
what
said
Hermione
rather
snappishly
maybe
its
not
Harrys
fault
he
cant
close
his
mind
said
Ron
darkly
what
do
you
mean
said
Hermione
well
maybe
Snape
isnt
really
trying
to
help
Harry
harry
and
Hermione
stared
at
him
ron
looked
darkly
and
meaningfully
from
one
to
the
other
maybe
he
said
again
in
a
lower
voice
hes
actually
trying
to
open
Harrys
mind
a
bit
wider
make
it
easier
for
You-Know
shut
up
Ron
said
Hermione
angrily
how
many
times
have
you
suspected
Snape
and
when
have
you
ever
been
right
dumbledore
trusts
him
he
works
for
the
Order
that
ought
to
be
enough
he
used
to
be
a
Death
Eater
said
Ron
stubbornly
and
weve
never
seen
proof
that
he
really
swapped
sides
dumbledore
trusts
him
Hermione
repeated
and
if
we
cant
trust
Dumbledore
we
cant
trust
anyone
with
so
much
to
worry
about
and
so
much
to
do
startling
amounts
of
homework
that
frequently
kept
the
fifth-years
working
until
past
midnight
secret
D
a.
sessions
and
regular
classes
with
snape
January
seemed
to
be
passing
alarmingly
fast
before
Harry
knew
it
February
had
arrived
bringing
with
it
wetter
and
warmer
weather
and
the
prospect
of
the
second
Hogsmeade
visit
of
the
year
harry
had
had
very
little
time
to
spare
for
conversations
with
Cho
since
they
had
agreed
to
visit
the
village
together
but
suddenly
found
himself
facing
a
Valentines
Day
spent
entirely
in
her
company
on
the
morning
of
the
fourteenth
he
dressed
particularly
carefully
he
and
Ron
arrived
at
breakfast
just
in
time
for
the
arrival
of
the
post
owls
hedwig
was
not
there
not
that
Harry
had
expected
her
but
Hermione
was
tugging
a
letter
from
the
beak
of
an
unfamiliar
brown
owl
as
they
sat
down
and
about
time
if
it
hadnt
come
today
she
said
eagerly
tearing
open
the
envelope
and
pulling
out
a
small
piece
of
parchment
her
eyes
sped
from
left
to
right
as
she
read
through
the
message
and
a
grimly
pleased
expression
spread
across
her
face
listen
Harry
she
said
looking
up
at
him
this
is
really
important
do
you
think
you
could
meet
me
in
the
Three
Broomsticks
around
midday
well
i
dunno
said
Harry
uncertainly
cho
might
be
expecting
me
to
spend
the
whole
day
with
her
we
never
said
what
we
were
going
to
do
well
bring
her
along
if
you
must
said
Hermione
urgently
but
will
you
come
well
all
right
but
why
i
havent
got
time
to
tell
you
now
Ive
got
to
answer
this
quickly
and
she
hurried
out
of
the
Great
Hall
the
letter
clutched
in
one
hand
and
a
piece
of
toast
in
the
other
are
you
coming
harry
asked
Ron
but
he
shook
his
head
looking
glum
i
cant
come
into
Hogsmeade
at
all
Angelina
wants
a
full
days
training
like
its
going
to
help
were
the
worst
team
Ive
ever
seen
you
should
see
Sloper
and
Kirke
theyre
pathetic
even
worse
than
I
am
he
heaved
a
great
sigh
i
dunno
why
Angelina
wont
just
let
me
resign
its
because
youre
good
when
youre
on
form
thats
why
said
Harry
irritably
he
found
it
very
hard
to
be
sympathetic
to
Rons
plight
when
he
himself
would
have
given
almost
anything
to
be
playing
in
the
forthcoming
match
against
Hufflepuff
ron
seemed
to
have
noticed
Harrys
tone
because
he
did
not
mention
Quidditch
again
during
breakfast
and
there
was
a
slight
frostiness
in
the
way
they
said
goodbye
to
each
other
shortly
afterwards
ron
departed
for
the
Quidditch
pitch
and
Harry
after
attempting
to
flatten
his
hair
while
staring
at
his
reflection
in
the
back
of
a
teaspoon
proceeded
alone
to
the
Entrance
Hall
to
meet
Cho
feeling
very
apprehensive
and
wondering
what
on
earth
they
were
going
to
talk
about
she
was
waiting
for
him
a
little
to
the
side
of
the
oak
front
doors
looking
very
pretty
with
her
hair
tied
back
in
a
long
pony-tail
harrys
feet
seemed
to
be
too
big
for
his
body
as
he
walked
towards
her
and
he
was
suddenly
horribly
aware
of
his
arms
and
how
stupid
they
must
look
swinging
at
his
sides
hi
said
Cho
slightly
breathlessly
hi
said
Harry
they
stared
at
each
other
for
a
moment
then
Harry
said
Well
er
shall
we
go
then
oh
yes
they
joined
the
queue
of
people
being
signed
out
by
Filch
occasionally
catching
each
others
eye
and
grinning
shiftily
but
not
talking
to
each
other
harry
was
relieved
when
they
reached
the
fresh
air
finding
it
easier
to
walk
along
in
silence
than
just
stand
about
looking
awkward
it
was
a
fresh
breezy
sort
of
a
day
and
as
they
passed
the
Quidditch
stadium
Harry
glimpsed
Ron
and
ginny
skimming
along
over
the
stands
and
felt
a
horrible
pang
that
he
was
not
up
there
with
them
you
really
miss
it
dont
you
said
Cho
he
looked
round
and
saw
her
watching
him
yeah
sighed
Harry
i
do
remember
the
first
time
we
played
against
each
other
in
the
third
year
she
asked
him
yeah
said
Harry
grinning
you
kept
blocking
me
and
Wood
told
you
not
to
be
a
gentleman
and
knock
me
off
my
broom
if
you
had
to
said
Cho
smiling
reminiscently
i
heard
he
got
taken
on
by
Pride
of
Portree
is
that
right
nah
it
was
Puddlemere
United
I
saw
him
at
the
World
Cup
last
year
oh
I
saw
you
there
too
remember
we
were
on
the
same
campsite
it
was
really
good
wasnt
it
the
subject
of
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
carried
them
all
the
way
down
the
drive
and
out
through
the
gates
harry
could
hardly
believe
how
easy
it
was
to
talk
to
her
no
more
difficult
in
fact
than
talking
to
Ron
and
Hermione
and
he
was
just
starting
to
feel
confident
and
cheerful
when
a
large
gang
of
Slytherin
girls
passed
them
including
Pansy
Parkinson
potter
and
Chang
screeched
Pansy
to
a
chorus
of
snide
giggles
urgh
Chang
I
dont
think
much
of
your
taste
at
least
Diggory
was
good-looking
the
girls
sped
up
talking
and
shrieking
in
a
pointed
fashion
with
many
exaggerated
glances
back
at
Harry
and
Cho
leaving
an
embarrassed
silence
in
their
wake
harry
could
think
of
nothing
else
to
say
about
Quidditch
and
Cho
slightly
flushed
was
watching
her
feet
so
where
dyou
want
to
go
harry
asked
as
they
entered
Hogsmeade
the
High
Street
was
full
of
students
ambling
up
and
down
peering
into
the
shop
windows
and
messing
about
together
on
the
pavements
oh
i
dont
mind
said
Cho
shrugging
urn
shall
we
just
have
a
look
in
the
shops
or
something
they
wandered
towards
Dervish
and
Banges
a
large
poster
had
been
stuck
up
in
the
window
and
a
few
Hogsmeaders
were
looking
at
it
they
moved
aside
when
Harry
and
Cho
approached
and
Harry
found
himself
staring
once
more
at
the
pictures
of
the
ten
escaped
Death
Eaters
the
poster
By
Order
of
the
Ministry
of
Magic
offered
a
thousand-Galleon
reward
to
any
witch
or
wizard
with
information
leading
to
the
recapture
of
any
of
the
convicts
pictured
its
funny
isnt
it
said
Cho
in
a
low
voice
gazing
up
at
the
pictures
of
the
Death
Eaters
remember
when
that
Sirius
Black
escaped
and
there
were
Dementors
all
over
Hogsmeade
looking
for
him
and
now
ten
Death
Eaters
are
on
the
loose
and
there
are
no
Dementors
anywhere
yeah
said
Harry
tearing
his
eyes
away
from
Bellatrix
Lestranges
face
to
glance
up
and
down
the
High
Street
yeah
that
is
weird
he
wasnt
sorry
that
there
were
no
Dementors
nearby
but
now
he
came
to
think
of
it
their
absence
was
highly
significant
they
had
not
only
let
the
Death
Eaters
escape
they
werent
bothering
to
look
for
them
it
looked
as
though
they
really
were
outside
Ministry
control
now
the
ten
escaped
Death
Eaters
were
staring
out
of
every
shop
window
he
and
Cho
passed
it
started
to
rain
as
they
passed
Scrivenshafts
cold
heavy
drops
of
water
kept
hitting
Harrys
face
and
the
back
of
his
neck
um
dyou
want
to
get
a
coffee
said
Cho
tentatively
as
the
rain
began
to
fall
more
heavily
yeah
all
right
said
Harry
looking
around
where
oh
theres
a
really
nice
place
just
up
here
havent
you
ever
been
to
Madam
Puddifoots
she
said
brightly
leading
him
up
a
side
road
and
into
a
small
teashop
that
Harry
had
never
noticed
before
it
was
a
cramped
steamy
little
place
where
everything
seemed
to
have
been
decorated
with
frills
or
bows
harry
was
reminded
unpleasantly
of
Umbridges
office
cute
isnt
it
said
Cho
happily
er
yeah
said
Harry
untruthfully
look
shes
decorated
it
for
Valentines
Day
said
Cho
indicating
a
number
of
golden
cherubs
that
were
hovering
over
each
of
the
small
circular
tables
occasionally
throwing
pink
confetti
over
the
occupants
aaah
they
sat
down
at
the
last
remaining
table
which
was
over
by
the
steamy
window
roger
Davies
the
Ravenclaw
Quidditch
Captain
was
sitting
about
a
foot
and
a
half
away
with
a
pretty
blonde
girl
they
were
holding
hands
the
sight
made
Harry
feel
uncomfortable
particularly
when
looking
around
the
teashop
he
saw
that
it
was
full
of
nothing
but
couples
all
of
them
holding
hands
perhaps
Cho
would
expect
him
to
hold
her
hand
what
can
I
get
you
mdears
said
Madam
Puddifoot
a
very
stout
woman
with
a
shiny
black
bun
squeezing
between
their
table
and
Roger
Daviess
with
great
difficulty
two
coffees
please
said
Cho
in
the
time
it
took
for
their
coffees
to
arrive
Roger
Davies
and
his
girlfriend
had
started
kissing
over
their
sugar
bowl
harry
wished
they
wouldnt
he
felt
that
Davies
was
setting
a
standard
with
which
Cho
would
soon
expect
him
to
compete
he
felt
his
face
growing
hot
and
tried
staring
out
of
the
window
but
it
was
so
steamed
up
he
couldnt
see
the
street
outside
to
postpone
the
moment
when
he
would
have
to
look
at
Cho
he
stared
up
at
the
ceiling
as
though
examining
the
paintwork
and
received
a
handful
of
confetti
in
the
face
from
their
hovering
cherub
after
a
few
more
painful
minutes
Cho
mentioned
Umbridge
harry
seized
on
the
subject
with
relief
and
they
passed
a
few
happy
moments
abusing
her
but
the
subject
had
already
been
so
thoroughly
canvassed
during
D
a.
meetings
it
did
not
last
very
long
silence
fell
again
harry
wasvery
conscious
of
the
slurping
noises
coming
from
the
table
next
door
and
cast
wildly
around
forsomething
else
to
say
er
listen
dyou
want
to
come
with
me
to
the
Three
Broomsticks
at
lunchtime
im
meeting
hermione
Granger
there
cho
raised
her
eyebrows
youre
meeting
Hermione
Granger
today
yeah
well
she
asked
me
to
so
I
thought
I
would
dyou
want
to
come
with
me
she
said
it
wouldnt
matter
if
you
did
oh
well
that
was
nice
of
her
but
Cho
did
not
sound
as
though
she
thought
it
was
nice
at
all
on
the
contrary
her
tone
was
cold
and
all
of
a
sudden
she
looked
rather
forbidding
a
few
more
minutes
passed
in
total
silence
Harry
drinking
his
coffee
so
fast
that
he
would
soon
need
a
fresh
cup
beside
them
Roger
Davies
and
his
girlfriend
seemed
glued
together
at
the
lips
chos
hand
was
lying
on
the
table
beside
her
coffee
and
Harry
was
feeling
a
mounting
pressure
to
take
hold
of
it
just
do
it
he
told
himself
as
a
fount
of
mingled
panic
and
excitement
surged
up
inside
his
chest
just
reach
out
and
grab
it
amazing
how
much
more
difficult
it
was
to
extend
his
arm
twelve
inches
and
touch
her
hand
than
it
was
to
snatch
a
speeding
Snitch
from
midair
but
just
as
he
moved
his
hand
forwards
Cho
took
hers
off
the
table
she
was
now
watching
roger
Davies
kissing
his
girlfriend
with
a
mildly
interested
expression
he
asked
me
out
you
know
she
said
in
a
quiet
voice
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
roger
i
turned
him
down
though
harry
who
had
grabbed
the
sugar
bowl
to
excuse
his
sudden
lunging
movement
across
the
table
could
not
think
why
she
was
telling
him
this
if
she
wished
she
were
sitting
at
the
next
table
being
heartily
kissed
by
Roger
Davies
why
had
she
agreed
to
come
out
with
him
he
said
nothing
their
cherub
threw
another
handful
of
confetti
over
them
some
of
it
landed
in
the
last
cold
dregs
of
coffee
Harry
had
been
about
to
drink
i
came
in
here
with
Cedric
last
year
said
Cho
in
the
second
or
so
it
took
for
him
to
take
in
what
she
had
said
Harrys
insides
had
become
glacial
he
could
not
believe
she
wanted
to
talk
about
Cedric
now
while
kissing
couples
surrounded
them
and
a
cherub
floated
over
their
heads
chos
voice
was
rather
higher
when
she
spoke
again
ive
been
meaning
to
ask
you
for
ages
did
Cedric
did
he
m
m
mention
me
at
all
before
he
died
this
was
the
very
last
subject
on
earth
Harry
wanted
to
discuss
and
least
of
all
with
Cho
well
no
he
said
quietly
there
there
wasnt
time
for
him
to
say
anything
erm
so
dyou
dyou
get
to
see
a
lot
of
Quidditch
in
the
holidays
you
support
the
Tornados
right
his
voice
sounded
falsely
bright
and
cheery
to
his
horror
he
saw
that
her
eyes
were
swimming
with
tears
again
just
as
they
had
been
after
the
last
D
a.
meeting
before
Christmas
look
he
said
desperately
leaning
in
so
that
nob
ody
else
could
overhear
lets
not
talk
about
cedric
right
now
lets
talk
about
something
else
but
this
apparently
was
quite
the
wrong
thing
to
say
i
thought
she
said
tears
spattering
down
on
to
the
table
I
thought
youd
u
u
understand
i
need
to
talk
about
it
surely
you
n
need
to
talk
about
it
t
too
i
mean
you
saw
it
happen
d
didnt
you
everything
was
going
nightmarishly
wrong
Roger
Daviess
girlfriend
had
even
unglued
herself
to
look
round
at
Cho
crying
well
I
have
talked
about
it
Harry
said
in
a
whisper
to
Ron
and
Hermione
but
oh
youll
talk
to
Hermione
Granger
she
said
shrilly
her
face
now
shining
with
tears
several
more
kissing
couples
broke
apart
to
stare
but
you
wont
talk
to
me
p
perhaps
it
would
be
best
if
we
just
just
p
paid
and
you
went
and
met
up
with
Hermione
G
Granger
like
you
obviously
want
to
harry
stared
at
her
utterly
bewildered
as
she
seized
a
frilly
napkin
and
dabbed
at
her
shining
face
with
it
cho
he
said
weakly
wishing
Roger
would
seize
his
girlfriend
and
start
kissing
her
again
to
stop
her
goggling
at
him
and
Cho
go
on
leave
she
said
now
crying
into
the
napkin
i
dont
know
why
you
asked
me
out
in
the
first
place
if
youre
going
to
make
arrangements
to
meet
other
girls
right
after
me
how
many
are
you
meeting
after
Hermione
its
not
like
that
said
Harry
and
he
was
so
relieved
at
finally
understanding
what
she
was
annoyed
about
that
he
laughed
which
he
realized
a
split
second
too
late
was
also
a
mistake
cho
sprang
to
her
feet
the
whole
tearoom
was
quiet
and
everybody
was
watching
them
now
ill
see
you
around
Harry
she
said
dramatically
and
hiccoughing
slightly
she
dashed
to
the
door
wrenched
it
open
and
hurried
off
into
the
pouring
rain
cho
harry
called
after
her
but
the
door
had
already
swung
shut
behind
her
with
a
tuneful
tinkle
there
was
total
silence
within
the
teashop
every
eye
was
on
Harry
he
threw
a
Galleon
down
on
to
the
table
shook
pink
confetti
out
of
his
hair
and
followed
Cho
out
of
the
door
it
was
raining
hard
now
and
she
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
he
simply
did
not
understand
what
had
happened
half
an
hour
ago
they
had
been
getting
along
fine
women
he
muttered
angrily
sloshing
down
the
rain-washed
street
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
what
did
she
want
to
talk
about
Cedric
for
anyway
why
does
she
always
want
to
drag
up
a
subject
that
makes
her
act
like
a
human
hosepipe
he
turned
right
and
broke
into
a
splashy
run
and
within
minutes
he
was
turning
into
the
doorway
of
the
Three
Broomsticks
he
knew
he
was
too
early
to
meet
Hermione
but
he
thought
it
likely
there
would
be
someone
in
here
with
whom
he
could
spend
the
intervening
time
he
shook
his
wet
hair
out
of
his
eyes
and
looked
around
hagrid
was
sitting
alone
in
a
corner
looking
morose
hi
Hagrid
he
said
when
he
had
squeezed
through
the
crammed
tables
and
pulled
up
a
chair
beside
him
hagrid
jumped
and
looked
down
at
Harry
as
though
he
barely
recognized
him
harry
saw
that
he
had
two
fresh
cuts
on
his
face
and
several
new
bruises
oh
its
yeh
Harry
said
Hagrid
yeh
all
right
yeah
Im
fine
lied
Harry
but
next
to
this
battered
and
mournful-looking
Hagrid
he
felt
he
didnt
really
have
much
to
complain
about
er
are
you
okay
me
said
Hagrid
oh
yeah
Im
grand
Harry
grand
he
gazed
into
the
depths
of
his
pewter
tankard
which
was
the
size
of
a
large
bucket
and
sighed
harry
didnt
know
what
to
say
to
him
they
sat
side
by
side
in
silence
for
a
moment
then
hagrid
said
abruptly
In
the
same
boat
yeh
an
me
aren
we
Arry
er
said
Harry
yeah
ive
said
it
before
both
outsiders
like
said
Hagrid
nodding
wisely
an
both
orphans
yeah
both
orphans
he
took
a
great
swig
from
his
tankard
makes
a
diffrence
havin
a
decent
family
he
said
me
dad
was
decent
an
your
mum
an
dad

decent
if
theyd
lived
life
woulda
bin
diffrent
eh
yeah
i
spose
said
Harry
cautiously
hagrid
seemed
to
be
in
a
very
strange
mood
family
said
Hagrid
gloomily
whatever
yeh
say
bloods
important
and
he
wiped
a
trickle
of
it
out
of
his
eye
hagrid
said
Harry
unable
to
stop
himself
where
are
you
getting
all
these
injuries
eh
said
Hagrid
looking
startled
wha
injuries
all
those
said
Harry
pointing
at
Hagrids
face
oh
thas
jus
normal
bumps
an
bruises
Harry
said
Hagrid
dismissively
I
got
a
rough
job
he
drained
his
tankard
set
it
back
on
the
table
and
got
to
his
feet
ill
be
seein
yeh
Harry
take
care
now
and
he
lumbered
out
of
the
pub
looking
wretched
and
disappeared
into
the
torrential
rain
harry
watched
him
go
feeling
miserable
hagrid
was
unhappy
and
he
was
hiding
something
but
he
seemed
determined
not
to
accept
help
what
was
going
on
but
before
Harry
could
think
about
it
any
further
he
heard
a
voice
calling
his
name
harry
harry
over
here
hermione
was
waving
at
him
from
the
other
side
of
the
room
he
got
up
and
made
his
way
towards
her
through
the
crowded
pub
he
was
still
a
few
tables
away
when
he
realized
that
hermione
was
not
alone
she
was
sitting
at
a
table
with
the
unlikeliest
pair
of
drinking
mates
he
could
ever
have
imagined
Luna
Lovegood
and
none
other
than
Rita
Skeeter
ex-journalist
on
the
Daily
Prophet
and
one
of
Hermiones
least
favorite
people
in
the
world
youre
early
said
Hermione
moving
along
to
give
him
room
to
sit
down
i
thought
you
were
with
Cho
I
wasnt
expecting
you
for
another
hour
at
least
cho
said
Rita
at
once
twisting
round
in
her
seat
to
stare
avidly
at
Harry
a
girl
she
snatched
up
her
crocodile-skin
handbag
and
groped
within
it
its
none
of
your
business
if
Harrys
been
with
a
h
undred
girls
Hermione
told
Rita
coolly
so
you
can
put
that
away
right
now
rita
had
been
on
the
point
of
withdrawing
an
acid-green
quill
from
her
bag
looking
as
though
she
had
been
forced
to
swallow
Stinksap
she
snapped
her
bag
shut
again
what
are
you
up
to
harry
asked
sitting
down
and
staring
from
Rita
to
Luna
to
Hermione
little
Miss
Perfect
was
just
about
to
tell
me
when
you
arrived
said
Rita
taking
a
large
slurp
of
her
drink
i
suppose
Im
allowed
to
talk
to
him
am
I
she
shot
at
Hermione
yes
I
suppose
you
are
said
Hermione
coldly
unemployment
did
not
suit
Rita
the
hair
that
had
once
been
set
in
elaborate
curls
now
hung
lank
and
unkempt
around
her
face
the
scarlet
paint
on
her
two-inch
talons
was
chipped
and
there
were
a
couple
of
false
jewels
missing
from
her
winged
glasses
she
took
another
great
gulp
of
her
drink
and
said
out
of
the
corner
of
her
mouth
Pretty
girl
is
she
Harry
one
more
word
about
Harrys
love
life
and
the
deals
off
and
thats
a
promise
said
Hermione
irritably
what
deal
said
Rita
wiping
her
mouth
on
the
back
of
her
hand
you
havent
mentioned
a
deal
yet
Miss
Prissy
you
just
told
me
to
turn
up
oh
one
of
these
days
she
took
a
deep
shuddering
breath
yes
yes
one
of
these
days
youll
write
more
horrible
stories
about
Harry
and
me
said
hermione
indifferently
find
someone
who
cares
why
dont
you
theyve
run
plenty
of
horrible
stories
about
Harry
this
year
without
my
help
said
Rita
shooting
a
sideways
look
at
him
over
the
top
of
her
glass
and
adding
in
a
rough
whisper
How
has
that
made
you
feel
Harry
betrayed
distraught
misunderstood
he
feels
angry
of
course
said
Hermione
in
a
hard
clear
voice
because
hes
told
the
Minister
for
Magic
the
truth
and
the
Ministers
too
much
of
an
idiot
to
believe
him
so
you
actually
stick
to
it
do
you
that
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
is
back
said
Rita
lowering
her
glass
and
subjecting
Harry
to
a
piercing
stare
while
her
finger
strayed
longingly
to
the
clasp
of
the
crocodile
bag
you
stand
by
all
this
garbage
Dumbledores
been
telling
everybody
about
You-Know-Who
returning
and
you
being
the
sole
witness
i
wasnt
the
sole
witness
snarled
Harry
there
were
a
dozen-odd
Death
Eaters
there
as
well
want
their
names
id
love
them
breathed
Rita
now
fumbling
in
her
bag
once
more
and
gazing
at
him
as
though
he
was
the
most
beautiful
thing
she
had
ever
seen
a
great
bold
headline
PotterAccuses
sub-heading
Harry
Potter
Names
Death
Eaters
Still
Among
us.
And
then
beneath
a
nice
big
photograph
of
you
Disturbed
teenage
survivor
of
You-Know-Whosattack
Harry
Potter
caused
outrage
yesterday
by
accusing
respectable
and
prominent
members
of
the
wizarding
community
of
being
Death
Eaters
the
Quick-Quotes
Quill
was
actually
in
her
hand
and
halfway
to
her
mouth
when
the
rapturous
expression
on
her
face
died
but
of
course
she
said
lowering
the
quill
and
looking
daggers
at
Hermione
Little
Miss
perfect
wouldnt
want
that
story
out
there
would
she
as
a
matter
of
fact
said
Hermione
sweetly
thats
exactly
what
Little
Miss
Perfect
does
want
rita
stared
at
her
so
did
Harry
luna
on
the
other
hand
sang
Weasley
is
our
King
dreamily
under
her
breath
and
stirred
her
drink
with
a
cocktail
onion
on
a
stick
you
want
me
to
report
what
he
says
about
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
rita
asked
Hermione
in
a
hushed
voice
yes
I
do
said
Hermione
the
true
story
all
the
facts
exactly
as
Harry
reports
them
hell
give
you
all
the
details
hell
tell
you
the
names
of
the
undiscovered
Death
Eaters
he
saw
there
hell
tell
you
what
Voldemort
looks
like
now
oh
get
a
grip
on
yourself
she
added
contemptuously
throwing
a
napkin
across
the
table
for
at
the
sound
of
Voldemorts
name
Rita
had
jumped
so
badly
she
had
slopped
half
her
glass
of
Firewhisky
down
herself
rita
blotted
the
front
of
her
grubby
raincoat
still
staring
at
Hermione
then
she
said
baldly
the
Prophet
wouldnt
print
it
in
case
you
havent
noticed
nobody
believes
his
cock-and-bull
story
everyone
thinks
hes
delusional
now
if
you
let
me
write
the
story
from
that
angle
we
dont
need
another
story
about
how
Harrys
lost
his
marbles
said
Hermione
angrily
weve
had
plenty
of
those
already
thank
you
i
want
him
given
the
opportunity
to
tell
the
truth
theres
no
market
for
a
story
like
that
said
Rita
coldly
you
mean
the
Prophet
wont
print
it
because
Fudge
wont
let
them
said
Hermione
irritably
rita
gave
Hermione
a
long
hard
look
then
leaning
forwards
across
the
table
towards
her
she
said
in
a
businesslike
tone
All
right
Fudge
is
leaning
on
the
Prophet
but
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
they
wont
print
a
story
that
shows
Harry
in
a
good
light
nobody
wants
to
read
it
its
against
the
public
mood
this
last
Azkaban
breakout
has
got
people
quite
worried
enough
people
just
dont
want
to
believe
You-Know-Whos
back
so
the
Daily
Prophet
exists
to
tell
people
what
they
want
to
hear
does
it
said
Hermione
scathingly
rita
sat
up
straight
again
her
eyebrows
raised
and
drained
her
glass
of
Firewhisky
the
Prophet
exists
to
sell
itself
you
silly
girl
she
said
coldly
my
dad
thinks
its
an
awful
paper
said
Luna
chipping
into
the
conversation
unexpectedly
sucking
on
her
cocktail
onion
she
gazed
at
Rita
with
her
enormous
protuberant
slightly
mad
eyes
he
publishes
important
stories
he
thinks
the
public
needs
to
know
he
doesnt
care
about
making
money
rita
looked
disparagingly
at
Luna
im
guessing
your
father
runs
some
stupid
little
village
newsletter
she
said
probably
Twenty
Five
Ways
to
Mingle
With
Muggles
and
the
dates
of
the
next
Bring
and
Fly
Sale
no
said
Luna
dipping
her
onion
back
into
her
Gillywater
hes
the
editor
of
The
Quibbler
rita
snorted
so
loudly
that
people
at
a
nearby
table
looked
round
in
alarm
important
stories
he
thinks
the
public
needs
to
know
eh
she
said
witheringly
i
could
manure
my
garden
with
the
contents
of
that
rag
well
this
is
your
chance
to
raise
the
tone
of
it
a
bit
isnt
it
said
Hermione
pleasantly
luna
says
her
fathers
quite
happy
to
take
Harrys
interview
thats
wholl
be
publishing
it
rita
stared
at
them
both
for
a
moment
then
let
out
a
great
whoop
of
laughter
the
Quibbler
she
said
cackling
you
think
people
will
take
him
seriously
if
hes
published
in
The
Quibbler
some
people
wont
said
Hermione
in
a
level
voice
but
the
Daily
Prophets
version
of
the
azkaban
breakout
had
some
gaping
holes
in
it
i
think
a
lot
of
people
will
be
wondering
whether
there
isnt
a
better
explanation
of
what
happened
and
if
theres
an
alternative
story
available
even
if
it
is
published
in
a
she
glanced
sideways
at
Luna
in
a
well
an
unusual
magazine
I
think
they
might
be
rather
keen
to
read
it
rita
didnt
say
anything
for
a
while
but
eyed
Hermione
shrewdly
her
head
a
little
to
one
side
all
right
lets
say
for
a
moment
Ill
do
it
she
said
abruptly
what
kind
of
fee
am
I
going
to
get
i
dont
think
Daddy
exactly
pays
people
to
write
f
or
the
magazine
said
Luna
dreamily
they
do
it
because
its
an
honor
and
of
course
to
see
their
names
in
print
rita
Skeeter
looked
as
though
the
taste
of
Stinksap
was
strong
in
her
mouth
again
as
she
rounded
on
Hermione
im
supposed
to
do
this
for
free
well
yes
said
Hermione
calmly
taking
a
sip
of
her
drink
otherwise
as
you
very
well
know
i
will
inform
the
authorities
that
you
are
an
unregistered
Animagus
of
course
the
Prophet
might
give
you
rather
a
lot
for
an
insiders
account
of
life
in
Azkaban
rita
looked
as
though
she
would
have
liked
nothing
better
than
to
seize
the
paper
umbrella
sticking
out
of
Hermiones
drink
and
thrust
it
up
her
nose
i
dont
suppose
Ive
got
any
choice
have
I
said
Rita
her
voice
shaking
slightly
she
opened
her
crocodile
bag
once
more
withdrew
a
piece
of
parchment
and
raised
her
Quick-Quotes
Quill
daddy
will
be
pleased
said
Luna
brightly
a
muscle
twitched
in
Ritas
jaw
okay
Harry
said
Hermione
turning
to
him
ready
to
tell
the
public
the
truth
i
suppose
said
Harry
watching
Rita
balancing
the
Quick-Quotes
Quill
at
the
ready
on
the
parchment
between
them
fire
away
then
Rita
said
Hermione
serenely
fishing
a
cherry
out
from
the
bottom
of
her
glass
chapter
twenty-six
seen
and
Unforeseen
luna
said
vaguely
that
she
did
not
know
how
soon
Ritas
interview
with
Harry
would
appear
in
The
Quibbler
that
her
father
was
expecting
a
lovely
long
article
on
recent
sightings
of
crumple-Horned
Snorkacks
and
of
course
thatll
be
a
very
important
story
so
Harrys
might
have
to
wait
for
the
following
issue
said
Luna
harry
had
not
found
it
an
easy
experience
to
talk
about
the
night
when
Voldemort
had
returned
rita
had
pressed
him
for
every
little
detail
and
he
had
given
her
everything
he
could
remember
knowing
that
this
was
his
one
big
opportunity
to
tell
the
world
the
truth
he
wondered
how
people
would
react
to
the
story
he
guessed
that
it
would
confirm
a
lot
of
people
in
the
view
that
he
was
completely
insane
not
least
because
his
story
would
be
appearing
alongside
utter
rubbish
about
Crumple-Horned
Snorkacks
but
the
breakout
of
Bellatrix
Lestrange
and
her
fellow
Death
eaters
had
given
Harry
a
burning
desire
to
dosomething
whether
or
not
it
worked
cant
wait
to
see
what
Umbridge
thinks
of
you
going
public
said
Dean
sounding
awestruck
at
dinner
on
Monday
night
seamus
was
shoveling
down
large
amounts
of
chicken
and
ham
pie
on
deans
other
side
but
Harry
knew
he
was
listening
its
the
right
thing
to
do
Harry
said
Neville
who
was
sitting
opposite
him
he
was
rather
pale
but
went
on
in
a
low
voice
It
must
have
been
tough
talking
about
it
was
it
yeah
mumbled
Harry
but
people
have
got
to
know
what
Voldemorts
capable
of
havent
they
thats
right
said
Neville
nodding
and
his
Death
Eaters
too
people
should
know
neville
left
his
sentence
hanging
and
returned
to
his
baked
potato
seamus
looked
up
but
when
he
caught
Harrys
eye
he
looked
quickly
back
at
his
plate
again
after
a
while
Dean
Seamus
and
neville
departed
for
the
common
room
leaving
Harry
and
Hermione
at
the
table
waiting
for
ron
who
had
not
yet
had
dinner
because
of
Quidditch
practice
cho
Chang
walked
into
the
Hall
with
her
friend
Marietta
harrys
stomach
gave
an
unpleasant
lurch
but
she
did
not
look
over
at
the
Gryffindor
table
and
sat
down
with
her
back
to
him
oh
I
forgot
to
ask
you
said
Hermione
brightly
glancing
over
at
the
Ravenclaw
table
what
happened
on
your
date
with
Cho
how
come
you
were
back
so
early
er
well
it
was
said
Harry
pulling
a
dish
of
rhubarb
crumble
towards
him
and
helping
himself
to
seconds
a
complete
fiasco
now
you
mention
it
and
he
told
her
what
had
happened
in
Madam
Puddifoots
teashop
so
then
he
finished
several
minutes
later
as
the
final
bit
of
crumble
disappeared
she
jumps
up
right
and
says
Ill
see
you
around
Harry
an
d
runs
out
of
the
place
he
put
down
his
spoon
and
looked
at
Hermione
i
mean
what
was
all
that
about
what
was
going
on
hermione
glanced
over
at
the
back
of
Chos
head
and
sighed
oh
Harry
she
said
sadly
well
Im
sorry
but
you
were
a
bit
tactless
me
tactless
said
Harry
outraged
one
minute
we
were
getting
on
fine
next
minute
she
was
telling
me
that
Roger
Davies
asked
her
out
and
how
she
used
to
go
and
snog
Cedric
in
that
stupid
teashop
how
was
I
supposed
to
feel
about
that
well
you
see
said
Hermione
with
the
patient
air
of
someone
explaining
that
one
plus
one
equals
two
to
an
over-emotional
toddler
you
shouldnt
have
told
her
that
you
wanted
to
meet
me
halfway
through
your
date
but
but
spluttered
Harry
but
you
told
me
to
meet
you
at
twelve
and
to
bring
her
along
how
was
I
supposed
to
do
that
without
telling
her
you
should
have
told
her
differently
said
Hermione
still
with
that
maddeningly
patient
air
you
should
have
said
it
was
really
annoying
but
Id
made
you
promise
to
come
along
to
the
three
Broomsticks
and
you
really
didnt
want
to
go
youd
much
rather
spend
the
whole
day
with
her
but
unfortunately
you
thought
you
really
ought
to
meet
me
and
would
she
please
please
come
along
with
you
and
hopefully
youd
be
able
to
get
away
more
quickly
and
it
might
have
been
a
good
idea
to
mention
how
ugly
you
think
I
am
too
Hermione
added
as
an
afterthought
but
I
dont
think
youre
ugly
said
Harry
bemused
hermione
laughed
harry
youre
worse
than
Ron
well
no
youre
not
she
sighed
as
Ron
himself
came
stumping
into
the
Hall
splattered
with
mud
and
looking
grumpy
look
you
upset
Cho
when
you
said
you
were
going
to
meet
me
so
she
tried
to
make
you
jealous
it
was
her
way
of
trying
to
find
out
how
much
you
liked
her
is
that
what
she
was
doing
said
Harry
as
Ron
dropped
on
to
the
bench
opposite
them
and
pulled
every
dish
within
reach
towards
him
well
wouldnt
it
have
been
easier
if
shed
just
asked
me
whether
I
liked
her
better
than
you
girls
dont
often
ask
questions
like
that
said
Hermione
well
they
should
said
Harry
forcefully
then
I
couldve
just
told
her
I
fancy
her
and
she
wouldnt
have
had
to
get
herself
all
worked
up
again
about
Cedric
dying
im
not
saying
what
she
did
was
sensible
said
Hermione
as
Ginny
joined
them
just
as
muddy
as
Ron
and
looking
equally
disgruntled
im
just
trying
to
make
you
see
how
she
was
feeling
at
the
time
you
should
write
a
book
Ron
told
Hermione
as
he
cut
up
his
potatoes
translating
mad
things
girls
do
so
boys
can
understand
them
yeah
said
Harry
fervently
looking
over
at
the
Ravenclaw
table
cho
had
just
got
up
and
still
not
looking
at
him
she
left
the
Great
Hall
feeling
rather
depressed
he
looked
back
at
Ron
and
ginny
so
how
was
Quidditch
practice
it
was
a
nightmare
said
Ron
in
a
surly
voice
oh
come
on
said
Hermione
looking
at
Ginny
Im
sure
it
wasnt
that
yes
it
was
said
Ginny
it
was
appalling
angelina
was
nearly
in
tears
by
the
end
of
it
ron
and
Ginny
went
off
for
baths
after
dinner
Harry
and
Hermione
returned
to
the
busy
gryffindor
common
room
and
their
usual
pile
of
homework
harry
had
been
struggling
with
a
new
star-chart
for
Astronomy
for
half
an
hour
when
Fred
and
George
turned
up
ron
and
Ginny
not
here
asked
Fred
looking
around
as
he
pulled
up
a
chair
and
when
Harry
shook
his
head
he
said
Good
we
were
watching
their
practice
theyre
going
to
be
slaughtered
theyre
complete
rubbish
without
us
come
on
Ginnys
not
bad
said
George
fairly
sitting
down
next
to
Fred
actually
I
dunno
how
she
got
so
good
seeing
how
we
never
let
her
play
with
us
shes
been
breaking
into
your
broom
shed
in
the
garden
since
the
age
of
six
and
taking
each
of
your
brooms
out
in
turn
when
you
werent
looking
said
Hermione
from
behind
her
tottering
pile
of
Ancient
Rune
books
oh
said
George
looking
mildly
impressed
well
thatd
explain
it
has
Ron
saved
a
goal
yet
asked
Hermione
peering
over
the
top
of
Magical
Hieroglyphs
and
logograms
well
he
can
do
it
if
he
doesnt
think
anyones
watching
him
said
Fred
rolling
his
eyes
so
all
we
have
to
do
is
ask
the
crowd
to
turn
their
backs
and
talk
among
themselves
every
time
the
quaffle
goes
up
his
end
on
Saturday
he
got
up
again
and
moved
restlessly
to
the
window
staring
out
across
the
dark
grounds
you
know
Quidditch
was
about
the
only
thing
in
this
place
worth
staying
for
hermione
cast
him
a
stern
look
youve
got
exams
coming
told
you
already
were
not
fussed
about
NEWTs
said
Fred
the
Snackboxes
are
ready
to
roll
we
found
out
how
to
get
rid
of
those
boils
just
a
couple
of
drops
of
Murtlap
essence
sorts
them
Lee
put
us
on
to
it
george
yawned
widely
and
looked
out
disconsolately
at
the
cloudy
night
sky
i
dunno
if
I
even
want
to
watch
this
match
if
Zacharias
Smith
beats
us
I
might
have
to
kill
myself
kill
him
more
like
said
Fred
firmly
thats
the
trouble
with
Quidditch
said
Hermione
absent-mindedly
once
again
bent
over
her
runes
translation
it
creates
all
this
bad
feeling
and
tension
between
the
houses
she
looked
up
to
find
her
copy
of
Spellmans
Syllabary
and
caught
Fred
George
and
Harry
all
staring
at
her
with
expressions
of
mingled
disgust
and
incredulity
on
their
faces
well
it
does
she
said
impatiently
its
only
a
game
isnt
it
hermione
said
Harry
shaking
his
head
youre
good
on
feelings
and
stuff
but
you
just
dont
understand
about
Quidditch
maybe
not
she
said
darkly
returning
to
her
translation
but
at
least
my
happiness
doesnt
depend
on
Rons
goalkeeping
ability
and
though
Harry
would
rather
have
jumped
off
the
Astronomy
Tower
than
admit
it
to
her
by
the
time
he
had
watched
the
game
the
following
Saturday
he
would
have
given
any
number
of
galleons
not
to
care
about
Quidditch
either
the
very
best
thing
you
could
say
about
the
match
was
that
it
was
short
the
Gryffindor
spectators
had
to
endure
only
twenty-two
minutes
of
agony
it
was
hard
to
say
what
the
worst
thing
was
Harry
thought
it
was
a
close-run
contest
between
Rons
fourteenth
failed
save
Sloper
missing
the
Bludger
but
hitting
Angelina
in
the
mouth
with
his
bat
and
Kirke
shrieking
and
falling
backwards
off
his
broom
when
Zacharias
Smith
zoomed
at
him
carrying
the
Quaffle
the
miracle
was
that
Gryffindor
only
lost
by
ten
points
Ginny
managed
to
snatch
the
Snitch
from
right
under
Hufflepuff
Seeker
Summerbys
nose
so
that
the
final
score
was
two
hundred
and
forty
versus
two
hundred
and
thirty
good
catch
Harry
told
Ginny
back
in
the
common
room
where
the
atmosphere
resembled
that
of
a
particularly
dismal
funeral
i
was
lucky
she
shrugged
it
wasnt
a
very
fast
Snitch
and
Summerbys
got
a
cold
he
sneezed
and
closed
his
eyes
at
exactly
the
wrong
moment
anyway
once
youre
back
on
the
team
ginny
Ive
got
a
lifelong
ban
youre
banned
as
long
as
Umbridge
is
in
the
school
Ginny
corrected
him
theres
a
difference
anyway
once
youre
back
I
think
Ill
try
out
for
Chaser
angelina
and
Alicia
are
both
leaving
next
year
and
I
prefer
goal-scoring
to
Seeking
anyway
harry
looked
over
at
Ron
who
was
hunched
in
a
corner
staring
at
his
knees
a
bottle
of
butterbeer
clutched
in
his
hand
angelina
still
wont
let
him
resign
Ginny
said
as
though
reading
Harrys
mind
she
says
she
knows
hes
got
it
in
him
harry
liked
Angelina
for
the
faith
she
was
showing
in
Ron
but
at
the
same
time
thought
it
would
really
be
kinder
to
let
him
leave
the
team
ron
had
left
the
pitch
to
another
booming
chorus
of
weasley
is
our
King
sung
with
great
gusto
by
the
Slytherins
who
were
now
favorites
to
win
the
Quidditch
Cup
fred
and
George
wandered
over
i
havent
even
got
the
heart
to
take
the
mickey
out
of
him
said
Fred
looking
over
at
Rons
crumpled
figure
mind
you
when
he
missed
the
fourteenth
he
made
wild
motions
with
his
arms
as
though
doing
an
upright
doggy-paddle
well
Ill
save
it
for
parties
eh
ron
dragged
himself
up
to
bed
shortly
after
this
out
of
respect
for
his
feelings
Harry
waited
a
while
before
going
up
to
the
dormitory
himself
so
that
Ron
could
pretend
to
be
asleep
if
he
wanted
to
sure
enough
when
Harry
finally
entered
the
room
Ron
was
snoring
a
little
too
loudly
to
be
entirely
plausible
harry
got
into
bed
thinking
about
the
match
it
had
been
immensely
frustrating
watching
from
the
sidelines
he
was
quite
impressed
by
Ginnys
performance
but
he
knew
if
he
had
been
playing
he
could
have
caught
the
Snitch
sooner
there
had
been
a
moment
when
it
had
been
fluttering
near
Kirkes
ankle
if
Ginny
hadnt
hesitated
she
might
have
been
able
to
scrape
a
win
for
Gryffindor
umbridge
had
been
sitting
a
few
rows
below
Harry
and
Hermione
once
or
twice
she
had
turned
squatly
in
her
seat
to
look
at
him
her
wide
toads
mouth
stretched
in
what
he
thought
had
been
a
gloating
smile
the
memory
of
it
made
him
feel
hot
with
anger
as
he
lay
there
in
the
dark
after
a
few
minutes
however
he
remembered
that
he
was
supposed
to
be
emptying
his
mind
of
all
emotion
before
he
slept
as
Snape
kept
instructing
him
at
the
end
of
every
Occlumency
lesson
he
tried
for
a
moment
or
two
but
the
thought
of
Snape
on
top
of
memories
of
Umbridge
merely
increased
his
sense
of
grumbling
resentment
and
he
found
himself
focusing
instead
on
how
much
he
loathed
the
pair
of
them
slowly
Rons
snores
died
away
to
be
replaced
by
the
sound
of
deep
slow
breathing
it
took
Harry
much
longer
to
get
to
sleep
his
body
was
tired
but
it
took
his
brain
a
long
time
to
close
down
he
dreamed
that
Neville
and
Professor
Sprout
were
waltzing
around
the
Room
of
Requirement
while
Professor
McGonagall
played
the
bagpipes
he
watched
them
happily
for
a
while
then
decided
to
go
and
find
the
other
members
of
the
D
but
when
he
left
the
room
he
found
himself
facing
not
the
tapestry
of
Barnabas
the
Barmy
but
a
torch
burning
in
its
bracket
on
a
stone
wall
he
turned
his
head
slowly
to
the
left
there
at
the
far
end
of
the
windowless
passage
was
a
plain
black
door
he
walked
towards
it
with
a
sense
of
mounting
excitement
he
had
the
strangest
feeling
that
this
time
he
was
going
to
get
lucky
at
last
and
find
the
way
to
open
it
he
was
feet
from
it
and
saw
with
a
leap
of
excitement
that
there
was
a
glowing
strip
of
faint
blue
light
down
the
right-hand
side
the
door
was
ajar
he
stretched
out
his
hand
to
push
it
wide
and
ron
gave
a
loud
rasping
genuine
snore
and
Harry
awoke
abruptly
with
his
right
hand
stretched
in
front
of
him
in
the
darkness
to
open
a
door
that
was
hundreds
of
miles
away
he
let
it
fall
with
a
feeling
of
mingled
disappointment
and
guilt
he
knew
he
should
not
have
seen
the
door
but
at
the
same
time
felt
so
consumed
with
curiosity
about
what
was
behind
it
that
he
could
not
help
feeling
annoyed
with
Ron
if
only
he
could
have
saved
his
snore
for
just
another
minute
they
entered
the
Great
Hall
for
breakfast
at
exactly
the
same
moment
as
the
post
owls
on
monday
morning
hermione
was
not
the
only
person
eagerly
awaiting
her
Daily
Prophet
nearly
everyone
was
eager
for
more
news
about
the
escaped
Death
Eaters
who
despite
many
reported
sightings
had
still
not
been
caught
she
gave
the
delivery
owl
a
Knut
and
unfolded
the
newspaper
eagerly
while
Harry
helped
himself
to
orange
juice
as
he
had
only
received
one
note
during
the
entire
year
he
was
sure
when
the
first
owl
landed
with
a
thud
in
front
of
him
that
it
had
made
a
mistake
whore
you
after
he
asked
it
languidly
removing
his
orange
juice
from
underneath
its
beak
and
leaning
forwards
to
see
the
recipients
name
and
address
harry
Potter
Great
Hall
Hogwarts
School
frowning
he
made
to
take
the
letter
from
the
owl
but
before
he
could
do
so
three
four
five
more
owls
had
fluttered
down
beside
it
and
were
jockeying
for
position
treading
in
the
butter
and
knocking
over
the
salt
as
each
one
attempted
to
give
him
their
letter
first
whats
going
on
ron
asked
in
amazement
as
the
whole
of
Gryffindor
table
leaned
forwards
to
watch
and
another
seven
owls
landed
amongst
the
first
ones
screeching
hooting
and
flapping
their
wings
harry
said
Hermione
breathlessly
plunging
her
hands
into
the
feathery
mass
and
pulling
out
a
screech
owl
bearing
a
long
cylindrical
package
i
think
I
know
what
this
means
open
this
one
first
harry
ripped
off
the
brown
packaging
out
rolled
a
tightly
furled
copy
of
the
March
edition
of
The
Quibbler
he
unrolled
it
to
see
his
own
face
grinning
sheepishly
at
him
from
the
front
cover
in
large
red
letters
across
this
picture
were
the
words
speaks
out
at
last
the
truth
about
he-who-must-not-be-named
and
the
night
I
saw
him
return
its
good
isnt
it
said
Luna
who
had
drifted
o
ver
to
the
Gryffindor
table
and
now
squeezed
herself
on
to
the
bench
between
Fred
and
Ron
it
came
out
yesterday
I
asked
Dad
to
send
you
a
free
copy
i
expect
all
these
she
waved
a
hand
at
the
assembled
owls
still
scrabbling
around
on
the
table
in
front
of
Harry
are
letters
from
readers
thats
what
I
thought
said
Hermione
eagerly
harry
dyou
mind
if
we
help
yourself
said
Harry
feeling
slightly
bemused
ron
and
Hermione
both
started
ripping
open
envelopes
this
ones
from
a
bloke
who
thinks
youre
off
your
rocker
said
Ron
glancing
down
his
letter
ah
well
this
woman
recommends
you
try
a
good
course
of
Shock
Spells
at
st.
Mungos
said
Hermione
looking
disappointed
and
crumpling
up
a
second
this
one
looks
okay
though
said
Harry
slowly
scanning
a
long
letter
from
a
witch
in
Paisley
hey
she
says
she
believes
me
this
ones
in
two
minds
said
Fred
who
had
joined
in
the
letter-opening
with
enthusiasm
says
you
dont
come
across
as
a
mad
person
but
he
really
doesnt
want
to
believe
You-Know
whos
back
so
he
doesnt
know
what
to
think
now
blimey
what
a
waste
of
parchment
heres
another
one
youve
convinced
Harry
said
Hermione
excitedly
having
read
your
side
of
the
story
I
am
forced
to
the
conclusion
that
the
Daily
Prophet
has
treated
you
very
unfairly
little
though
I
want
to
think
that
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
has
returned
I
am
forced
to
accept
that
you
are
telling
the
truth
oh
this
is
wonderful
another
one
who
thinks
youre
barking
said
Ron
throwing
a
crumpled
letter
over
his
shoulder
but
this
one
says
youve
got
her
converted
and
she
now
thinks
youre
a
real
hero
shes
put
in
a
photograph
too
wow
what
is
going
on
here
said
a
falsely
sweet
girlish
voice
harry
looked
up
with
his
hands
full
of
envelopes
professor
Umbridge
was
standing
behind
Fred
and
Luna
her
bulging
toads
eyes
scanning
the
mess
of
owls
and
letters
on
the
table
in
front
of
harry
behind
her
he
saw
many
of
the
students
watching
them
avidly
why
have
you
got
all
these
letters
mr.
Potter
she
asked
slowly
is
that
a
crime
now
said
Fred
loudly
getting
mail
be
careful
mr.
Weasley
or
I
shall
have
to
put
you
in
detention
said
Umbridge
well
Mr
potter
harry
hesitated
but
he
did
not
see
how
he
could
keep
what
he
had
done
quiet
it
was
surely
only
a
matter
of
time
before
a
copy
of
The
Quibbler
came
to
Umbridges
attention
people
have
written
to
me
because
I
gave
an
interview
said
Harry
about
what
happened
to
me
last
June
for
some
reason
he
glanced
up
at
the
staff
table
as
he
said
this
harry
had
the
strangest
feeling
that
Dumbledore
had
been
watching
him
a
second
before
but
when
he
looked
towards
the
headmaster
he
seemed
to
be
absorbed
in
conversation
with
Professor
Flitwick
an
interview
repeated
Umbridge
her
voice
thinner
and
higher
than
ever
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
a
reporter
asked
me
questions
and
I
answered
them
said
Harry
here
and
he
threw
the
copy
of
The
Quibbler
to
her
she
caught
it
and
stared
down
at
the
cover
her
pale
doughy
face
turned
an
ugly
patchy
violet
when
did
you
do
this
she
asked
her
voice
trembling
slightly
last
Hogsmeade
weekend
said
Harry
she
looked
up
at
him
incandescent
with
rage
the
magazine
shaking
in
her
stubby
fingers
there
will
be
no
more
Hogsmeade
trips
for
you
mr.
Potter
she
whispered
how
you
dare
how
you
could
she
took
a
deep
breath
i
have
tried
again
and
again
to
teach
you
not
to
tell
lies
the
message
apparently
has
still
not
sunk
in
fifty
points
from
Gryffindor
and
another
weeks
worth
of
detentions
she
stalked
away
clutching
The
Quibbler
to
her
chest
the
eyes
of
many
students
following
her
by
mid-morning
enormous
signs
had
been
put
up
all
over
the
school
not
just
on
house
noticeboards
but
in
the
corridors
and
classrooms
too
by
order
of
the
high
inquisitor
of
hogwarts
any
student
found
in
possession
of
the
magazine
The
Quibbler
will
be
expelled
the
above
is
in
accordance
with
Educational
Decree
Number
twenty-seven
signed
Dolores
Jane
Umbridge
High
Inquisitor
for
some
reason
every
time
Hermione
caught
sight
of
one
of
these
signs
she
beamed
with
pleasure
what
exactly
are
you
so
happy
about
harry
asked
her
oh
Harry
dont
you
see
hermione
breathed
if
she
could
have
done
one
thing
to
make
absolutely
sure
that
every
single
person
in
this
school
will
read
your
interview
it
was
banning
it
and
it
seemed
that
Hermione
was
quite
right
by
the
end
of
the
day
though
Harry
had
not
seen
so
much
as
a
corner
of
The
Quibbler
anywhere
in
the
school
the
whole
place
seemed
to
be
quoting
the
interview
to
each
other
harry
heard
them
whispering
about
it
as
they
queued
up
outside
classes
discussing
it
over
lunch
and
in
the
back
of
lessons
while
Hermione
even
reported
that
every
occupant
of
the
cubicles
in
the
girls
toilets
had
been
talking
about
it
when
she
nipped
in
there
before
Ancient
Runes
then
they
spotted
me
and
obviously
they
know
I
know
you
so
they
bombarded
me
with
questions
Hermione
told
Harry
her
eyes
shining
and
harry
I
think
they
believe
you
I
really
do
I
think
youve
finally
got
them
convinced
meanwhile
Professor
Umbridge
was
stalking
the
school
stopping
students
at
random
and
demanding
that
they
turn
out
their
books
and
pockets
Harry
knew
she
was
looking
for
copies
of
The
Quibbler
but
the
students
were
several
steps
ahead
of
her
the
pages
carrying
Harrys
interview
had
been
bewitched
to
resemble
extracts
from
textbooks
if
anyone
but
themselves
read
it
or
else
wiped
magically
blank
until
they
wanted
to
peruse
it
again
soon
it
seemed
that
every
single
person
in
the
school
had
read
it
the
teachers
were
of
course
forbidden
from
mentioning
the
interview
by
Educational
Decree
number
twenty-six
but
they
found
ways
to
express
their
feelings
about
it
all
the
same
professor
Sprout
awarded
Gryffindor
twenty
points
when
Harry
passed
her
a
watering
can
a
beaming
Professor
Flitwick
pressed
a
box
of
squeaking
sugar
mice
on
him
at
the
end
of
Charms
said
Shh
and
hurried
away
and
Professor
Trelawney
broke
into
hysterical
sobs
during
divination
and
announced
to
the
startled
class
and
a
very
disapproving
Umbridge
that
Harry
was
not
going
to
suffer
an
early
death
after
all
but
would
live
to
a
ripe
old
age
become
Minister
for
Magic
and
have
twelve
children
but
what
made
Harry
happiest
was
Cho
catching
up
with
him
as
he
was
hurrying
along
to
transfiguration
the
next
day
before
he
knew
what
had
happened
her
hand
was
in
his
and
she
was
breathing
in
his
ear
Im
really
really
sorry
that
interview
was
so
brave
it
made
me
cry
he
was
sorry
to
hear
she
had
shed
even
more
tears
over
it
but
very
glad
they
were
on
speaking
terms
again
and
even
more
pleased
when
she
gave
him
a
swift
kiss
on
the
cheek
and
hurried
off
again
and
unbelievably
no
sooner
had
he
arrived
outside
Transfiguration
than
something
just
as
good
happened
Seamus
stepped
out
of
the
queue
to
face
him
i
just
wanted
to
say
he
mumbled
squinting
at
Harrys
left
knee
I
believe
you
and
Ive
sent
a
copy
of
that
magazine
to
me
mam
if
anything
more
was
needed
to
complete
Harrys
happiness
it
was
the
reaction
he
got
from
malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
he
saw
them
with
their
heads
together
later
that
afternoon
in
the
library
they
were
with
a
weedy-looking
boy
Hermione
whispered
was
called
Theodore
Nott
they
looked
round
at
Harry
as
he
browsed
the
shelves
for
the
book
he
needed
on
Partial
vanishment
Goyle
cracked
his
knuckles
threateningly
and
Malfoy
whispered
something
undoubtedly
malevolent
to
Crabbe
harry
knew
perfectly
well
why
they
were
acting
like
this
he
had
named
all
of
their
fathers
as
Death
Eaters
and
the
best
bit
whispered
Hermione
gleefully
as
they
left
the
library
is
they
cant
contradict
you
because
they
cant
admit
theyve
read
the
article
to
cap
it
all
Luna
told
him
over
dinner
that
no
issue
of
The
Quibbler
had
ever
sold
out
faster
dads
reprinting
she
told
Harry
her
eyes
popping
excitedly
he
cant
believe
it
he
says
people
seem
even
more
interested
in
this
than
the
Crumple-Horned
Snorkacks
harry
was
a
hero
in
the
Gryffindor
common
room
that
night
daringly
Fred
and
George
had
put
an
Enlargement
Charm
on
the
front
cover
of
The
Quibbler
and
hung
it
on
the
wall
so
that
Harrys
giant
head
gazed
down
upon
the
proceedings
occasionally
saying
things
like
the
ministry
are
morons
and
eat
dung
umbridge
in
a
booming
voice
hermione
did
not
find
this
very
amusing
she
said
it
interfered
with
her
concentration
and
she
ended
up
going
to
bed
early
out
of
irritation
harry
had
to
admit
that
the
poster
was
not
quite
as
funny
after
an
hour
or
two
especially
when
the
talking
spell
had
started
to
wear
off
so
that
it
merely
shouted
disconnected
words
like
dung
and
umbridge
at
more
and
more
frequent
intervals
in
a
progressively
higher
voice
in
fact
it
started
to
make
his
head
ache
and
his
scar
began
prickling
uncomfortably
again
to
disappointed
moans
from
the
many
people
who
were
sitting
around
him
asking
him
to
relive
his
interview
for
the
umpteenth
time
he
announced
that
he
too
needed
an
early
night
the
dormitory
was
empty
when
he
reached
it
he
rested
his
forehead
for
a
moment
against
the
cool
glass
of
the
window
beside
his
bed
it
felt
soothing
against
his
scar
then
he
undressed
and
got
into
bed
wishing
his
headache
would
go
away
he
also
felt
slightly
sick
he
rolled
over
on
to
his
side
closed
his
eyes
and
fell
asleep
almost
at
once
he
was
standing
in
a
dark
curtained
room
lit
by
a
single
branch
of
candles
his
hands
were
clenched
on
the
back
of
a
chair
in
front
of
him
they
were
long-fingered
and
white
as
though
they
had
not
seen
sunlight
for
years
and
looked
like
large
pale
spiders
against
the
dark
velvet
of
the
chair
beyond
the
chair
in
a
pool
of
light
cast
upon
the
floor
by
the
candles
knelt
a
man
in
black
robes
i
have
been
badly
advised
it
seems
said
Harry
in
a
high
cold
voice
that
pulsed
with
anger
master
I
crave
your
pardon
croaked
the
man
kneeling
on
the
floor
the
back
of
his
head
glimmered
in
the
candlelight
he
seemed
to
be
trembling
i
do
not
blame
you
Rookwood
said
Harry
in
that
cold
cruel
voice
he
relinquished
his
grip
on
the
chair
and
walked
around
it
closer
to
the
man
cowering
on
the
floor
until
he
stood
directly
over
him
in
the
darkness
looking
down
from
a
far
greater
height
than
usual
you
are
sure
of
your
facts
Rookwood
asked
Harry
yes
My
Lord
yes
i
used
to
work
in
the
Department
after
after
all
avery
told
me
Bode
would
be
able
to
remove
it
bode
could
never
have
taken
it
Master
bode
would
have
known
he
could
not
undoubtedly
that
is
why
he
fought
so
hard
against
Malfoys
Imperius
Curse
stand
up
Rookwood
whispered
Harry
the
kneeling
man
almost
fell
over
in
his
haste
to
obey
his
face
was
pockmarked
the
scars
were
thrown
into
relief
by
the
candlelight
he
remained
a
little
stooped
when
standing
as
though
halfway
through
a
bow
and
he
darted
terrified
looks
up
at
Harrys
face
you
have
done
well
to
tell
me
this
said
Harry
very
well
i
have
wasted
months
on
fruitless
schemes
it
seems
but
no
matter
we
begin
again
from
now
you
have
Lord
Voldemorts
gratitude
Rookwood
my
Lord
yes
My
Lord
gasped
Rookwood
his
voice
hoarse
with
relief
i
shall
need
your
help
i
shall
need
all
the
information
you
can
give
me
of
course
My
Lord
of
course
anything
very
well
you
may
go
send
Avery
to
me
rookwood
scurried
backwards
bowing
and
disappeared
through
a
door
left
alone
in
the
dark
room
Harry
turned
towards
the
wall
a
cracked
age-spotted
mirror
hung
on
the
wall
in
the
shadows
harry
moved
towards
it
his
reflection
grew
larger
and
clearer
in
the
darkness
a
face
whiter
than
a
skull
red
eyes
with
slits
for
pupils
nooooooooo
what
yelled
a
voice
nearby
harry
flailed
around
madly
became
entangled
in
the
hangings
and
fell
out
of
his
bed
for
a
few
seconds
he
did
not
know
where
he
was
he
was
convinced
he
was
about
to
see
the
white
skulllike
face
looming
at
him
out
of
the
dark
again
then
very
near
to
him
Rons
voice
spoke
will
you
stop
acting
like
a
maniac
so
I
can
get
you
out
of
here
ron
wrenched
the
hangings
apart
and
Harry
stared
up
at
him
in
the
moonlight
flat
on
his
back
his
scar
searing
with
pain
ron
looked
as
though
he
had
just
been
getting
ready
for
bed
one
arm
was
out
of
his
robes
has
someone
been
attacked
again
asked
Ron
pulling
Harry
roughly
to
his
feet
is
it
Dad
is
it
that
snake
no
everyones
fine
gasped
Harry
whose
forehead
felt
as
though
it
were
on
fire
well
avery
isnt
hes
in
trouble
he
gave
him
the
wrong
information
voldemorts
really
angry
harry
groaned
and
sank
shaking
on
to
his
bed
rubbing
his
scar
but
Rookwoods
going
to
help
him
now
hes
on
the
right
track
again
what
are
you
talking
about
said
Ron
sounding
scared
dyou
mean
did
you
just
see
You
know-Who
i
was
You-Know-Who
said
Harry
and
he
stretched
out
his
hands
in
the
darkness
and
held
them
up
to
his
face
to
check
that
they
were
no
longer
deathly
white
and
long-fingered
he
was
with
Rookwood
hes
one
of
the
Death
Eaters
who
escaped
from
Azkaban
remember
rookwoods
just
told
him
Bode
couldnt
have
done
it
done
what
remove
something
he
said
Bode
would
have
known
he
couldnt
have
done
it
bode
was
under
the
Imperius
Curse
i
think
he
said
Malfoys
dad
put
it
on
him
bode
was
bewitched
to
remove
something
ron
said
but
Harry
thats
got
to
be
the
weapon
Harry
finished
the
sentence
for
him
i
know
the
dormitory
door
opened
Dean
and
Seamus
came
in
harry
swung
his
legs
back
into
bed
he
did
not
want
to
look
as
though
anything
odd
had
just
happened
seeing
as
Seamus
had
only
just
stopped
thinking
Harry
was
a
nutter
did
you
say
murmured
Ron
putting
his
head
close
to
Harrys
on
the
pretence
of
helping
himself
to
water
from
the
jug
on
his
bedside
table
that
you
were
You-Know-Who
yeah
said
Harry
quietly
ron
took
an
unnecessarily
large
gulp
of
water
Harry
saw
it
spill
over
his
chin
on
to
his
chest
harry
he
said
as
Dean
and
Seamus
clattered
around
noisily
pulling
off
their
robes
and
talking
youve
got
to
tell
i
havent
got
to
tell
anyone
said
Harry
shortly
i
wouldnt
have
seen
it
at
all
if
I
could
do
occlumency
im
supposed
to
have
learned
to
shut
this
stuff
out
thats
what
they
want
by
they
he
meant
Dumbledore
he
got
back
into
bed
and
rolled
over
on
to
his
side
with
his
back
to
Ron
and
after
a
while
he
heard
Rons
mattress
creak
as
he
too
lay
back
down
harrys
scar
began
to
burn
he
bit
hard
on
his
pillow
to
stop
himself
making
a
noise
somewhere
he
knew
Avery
was
being
punished
harry
and
Ron
waited
until
break
next
morning
to
tell
Hermione
exactly
what
had
happened
they
wanted
to
be
absolutely
sure
they
could
not
be
overheard
standing
in
their
usual
corner
of
the
cool
and
breezy
courtyard
Harry
told
her
every
detail
of
the
dream
he
could
remember
when
he
had
finished
she
said
nothing
at
all
for
a
few
moments
but
stared
with
a
kind
of
painful
intensity
at
Fred
and
George
who
were
both
headless
and
selling
their
magical
hats
from
under
their
cloaks
on
the
other
side
of
the
yard
so
thats
why
they
killed
him
she
said
quietly
withdrawing
her
gaze
from
Fred
and
George
at
last
when
Bode
tried
to
steal
this
weapon
something
funny
happened
to
him
i
think
there
must
be
defensive
spells
on
it
or
around
it
to
stop
people
touching
it
thats
why
he
was
in
St
mungos
his
brain
had
gone
all
funny
and
he
couldnt
talk
but
remember
what
the
Healer
told
us
he
was
recovering
and
they
couldnt
risk
him
getting
better
could
they
i
mean
the
shock
of
whatever
happened
when
he
touched
that
weapon
probably
made
the
Imperius
Curse
lift
once
hed
got
his
voice
back
hed
explain
what
hed
been
doing
wouldnt
he
they
would
have
known
hed
been
sent
to
steal
the
weapon
of
course
it
would
have
been
easy
for
Lucius
Malfoy
to
put
the
curse
on
him
never
out
of
the
Ministry
is
he
he
was
even
hanging
around
that
day
I
had
my
hearing
said
Harry
in
the
hang
on
he
said
slowly
he
was
in
the
Department
of
Mysteries
corridor
that
day
your
dad
said
he
was
probably
trying
to
sneak
down
and
find
out
what
happened
in
my
hearing
but
what
if
sturgis
gasped
Hermione
looking
thunderstruck
sorry
said
Ron
looking
bewildered
sturgis
Podmore
said
Hermione
breathlessly
arrested
for
trying
to
get
through
a
door
lucius
Malfoy
must
have
got
him
too
i
bet
he
did
it
the
day
you
saw
him
there
Harry
sturgis
had
Moodys
Invisibility
Cloak
right
so
what
if
he
was
standing
guard
by
the
door
invisible
and
Malfoy
heard
him
move
or
guessed
someone
was
there
or
just
did
the
Imperius
Curse
on
the
off-chance
thered
be
a
guard
there
so
when
Sturgis
next
had
an
opportunity
probably
when
it
was
his
turn
on
guard
duty
again
he
tried
to
get
into
the
Department
to
steal
the
weapon
for
Voldemort
Ron
be
quiet
but
he
got
caught
and
sent
to
Azkaban
she
gazed
at
Harry
and
now
Rookwoods
told
Voldemort
how
to
get
the
weapon
i
didnt
hear
all
the
conversation
but
thats
what
it
sounded
like
said
Harry
rookwood
used
to
work
there
maybe
Voldemortll
send
Rookwood
to
do
it
hermione
nodded
apparently
still
lost
in
thought
then
quite
abruptly
she
said
But
you
shouldnt
have
seen
this
at
all
Harry
what
he
said
taken
aback
youre
supposed
to
be
learning
how
to
close
your
m
ind
to
this
sort
of
thing
said
Hermione
suddenly
stern
i
know
I
am
said
Harry
but
well
I
think
we
should
just
try
and
forget
what
you
saw
said
Hermione
firmly
and
you
ought
to
put
in
a
bit
more
effort
on
your
Occlumency
from
now
on
harry
was
so
angry
with
her
he
did
not
talk
to
her
for
the
rest
of
the
day
which
proved
to
be
another
bad
one
when
people
were
not
discussing
the
escaped
Death
Eaters
in
the
corridors
they
were
laughing
at
Gryffindors
abysmal
performance
in
their
match
against
Hufflepuff
the
slytherins
were
singing
Weasley
is
our
King
so
loudly
and
frequently
that
by
sundown
Filch
had
banned
it
from
the
corridors
out
of
sheer
irritation
the
week
did
not
improve
as
it
progressed
harry
received
two
more
Ds
in
Potions
he
was
still
on
tenterhooks
that
Hagrid
might
get
the
sack
and
he
couldnt
stop
himself
dwelling
on
the
dream
in
which
he
had
been
Voldemort
though
he
didnt
bring
it
up
with
Ron
and
Hermione
again
he
didnt
want
another
telling-off
from
Hermione
he
wished
very
much
that
he
could
have
talked
to
Sirius
about
it
but
that
was
out
of
the
question
so
he
tried
to
push
the
matter
to
the
back
of
his
mind
unfortunately
the
back
of
his
mind
was
no
longer
the
secure
place
it
had
once
been
get
up
Potter
a
couple
of
weeks
after
his
dream
of
Rookwood
Harry
was
to
be
found
yet
again
kneeling
on
the
floor
of
Snapes
office
trying
to
clear
his
head
he
had
just
been
forced
yet
again
to
relive
a
stream
of
very
early
memories
he
had
not
even
realized
he
still
had
most
of
them
concerning
humiliations
Dudley
and
his
gang
had
inflicted
upon
him
in
primary
school
that
last
memory
said
Snape
what
was
it
i
dont
know
said
Harry
getting
wearily
to
his
feet
he
was
finding
it
increasingly
difficult
to
disentangle
separate
memories
from
the
rush
of
images
and
sound
that
Snape
kept
calling
forth
you
mean
the
one
where
my
cousin
tried
to
make
me
stand
in
the
toilet
no
said
Snape
softly
i
mean
the
one
with
a
man
kneeling
in
the
middle
of
a
darkened
room
its
nothing
said
Harry
snapes
dark
eyes
bored
into
Harrys
remembering
what
Snape
had
said
about
eye
contact
being
crucial
to
Legilimency
Harry
blinked
and
looked
away
how
do
that
man
and
that
room
come
to
be
inside
your
head
Potter
said
Snape
it
said
Harry
looking
everywhere
but
at
Snape
it
was
just
a
dream
I
had
a
dream
repeated
Snape
there
was
a
pause
during
which
Harry
stared
fixedly
at
a
large
dead
frog
suspended
in
a
jar
of
purple
liquid
you
do
know
why
we
are
here
dont
you
Potter
said
Snape
in
a
low
dangerous
voice
you
do
know
why
I
am
giving
up
my
evenings
to
this
tedious
job
yes
said
Harry
stiffly
remind
me
why
we
are
here
Potter
so
I
can
learn
Occlumency
said
Harry
now
glaring
at
a
dead
eel
correct
Potter
and
dim
though
you
may
be
Harry
looked
back
at
Snape
hating
him
I
would
have
thought
that
after
over
two
months
of
lessons
you
might
have
made
some
progress
how
many
other
dreams
about
the
Dark
Lord
have
you
had
just
that
one
lied
Harry
perhaps
said
Snape
his
dark
cold
eyes
narrowin
g
slightly
perhaps
you
actually
enjoy
having
these
visions
and
dreams
Potter
maybe
they
make
you
feel
special
important
no
they
dont
said
Harry
his
jaw
set
and
his
fingers
clenched
tightly
around
the
handle
of
his
wand
that
is
just
as
well
Potter
said
Snape
coldly
because
you
are
neither
special
nor
important
and
it
is
not
up
to
you
to
find
out
what
the
Dark
Lord
is
saying
to
his
Death
Eaters
no
thats
your
job
isnt
it
harry
shot
at
him
he
had
not
meant
to
say
it
it
had
burst
out
of
him
in
temper
for
a
long
moment
they
stared
at
each
other
Harry
convinced
he
had
gone
too
far
but
there
was
a
curious
almost
satisfied
expression
on
Snapes
face
when
he
answered
yes
Potter
he
said
his
eyes
glinting
that
is
my
job
now
if
you
are
ready
we
will
start
again
he
raised
his
wand
One
two
three
Legilimens
a
hundred
Dementors
were
swooping
towards
Harry
across
the
lake
in
the
grounds
he
screwed
up
his
face
in
concentration
they
were
coming
closer
he
could
see
the
dark
holes
beneath
their
hoods
yet
he
could
also
see
Snape
standing
in
front
of
him
his
eyes
fixed
on
harrys
face
muttering
under
his
breath
and
somehow
Snape
was
growing
clearer
and
the
dementors
were
growing
fainter
harry
raised
his
own
wand
protego
snape
staggered
his
wand
flew
upwards
away
from
Harry
and
suddenly
Harrys
mind
was
teeming
with
memories
that
were
not
his
a
hook-nosed
man
was
shouting
at
a
cowering
woman
while
a
small
dark-haired
boy
cried
in
a
corner
a
greasy-haired
teenager
sat
alone
in
a
dark
bedroom
pointing
his
wand
at
the
ceiling
shooting
down
flies
a
girl
was
laughing
as
a
scrawny
boy
tried
to
mount
a
bucking
broomstick
enough
harry
felt
as
though
he
had
been
pushed
hard
in
the
chest
he
staggered
several
steps
backwards
hit
some
of
the
shelves
covering
Snapes
walls
and
heard
something
crack
snape
was
shaking
slightly
and
was
very
white
in
the
face
the
back
of
Harrys
robes
was
damp
one
of
the
jars
behind
him
had
broken
when
he
fell
against
it
the
pickled
slimy
thing
within
was
swirling
in
its
draining
potion
reparo
hissed
Snape
and
the
jar
sealed
itself
at
once
well
Potter
that
was
certainly
an
improvement
panting
slightly
Snape
straightened
the
Pensieve
in
which
he
had
again
stored
some
of
his
thoughts
before
starting
the
lesson
almost
as
though
he
was
checking
they
were
still
there
i
dont
remember
telling
you
to
use
a
Shield
Charm
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
it
was
effective
harry
did
not
speak
he
felt
that
to
say
anything
might
be
dangerous
he
was
sure
he
had
just
broken
into
Snapes
memories
that
he
had
just
seen
scenes
from
Snapes
childhood
it
was
unnerving
to
think
that
the
little
boy
who
had
been
crying
as
he
watched
his
parents
shouting
was
actually
standing
in
front
of
him
with
such
loathing
in
his
eyes
lets
try
again
shall
we
said
Snape
harry
felt
a
thrill
of
dread
he
was
about
to
pay
for
what
had
just
happened
he
was
sure
of
it
they
moved
back
into
position
with
the
desk
between
them
Harry
feeling
he
was
going
to
find
it
much
harder
to
empty
his
mind
this
time
on
the
count
of
three
then
said
Snape
raising
his
wand
once
more
one
two
harry
did
not
have
time
to
gather
himself
together
and
attempt
to
clear
his
mind
before
Snape
cried
Legilimens
he
was
hurtling
along
the
corridor
towards
the
Department
of
Mysteries
past
the
blank
stone
walls
past
the
torches
the
plain
black
door
was
growing
ever
larger
he
was
moving
so
fast
he
was
going
to
collide
with
it
he
was
feet
from
it
and
again
he
could
see
that
chink
of
faint
blue
light
The
door
had
flown
open
he
was
through
it
at
last
inside
a
black-walled
black-floored
circular
room
lit
with
blue-flamed
candles
and
there
were
more
doors
all
around
him
he
needed
to
go
on
but
which
door
ought
he
to
take
potter
harry
opened
his
eyes
he
was
flat
on
his
back
again
with
no
memory
of
having
gotten
there
he
was
also
panting
as
though
he
really
had
run
the
length
of
the
Department
of
Mysteries
corridor
really
had
sprinted
through
the
black
door
and
found
the
circular
room
explain
yourself
said
Snape
who
was
standing
over
him
looking
furious
dunno
what
happened
said
Harry
truthfully
st
anding
up
there
was
a
lump
on
the
back
of
his
head
from
where
he
had
hit
the
ground
and
he
felt
feverish
ive
never
seen
that
before
mean
I
told
you
Ive
dreamed
about
the
door
but
its
never
opened
before
you
are
not
working
hard
enough
for
some
reason
Snape
seemed
even
angrier
than
he
had
done
two
minutes
before
when
Harry
had
seen
into
his
teachers
memories
you
are
lazy
and
sloppy
Potter
it
is
small
wonder
that
the
Dark
Lord
can
you
tell
me
something
sir
said
Harry
firing
up
again
why
do
you
call
Voldemort
the
dark
Lord
ive
only
ever
heard
Death
Eaters
call
him
that
snape
opened
his
mouth
in
a
snarl
and
a
woman
screamed
from
somewhere
outside
the
room
snapes
head
jerked
upwards
he
was
gazing
at
the
ceiling
what
the
he
muttered
harry
could
hear
a
muffled
commotion
coming
from
what
he
thought
might
be
the
Entrance
hall
snape
looked
round
at
him
frowning
did
you
see
anything
unusual
on
your
way
down
here
Potter
harry
shook
his
head
somewhere
above
them
the
woman
screamed
again
snape
strode
to
his
office
door
his
wand
still
held
at
the
ready
and
swept
out
of
sight
harry
hesitated
for
a
moment
then
followed
the
screams
were
indeed
coming
from
the
Entrance
Hall
they
grew
louder
as
Harry
ran
towards
the
stone
steps
leading
up
from
the
dungeons
when
he
reached
the
top
he
found
the
Entrance
hall
packed
students
had
come
flooding
out
of
the
Great
Hall
where
dinner
was
still
in
progress
to
see
what
was
going
on
others
had
crammed
themselves
on
to
the
marble
staircase
harry
pushed
forwards
through
a
knot
of
tall
Slytherins
and
saw
that
the
onlookers
had
formed
a
great
ring
some
of
them
looking
shocked
others
even
frightened
professor
McGonagall
was
directly
opposite
Harry
on
the
other
side
of
the
Hall
she
looked
as
though
what
she
was
watching
made
her
feel
faintly
sick
professor
Trelawney
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
Entrance
Hall
with
her
wand
in
one
hand
and
an
empty
sherry
bottle
in
the
other
looking
utterly
mad
her
hair
was
sticking
up
on
end
her
glasses
were
lopsided
so
that
one
eye
was
magnified
more
than
the
other
her
innumerable
shawls
and
scarves
were
trailing
haphazardly
from
her
shoulders
giving
the
impression
that
she
was
falling
apart
at
the
seams
two
large
trunks
lay
on
the
floor
beside
her
one
of
them
upsidedown
it
looked
very
much
as
though
it
had
been
thrown
down
the
stairs
after
her
professor
Trelawney
was
staring
apparently
terrified
at
something
Harry
could
not
see
but
which
seemed
to
be
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
no
she
shrieked
no
this
cannot
be
happening
it
cannot
i
refuse
to
accept
it
you
didnt
realize
this
was
coming
said
a
high
girlish
voice
sounding
callously
amused
and
harry
moving
slightly
to
his
right
saw
that
Trelawneys
terrifying
vision
was
nothing
other
than
professor
Umbridge
incapable
though
you
are
of
predicting
even
tomorrows
weather
you
must
surely
have
realized
that
your
pitiful
performance
during
my
inspections
and
lack
of
any
improvement
would
make
it
inevitable
that
you
would
be
sacked
you
c
cant
howled
Professor
Trelawney
tears
streaming
down
her
face
from
behind
her
enormous
lenses
you
c
cant
sack
me
ive
b
been
here
sixteen
years
h
Hogwarts
is
in
my
h
home
it
was
your
home
said
Professor
Umbridge
and
Harry
was
revolted
to
see
the
enjoyment
stretching
her
toadlike
face
as
she
watched
Professor
Trelawney
sink
sobbing
uncontrollably
on
to
one
of
her
trunks
until
an
hour
ago
when
the
Minister
of
Magic
countersigned
your
Order
of
Dismissal
now
kindly
remove
yourself
from
this
Hall
you
are
embarrassing
us
but
she
stood
and
watched
with
an
expression
of
gloating
enjoyment
as
Professor
Trelawney
shuddered
and
moaned
rocking
backwards
and
forwards
on
her
trunk
in
paroxysms
of
grief
harry
heard
a
muffled
sob
to
his
left
and
looked
around
lavender
and
Parvati
were
both
crying
quietly
their
arms
round
each
other
then
he
heard
footsteps
professor
McGonagall
had
broken
away
from
the
spectators
marched
straight
up
to
Professor
Trelawney
and
was
patting
her
firmly
on
the
back
while
withdrawing
a
large
handkerchief
from
within
her
robes
there
there
Sibyll
calm
down
blow
your
nose
on
this
its
not
as
bad
as
you
think
now
you
are
not
going
to
have
to
leave
Hogwarts
oh
really
Professor
McGonagall
said
Umbridge
in
a
deadly
voice
taking
a
few
steps
forward
and
your
authority
for
that
statement
is
that
would
be
mine
said
a
deep
voice
the
oaken
front
doors
had
swung
open
students
beside
them
scuttled
out
of
the
way
as
dumbledore
appeared
in
the
entrance
what
he
had
been
doing
out
in
the
grounds
Harry
could
not
imagine
but
there
was
something
impressive
about
the
sight
of
him
framed
in
the
doorway
against
an
oddly
misty
night
leaving
the
doors
wide
open
behind
him
he
strode
forwards
through
the
circle
of
onlookers
towards
Professor
Trelawney
tear-stained
and
trembling
on
her
trunk
Professor
McGonagall
alongside
her
yours
Professor
Dumbledore
said
Umbridge
with
a
singularly
unpleasant
little
laugh
im
afraid
you
do
not
understand
the
position
i
have
here
she
pulled
a
parchment
scroll
from
within
her
robes
an
Order
of
Dismissal
signed
by
myself
and
the
Minister
for
Magic
under
the
terms
of
Educational
Decree
Number
twenty-three
the
High
Inquisitor
of
Hogwarts
has
the
power
to
inspect
place
upon
probation
and
sack
any
teacher
she
that
is
to
say
I
feel
is
not
performing
to
the
standards
required
by
the
Ministry
of
Magic
i
have
decided
that
Professor
trelawney
is
not
up
to
scratch
i
have
dismissed
her
to
Harrys
very
great
surprise
Dumbledore
continued
to
smile
he
looked
down
at
Professor
trelawney
who
was
still
sobbing
and
choking
on
her
trunk
and
said
You
are
quite
right
of
course
Professor
Umbridge
as
High
Inquisitor
you
have
every
right
to
dismiss
my
teachers
you
do
not
however
have
the
authority
to
send
them
away
from
the
castle
i
am
afraid
he
went
on
with
a
courteous
little
bow
that
the
power
to
do
that
still
resides
with
the
Headmaster
and
it
is
my
wish
that
Professor
Trelawney

to
live
at
Hogwarts
at
this
Professor
Trelawney
gave
a
wild
little
laugh
in
which
a
hiccough
was
barely
hidden
no
no
Ill

Dumbledore

sh
shall
leave
Hogwarts
and
s
seek
my
fortune

no
said
Dumbledore
sharply
it
is
my
wish
that
you
remain
Sibyll
he
turned
to
Professor
McGonagall
might
I
ask
you
to
escort
Sibyll
back
upstairs
Professor
McGonagall
of
course
said
McGonagall
up

get
Sibyll
professor
Sprout
came
hurrying
forwards
out
of
the
crowd
and
grabbed
Professor
Trelawneys
other
arm
together
they
guided
her
past
Umbridge
and
up
the
marble
stairs
professor
Flitwick
went
scurrying
after
them
his
wand
held
out
before
him
he
squeaked
Locomotor
trunks
and
professor
Trelawneys
luggage
rose
into
the
air
and
proceeded
up
the
staircase
after
her
professor
Flitwick
bringing
up
the
rear
professor
Umbridge
was
standing
stock
still
staring
at
Dumbledore
who
continued
to
smile
benignly
and
what
she
said
in
a
whisper
that
carried
all
around
the
Entrance
Hall
are
you
going
to
do
with
her
once
I
appoint
a
new
Divination
teacher
who
needs
her
lodgings
oh
that
wont
be
a
problem
said
Dumbledore
pleasantly
you
see
I
have
already
found
us
a
new
Divination
teacher
and
he
will
prefer
lodgings
on
the
ground
floor
youve
found
said
Umbridge
shrilly
youve
found
might
I
remind
you
Dumbledore
that
under
Educational
Decree
Number
twenty-two
the
Ministry
has
the
right
to
appoint
a
suitable
candidate
if
and
only
if
the
Headmaster
is
unable
to
find
one
said
Dumbledore
and
I
am
happy
to
say
that
on
this
occasion
I
have
succeeded
may
I
introduce
you
he
turned
to
face
the
open
front
doors
through
which
night
mist
was
now
drifting
harry
heard
hooves
there
was
a
shocked
murmur
around
the
Hall
and
those
nearest
the
doors
hastily
moved
even
further
backwards
some
of
them
tripping
over
in
their
haste
to
clear
a
path
for
the
newcomer
through
the
mist
came
a
face
Harry
had
seen
once
before
on
a
dark
dangerous
night
in
the
forbidden
Forest
white-blond
hair
and
astonishingly
blue
eyes
the
head
and
torso
of
a
man
joined
to
the
palomino
body
of
a
horse
this
is
Firenze
said
Dumbledore
happily
to
a
thunderstruck
Umbridge
i
think
youll
find
him
suitable

bet
you
wish
you

now
dont
you
Hermione
asked
Parvati
smirking
it
was
breakfast
time
two
days
after
the
sacking
of
Professor
Trelawney
and
Parvati
was
curling
her
eyelashes
around
her
wand
and
examining
the
effect
in
the
back
of
her
spoon
they
were
to
have
their
first
lesson
with
Firenze
that
morning
not
really
said
Hermione
indifferently
who
was
reading
the
Daily
Prophet
ive
never
really
liked
horses
she
turned
a
page
of
the
newspaper
and
scanned
its
columns
hes
not
a
horse
hes
a
centaur
said
Lavender
sounding
shocked
a
gorgeous
centaur
sighed
Parvati
either
way
hes
still
got
four
legs
said
Hermione
coolly
anyway
I
thought
you
two
were
all
upset
that
Trelawney
had
gone
we
are
lavender
assured
her
we
went
up
to
her
office
to
see
her
we
took
her
some
daffodils
not
the
honking
ones
that
Sprouts
got
nice
ones
how
is
she
asked
Harry
not
very
good
poor
thing
said
Lavender
sympathetically
she
was
crying
and
saying
shed
rather
leave
the
castle
forever
than
stay
here
where
Umbridge
is
and
I
dont
blame
her
umbridge
was
horrible
to
her
wasnt
she
ive
got
a
feeling
Umbridge
has
only
just
started
being
horrible
said
Hermione
darkly
impossible
said
Ron
who
was
tucking
into
a
large
plate
of
eggs
and
bacon
she
cant
get
any
worse
than
shes
been
already
you
mark
my
words
shes
going
to
want
revenge
on
Dumbledore
for
appointing
a
new
teacher
without
consulting
her
said
Hermione
closing
the
newspaper
especially
another
part-human
you
saw
the
look
on
her
face
when
she
saw
Firenze
after
breakfast
Hermione
departed
for
her
Arithmancy
class
as
Harry
and
Ron
followed
Parvati
and
Lavender
into
the
Entrance
Hall
heading
for
Divination
arent
we
going
up
to
North
Tower
asked
Ron
looking
puzzled
as
Parvati
bypassed
the
marble
staircase
parvati
looked
at
him
scornfully
over
her
shoulder
how
dyou
expect
Firenze
to
climb
that
ladder
were
in
classroom
eleven
now
it
was
on
the
noticeboard
yesterday
classroom
eleven
was
on
the
ground
floor
along
the
corridor
leading
off
the
Entrance
Hall
from
the
opposite
side
to
the
Great
Hall
harry
knew
it
was
one
of
those
classrooms
that
were
never
used
regularly
and
therefore
had
the
slightly
neglected
feeling
of
a
cupboard
or
storeroom
when
he
entered
it
right
behind
Ron
and
found
himself
in
the
middle
of
a
forest
clearing
he
was
therefore
momentarily
stunned
what
the
the
classroom
floor
had
become
springily
mossy
and
trees
were
growing
out
of
it
their
leafy
branches
fanned
across
the
ceiling
and
windows
so
that
the
room
was
full
of
slanting
shafts
of
soft
dappled
green
light
the
students
who
had
already
arrived
were
sitting
on
the
earthy
floor
with
their
backs
resting
against
tree
trunks
or
boulders
arms
wrapped
around
their
knees
or
folded
tightly
across
their
chests
and
all
looking
rather
nervous
in
the
middle
of
the
clearing
where
there
were
no
trees
stood
Firenze
harry
Potter
he
said
holding
out
a
hand
when
Harry
entered
er
hi
said
Harry
shaking
hands
with
the
centaur
who
surveyed
him
unblinkingly
through
those
astonishingly
blue
eyes
but
did
not
smile
er
good
to
see
you
and
you
said
the
centaur
inclining
his
white-blond
head
it
was
foretold
that
we
would
meet
again
harry
noticed
there
was
the
shadow
of
a
hoof-shaped
bruise
on
Firenzes
chest
as
he
turned
to
join
the
rest
of
the
class
on
the
ground
he
saw
they
were
all
looking
at
him
in
awe
apparently
deeply
impressed
that
he
was
on
speaking
terms
with
Firenze
whom
they
seemed
to
find
intimidating
when
the
door
was
closed
and
the
last
student
had
sat
down
on
a
tree
stump
beside
the
wastepaper
basket
Firenze
gestured
around
the
room
professor
Dumbledore
has
kindly
arranged
this
classroom
for
us
said
Firenze
when
everyone
had
settled
down
in
imitation
of
my
natural
habitat
i
would
have
preferred
to
teach
you
in
the
forbidden
Forest
which
was
until
Monday
my
home
but
that
is
no
longer
possible
please
er
sir
said
Parvati
breathlessly
raising
her
hand
why
not
weve
been
in
there
with
Hagrid
were
not
frightened
it
is
not
a
question
of
your
bravery
said
Firenze
but
of
my
position
i
cannot
return
to
the
forest
my
herd
has
banished
me
herd
said
Lavender
in
a
confused
voice
and
Harry
knew
she
was
thinking
of
cows
what
oh
comprehension
dawned
on
her
face
there
are
more
o
f
you
she
said
stunned
did
Hagrid
breed
you
like
the
Thestrals
asked
Dean
eagerly
firenze
turned
his
head
very
slowly
to
face
Dean
who
seemed
to
realize
at
once
that
he
had
said
something
very
offensive
i
didnt
I
meant
sorry
he
finished
in
a
hushed
voice
centaurs
are
not
the
servants
or
playthings
of
humans
said
Firenze
quietly
there
was
a
pause
then
Parvati
raised
her
hand
again
please
sir
why
have
the
other
centaurs
banished
you
because
I
have
agreed
to
work
for
Professor
Dumbledore
said
Firenze
they
see
this
as
a
betrayal
of
our
kind
harry
remembered
how
nearly
four
years
ago
the
centaur
Bane
had
shouted
at
Firenze
for
allowing
Harry
to
ride
to
safety
on
his
back
he
had
called
him
a
common
mule
he
wondered
whether
it
had
been
Bane
who
had
kicked
Firenze
in
the
chest
let
us
begin
said
Firenze
he
swished
his
long
palomino
tail
raised
his
hand
towards
the
leafy
canopy
overhead
then
lowered
it
slowly
and
as
he
did
so
the
light
in
the
room
dimmed
so
that
they
now
seemed
to
be
sitting
in
a
forest
clearing
by
twilight
and
stars
appeared
on
the
ceiling
there
were
oohs
and
gasps
and
Ron
said
audibly
Blimey
lie
back
on
the
floor
said
Firenze
in
his
calm
voice
and
observe
the
heavens
here
is
written
for
those
who
can
see
the
fortune
of
our
races
harry
stretched
out
on
his
back
and
gazed
upwards
at
the
ceiling
a
twinkling
red
star
winked
at
him
from
overhead
i
know
that
you
have
learned
the
names
of
the
planets
and
their
moons
in
Astronomy
said
firenzes
calm
voice
and
that
you
have
mapped
the
stars
progress
through
the
heavens
centaurs
have
unraveled
the
mysteries
of
these
movements
over
centuries
our
findings
teach
us
that
the
future
may
be
glimpsed
in
the
sky
above
us
professor
Trelawney
did
astrology
with
us
said
Parvati
excitedly
raising
her
hand
in
front
of
her
so
that
it
stuck
up
in
the
air
as
she
lay
on
her
back
mars
causes
accidents
and
burns
and
things
like
that
and
when
it
makes
an
angle
to
Saturn
like
now
she
drew
a
right-angle
in
the
air
above
her
that
means
people
need
to
be
extra
careful
when
handling
hot
things
that
said
Firenze
calmly
is
human
nonsense
parvatis
hand
fell
limply
to
her
side
trivial
hurts
tiny
human
accidents
said
Firenze
as
his
hooves
thudded
over
the
mossy
floor
these
are
of
no
more
significance
than
the
scurryings
of
ants
to
the
wide
universe
and
are
unaffected
by
planetary
movements
professor
Trelawney
began
Parvati
in
a
hurt
and
indignant
voice
is
a
human
said
Firenze
simply
and
is
therefore
blinkered
and
fettered
by
the
limitations
of
your
kind
harry
turned
his
head
very
slightly
to
look
at
Parvati
she
looked
very
offended
as
did
several
of
the
people
surrounding
her
sibyll
Trelawney
may
have
Seen
I
do
not
know
continued
Firenze
and
Harry
heard
the
swishing
of
his
tail
again
as
he
walked
up
and
down
before
them
but
she
wastes
her
time
in
the
main
on
the
self-flattering
nonsense
humans
call
fortune-telling
i
however
am
here
to
explain
the
wisdom
of
centaurs
which
is
impersonal
and
impartial
we
watch
the
skies
for
the
great
tides
of
evil
or
change
that
are
sometimes
marked
there
it
may
take
ten
years
to
be
sure
of
what
we
are
seeing
firenze
pointed
to
the
red
star
directly
above
Harry
in
the
past
decade
the
indications
have
been
that
wizardkind
is
living
through
nothing
more
than
a
brief
calm
between
two
wars
mars
bringer
of
battle
shines
brightly
above
us
suggesting
that
the
fight
must
soon
break
out
again
how
soon
centaurs
may
attempt
to
divine
by
the
burning
of
certain
herbs
and
leaves
by
the
observation
of
fume
and
flame
it
was
the
most
unusual
lesson
Harry
had
ever
attended
they
did
indeed
burn
sage
and
mallowsweet
there
on
the
classroom
floor
and
Firenze
told
them
to
look
for
certain
shapes
and
symbols
in
the
pungent
fumes
but
he
seemed
perfectly
unconcerned
that
not
one
of
them
could
see
any
of
the
signs
he
described
telling
them
that
humans
were
hardly
ever
good
at
this
that
it
took
centaurs
years
and
years
to
become
competent
and
finished
by
telling
them
that
it
was
foolish
to
put
too
much
faith
in
such
things
anyway
because
even
centaurs
sometimes
read
them
wrongly
he
was
nothing
like
any
human
teacher
Harry
had
ever
had
his
priority
did
not
seem
to
be
to
teach
them
what
he
knew
but
rather
to
impress
upon
them
that
nothing
not
even
centaurs
knowledge
was
foolproof
hes
not
very
definite
on
anything
is
he
said
Ron
in
a
low
voice
as
they
put
out
their
mallowsweet
fire
i
mean
I
could
do
with
a
few
more
details
about
this
war
were
about
to
have
couldnt
you
the
bell
rang
right
outside
the
classroom
door
and
everyone
jumped
Harry
had
completely
forgotten
they
were
still
inside
the
castle
and
quite
convinced
that
he
was
really
in
the
Forest
the
class
filed
out
looking
slightly
perplexed
harry
and
Ron
were
on
the
point
of
following
them
when
Firenze
called
Harry
Potter
a
word
please
harry
turned
the
centaur
advanced
a
little
towards
him
ron
hesitated
you
may
stay
Firenze
told
him
but
close
the
door
please
ron
hastened
to
obey
harry
Potter
you
are
a
friend
of
Hagrids
are
you
not
said
the
centaur
yes
said
Harry
then
give
him
a
warning
from
me
his
attempt
is
not
working
he
would
do
better
to
abandon
it
his
attempt
is
not
working
harry
repeated
blankly
and
he
would
do
better
to
abandon
it
said
Firenze
nodding
i
would
warn
Hagrid
myself
but
i
am
banished
it
would
be
unwise
for
me
to
go
too
near
the
Forest
now
Hagrid
has
troubles
enough
without
a
centaurs
battle
but
whats
Hagrid
attempting
to
do
said
Harry
nervously
firenze
surveyed
Harry
impassively
hagrid
has
recently
rendered
me
a
great
service
said
Firenze
and
he
has
long
since
earned
my
respect
for
the
care
he
shows
all
living
creatures
i
shall
not
betray
his
secret
but
he
must
be
brought
to
his
senses
the
attempt
is
not
working
tell
him
Harry
Potter
good-day
to
you
the
happiness
Harry
had
felt
in
the
aftermath
of
The
Quibbler
interview
had
long
since
evaporated
as
a
dull
March
blurred
into
a
squally
April
his
life
seemed
to
have
become
one
long
series
of
worries
and
problems
again
umbridge
had
continued
attending
all
Care
of
Magical
Creatures
lessons
so
it
had
been
very
difficult
to
deliver
Firenzes
warning
to
Hagrid
at
last
Harry
had
managed
it
by
pretending
hed
lost
his
copy
of
Fantastic
Beasts
and
Where
to
Find
Them
and
doubling
back
after
class
one
day
when
hed
repeated
Firenzes
words
Hagrid
gazed
at
him
for
a
moment
through
his
puffy
blackened
eyes
apparently
taken
aback
then
he
seemed
to
pull
himself
together
nice
bloke
Firenze
he
said
gruffly
but
he
don
know
what
hes
talkin
abou
on
this
the
attemps
comin
on
fine
hagrid
whatre
you
up
to
asked
Harry
seriously
because
youve
got
to
be
careful
Umbridge
has
already
sacked
Trelawney
and
if
you
ask
me
shes
on
a
roll
if
youre
doing
anything
you
shouldnt
be
youll
be
theres
things
more
importan
than
keepin
a
job
said
Hagrid
though
his
hands
shook
slightly
as
he
said
this
and
a
basin
full
of
Knarl
droppings
crashed
to
the
floor
don
worry
abou
me
harry
jus
get
along
now
theres
a
good
lad
harry
had
no
choice
but
to
leave
Hagrid
mopping
up
the
dung
all
over
his
floor
but
he
felt
thoroughly
dispirited
as
he
trudged
back
up
to
the
castle
meanwhile
as
the
teachers
and
Hermione
persisted
in
reminding
them
the
OWLs
were
drawing
ever
nearer
all
the
fifth-years
were
suffering
from
stress
to
some
degree
but
Hannah
Abbott
became
the
first
to
receive
a
Calming
Draught
from
Madam
Pomfrey
after
she
burst
into
tears
during
Herbology
and
sobbed
that
she
was
too
stupid
to
take
exams
and
wanted
to
leave
school
now
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
D
a.
lessons
Harry
thought
he
would
have
been
extremely
unhappy
he
sometimes
felt
he
was
living
for
the
hours
he
spent
in
the
Room
of
Requirement
working
hard
but
thoroughly
enjoying
himself
at
the
same
time
swelling
with
pride
as
he
looked
around
at
his
fellow
D
a.
members
and
saw
how
far
they
had
come
indeed
Harry
sometimes
wondered
how
Umbridge
was
going
to
react
when
all
the
members
of
the
D
a.
received
Outstanding
in
their
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
OWLs
they
had
finally
started
work
on
Patronuses
which
everybody
had
been
very
keen
to
practice
though
as
Harry
kept
reminding
them
producing
a
Patronus
in
the
middle
of
a
brightly
lit
classroom
when
they
were
not
under
threat
was
very
different
from
producing
it
when
confronted
by
something
like
a
Dementor
oh
dont
be
such
a
killjoy
said
Cho
brightly
watching
her
silvery
swan-shaped
Patronus
soar
around
the
Room
of
Requirement
during
their
last
lesson
before
Easter
theyre
so
pretty
theyre
not
supposed
to
be
pretty
theyre
supposed
to
protect
you
said
Harry
patiently
what
we
really
need
is
a
Boggart
or
something
thats
how
I
learned
I
had
to
conjure
a
Patronus
while
the
Boggart
was
pretending
to
be
a
Dementor
but
that
would
be
really
scary
said
Lavender
who
was
shooting
puffs
of
silver
vapour
out
of
the
end
of
her
wand
and
I
still
cant
do
it
she
added
angrily
neville
was
having
trouble
too
his
face
was
screwed
up
in
concentration
but
only
feeble
wisps
of
silver
smoke
issued
from
his
wand
tip
youve
got
to
think
of
something
happy
Harry
reminded
him
im
trying
said
Neville
miserably
who
was
trying
so
hard
his
round
face
was
actually
shining
with
sweat
harry
I
think
Im
doing
it
yelled
Seamus
who
had
been
brought
along
to
his
first
ever
D
meeting
by
Dean
look
ah
its
gone
but
it
was
definitely
something
hairy
Harry
hermiones
Patronus
a
shining
silver
otter
was
gamboling
around
her
they
are
sort
of
nice
arent
they
she
said
looking
at
it
fondly
the
door
of
the
Room
of
Requirement
opened
and
closed
harry
looked
round
to
see
who
had
entered
but
there
did
not
seem
to
be
anybody
there
it
was
a
few
moments
before
he
realized
that
the
people
close
to
the
door
had
fallen
silent
next
thing
he
knew
something
was
tugging
at
his
robes
somewhere
near
the
knee
he
looked
down
and
saw
to
his
very
great
astonishment
Dobby
the
house-elf
peering
up
at
him
from
beneath
his
usual
eight
woolly
hats
hi
Dobby
he
said
what
are
you
Whats
wrong
the
elfs
eyes
were
wide
with
terror
and
he
was
shaking
the
members
of
the
D
a.
closest
to
harry
had
fallen
silent
everybody
in
the
room
was
watching
Dobby
the
few
Patronuses
people
had
managed
to
conjure
faded
away
into
silver
mist
leaving
the
room
looking
much
darker
than
before
harry
Potter
sir
squeaked
the
elf
trembling
from
head
to
foot
Harry
Potter
sir
dobby
has
come
to
warn
you
but
the
house-elves
have
been
warned
not
to
tell
he
ran
head-first
at
the
wall
harry
who
had
some
experience
of
Dobbys
habits
of
self
punishment
made
to
seize
him
but
Dobby
merely
bounced
off
the
stone
cushioned
by
his
eight
hats
hermione
and
a
few
of
the
other
girls
let
out
squeaks
of
fear
and
sympathy
whats
happened
Dobby
harry
asked
grabbing
the
elfs
tiny
arm
and
holding
him
away
from
anything
with
which
he
might
seek
to
hurt
himself
harry
Potter
she
she
dobby
hit
himself
hard
on
the
nose
with
his
free
fist
harry
seized
that
too
whos
she
Dobby
but
he
thought
he
knew
surely
only
one
she
could
induce
such
fear
in
Dobby
the
elf
looked
up
at
him
slightly
cross-eyed
and
mouthed
wordlessly
umbridge
asked
Harry
horrified
dobby
nodded
then
tried
to
bang
his
head
on
Harrys
knees
harry
held
him
at
arms
length
what
about
her
dobby
she
hasnt
found
out
about
this
about
us
about
the
D
he
read
the
answer
in
the
elfs
stricken
face
his
hands
held
fast
by
Harry
the
elf
tried
to
kick
himself
and
fell
to
the
floor
is
she
coming
harry
asked
quietly
dobby
let
out
a
howl
and
began
beating
his
bare
feet
hard
on
the
floor
yes
Harry
Potter
yes
harry
straightened
up
and
looked
around
at
the
motionless
terrified
people
gazing
at
the
thrashing
elf
what
are
you
waiting
for
harry
bellowed
run
they
all
pelted
towards
the
exit
at
once
forming
a
scrum
at
the
door
then
people
burst
through
harry
could
hear
them
sprinting
along
the
corridors
and
hoped
they
had
the
sense
not
to
try
and
make
it
all
the
way
to
their
dormitories
it
was
only
ten
to
nine
if
they
just
took
refuge
in
the
library
or
the
Owlery
which
were
both
nearer
harry
come
on
shrieked
Hermione
from
the
center
of
the
knot
of
people
now
fighting
to
get
out
he
scooped
up
Dobby
who
was
still
attempting
to
do
himself
serious
injury
and
ran
with
the
elf
in
his
arms
to
join
the
back
of
the
queue
dobby
this
is
an
order
get
back
down
to
the
kitchen
with
the
other
elves
and
if
she
asks
you
whether
you
warned
me
lie
and
say
no
said
Harry
and
I
forbid
you
to
hurt
yourself
he
added
dropping
the
elf
as
he
made
it
over
the
threshold
at
last
and
slammed
the
door
behind
him
thank
you
Harry
Potter
squeaked
Dobby
and
he
streaked
off
harry
glanced
left
and
right
the
others
were
all
moving
so
fast
he
caught
only
glimpses
of
flying
heels
at
either
end
of
the
corridor
before
they
vanished
he
started
to
run
right
there
was
a
boys
bathroom
up
ahead
he
could
pretend
hed
been
in
there
all
the
time
if
he
could
just
reach
it
aaargh
something
caught
him
around
the
ankles
and
he
fell
spectacularly
skidding
along
on
his
front
for
six
feet
before
coming
to
a
halt
someone
behind
him
was
laughing
he
rolled
over
on
to
his
back
and
saw
Malfoy
concealed
in
a
niche
beneath
an
ugly
dragon-shaped
vase
trip
Jinx
Potter
he
said
hey
Professor
professor
ive
got
one
umbridge
came
bustling
round
the
far
corner
breathless
but
wearing
a
delighted
smile
its
him
she
said
jubilantly
at
the
sight
of
Harry
on
the
floor
excellent
Draco
excellent
oh
very
good
fifty
points
to
Slytherin
ill
take
him
from
here
stand
up
Potter
harry
got
to
his
feet
glaring
at
the
pair
of
them
he
had
never
seen
Umbridge
looking
so
happy
she
seized
his
arm
in
a
vice-like
grip
and
turned
beaming
broadly
to
Malfoy
you
hop
along
and
see
if
you
can
round
up
any
more
of
them
Draco
she
said
tell
the
others
to
look
in
the
library
anybody
out
of
breath
check
the
bathrooms
Miss
Parkinson
can
do
the
girls
ones
off
you
go
and
you
she
added
in
her
softest
most
dangerous
voice
as
Malfoy
walked
away
you
can
come
with
me
to
the
Headmasters
office
Potter
they
were
at
the
stone
gargoyle
within
minutes
harry
wondered
how
many
of
the
others
had
been
caught
he
thought
of
Ron
Mrs
weasley
would
kill
him
and
of
how
Hermione
would
feel
if
she
was
expelled
before
she
could
take
her
owls.
And
it
had
been
Seamuss
very
first
meeting
and
Neville
had
been
getting
so
good
fizzing
Whizzbee
sang
Umbridge
the
stone
gargoyle
jumped
aside
the
wall
behind
split
open
and
they
ascended
the
moving
stone
staircase
they
reached
the
polished
door
with
the
griffin
knocker
but
Umbridge
did
not
bother
to
knock
she
strode
straight
inside
still
holding
tight
to
Harry
the
office
was
full
of
people
dumbledore
was
sitting
behind
his
desk
his
expression
serene
the
tips
of
his
long
fingers
together
professor
McGonagall
stood
rigidly
beside
him
her
face
extremely
tense
cornelius
Fudge
Minister
for
Magic
was
rocking
backwards
and
forwards
on
his
toes
beside
the
fire
apparently
immensely
pleased
with
the
situation
Kingsley
Shacklebolt
and
a
tough-looking
wizard
with
very
short
wiry
hair
whom
Harry
did
not
recognize
were
positioned
on
either
side
of
the
door
like
guards
and
the
freckled
bespectacled
form
of
Percy
weasley
hovered
excitedly
beside
the
wall
a
quill
and
a
heavy
scroll
of
parchment
in
his
hands
apparently
poised
to
take
notes
the
portraits
of
old
headmasters
and
headmistresses
were
not
shamming
sleep
tonight
all
of
them
were
alert
and
serious
watching
what
was
happening
below
them
as
Harry
entered
a
few
flitted
into
neighboring
frames
and
whispered
urgently
into
their
neighbors
ear
harry
pulled
himself
free
of
Umbridges
grasp
as
the
door
swung
shut
behind
them
cornelius
fudge
was
glaring
at
him
with
a
kind
of
vicious
satisfaction
on
his
face
well
he
said
well
well
well
harry
replied
with
the
dirtiest
look
he
could
muster
his
heart
drummed
madly
inside
him
but
his
brain
was
oddly
cool
and
clear
he
was
heading
back
to
Gryffindor
Tower
said
Umbridge
there
was
an
indecent
excitement
in
her
voice
the
same
callous
pleasure
Harry
had
heard
as
she
watched
Professor
Trelawney
dissolving
with
misery
in
the
Entrance
Hall
the
Malfoy
boy
cornered
him
did
he
did
he
said
Fudge
appreciatively
i
must
remember
to
tell
Lucius
well
Potter
expect
you
know
why
you
are
here
harry
fully
intended
to
respond
with
a
defiant
yes
his
mouth
had
opened
and
the
word
was
half-formed
when
he
caught
sight
of
Dumbledores
face
dumbledore
was
not
looking
directly
at
harry
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
a
point
just
over
his
shoulder
but
as
Harry
stared
at
him
he
shook
his
head
a
fraction
of
an
inch
to
each
side
harry
changed
direction
mid-word
yeno
i
beg
your
pardon
said
Fudge
no
said
Harry
firmly
you
dont
know
why
you
are
here
no
I
dont
said
Harry
fudge
looked
incredulously
from
Harry
to
Professor
Umbridge
harry
took
advantage
of
his
momentary
inattention
to
steal
another
quick
look
at
Dumbledore
who
gave
the
carpet
the
tiniest
of
nods
and
the
shadow
of
a
wink
so
you
have
no
idea
said
Fudge
in
a
voice
positively
sagging
with
sarcasm
why
Professor
umbridge
has
brought
you
to
this
office
you
are
not
aware
that
you
have
broken
any
school
rules
school
rules
said
Harry
no
or
Ministry
Decrees
amended
Fudge
angrily
not
that
Im
aware
of
said
Harry
blandly
his
heart
was
still
hammering
very
fast
it
was
almost
worth
telling
these
lies
to
watch
Fudges
blood
pressure
rising
but
he
could
not
see
how
on
earth
he
would
get
away
with
them
if
somebody
had
tipped
off
Umbridge
about
the
D
a.
then
he
the
leader
might
as
well
be
packing
his
trunk
right
now
so
its
news
to
you
is
it
said
Fudge
his
voice
now
thick
with
anger
that
an
illegal
student
organization
has
been
discovered
within
this
school
yes
it
is
said
Harry
hoisting
an
unconvincing
look
of
innocent
surprise
on
to
his
face
i
think
Minister
said
Umbridge
silkily
from
beside
him
we
might
make
better
progress
if
I
fetch
our
informant
yes
yes
do
said
Fudge
nodding
and
he
glanced
maliciously
at
Dumbledore
as
Umbridge
left
the
room
theres
nothing
like
a
good
witness
is
t
here
Dumbledore
nothing
at
all
Cornelius
said
Dumbledore
gravely
inclining
his
head
there
was
a
wait
of
several
minutes
in
which
nobody
looked
at
each
other
then
Harry
heard
the
door
open
behind
him
umbridge
moved
past
him
into
the
room
gripping
by
the
shoulder
Chos
curly-haired
friend
Marietta
who
was
hiding
her
face
in
her
hands
dont
be
scared
dear
dont
be
frightened
said
Professor
Umbridge
softly
patting
her
on
the
back
its
quite
all
right
now
you
have
done
the
right
thing
the
Minister
is
very
pleased
with
you
hell
be
telling
your
mother
what
a
good
girl
youve
been
mariettas
mother
Minister
she
added
looking
up
at
Fudge
is
Madam
Edgecombe
from
the
department
of
Magical
Transportation
Floo
Network
office
shes
been
helping
us
police
the
hogwarts
fires
you
know
jolly
good
jolly
good
said
Fudge
heartily
like
mother
like
daughter
eh
well
come
on
now
dear
look
up
dont
be
shy
lets
hear
what
youve
got
to
galloping
gargoyles
as
Marietta
raised
her
head
Fudge
leapt
backwards
in
shock
nearly
landing
himself
in
the
fire
he
cursed
and
stamped
on
the
hem
of
his
cloak
which
had
started
to
smoke
marietta
gave
a
wail
and
pulled
the
neck
of
her
robes
right
up
to
her
eyes
but
not
before
everyone
had
seen
that
her
face
was
horribly
disfigured
by
a
series
of
close-set
purple
pustules
that
had
spread
across
her
nose
and
cheeks
to
form
the
word
sneak
never
mind
the
spots
now
dear
said
Umbridge
impatiently
just
take
your
robes
away
from
your
mouth
and
tell
the
Minister
but
Marietta
gave
another
muffled
wail
and
shook
her
head
frantically
oh
very
well
you
silly
girl
Ill
tell
him
snapped
Umbridge
she
hitched
her
sickly
smile
back
on
to
her
face
and
said
Well
Minister
Miss
Edgecombe
here
came
to
my
office
shortly
after
dinner
this
evening
and
told
me
she
had
something
she
wanted
to
tell
me
she
said
that
if
I
proceeded
to
a
secret
room
on
the
seventh
floor
sometimes
known
as
the
Room
of
Requirement
i
would
find
out
something
to
my
advantage
i
questioned
her
a
little
further
and
she
admitted
that
there
was
to
be
some
kind
of
meeting
there
unfortunately
at
that
point
this
hex
she
waved
impatiently
at
Mariettas
concealed
face
came
into
operation
and
upon
catching
sight
of
her
face
in
my
mirror
the
girl
became
too
distressed
to
tell
me
any
more
well
now
said
Fudge
fixing
Marietta
with
what
he
evidently
imagined
was
a
kind
and
fatherly
look
it
is
very
brave
of
you
my
dear
coming
to
tell
Professor
Umbridge
you
did
exactly
the
right
thing
now
will
you
tell
me
what
happened
at
this
meeting
what
was
its
purpose
who
was
there
but
Marietta
would
not
speak
she
merely
shook
her
head
again
her
eyes
wide
and
fearful
havent
we
got
a
counter-jinx
for
this
fudge
asked
Umbridge
impatiently
gesturing
at
mariettas
face
so
she
can
speak
freely
i
have
not
yet
managed
to
find
one
Umbridge
admitted
grudgingly
and
Harry
felt
a
surge
of
pride
in
Hermiones
jinxing
ability
but
it
doesnt
matter
if
she
wont
speak
I
can
take
up
the
story
from
here
you
will
remember
Minister
that
I
sent
you
a
report
back
in
October
that
Potter
had
met
a
number
of
fellow
students
in
the
Hogs
Head
in
Hogsmeade
and
what
is
your
evidence
for
that
cut
in
Professor
McGonagall
i
have
testimony
from
Willy
Widdershins
Minerva
who
happened
to
be
in
the
bar
at
the
time
he
was
heavily
bandaged
it
is
true
but
his
hearing
was
quite
unimpaired
said
Umbridge
smugly
he
heard
every
word
Potter
said
and
hastened
straight
to
the
school
to
report
to
me
oh
so
thats
why
he
wasnt
prosecuted
for
setting
up
all
those
regurgitating
toilets
said
professor
McGonagall
raising
her
eyebrows
what
an
interesting
insight
into
our
justice
system
blatant
corruption
roared
the
portrait
of
the
corpulent
red-nosed
wizard
on
the
wall
behind
dumbledores
desk
the
Ministry
did
not
cut
deals
with
petty
criminals
in
my
day
no
sir
they
did
not
thank
you
Fortescue
that
will
do
said
Dumbledore
softly
the
purpose
of
Potters
meeting
with
these
students
continued
Professor
Umbridge
was
to
persuade
them
to
join
an
illegal
society
whose
aim
was
to
learn
spells
and
curses
the
Ministry
has
decided
are
inappropriate
for
school-age
i
think
youll
find
youre
wrong
there
Dolores
said
Dumbledore
quietly
peering
at
her
over
the
half-moon
spectacles
perched
halfway
down
his
crooked
nose
harry
stared
at
him
he
could
not
see
how
Dumbledore
was
going
to
talk
him
out
of
this
one
if
willy
Widdershins
had
indeed
heard
every
word
he
had
said
in
the
Hogs
Head
there
was
simply
no
escaping
it
oho
said
Fudge
bouncing
up
and
down
on
the
balls
of
his
feet
again
yes
do
lets
hear
the
latest
cock-and-bull
story
designed
to
pull
Potter
out
of
trouble
go
on
then
Dumbledore
go
on
Willy
Widdershins
was
lying
was
he
or
was
it
Potters
identical
twin
in
the
Hogs
Head
that
day
or
is
there
the
usual
simple
explanation
involving
a
reversal
of
time
a
dead
man
coming
back
to
life
and
a
couple
of
invisible
Dementors
percy
Weasley
let
out
a
hearty
laugh
oh
very
good
Minister
very
good
harry
could
have
kicked
him
then
he
saw
to
his
astonishment
that
Dumbledore
was
smiling
gently
too
cornelius
I
do
not
deny
and
nor
I
am
sure
does
Harry
that
he
was
in
the
Hogs
Head
that
day
nor
that
he
was
trying
to
recruit
students
to
a
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
group
i
am
merely
pointing
out
that
Dolores
is
quite
wrong
to
suggest
that
such
a
group
was
at
that
time
illegal
if
you
remember
the
Ministry
Decree
banning
all
student
societies
was
not
put
into
effect
until
two
days
after
Harrys
Hogsmeade
meeting
so
he
was
not
breaking
any
rules
at
all
in
the
hogs
Head
percy
looked
as
though
he
had
been
struck
in
the
face
by
something
very
heavy
fudge
remained
motionless
in
mid-bounce
his
mouth
hanging
open
umbridge
recovered
first
thats
all
very
fine
Headmaster
she
said
smiling
sweetly
but
we
are
now
nearly
six
months
on
from
the
introduction
of
Educational
Decree
Number
twenty-four
if
the
first
meeting
was
not
illegal
all
those
that
have
happened
since
most
certainly
are
well
said
Dumbledore
surveying
her
with
polite
interest
over
the
top
of
his
interlocked
fingers
they
certainly
would
be
if
they
had
continued
after
the
Decree
came
into
effect
do
you
have
any
evidence
that
any
such
meetings
continued
as
Dumbledore
spoke
Harry
heard
a
rustle
behind
him
and
rather
thought
Kingsley
whispered
something
he
could
have
sworn
too
that
he
felt
something
brush
against
his
side
a
gentle
something
like
a
draught
or
bird
wings
but
looking
down
he
saw
nothing
there
evidence
repeated
Umbridge
with
that
horrible
wide
toad-like
smile
have
you
not
been
listening
Dumbledore
why
do
you
think
Miss
Edgecombe
is
here
oh
can
she
tell
us
about
six
months
worth
of
meetings
said
Dumbledore
raising
his
eyebrows
i
was
under
the
impression
that
she
was
merely
reporting
a
meeting
tonight
miss
Edgecombe
said
Umbridge
at
once
tell
us
how
long
these
meetings
have
been
going
on
dear
you
can
simply
nod
or
shake
your
head
Im
sure
that
wont
make
the
spots
worse
have
they
been
happening
regularly
over
the
last
six
months
harry
felt
a
horrible
plummeting
in
his
stomach
this
was
it
they
had
hit
a
dead
end
of
solid
evidence
that
not
even
Dumbledore
would
be
able
to
shift
aside
just
nod
or
shake
your
head
dear
Umbridge
said
coaxingly
to
Marietta
come
on
now
that
wont
re-activate
the
jinx
everyone
in
the
room
was
gazing
at
the
top
of
Mariettas
face
only
her
eyes
were
visible
between
the
pulled-up
robes
and
her
curly
fringe
perhaps
it
was
a
trick
of
the
firelight
but
her
eyes
looked
oddly
blank
and
then
to
Harrys
utter
amazement
Marietta
shook
her
head
umbridge
looked
quickly
at
Fudge
then
back
at
Marietta
i
dont
think
you
understood
the
question
did
you
dear
im
asking
whether
youve
been
going
to
these
meetings
for
the
past
six
months
you
have
havent
you
again
Marietta
shook
her
head
what
do
you
mean
by
shaking
your
head
dear
said
Umbridge
in
a
testy
voice
i
would
have
thought
her
meaning
was
quite
clear
said
Professor
McGonagall
harshly
there
have
been
no
secret
meetings
for
the
past
six
months
is
that
correct
Miss
Edgecombe
marietta
nodded
but
there
was
a
meeting
tonight
said
Umbridge
furiously
there
was
a
meeting
Miss
edgecombe
you
told
me
about
it
in
the
Room
of
Requirement
and
Potter
was
the
leader
was
he
not
Potter
organized
it
Potter
why
are
you
shaking
your
head
girl
well
usually
when
a
person
shakes
their
head
said
McGonagall
coldly
they
mean
no
so
unless
Miss
Edgecombe
is
using
a
form
of
sign-language
as
yet
unknown
to
humans
professor
Umbridge
seized
Marietta
pulled
her
round
to
face
her
and
began
shaking
her
very
hard
a
split
second
later
Dumbledore
was
on
his
feet
his
wand
raised
Kingsley
started
forwards
and
Umbridge
leapt
back
from
Marietta
waving
her
hands
in
the
air
as
though
they
had
been
burned
i
cannot
allow
you
to
manhandle
my
students
Dolores
said
Dumbledore
and
for
the
first
time
he
looked
angry
you
want
to
calm
yourself
Madam
Umbridge
said
Kingsley
in
his
deep
slow
voice
you
dont
want
to
get
yourself
into
trouble
now
no
said
Umbridge
breathlessly
glancing
up
at
the
towering
figure
of
Kingsley
i
mean
yes
youre
right
Shacklebolt
I
I
forgot
myself
marietta
was
standing
exactly
where
Umbridge
had
released
her
she
seemed
neither
perturbed
by
Umbridges
sudden
attack
nor
relieved
by
her
release
she
was
still
clutching
her
robe
up
to
her
oddly
blank
eyes
and
staring
straight
ahead
of
her
a
sudden
suspicion
connected
to
Kingsleys
whisper
and
the
thing
he
had
felt
shoot
past
him
sprang
into
Harrys
mind
dolores
said
Fudge
with
the
air
of
trying
to
settle
something
once
and
for
all
the
meeting
tonight
the
one
we
know
definitely
happened
yes
said
Umbridge
pulling
herself
together
yes
well
Miss
Edgecombe
tipped
me
off
and
I
proceeded
at
once
to
the
seventh
floor
accompanied
by
certain
trustworthy
students
so
as
to
catch
those
in
the
meeting
red-handed
it
appears
that
they
were
forewarned
of
my
arrival
however
because
when
we
reached
the
seventh
floor
they
were
running
in
every
direction
it
does
not
matter
however
i
have
all
their
names
here
Miss
Parkinson
ran
into
the
Room
of
requirement
for
me
to
see
if
they
had
left
anything
behind
we
needed
evidence
and
the
room
provided
and
to
Harrys
horror
she
withdrew
from
her
pocket
the
list
of
names
that
had
been
pinned
upon
the
Room
of
Requirements
wall
and
handed
it
to
Fudge
the
moment
I
saw
Potters
name
on
the
list
I
knew
what
we
were
dealing
with
she
said
softly
excellent
said
Fudge
a
smile
spreading
across
his
face
excellent
Dolores
and
by
thunder
he
looked
up
at
Dumbledore
who
was
still
standing
beside
Marietta
his
wand
held
loosely
in
his
hand
see
what
theyve
named
themselves
said
Fudge
quietly
dumbledores
Army
dumbledore
reached
out
and
took
the
piece
of
parchment
from
Fudge
he
gazed
at
the
heading
scribbled
by
Hermione
months
before
and
for
a
moment
seemed
unable
to
speak
then
he
looked
up
smiling
well
the
game
is
up
he
said
simply
would
you
like
a
written
confession
from
me
Cornelius
or
will
a
statement
before
these
witnesses
suffice
harry
saw
McGonagall
and
Kingsley
look
at
each
other
there
was
fear
in
both
faces
he
did
not
understand
what
was
going
on
and
nor
apparently
did
Fudge
statement
said
Fudge
slowly
what
I
dont
dumbledores
Army
Cornelius
said
Dumbledore
still
smiling
as
he
waved
the
list
of
names
before
Fudges
face
not
Potters
Army
dumbledores
Army
but
but
understanding
blazed
suddenly
in
Fudges
face
he
took
a
horrified
step
backwards
yelped
and
jumped
out
of
the
fire
again
you
he
whispered
stamping
again
on
his
smouldering
cloak
thats
right
said
Dumbledore
pleasantly
you
organized
this
i
did
said
Dumbledore
you
recruited
these
students
for
for
your
army
tonight
was
supposed
to
be
the
first
meeting
said
Dumbledore
nodding
merely
to
see
whether
they
would
be
interested
in
joining
me
i
see
now
that
it
was
a
mistake
to
invite
Miss
edgecombe
of
course
marietta
nodded
fudge
looked
from
her
to
Dumbledore
his
chest
swelling
then
you
have
been
plotting
against
me
he
yelled
thats
right
said
Dumbledore
cheerfully
no
shouted
Harry
kingsley
flashed
a
look
of
warning
at
him
McGonagall
widened
her
eyes
threateningly
but
it
had
suddenly
dawned
on
Harry
what
Dumbledore
was
about
to
do
and
he
could
not
let
it
happen
no
Professor
Dumbledore
be
quiet
Harry
or
I
am
afraid
you
will
have
to
leave
my
office
said
Dumbledore
calmly
yes
shut
up
Potter
barked
Fudge
who
was
still
ogling
Dumbledore
with
a
kind
of
horrified
delight
well
well
well
I
came
here
tonight
expecting
to
expel
Potter
and
instead
instead
you
get
to
arrest
me
said
Dumbledore
smiling
its
like
losing
a
Knut
and
finding
a
galleon
isnt
it
weasley
cried
Fudge
now
positively
quivering
with
delight
Weasley
have
you
written
it
all
down
everything
hes
said
his
confession
have
you
got
it
yes
sir
I
think
so
sir
said
Percy
eagerly
whose
nose
was
splattered
with
ink
from
the
speed
of
his
note-taking
the
bit
about
how
hes
been
trying
to
build
up
an
army
against
the
Ministry
how
hes
been
working
to
destabilize
me
yes
sir
Ive
got
it
yes
said
Percy
scanning
his
notes
joyfully
very
well
then
said
Fudge
now
radiant
with
glee
duplicate
your
notes
Weasley
and
send
a
copy
to
the
Daily
Prophet
at
once
if
we
send
a
fast
owl
we
should
make
the
morning
edition
percy
dashed
from
the
room
slamming
the
door
behind
him
and
Fudge
turned
back
to
dumbledore
you
will
now
be
escorted
back
to
the
Ministry
where
you
will
be
formally
charged
then
sent
to
Azkaban
to
await
trial
ah
said
Dumbledore
gently
yes
yes
I
thought
we
might
hit
that
little
snag
snag
said
Fudge
his
voice
still
vibrating
with
joy
i
see
no
snag
Dumbledore
well
said
Dumbledore
apologetically
Im
afraid
I
do
oh
really
well
its
just
that
you
seem
to
be
laboring
under
the
delusion
that
I
am
going
to
what
is
the
phrase
come
quietly
i
am
afraid
I
am
not
going
to
come
quietly
at
all
Cornelius
i
have
absolutely
no
intention
of
being
sent
to
Azkaban
i
could
break
out
of
course
but
what
a
waste
of
time
and
frankly
I
can
think
of
a
whole
host
of
things
I
would
rather
be
doing
umbridges
face
was
growing
steadily
redder
she
looked
as
though
she
was
being
filled
with
boiling
water
fudge
stared
at
Dumbledore
with
a
very
silly
expression
on
his
face
as
though
he
had
just
been
stunned
by
a
sudden
blow
and
could
not
quite
believe
it
had
happened
he
made
a
small
choking
noise
then
looked
round
at
Kingsley
and
the
man
with
short
grey
hair
who
alone
of
everyone
in
the
room
had
remained
entirely
silent
so
far
the
latter
gave
Fudge
a
reassuring
nod
and
moved
forwards
a
little
away
from
the
wall
harry
saw
his
hand
drift
almost
casually
towards
his
pocket
dont
be
silly
Dawlish
said
Dumbledore
kindly
im
sure
you
are
an
excellent
Auror
I
seem
to
remember
that
you
achieved
Outstanding
in
all
your
newt
s
but
if
you
attempt
to
er
bring
me
in
by
force
I
will
have
to
hurt
you
the
man
called
Dawlish
blinked
rather
foolishly
he
looked
towards
Fudge
again
but
this
time
seemed
to
be
hoping
for
a
clue
as
to
what
to
do
next
so
sneered
Fudge
recovering
himself
you
intend
to
take
on
Dawlish
Shacklebolt
Dolores
and
myself
single-handed
do
you
Dumbledore
merlins
beard
no
said
Dumbledore
smiling
not
unless
you
are
foolish
enough
to
force
me
to
he
will
not
be
single-handed
said
Professor
McGonagall
loudly
plunging
her
hand
inside
her
robes
oh
yes
he
will
Minerva
said
Dumbledore
sharply
hogwarts
needs
you
enough
of
this
rubbish
said
Fudge
pulling
out
his
own
wand
dawlish
shacklebolt
take
him
a
streak
of
silver
light
flashed
around
the
room
there
was
a
bang
like
a
gunshot
and
the
floor
trembled
a
hand
grabbed
the
scruff
of
Harrys
neck
and
forced
him
down
on
the
floor
as
a
second
silver
flash
went
off
several
of
the
portraits
yelled
Fawkes
screeched
and
a
cloud
of
dust
filled
the
air
coughing
in
the
dust
Harry
saw
a
dark
figure
fall
to
the
ground
with
a
crash
in
front
of
him
there
was
a
shriek
and
a
thud
and
somebody
cried
No
then
there
was
the
sound
of
breaking
glass
frantically
scuffling
footsteps
a
groan
and
silence
harry
struggled
around
to
see
who
was
half-strangling
him
and
saw
Professor
McGonagall
crouched
beside
him
she
had
forced
both
him
and
Marietta
out
of
harms
way
dust
was
still
floating
gently
down
through
the
air
on
to
them
panting
slightly
Harry
saw
a
very
tall
figure
moving
towards
them
are
you
all
right
dumbledore
asked
yes
said
Professor
McGonagall
getting
up
and
dragging
Harry
and
Marietta
with
her
the
dust
was
clearing
the
wreckage
of
the
office
loomed
into
view
Dumbledores
desk
had
been
overturned
all
of
the
spindly
tables
had
been
knocked
to
the
floor
their
silver
instruments
in
pieces
fudge
Umbridge
Kingsley
and
Dawlish
lay
motionless
on
the
floor
fawkes
the
phoenix
soared
in
wide
circles
above
them
singing
softly
unfortunately
I
had
to
hex
Kingsley
too
or
it
would
have
looked
very
suspicious
said
dumbledore
in
a
low
voice
he
was
remarkably
quick
on
the
uptake
modifying
Miss
edgecombes
memory
like
that
while
everyone
was
looking
the
other
way
thank
him
for
me
wont
you
Minerva
now
they
will
all
awake
very
soon
and
it
will
be
best
if
they
do
not
know
that
we
had
time
to
communicate
you
must
act
as
though
no
time
has
passed
as
though
they
were
merely
knocked
to
the
ground
they
will
not
remember
where
will
you
go
Dumbledore
whispered
Professor
McGonagall
grimmauld
Place
oh
no
said
Dumbledore
with
a
grim
smile
I
am
not
leaving
to
go
into
hiding
fudge
will
soon
wish
hed
never
dislodged
me
from
Hogwarts
I
promise
you
professor
Dumbledore
harry
began
he
did
not
know
what
to
say
first
how
sorry
he
was
that
he
had
started
the
D
a.
in
the
first
place
and
caused
all
this
trouble
or
how
terrible
he
felt
that
Dumbledore
was
leaving
to
save
him
from
expulsion
but
Dumbledore
cut
him
off
before
he
could
say
another
word
listen
to
me
Harry
he
said
urgently
you
must
study
Occlumency
as
hard
as
you
can
do
you
understand
me
do
everything
Professor
Snape
tells
you
and
practice
it
particularly
every
night
before
sleeping
so
that
you
can
close
your
mind
to
bad
dreams
you
will
understand
why
soon
enough
but
you
must
promise
me
the
man
called
Dawlish
was
stirring
dumbledore
seized
Harrys
wrist
remember
close
your
mind
but
as
Dumbledores
fingers
closed
over
Harrys
skin
a
pain
shot
through
the
scar
on
his
forehead
and
he
felt
again
that
terrible
snakelike
longing
to
strike
Dumbledore
to
bite
him
to
hurt
him
you
will
understand
whispered
Dumbledore
fawkes
circled
the
office
and
swooped
low
over
him
dumbledore
released
Harry
raised
his
hand
and
grasped
the
phoenixs
long
golden
tail
there
was
a
flash
of
fire
and
the
pair
of
them
were
gone
where
is
he
yelled
Fudge
pushing
himself
up
from
the
floor
where
is
he
i
dont
know
shouted
Kingsley
also
leaping
to
his
feet
well
he
cant
have
Disapparated
cried
Umbridge
you
cant
do
it
from
inside
this
school
the
stairs
cried
Dawlish
and
he
flung
himself
upon
the
door
wrenched
it
open
and
disappeared
followed
closely
by
Kingsley
and
Umbridge
fudge
hesitated
then
got
slowly
to
his
feet
brushing
dust
from
his
front
there
was
a
long
and
painful
silence
well
Minerva
said
Fudge
nastily
straightening
his
torn
shirtsleeve
Im
afraid
this
is
the
end
of
your
friend
Dumbledore
you
think
so
do
you
said
Professor
McGonagall
scornfully
fudge
seemed
not
to
hear
her
he
was
looking
around
at
the
wrecked
office
a
few
of
the
portraits
hissed
at
him
one
or
two
even
made
rude
hand
gestures
youd
better
get
those
two
off
to
bed
said
Fudge
looking
back
at
Professor
McGonagall
with
a
dismissive
nod
towards
Harry
and
Marietta
professor
McGonagall
said
nothing
but
marched
Harry
and
Marietta
to
the
door
as
it
swung
closed
behind
them
Harry
heard
Phineas
Nigelluss
voice

matter
where
harry
went
within
the
castle
the
sole
topic
of
conversation
was
Dumbledores
flight
and
though
some
of
the
details
may
have
gone
awry
in
the
retelling
Harry
overheard
one
second-year
girl
assuring
another
that
Fudge
was
now
lying
in
st.
Mungos
with
a
pumpkin
for
a
head
it
was
surprising
how
accurate
the
rest
of
their
information
was
everybody
knew
for
instance
that
harry
and
Marietta
were
the
only
students
to
have
witnessed
the
scene
in
Dumbledores
office
and
as
Marietta
was
now
in
the
hospital
wing
Harry
found
himself
besieged
with
requests
to
give
a
first-hand
account
dumbledore
will
be
back
before
long
said
Ernie
Macmillan
confidently
on
the
way
back
from
herbology
after
listening
intently
to
Harrys
story
they
couldnt
keep
him
away
in
our
second
year
and
they
wont
be
able
to
this
time
the
Fat
Friar
told
me
he
dropped
his
voice
conspiratorially
so
that
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
had
to
lean
closer
to
him
to
hear
that
umbridge
tried
to
get
back
into
his
office
last
night
after
theyd
searched
the
castle
and
grounds
for
him
couldnt
get
past
the
gargoyle
the
Heads
office
has
sealed
itself
against
her
ernie
smirked
apparently
she
had
a
right
little
tantrum
oh
I
expect
she
really
fancied
herself
sitting
up
there
in
the
Heads
office
said
Hermione
viciously
as
they
walked
up
the
stone
steps
into
the
Entrance
Hall
lording
it
over
all
the
other
teachers
the
stupid
puffed-up
power-crazy
old
now
do
you
really
want
to
finish
that
sentence
Granger
draco
Malfoy
had
slid
out
from
behind
the
door
closely
followed
by
Crabbe
and
Goyle
his
pale
pointed
face
was
alight
with
malice
afraid
Im
going
to
have
to
dock
a
few
points
from
Gryffindor
and
Hufflepuff
he
drawled
its
only
teachers
who
can
dock
points
from
houses
Malfoy
said
Ernie
at
once
yeah
were
prefects
too
remember
snarled
Ron
i
know
prefects
cant
dock
points
Weasel
King
sneered
Malfoy
crabbe
and
Goyle
sniggered
but
members
of
the
Inquisitorial
Squad
the
what
said
Hermione
sharply
the
Inquisitorial
Squad
Granger
said
Malfoy
pointing
towards
a
tiny
silver
I
on
his
robes
just
beneath
his
prefects
badge
a
select
group
of
students
who
are
supportive
of
the
Ministry
of
Magic
hand-picked
by
Professor
Umbridge
anyway
members
of
the
Inquisitorial
Squad
do
have
the
power
to
dock
points
so
Granger
Ill
have
five
from
you
for
being
rude
about
our
new
Headmistress
macmillan
five
for
contradicting
me
five
because
I
dont
like
you
Potter
weasley
your
shirts
untucked
so
Ill
have
another
five
for
that
oh
yeah
I
forgot
youre
a
mudblood
Granger
so
ten
off
for
that
ron
pulled
out
his
wand
but
Hermione
pushed
it
away
whispering
Dont
wise
move
Granger
breathed
Malfoy
new
Head
new
times
be
good
now
Potty
weasel
King
laughing
heartily
he
strode
away
with
Crabbe
and
Goyle
he
was
bluffing
said
Ernie
looking
appalled
he
cant
be
allowed
to
dock
points
that
would
be
ridiculous
it
would
completely
undermine
the
prefect
system
but
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
had
turned
automatically
towards
the
giant
hour-glasses
set
in
niches
along
the
wall
behind
them
which
recorded
the
house-points
gryffindor
and
Ravenclaw
had
been
neck
and
neck
in
the
lead
that
morning
even
as
they
watched
stones
flew
upwards
reducing
the
amounts
in
the
lower
bulbs
in
fact
the
only
glass
that
seemed
unchanged
was
the
emerald-filled
one
of
Slytherin
noticed
have
you
said
Freds
voice
he
and
George
had
just
come
down
the
marble
staircase
and
joined
Harry
Ron
Hermione
and
ernie
in
front
of
the
hour-glasses
malfoy
just
docked
us
all
about
fifty
points
said
Harry
furiously
as
they
watched
several
more
stones
fly
upwards
from
the
Gryffindor
hour-glass
yeah
Montague
tried
to
do
us
during
break
said
George
what
do
you
mean
tried
said
Ron
quickly
he
never
managed
to
get
all
the
words
out
said
Fred
due
to
the
fact
that
we
forced
him
headfirst
into
that
Vanishing
Cabinet
on
the
first
floor
hermione
looked
very
shocked
but
youll
get
into
terrible
trouble
not
until
Montague
reappears
and
that
could
take
weeks
I
dunno
where
we
sent
him
said
fred
coolly
anyway
weve
decided
we
dont
care
about
getting
into
trouble
any
more
have
you
ever
asked
Hermione
course
we
have
said
George
never
been
expelled
have
we
weve
always
known
where
to
draw
the
line
said
Fred
we
might
have
put
a
toe
across
it
occasionally
said
George
but
weve
always
stopped
short
of
causing
real
mayhem
said
Fred
but
now
said
Ron
tentatively
well
now
said
George
what
with
Dumbledore
gone
said
Fred
we
reckon
a
bit
of
mayhem
said
George
is
exactly
what
our
dear
new
Head
deserves
said
Fred
you
mustnt
whispered
Hermione
you
really
mustnt
shed
love
a
reason
to
expel
you
you
dont
get
it
Hermione
do
you
said
Fred
smiling
at
her
we
dont
care
about
staying
anymore
wed
walk
out
right
now
if
we
werent
determined
to
do
our
bit
for
Dumbledore
first
so
anyway
he
checked
his
watch
phase
one
is
about
to
begin
id
get
in
the
Great
Hall
for
lunch
if
I
were
you
that
way
the
teachers
will
see
you
cant
have
had
anything
to
do
with
it
anything
to
do
with
what
said
Hermione
anxiously
youll
see
said
George
run
along
now
fred
and
George
turned
away
and
disappeared
into
the
swelling
crowd
descending
the
stairs
towards
lunch
looking
highly
disconcerted
Ernie
muttered
something
about
unfinished
transfiguration
homework
and
scurried
away
i
think
we
should
get
out
of
here
you
know
said
Hermione
nervously
just
in
case
yeah
all
right
said
Ron
and
the
three
of
them
moved
towards
the
doors
to
the
Great
Hall
but
harry
had
barely
glimpsed
the
days
ceiling
of
scudding
white
clouds
when
somebody
tapped
him
on
the
shoulder
and
turning
he
found
himself
almost
nose-to-nose
with
Filch
the
caretaker
he
took
several
hasty
steps
backwards
Filch
was
best
viewed
at
a
distance
the
Headmistress
would
like
to
see
you
Potter
he
leered
i
didnt
do
it
said
Harry
stupidly
thinking
of
whatever
Fred
and
George
were
planning
filchs
jowls
wobbled
with
silent
laughter
guilty
conscience
eh
he
wheezed
follow
me
harry
glanced
back
at
Ron
and
Hermione
who
were
both
looking
worried
he
shrugged
and
followed
Filch
back
into
the
Entrance
Hall
against
the
tide
of
hungry
students
filch
seemed
to
be
in
an
extremely
good
mood
he
hummed
creakily
under
his
breath
as
they
climbed
the
marble
staircase
as
they
reached
the
first
landing
he
said
Things
are
changing
around
here
Potter
ive
noticed
said
Harry
coldly
yerse
ive
been
telling
Dumbledore
for
years
and
years
hes
too
soft
with
you
all
said
Filch
chuckling
nastily
you
filthy
little
beasts
would
never
have
dropped
Stink
Pellets
if
youd
known
I
had
it
in
my
power
to
whip
you
raw
would
you
now
nobody
would
have
thought
of
throwing
Fanged
Frisbees
down
the
corridors
if
I
couldve
strung
you
up
by
the
ankles
in
my
office
would
they
but
when
Educational
Decree
Number
twenty-nine
comes
in
Potter
Ill
be
allowed
to
do
them
things
and
shes
asked
the
Minister
to
sign
an
order
for
the
expulsion
of
peeves
oh
things
are
going
to
be
very
different
around
here
with
her
in
charge
umbridge
had
obviously
gone
to
some
lengths
to
get
Filch
on
her
side
Harry
thought
and
the
worst
of
it
was
that
he
would
probably
prove
an
important
weapon
his
knowledge
of
the
schools
secret
passageways
and
hiding
places
was
probably
second
only
to
that
of
the
Weasley
twins
here
we
are
he
said
leering
down
at
Harry
as
he
rapped
three
times
on
Professor
Umbridges
door
and
pushed
it
open
the
Potter
boy
to
see
you
Maam
umbridges
office
so
very
familiar
to
Harry
from
his
many
detentions
was
the
same
as
usual
except
for
the
large
wooden
block
lying
across
the
front
of
her
desk
on
which
golden
letters
spelled
the
word
headmistress
also
his
Firebolt
and
Fred
and
Georges
Cleansweeps
which
he
saw
with
a
pang
were
chained
and
padlocked
to
a
stout
iron
peg
in
the
wall
behind
the
desk
umbridge
was
sitting
behind
the
desk
busily
scribbling
on
some
of
her
pink
parchment
but
she
looked
up
and
smiled
widely
at
their
entrance
thank
you
Argus
she
said
sweetly
not
at
all
Maam
not
at
all
said
Filch
bowing
as
low
as
his
rheumatism
would
permit
and
exiting
backwards
sit
said
Umbridge
curtly
pointing
towards
a
chair
harry
sat
she
continued
to
scribble
for
a
few
moments
he
watched
some
of
the
foul
kittens
gamboling
around
the
plates
over
her
head
wondering
what
fresh
horror
she
had
in
store
for
him
well
now
she
said
finally
setting
down
her
quill
and
surveying
him
complacently
like
a
toad
about
to
swallow
a
particularly
juicy
fly
what
would
you
like
to
drink
what
said
Harry
quite
sure
he
had
misheard
her
to
drink
mr.
Potter
she
said
smiling
still
more
widely
tea
coffee
pumpkin
juice
as
she
named
each
drink
she
gave
her
short
wand
a
wave
and
a
cup
or
glass
of
it
appeared
on
her
desk
nothing
thank
you
said
Harry
i
wish
you
to
have
a
drink
with
me
she
said
her
voice
becoming
dangerously
sweet
choose
one
fine
tea
then
said
Harry
shrugging
she
got
up
and
made
quite
a
performance
of
adding
milk
with
her
back
to
him
she
then
bustled
around
the
desk
with
it
smiling
in
a
sinisterly
sweet
fashion
there
she
said
handing
it
to
him
drink
it
before
it
gets
cold
wont
you
well
now
Mr
potter
i
thought
we
ought
to
have
a
little
chat
after
the
distressing
events
of
last
night
he
said
nothing
she
settled
herself
back
into
her
seat
and
waited
when
several
long
moments
had
passed
in
silence
she
said
gaily
Youre
not
drinking
up
he
raised
the
cup
to
his
lips
and
then
just
as
suddenly
lowered
it
one
of
the
horrible
painted
kittens
behind
Umbridge
had
great
round
blue
eyes
just
like
Mad-Eye
Moodys
magical
one
and
it
had
just
occurred
to
Harry
what
Mad-Eye
would
say
if
he
ever
heard
that
Harry
had
drunk
anything
offered
by
a
known
enemy
whats
the
matter
said
Umbridge
who
was
still
watching
him
closely
do
you
want
sugar
no
said
Harry
he
raised
the
cup
to
his
lips
again
and
pretended
to
take
a
sip
though
keeping
his
mouth
tightly
closed
umbridges
smile
widened
good
she
whispered
very
good
now
then
she
leaned
forwards
a
little
where
is
Albus
dumbledore
no
idea
said
Harry
promptly
drink
up
drink
up
she
said
still
smiling
now
mr.
Potter
let
us
not
play
childish
games
know
that
you
know
where
he
has
gone
you
and
Dumbledore
have
been
in
this
together
from
the
beginning
consider
your
position
mr.
Potter
i
dont
know
where
he
is
Harry
repeated
he
pretended
to
drink
again
she
was
watching
him
very
closely
very
well
she
said
though
she
looked
displeased
in
that
case
you
will
kindly
tell
me
the
whereabouts
of
Sirius
Black
harrys
stomach
turned
over
and
his
hand
holding
the
teacup
shook
so
that
it
rattled
in
its
saucer
he
tilted
the
cup
to
his
mouth
with
his
lips
pressed
together
so
that
some
of
the
hot
liquid
trickled
down
on
to
his
robes
i
dont
know
he
said
a
little
too
quickly
mr.
Potter
said
Umbridge
let
me
remind
you
that
it
was
I
who
almost
caught
the
criminal
black
in
the
Gryffindor
fire
in
October
i
know
perfectly
well
it
was
you
he
was
meeting
and
if
I
had
had
any
proof
neither
of
you
would
be
at
large
today
I
promise
you
i
repeat
mr.
Potter
where
is
Sirius
Black
no
idea
said
Harry
loudly
havent
got
a
clue
they
stared
at
each
other
so
long
that
Harry
felt
his
eyes
watering
then
Umbridge
stood
up
very
well
Potter
I
will
take
your
word
for
it
this
time
but
be
warned
the
might
of
the
Ministry
stands
behind
me
all
channels
of
communication
in
and
out
of
this
school
are
being
monitored
a
Floo
Network
Regulator
is
keeping
watch
over
every
fire
in
Hogwarts
except
my
own
of
course
my
Inquisitorial
Squad
is
opening
and
reading
all
owl
post
entering
and
leaving
the
castle
and
mr.
Filch
is
observing
all
secret
passages
in
and
out
of
the
castle
if
I
find
a
shred
of
evidence
boom
the
very
floor
of
the
office
shook
umbridge
slipped
sideways
clutching
her
desk
for
support
and
looking
shocked
what
was
she
was
gazing
towards
the
door
harry
took
the
opportunity
to
empty
his
almost-full
cup
of
tea
into
the
nearest
vase
of
dried
flowers
he
could
hear
people
running
and
screaming
several
floors
below
back
to
lunch
you
go
Potter
cried
Umbridge
raising
her
wand
and
dashing
out
of
the
office
harry
gave
her
a
few
seconds
start
then
hurried
after
her
to
see
what
the
source
of
all
the
uproar
was
it
was
not
difficult
to
find
one
floor
down
pandemonium
reigned
somebody
and
Harry
had
a
very
shrewd
idea
who
had
set
off
what
seemed
to
be
an
enormous
crate
of
enchanted
fireworks
dragons
comprised
entirely
of
green
and
gold
sparks
were
soaring
up
and
down
the
corridors
emitting
loud
fiery
blasts
and
bangs
as
they
went
shocking-pink
Catherine
wheels
five
feet
in
diameter
were
whizzing
lethally
through
the
air
like
so
many
flying
saucers
rockets
with
long
tails
of
brilliant
silver
stars
were
ricocheting
off
the
walls
sparklers
were
writing
swear
words
in
midair
of
their
own
accord
firecrackers
were
exploding
like
mines
everywhere
Harry
looked
and
instead
of
burning
themselves
out
fading
from
sight
or
fizzling
to
a
halt
these
pyrotechnical
miracles
seemed
to
be
gaining
in
energy
and
momentum
the
longer
he
watched
filch
and
Umbridge
were
standing
apparently
transfixed
in
horror
halfway
down
the
stairs
as
harry
watched
one
of
the
larger
Catherine
wheels
seemed
to
decide
that
what
it
needed
was
more
room
to
maneuver
it
whirled
towards
Umbridge
and
Filch
with
a
sinister
wheeeeeeeeee
they
both
yelled
with
fright
and
ducked
and
it
soared
straight
out
of
the
window
behind
them
and
off
across
the
grounds
meanwhile
several
of
the
dragons
and
a
large
purple
bat
that
was
smoking
ominously
took
advantage
of
the
open
door
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
to
escape
towards
the
second
floor
hurry
Filch
hurry
shrieked
Umbridge
theyll
be
all
over
the
school
unless
we
do
something
Stupefy
a
jet
of
red
light
shot
out
of
the
end
of
her
wand
and
hit
one
of
the
rockets
instead
of
freezing
in
midair
it
exploded
with
such
force
that
it
blasted
a
hole
in
a
painting
of
a
soppy-looking
witch
in
the
middle
of
a
meadow
she
ran
for
it
just
in
time
reappearing
seconds
later
squashed
into
the
next
painting
where
a
couple
of
wizards
playing
cards
stood
up
hastily
to
make
room
for
her
dont
Stun
them
Filch
shouted
Umbridge
angrily
for
all
the
world
as
though
it
had
been
his
incantation
right
you
are
Headmistress
wheezed
Filch
who
as
a
Squib
could
no
more
have
Stunned
the
fireworks
than
swallowed
them
he
dashed
to
a
nearby
cupboard
pulled
out
a
broom
and
began
swatting
at
the
fireworks
in
midair
within
seconds
the
head
of
the
broom
was
ablaze
harry
had
seen
enough
laughing
he
ducked
down
low
ran
to
a
door
he
knew
was
concealed
behind
a
tapestry
a
little
way
along
the
corridor
and
slipped
through
it
to
find
Fred
and
George
hiding
just
behind
it
listening
to
Umbridge
and
Filchs
yells
and
quaking
with
suppressed
mirth
impressive
Harry
said
quietly
grinning
very
impressive
youll
put
dr.
Filibuster
out
of
business
no
problem
cheers
whispered
George
wiping
tears
of
laughter
from
his
face
oh
I
hope
she
tries
vanishing
them
next
they
multiply
by
ten
every
time
you
try
the
fireworks
continued
to
burn
and
to
spread
all
over
the
school
that
afternoon
though
they
caused
plenty
of
disruption
particularly
the
firecrackers
the
other
teachers
didnt
seem
to
mind
them
very
much
dear
dear
said
Professor
McGonagall
sardonically
as
one
of
the
dragons
soared
around
her
classroom
emitting
loud
bangs
and
exhaling
flame
miss
Brown
would
you
mind
running
along
to
the
Headmistress
and
informing
her
that
we
have
an
escaped
firework
in
our
classroom
the
upshot
of
it
all
was
that
Professor
Umbridge
spent
her
first
afternoon
as
Headmistress
running
all
over
the
school
answering
the
summonses
of
the
other
teachers
none
of
whom
seemed
able
to
rid
their
rooms
of
the
fireworks
without
her
when
the
final
bell
rang
and
they
were
heading
back
to
Gryffindor
Tower
with
their
bags
Harry
saw
with
immense
satisfaction
a
disheveled
and
soot-blackened
Umbridge
tottering
sweaty-faced
from
Professor
Flitwicks
classroom
thank
you
so
much
Professor
said
Professor
Flitwick
in
his
squeaky
little
voice
i
could
have
got
rid
of
the
sparklers
myself
of
course
but
I
wasnt
sure
whether
or
not
I
had
the
authority
beaming
he
closed
his
classroom
door
in
her
snarling
face
fred
and
George
were
heroes
that
night
in
the
Gryffindor
common
room
even
Hermione
fought
her
way
through
the
excited
crowd
to
congratulate
them
they
were
wonderful
fireworks
she
said
admiringly
thanks
said
George
looking
both
surprised
and
pleased
weasleys
Wildfire
whiz-bangs
only
thing
is
we
used
our
whole
stock
were
going
to
have
to
start
again
from
scratch
now
it
was
worth
it
though
said
Fred
who
was
taking
orders
from
clamouring
Gryffindors
if
you
want
to
add
your
name
to
the
waiting
list
Hermione
its
five
Galleons
for
your
Basic
Blaze
box
and
twenty
for
the
Deflagration
Deluxe
hermione
returned
to
the
table
where
Harry
and
Ron
were
sitting
staring
at
their
schoolbags
as
though
hoping
their
homework
would
spring
out
and
start
doing
itself
oh
why
dont
we
have
a
night
off
said
Hermione
brightly
as
a
silver-tailed
Weasley
rocket
zoomed
past
the
window
after
all
the
Easter
holidays
start
on
Friday
well
have
plenty
of
time
then
are
you
feeling
all
right
ron
asked
staring
at
her
in
disbelief
now
you
mention
it
said
Hermione
happily
dyou
know
i
think
Im
feeling
a
bit
rebellious
harry
could
still
hear
the
distant
bangs
of
escaped
firecrackers
when
he
and
Ron
went
up
to
bed
an
hour
later
and
as
he
got
undressed
a
sparkler
floated
past
the
tower
still
resolutely
spelling
out
the
word
too
he
got
into
bed
yawning
with
his
glasses
off
the
occasional
firework
passing
the
window
had
become
blurred
looking
like
sparkling
clouds
beautiful
and
mysterious
against
the
black
sky
he
turned
on
to
his
side
wondering
how
Umbridge
was
feeling
about
her
first
day
in
dumbledores
job
and
how
Fudge
would
react
when
he
heard
that
the
school
had
spent
most
of
the
day
in
a
state
of
advanced
disruption
smiling
to
himself
Harry
closed
his
eyes
the
whizzes
and
bangs
of
escaped
fireworks
in
the
grounds
seemed
to
be
growing
more
distant
or
perhaps
he
was
simply
speeding
away
from
them
he
had
fallen
right
into
the
corridor
leading
to
the
Department
of
Mysteries
he
was
speeding
towards
the
plain
black
door
let
it
open
let
it
open
it
did
he
was
inside
the
circular
room
lined
with
doors
he
crossed
it
placed
his
hand
on
an
identical
door
and
it
swung
inwards
now
he
was
in
a
long
rectangular
room
full
of
an
odd
mechanical
clicking
there
were
dancing
flecks
of
light
on
the
walls
but
he
did
not
pause
to
investigate
he
had
to
go
on
there
was
a
door
at
the
far
end
it
too
opened
at
his
touch
and
now
he
was
in
a
dimly
lit
room
as
high
and
wide
as
a
church
full
of
nothing
but
rows
and
rows
of
towering
shelves
each
laden
with
small
dusty
spun-glass
spheres
now
Harrys
heart
was
beating
fast
with
excitement
he
knew
where
to
go
he
ran
forwards
but
his
footsteps
made
no
noise
in
the
enormous
deserted
room
there
was
something
in
this
room
he
wanted
very
very
much
something
he
wanted
or
somebody
else
wanted
his
scar
was
hurting
bang
harry
awoke
instantly
confused
and
angry
the
dark
dormitory
was
full
of
the
sound
of
laughter
cool
said
Seamus
who
was
silhouetted
against
the
window
i
think
one
of
those
Catherine
wheels
hit
a
rocket
and
its
like
they
mated
come
and
see
harry
heard
Ron
and
Dean
scramble
out
of
bed
for
a
better
look
he
lay
quite
still
and
silent
while
the
pain
in
his
scar
subsided
and
disappointment
washed
over
him
he
felt
as
though
a
wonderful
treat
had
been
snatched
from
him
at
the
very
last
moment
he
had
got
so
close
that
time
glittering
pink
and
silver
winged
piglets
were
now
soaring
past
the
windows
of
Gryffindor
tower
harry
lay
and
listened
to
the
appreciative
whoops
of
Gryffindors
in
the
dormitories
below
them
his
stomach
gave
a
sickening
jolt
as
he
remembered
that
he
had
Occlumency
the
following
evening
harry
spent
the
whole
of
the
next
day
dreading
what
Snape
was
going
to
say
if
he
found
out
how
much
further
into
the
Department
of
Mysteries
Harry
had
penetrated
during
his
last
dream
with
a
surge
of
guilt
he
realized
that
he
had
not
practiced
Occlumency
once
since
their
last
lesson
there
had
been
too
much
going
on
since
Dumbledore
had
left
he
was
sure
he
would
not
have
been
able
to
empty
his
mind
even
if
he
had
tried
he
doubted
however
whether
Snape
would
accept
that
excuse
he
attempted
a
little
last-minute
practice
during
classes
that
day
but
it
was
no
good
hermione
kept
asking
him
what
was
wrong
whenever
he
fell
silent
trying
to
rid
himself
of
all
thought
and
emotion
and
after
all
the
best
moment
to
empty
his
brain
was
not
while
teachers
were
firing
review
questions
at
the
class
resigned
to
the
worst
he
set
off
for
Snapes
office
after
dinner
halfway
across
the
Entrance
hall
however
Cho
came
hurrying
up
to
him
over
here
said
Harry
glad
of
a
reason
to
postpone
his
meeting
with
Snape
and
beckoning
her
across
to
the
corner
of
the
Entrance
Hall
where
the
giant
hour-glasses
stood
gryffindors
was
now
almost
empty
are
you
okay
umbridge
hasnt
been
asking
you
about
the
D
a.
has
she
oh
no
said
Cho
hurriedly
no
it
was
only
well
I
just
wanted
to
say
harry
I
never
dreamed
Marietta
would
tell
yeah
well
said
Harry
moodily
he
did
feel
Cho
might
have
chosen
her
friends
a
bit
more
carefully
it
was
small
consolation
that
the
last
he
had
heard
Marietta
was
still
up
in
the
hospital
wing
and
Madam
Pomfrey
had
not
been
able
to
make
the
slightest
improvement
to
her
pimples
shes
a
lovely
person
really
said
Cho
she
just
made
a
mistake
harry
looked
at
her
incredulously
a
lovely
person
who
made
a
mistake
she
sold
us
all
out
including
you
well
we
all
got
away
didnt
we
said
Cho
pleadingly
you
know
her
mum
works
for
the
ministry
its
really
difficult
for
her
rons
dad
works
for
the
Ministry
too
harry
said
furiously
and
in
case
you
hadnt
noticed
he
hasnt
got
sneak
written
across
his
face
that
was
a
really
horrible
trick
of
Hermione
Grangers
said
Cho
fiercely
she
should
have
told
us
shed
jinxed
that
list
i
think
it
was
a
brilliant
idea
said
Harry
coldly
cho
flushed
and
her
eyes
grew
brighter
oh
yes
I
forgot
of
course
if
it
was
darling
Hermiones
idea
dont
start
crying
again
said
Harry
warningly
i
wasnt
going
to
she
shouted
yeah
well
good
he
said
ive
got
enough
to
cope
with
at
the
moment
go
and
cope
with
it
then
cho
said
furiously
turning
on
her
heel
and
stalking
off
fuming
Harry
descended
the
stairs
to
Snapes
dungeon
and
though
he
knew
from
experience
how
much
easier
it
would
be
for
Snape
to
penetrate
his
mind
if
he
arrived
angry
and
resentful
he
succeeded
in
nothing
but
thinking
of
a
few
more
things
he
should
have
said
to
Cho
about
marietta
before
reaching
the
dungeon
door
youre
late
Potter
said
Snape
coldly
as
Harry
closed
the
door
behind
him
snape
was
standing
with
his
back
to
Harry
removing
as
usual
certain
of
his
thoughts
and
placing
them
carefully
in
Dumbledores
Pensieve
he
dropped
the
last
silvery
strand
into
the
stone
basin
and
turned
to
face
Harry
so
he
said
have
you
been
practicing
yes
Harry
lied
looking
carefully
at
one
of
the
legs
of
Snapes
desk
well
well
soon
find
out
wont
we
said
Snape
smoothly
wand
out
Potter
harry
moved
into
his
usual
position
facing
Snape
with
the
desk
between
them
his
heart
was
pumping
fast
with
anger
at
Cho
and
anxiety
about
how
much
Snape
was
about
to
extract
from
his
mind
on
the
count
of
three
then
said
Snape
lazily
one
two
snapes
office
door
banged
open
and
Draco
Malfoy
sped
in
professor
Snape
sir
oh
sorry
malfoy
was
looking
at
Snape
and
Harry
in
some
surprise
its
all
right
Draco
said
Snape
lowering
his
w
and
potter
is
here
for
a
little
remedial
Potions
harry
had
not
seen
Malfoy
look
so
gleeful
since
Umbridge
had
turned
up
to
inspect
Hagrid
i
didnt
know
he
said
leering
at
Harry
who
knew
his
face
was
burning
he
would
have
given
a
great
deal
to
be
able
to
shout
the
truth
at
Malfoy
or
even
better
to
hit
him
with
a
good
curse
well
Draco
what
is
it
asked
Snape
its
Professor
Umbridge
sir
she
needs
your
help
said
Malfoy
theyve
found
Montague
sir
hes
turned
up
jammed
inside
a
toilet
on
the
fourth
floor
how
did
he
get
in
there
demanded
Snape
i
dont
know
sir
hes
a
bit
confused
very
well
very
well
potter
said
Snape
we
shall
resume
this
lesson
tomorrow
evening
he
turned
and
swept
from
his
office
malfoy
mouthed
Remedial
Potions
at
Harry
behind
snapes
back
before
following
him
seething
Harry
replaced
his
wand
inside
his
robes
and
made
to
leave
the
room
at
least
he
had
twenty-four
more
hours
in
which
to
practice
he
knew
he
ought
to
feel
grateful
for
the
narrow
escape
though
it
was
hard
that
it
came
at
the
expense
of
Malfoy
telling
the
whole
school
that
he
needed
remedial
Potions
he
was
at
the
office
door
when
he
saw
it
a
patch
of
shivering
light
dancing
on
the
doorframe
he
stopped
and
stood
looking
at
it
reminded
of
something
then
he
remembered
it
was
a
little
like
the
lights
he
had
seen
in
his
dream
last
night
the
lights
in
the
second
room
he
had
walked
through
on
his
journey
through
the
Department
of
Mysteries
he
turned
around
the
light
was
coming
from
the
Pensieve
sitting
on
Snapes
desk
the
silverwhite
contents
were
ebbing
and
swirling
within
snapes
thoughts
things
he
did
not
want
harry
to
see
if
he
broke
through
Snapes
Defenses
accidentally
harry
gazed
at
the
Pensieve
curiosity
welling
inside
him
what
was
it
that
Snape
was
so
keen
to
hide
from
Harry
the
silvery
lights
shivered
on
the
wall
harry
took
two
steps
towards
the
desk
thinking
hard
could
it
possibly
be
information
about
the
Department
of
Mysteries
that
Snape
was
determined
to
keep
from
him
harry
looked
over
his
shoulder
his
heart
now
pumping
harder
and
faster
than
ever
how
long
would
it
take
Snape
to
release
Montague
from
the
toilet
would
he
come
straight
back
to
his
office
afterwards
or
accompany
Montague
to
the
hospital
wing
surely
the
latter
montague
was
Captain
of
the
Slytherin
Quidditch
team
Snape
would
want
to
make
sure
he
was
all
right
harry
walked
the
remaining
few
feet
to
the
Pensieve
and
stood
over
it
gazing
into
its
depths
he
hesitated
listening
then
pulled
out
his
wand
again
the
office
and
the
corridor
beyond
were
completely
silent
he
gave
the
contents
of
the
Pensieve
a
small
prod
with
the
end
of
his
wand
the
silvery
stuff
within
began
to
swirl
very
fast
harry
leaned
forwards
over
it
and
saw
that
it
had
become
transparent
he
was
once
again
looking
down
into
a
room
as
though
through
a
circular
window
in
the
ceiling
in
fact
unless
he
was
much
mistaken
he
was
looking
down
into
the
Great
Hall
his
breath
was
actually
fogging
the
surface
of
Snapes
thoughts
his
brain
seemed
to
be
in
limbo
it
would
be
insane
to
do
the
thing
he
was
so
strongly
tempted
to
do
he
was
trembling
snape
could
be
back
at
any
moment
but
Harry
thought
of
cho's
anger
of
malfoys
jeering
face
and
a
reckless
daring
seized
him
he
took
a
great
gulp
of
breath
and
plunged
his
face
into
the
surface
of
Snapes
thoughts
at
once
the
floor
of
the
office
lurched
tipping
Harry
head-first
into
the
Pensieve
he
was
falling
through
cold
blackness
spinning
furiously
as
he
went
and
then
he
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
Great
Hall
but
the
four
house
tables
were
gone
instead
there
were
more
than
a
hundred
smaller
tables
all
facing
the
same
way
at
each
of
which
sat
a
student
head
bent
low
scribbling
on
a
roll
of
parchment
the
only
sound
was
the
scratching
of
quills
and
the
occasional
rustle
as
somebody
adjusted
their
parchment
it
was
clearly
exam
time
sunshine
was
streaming
through
the
high
windows
on
to
the
bent
heads
which
shone
chestnut
and
copper
and
gold
in
the
bright
light
harry
looked
around
carefully
snape
had
to
be
here
somewhere
this
was
his
memory
and
there
he
was
at
a
table
right
behind
Harry
harry
stared
snape-the-teenager
had
a
stringy
pallid
look
about
him
like
a
plant
kept
in
the
dark
his
hair
was
lank
and
greasy
and
was
flopping
on
to
the
table
his
hooked
nose
barely
half
an
inch
from
the
surface
of
the
parchment
as
he
scribbled
harry
moved
around
behind
Snape
and
read
the
heading
of
the
examination
paper
defense
against
the
dark
arts
ordinary
wizarding
level
so
Snape
had
to
be
fifteen
or
sixteen
around
Harrys
own
age
his
hand
was
flying
across
the
parchment
he
had
written
at
least
a
foot
more
than
his
closest
neighbors
and
yet
his
writing
was
minuscule
and
cramped
five
more
minutes
the
voice
made
Harry
jump
turning
he
saw
the
top
of
Professor
Flitwicks
head
moving
between
the
desks
a
short
distance
away
professor
Flitwick
was
walking
past
a
boy
with
untidy
black
hair
very
untidy
black
hair
harry
moved
so
quickly
that
had
he
been
solid
he
would
have
knocked
desks
flying
instead
he
seemed
to
slide
dreamlike
across
two
aisles
and
up
a
third
the
back
of
the
black-haired
boys
head
drew
nearer
and
he
was
straightening
up
now
putting
down
his
quill
pulling
his
roll
of
parchment
towards
him
so
as
to
reread
what
he
had
written
harry
stopped
in
front
of
the
desk
and
gazed
down
at
his
fifteen-year-old
father
excitement
exploded
in
the
pit
of
his
stomach
it
was
as
though
he
was
looking
at
himself
but
with
deliberate
mistakes
jamess
eyes
were
hazel
his
nose
was
slightly
longer
than
Harrys
and
there
was
no
scar
on
his
forehead
but
they
had
the
same
thin
face
same
mouth
same
eyebrows
jamess
hair
stuck
up
at
the
back
exactly
as
Harrys
did
his
hands
could
have
been
Harrys
and
harry
could
tell
that
when
James
stood
up
they
would
be
within
an
inch
of
each
other
in
height
james
yawned
hugely
and
rumpled
up
his
hair
making
it
even
messier
than
it
had
been
then
with
a
glance
towards
Professor
Flitwick
he
turned
in
his
seat
and
grinned
at
a
boy
sitting
four
seats
behind
him
with
another
shock
of
excitement
Harry
saw
Sirius
give
James
the
thumbs-up
sirius
was
lounging
in
his
chair
at
his
ease
tilting
it
back
on
two
legs
he
was
very
good-looking
his
dark
hair
fell
into
his
eyes
with
a
sort
of
casual
elegance
neither
Jamess
nor
Harrys
could
ever
have
achieved
and
a
girl
sitting
behind
him
was
eyeing
him
hopefully
though
he
didnt
seem
to
have
noticed
and
two
seats
along
from
this
girl
Harrys
stomach
gave
another
pleasurable
squirm
was
Remus
Lupin
he
looked
rather
pale
and
peaky
was
the
full
moon
approaching
and
was
absorbed
in
the
exam
as
he
reread
his
answers
he
scratched
his
chin
with
the
end
of
his
quill
frowning
slightly
so
that
meant
Wormtail
had
to
be
around
here
somewhere
too
and
sure
enough
Harry
spotted
him
within
seconds
a
small
mousy-haired
boy
with
a
pointed
nose
wormtail
looked
anxious
he
was
chewing
his
fingernails
staring
down
at
his
paper
scuffing
the
ground
with
his
toes
every
now
and
then
he
glanced
hopefully
at
his
neighbors
paper
harry
stared
at
Wormtail
for
a
moment
then
back
at
James
who
was
now
doodling
on
a
bit
of
scrap
parchment
he
had
drawn
a
Snitch
and
was
now
tracing
the
letters
L
e.
What
did
they
stand
for
quills
down
please
squeaked
Professor
Flitwick
that
means
you
too
Stebbins
please
remain
seated
while
I
collect
your
parchment
accio
over
a
hundred
rolls
of
parchment
zoomed
into
the
air
and
into
Professor
Flitwicks
outstretched
arms
knocking
him
backwards
off
his
feet
several
people
laughed
a
couple
of
students
at
the
front
desks
got
up
took
hold
of
Professor
Flitwick
beneath
the
elbows
and
lifted
him
back
on
to
his
feet
thank
you
thank
you
panted
Professor
Flitwick
very
well
everybody
youre
free
to
go
harry
looked
down
at
his
father
who
had
hastily
crossed
out
the
L
e.
he
had
been
embellishing
jumped
to
his
feet
stuffed
his
quill
and
the
exam
paper
into
his
bag
which
he
slung
over
his
back
and
stood
waiting
for
Sirius
to
join
him
harry
looked
around
and
glimpsed
Snape
a
short
way
away
moving
between
the
tables
towards
the
doors
to
the
Entrance
Hall
still
absorbed
in
his
own
exam
paper
round-shouldered
yet
angular
he
walked
in
a
twitchy
manner
that
recalled
a
spider
and
his
oily
hair
was
jumping
about
his
face
a
gang
of
chattering
girls
separated
Snape
from
James
Sirius
and
Lupin
and
by
planting
himself
in
their
midst
Harry
managed
to
keep
Snape
in
sight
while
straining
his
ears
to
catch
the
voices
of
James
and
his
friends
did
you
like
question
ten
Moony
asked
Sirius
as
they
emerged
into
the
Entrance
Hall
loved
it
said
Lupin
briskly
give
five
signs
that
identify
the
werewolf
excellent
question
dyou
think
you
managed
to
get
all
the
signs
said
James
in
tones
of
mock
concern
think
I
did
said
Lupin
seriously
as
they
joined
the
crowd
thronging
around
the
front
doors
eager
to
get
out
into
the
sunlit
grounds
one
hes
sitting
on
my
chair
two
hes
wearing
my
clothes
three
his
names
Remus
Lupin
wormtail
was
the
only
one
who
didnt
laugh
i
got
the
snout
shape
the
pupils
of
the
eyes
and
the
tufted
tail
he
said
anxiously
but
I
couldnt
think
what
else
how
thick
are
you
Wormtail
said
James
impatiently
you
run
round
with
a
werewolf
once
a
month
keep
your
voice
down
implored
Lupin
harry
looked
anxiously
behind
him
again
snape
remained
close
by
still
buried
in
his
exam
questions
but
this
was
Snapes
memory
and
Harry
was
sure
that
if
Snape
chose
to
wander
off
in
a
different
direction
once
outside
in
the
grounds
he
Harry
would
not
be
able
to
follow
James
any
further
to
his
intense
relief
however
when
James
and
his
three
friends
strode
off
down
the
lawn
towards
the
lake
Snape
followed
still
poring
over
the
exam
paper
and
apparently
with
no
fixed
idea
of
where
he
was
going
by
keeping
a
little
ahead
of
him
Harry
managed
to
maintain
a
close
watch
on
James
and
the
others
well
I
thought
that
paper
was
a
piece
of
cake
he
heard
Sirius
say
ill
be
surprised
if
I
dont
get
Outstanding
on
it
at
least
me
too
said
James
he
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
took
out
a
struggling
Golden
Snitch
whered
you
get
that
nicked
it
said
James
casually
he
started
playing
with
the
Snitch
allowing
it
to
fly
as
much
as
a
foot
away
before
seizing
it
again
his
reflexes
were
excellent
wormtail
watched
him
in
awe
they
stopped
in
the
shade
of
the
very
same
beech
tree
on
the
edge
of
the
lake
where
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
had
once
spent
a
Sunday
finishing
their
homework
and
threw
themselves
down
on
the
grass
harry
looked
over
his
shoulder
yet
again
and
saw
to
his
delight
that
Snape
had
settled
himself
on
the
grass
in
the
dense
shadow
of
a
clump
of
bushes
he
was
as
deeply
immersed
in
the
owl
paper
as
ever
which
left
Harry
free
to
sit
down
on
the
grass
between
the
beech
and
the
bushes
and
watch
the
foursome
under
the
tree
the
sunlight
was
dazzling
on
the
smooth
surface
of
the
lake
on
the
bank
of
which
the
group
of
laughing
girls
who
had
just
left
the
great
Hall
were
sitting
with
their
shoes
and
socks
off
cooling
their
feet
in
the
water
lupin
had
pulled
out
a
book
and
was
reading
sirius
stared
around
at
the
students
milling
over
the
grass
looking
rather
haughty
and
bored
but
very
handsomely
so
james
was
still
playing
with
the
Snitch
letting
it
zoom
further
and
further
away
almost
escaping
but
always
grabbed
at
the
last
second
wormtail
was
watching
him
with
his
mouth
open
every
time
James
made
a
particularly
difficult
catch
Wormtail
gasped
and
applauded
after
five
minutes
of
this
Harry
wondered
why
James
didnt
tell
Wormtail
to
get
a
grip
on
himself
but
James
seemed
to
be
enjoying
the
attention
harry
noticed
that
his
father
had
a
habit
of
rumpling
up
his
hair
as
though
to
keep
it
from
getting
too
tidy
and
he
also
kept
looking
over
at
the
girls
by
the
waters
edge
put
that
away
will
you
said
Sirius
finally
as
James
made
a
fine
catch
and
Wormtail
let
out
a
cheer
before
Wormtail
wets
himself
with
excitement
wormtail
turned
slightly
pink
but
James
grinned
if
it
bothers
you
he
said
stuffing
the
Snitch
back
in
his
pocket
harry
had
the
distinct
impression
that
Sirius
was
the
only
one
for
whom
James
would
have
stopped
showing
off
im
bored
said
Sirius
wish
it
was
full
moon
you
might
said
Lupin
darkly
from
behind
his
book
weve
still
got
Transfiguration
if
youre
bored
you
could
test
me
here
and
he
held
out
his
book
but
Sirius
snorted
i
dont
need
to
look
at
that
rubbish
I
know
it
all
thisll
liven
you
up
Padfoot
said
James
quietly
look
who
it
is
siriuss
head
turned
he
became
very
still
like
a
dog
that
has
scented
a
rabbit
excellent
he
said
softly
snivellus
harry
turned
to
see
what
Sirius
was
looking
at
snape
was
on
his
feet
again
and
was
stowing
the
owl
paper
in
his
bag
as
he
left
the
shadows
of
the
bushes
and
set
off
across
the
grass
Sirius
and
James
stood
up
lupin
and
Wormtail
remained
sitting
Lupin
was
still
staring
down
at
his
book
though
his
eyes
were
not
moving
and
a
faint
frown
line
had
appeared
between
his
eyebrows
Wormtail
was
looking
from
Sirius
and
James
to
Snape
with
a
look
of
avid
anticipation
on
his
face
all
right
Snivellus
said
James
loudly
snape
reacted
so
fast
it
was
as
though
he
had
been
expecting
an
attack
dropping
his
bag
he
plunged
his
hand
inside
his
robes
and
his
wand
was
halfway
into
the
air
when
James
shouted
expelliarmus
snapes
wand
flew
twelve
feet
into
the
air
and
fell
with
a
little
thud
in
the
grass
behind
him
sirius
let
out
a
bark
of
laughter
impedimenta
he
said
pointing
his
wand
at
Snape
who
was
knocked
off
his
feet
halfway
through
a
dive
towards
his
own
fallen
wand
students
all
around
had
turned
to
watch
some
of
them
had
got
to
their
feet
and
were
edging
nearer
some
looked
apprehensive
others
entertained
snape
lay
panting
on
the
ground
james
and
Sirius
advanced
on
him
wands
raised
James
glancing
over
his
shoulder
at
the
girls
at
the
waters
edge
as
he
went
wormtail
was
on
his
feet
now
watching
hungrily
edging
around
Lupin
to
get
a
clearer
view
howd
the
exam
go
Snivelly
said
James
i
was
watching
him
his
nose
was
touching
the
parchment
said
Sirius
viciously
therell
be
great
grease
marks
all
over
it
they
wont
be
able
to
read
a
word
several
people
watching
laughed
Snape
was
clearly
unpopular
wormtail
sniggered
shrilly
snape
was
trying
to
get
up
but
the
jinx
was
still
operating
on
him
he
was
struggling
as
though
bound
by
invisible
ropes
you
wait
he
panted
staring
up
at
James
with
an
expression
of
purest
loathing
you
wait
wait
for
what
said
Sirius
coolly
whatre
you
going
to
do
Snivelly
wipe
your
nose
on
us
snape
let
out
a
stream
of
mixed
swear
words
and
hexes
but
with
his
wand
ten
feet
away
nothing
happened
wash
out
your
mouth
said
James
coldly
scourgify
pink
soap
bubbles
streamed
from
Snapes
mouth
at
once
the
froth
was
covering
his
lips
making
him
gag
choking
him
leave
him
alone
james
and
Sirius
looked
round
jamess
free
hand
immediately
jumped
to
his
hair
it
was
one
of
the
girls
from
the
lake
edge
she
had
thick
dark
red
hair
that
fell
to
her
shoulders
and
startlingly
green
almond-shaped
eyes
Harrys
eyes
harrys
mother
all
right
Evans
said
James
and
the
tone
of
his
voice
was
suddenly
pleasant
deeper
more
mature
leave
him
alone
Lily
repeated
she
was
looking
a
t
James
with
every
sign
of
great
dislike
whats
he
done
to
you
well
said
James
appearing
to
deliberate
the
point
its
more
the
fact
that
he
exists
if
you
know
what
I
mean
many
of
the
surrounding
students
laughed
Sirius
and
Wormtail
included
but
Lupin
still
apparently
intent
on
his
book
didnt
and
nor
did
Lily
you
think
youre
funny
she
said
coldly
but
youre
just
an
arrogant
bullying
toerag
Potter
leave
him
alone
i

with

Evans
said
James
quickly
go
on

out
with
me
and
Ill
never
lay
a
wand
on
old
Snivelly
again
behind
him
the
Impediment
Jinx
was
wearing
off
snape
was
beginning
to
inch
towards
his
fallen
wand
spitting
out
soapsuds
as
he
crawled
i
wouldnt
go
out
with
you
if
it
was
a
choice
between
you
and
the
giant
squid
said
Lily
bad
luck
Prongs
said
Sirius
briskly
and
turned
back
to
Snape
oy
but
too
late
Snape
had
directed
his
wand
straight
at
James
there
was
a
flash
of
light
and
a
gash
appeared
on
the
side
of
Jamess
face
spattering
his
robes
with
blood
james
whirled
about
a
second
flash
of
light
later
Snape
was
hanging
upside-down
in
the
air
his
robes
falling
over
his
head
to
reveal
skinny
pallid
legs
and
a
pair
of
graying
underpants
many
people
in
the
small
crowd
cheered
Sirius
James
and
Wormtail
roared
with
laughter
lily
whose
furious
expression
had
twitched
for
an
instant
as
though
she
was
going
to
smile
said
Let
him
down
certainly
said
James
and
he
jerked
his
wand
upwards
Snape
fell
into
a
crumpled
heap
on
the
ground
disentangling
himself
from
his
robes
he
got
quickly
to
his
feet
wand
up
but
Sirius
said
Locomotor
mortis
and
Snape
keeled
over
again
at
once
rigid
as
a
board
leave
him
alone
lily
shouted
she
had
her
own
wand
out
now
james
and
Sirius
eyed
it
warily
ah
Evans
dont
make
me
hex
you
said
James
earnestly
take
the
curse
off
him
then
james
sighed
deeply
then
turned
to
Snape
and
muttered
the
counter-curse
there
you
go
he
said
as
Snape
struggled
to
his
feet
youre
lucky
Evans
was
here
Snivellus
i
dont
need
help
from
filthy
little
Mudbloods
like
her
lily
blinked
fine
she
said
coolly
i
wont
bother
in
future
and
Id
wash
your
pants
if
I
were
you
Snivellus
apologize
to
Evans
james
roared
at
Snape
his
wand
pointed
threateningly
at
him
i
dont
want
you
to
make
him
apologize
Lily
shouted
rounding
on
James
youre
as
bad
as
he
is
what
yelped
James
id
never
call
you
a
you-know-what
messing
up
your
hair
because
you
think
it
looks
cool
to
look
like
youve
just
got
off
your
broomstick
showing
off
with
that
stupid
Snitch
walking
down
corridors
and
hexing
anyone
who
annoys
you
just
because
you
can
Im
surprised
your
broomstick
can
get
off
the
ground
with
that
fat
head
on
it
you
make
me
sick
she
turned
on
her
heel
and
hurried
away
evans
james
shouted
after
her
hey
evans
but
she
didnt
look
back
what
is
it
with
her
said
James
trying
and
failing
to
look
as
though
this
was
a
throwaway
question
of
no
real
importance
to
him
reading
between
the
lines
Id
say
she
thinks
youre
a
bit
conceited
mate
said
Sirius
right
said
James
who
looked
furious
now
right
there
was
another
flash
of
light
and
Snape
was
once
again
hanging
upside-down
in
the
air
who
wants
to
see
me
take
off
Snivellys
pants
but
whether
James
really
did
take
off
Snapes
pants
Harry
never
found
out
a
hand
had
closed
tight
over
his
upper
arm
closed
with
a
pincer-like
grip
wincing
Harry
looked
round
to
see
who
had
hold
of
him
and
saw
with
a
thrill
of
horror
a
fully
grown
adult-sized
Snape
standing
right
beside
him
white
with
rage
having
fun
harry
felt
himself
rising
into
the
air
the
summers
day
evaporated
around
him
he
was
floating
upwards
through
icy
blackness
Snapes
hand
still
tight
upon
his
upper
arm
then
with
a
swooping
feeling
as
though
he
had
turned
head-over-heels
in
midair
his
feet
hit
the
stone
floor
of
Snapes
dungeon
and
he
was
standing
again
beside
the
Pensieve
on
Snapes
desk
in
the
shadowy
present-day
Potion
masters
study
so
said
Snape
gripping
Harrys
arm
so
tightly
Harrys
hand
was
starting
to
feel
numb
so
been
enjoying
yourself
Potter
n-no
said
Harry
trying
to
free
his
arm
it
was
scary
Snapes
lips
were
shaking
his
face
was
white
his
teeth
were
bared
amusing
man
your
father
wasnt
he
said
Snape
shaking
Harry
so
hard
his
glasses
slipped
down
his
nose
i
didnt
snape
threw
Harry
from
him
with
all
his
might
harry
fell
hard
on
to
the
dungeon
floor
you
will
not
repeat
what
you
saw
to
anybody
snape
bellowed
no
said
Harry
getting
to
his
feet
as
far
from
Snape
as
he
could
no
of
course
I
w
get
out
get
out
I
dont
want
to
see
you
in
this
office
ever
again
and
as
Harry
hurtled
towards
the
door
a
jar
of
dead
cockroaches
exploded
over
his
head
he
wrenched
the
door
open
and
flew
along
the
corridor
stopping
only
when
he
had
put
three
floors
between
himself
and
Snape
there
he
leaned
against
the
wall
panting
and
rubbing
his
bruised
arm
he
had
no
desire
at
all
to
return
to
Gryffindor
Tower
so
early
nor
to
tell
Ron
and
Hermione
what
he
had
just
seen
what
was
making
Harry
feel
so
horrified
and
unhappy
was
not
being
shouted
at
or
having
jars
thrown
at
him
it
was
that
he
knew
how
it
felt
to
be
humiliated
in
the
middle
of
a
circle
of
onlookers
knew
exactly
how
Snape
had
felt
as
his
father
had
taunted
him
and
that
judging
from
what
he
had
just
seen
his
father
had
been
every
bit
as
arrogant
as
Snape
had
always
told
him
chapter
twenty-nine
career
Advice

why
havent
you
got
Occlumency
lessons

more
said
Hermione
frowning
ive

Harry
muttered

the
basics
so
youve
stopped
having
funny
dreams
said
Hermione
skeptically
pretty
much
said
Harry
not
looking
at
her
well
I
dont
think
Snape
should
stop
until
youre
absolutely
sure
you
can
control
them
said
hermione
indignantly
harry
I
think
you
should
go
back
to
him
and
ask
no
said
Harry
forcefully
just
drop
it
Hermione
okay
it
was
the
first
day
of
the
Easter
holidays
and
Hermione
as
was
her
custom
had
spent
a
large
part
of
the
day
drawing
up
study
schedule
for
the
three
of
them
harry
and
Ron
had
let
her
do
it
it
was
easier
than
arguing
with
her
and
in
any
case
they
might
come
in
useful
ron
had
been
startled
to
discover
there
were
only
six
weeks
left
until
their
exams
how
can
that
come
as
a
shock
hermione
demanded
as
she
tapped
each
little
square
on
Rons
schedule
with
her
wand
so
that
it
flashed
a
different
color
according
to
its
subject
i
dunno
said
Ron
theres
been
a
lot
going
on
well
there
you
are
she
said
handing
him
his
timetable
if
you
follow
that
you
should
do
fine
ron
looked
down
it
gloomily
but
then
brightened
youve
given
me
an
evening
off
every
week
thats
for
Quidditch
practice
said
Hermione
the
smile
faded
from
Rons
face
whats
the
point
he
said
dully
weve
got
about
as
much
chance
of
winning
the
Quidditch
cup
this
year
as
Dads
got
of
becoming
Minister
for
Magic
hermione
said
nothing
she
was
looking
at
Harry
who
was
staring
blankly
at
the
opposite
wall
of
the
common
room
while
Crookshanks
pawed
at
his
hand
trying
to
get
his
ears
scratched
whats
wrong
Harry
what
he
said
quickly
nothing
he
seized
his
copy
of
Defensive
Magical
Theory
and
pretended
to
be
looking
something
up
in
the
index
crookshanks
gave
him
up
as
a
bad
job
and
slunk
away
under
Hermiones
chair
i
saw
Cho
earlier
said
Hermione
tentatively
she
looked
really
miserable
too
have
you
two
had
a
row
again
wha
oh
yeah
we
have
said
Harry
seizing
gratefully
on
the
excuse
what
about
that
sneak
friend
of
hers
Marietta
said
Harry
yeah
well
I
dont
blame
you
said
Ron
angrily
setting
down
his
revision
timetable
if
it
hadnt
been
for
her
ron
went
into
a
rant
about
Marietta
Edgecombe
which
Harry
found
helpful
all
he
had
to
do
was
look
angry
nod
and
say
Yeah
and
Thats
right
whenever
Ron
drew
breath
leaving
his
mind
free
to
dwell
ever
more
miserably
on
what
he
had
seen
in
the
Pensieve
he
felt
as
though
the
memory
of
it
was
eating
him
from
inside
he
had
been
so
sure
his
parents
were
wonderful
people
that
he
had
never
had
the
slightest
difficulty
in
disbelieving
the
aspersions
Snape
cast
on
his
fathers
character
hadnt
people
like
Hagrid
and
Sirius
told
Harry
how
wonderful
his
father
had
been
Yeah
well
look
what
Sirius
was
like
himself
said
a
nagging
voice
inside
Harrys
head
he
was
as
bad
wasnt
he
Yes
he
had
once
overheard
professor
McGonagall
saying
that
his
father
and
Sirius
had
been
troublemakers
at
school
but
she
had
described
them
as
forerunners
of
the
Weasley
twins
and
Harry
could
not
imagine
Fred
and
george
dangling
someone
upside-down
for
the
fun
of
it
not
unless
they
really
loathed
them
perhaps
Malfoy
or
somebody
who
really
deserved
it
harry
tried
to
make
a
case
for
Snape
having
deserved
what
he
had
suffered
at
Jamess
hands
but
hadnt
Lily
asked
Whats
he
done
to
you
and
hadnt
James
replied
Its
more
the
fact
that
he
exists
if
you
know
what
I
mean
hadnt
James
started
it
all
simply
because
Sirius
had
said
he
was
bored
harry
remembered
Lupin
saying
back
in
Grimmauld
Place
that
Dumbledore
had
made
him
prefect
in
the
hope
that
he
would
be
able
to
exercise
some
control
over
James
and
sirius
but
in
the
Pensieve
he
had
sat
there
and
let
it
all
happen
harry
kept
reminding
himself
that
Lily
had
intervened
his
mother
had
been
decent
yet
the
memory
of
the
look
on
her
face
as
she
had
shouted
at
James
disturbed
him
quite
as
much
as
anything
else
she
had
clearly
loathed
James
and
Harry
simply
could
not
understand
how
they
could
have
ended
up
married
once
or
twice
he
even
wondered
whether
James
had
forced
her
into
it
for
nearly
five
years
the
thought
of
his
father
had
been
a
source
of
comfort
of
inspiration
whenever
someone
had
told
him
he
was
like
James
he
had
glowed
with
pride
inside
and
now
now
he
felt
cold
and
miserable
at
the
thought
of
him
the
weather
grew
breezier
brighter
and
warmer
as
the
Easter
holidays
passed
but
Harry
along
with
the
rest
of
the
fifth
and
seventh-years
was
trapped
inside
traipsing
back
and
forth
to
the
library
harry
pretended
his
bad
mood
had
no
other
cause
but
the
approaching
exams
and
as
his
fellow
Gryffindors
were
sick
of
studying
themselves
his
excuse
went
unchallenged
harry
Im
talking
to
you
can
you
hear
me
huh
he
looked
round
ginny
Weasley
looking
very
windswept
had
joined
him
at
the
library
table
where
he
had
been
sitting
alone
it
was
late
on
Sunday
evening
Hermione
had
gone
back
to
gryffindor
Tower
to
review
Ancient
Runes
and
Ron
had
Quidditch
practice
oh
hi
said
Harry
pulling
his
books
towards
him
how
come
youre
not
at
practice
its
over
said
Ginny
ron
had
to
take
Jack
Sloper
up
to
the
hospital
wing
why
well
were
not
sure
but
we
think
he
knocked
himself
out
with
his
own
bat
she
sighed
heavily
anyway
a
package
just
arrived
its
only
just
got
through
Umbridges
new
screening
process
she
hoisted
a
box
wrapped
in
brown
paper
on
to
the
table
it
had
clearly
been
unwrapped
and
carelessly
re-wrapped
there
was
a
scribbled
note
across
it
in
red
ink
reading
Inspected
and
passed
by
the
Hogwarts
High
Inquisitor
its
Easter
eggs
from
Mum
said
Ginny
theres
one
for
you
there
you
go
she
handed
him
a
handsome
chocolate
egg
decorated
with
small
iced
Snitches
and
according
to
the
packaging
containing
a
bag
of
Fizzing
Whizzbees
harry
looked
at
it
for
a
moment
then
to
his
horror
felt
a
lump
rise
in
his
throat
are
you
okay
Harry
ginny
asked
quietly
yeah
Im
fine
said
Harry
gruffly
the
lump
in
his
throat
was
painful
he
did
not
understand
why
an
Easter
egg
should
have
made
him
feel
like
this
you
seem
really
down
lately
Ginny
persisted
you
know
Im
sure
if
you
just
talked
to
Cho
its
not
Cho
I
want
to
talk
to
said
Harry
brusquely
who
is
it
then
asked
Ginny
watching
him
closely
he
glanced
around
to
make
quite
sure
nobody
was
listening
madam
Pince
was
several
shelves
away
stamping
out
a
pile
of
books
for
a
frantic-looking
Hannah
Abbott
i
wish
I
could
talk
to
Sirius
he
muttered
but
I
know
I
cant
ginny
continued
to
watch
him
thoughtfully
more
to
give
himself
something
to
do
than
because
he
really
wanted
any
Harry
unwrapped
his
Easter
egg
broke
off
a
large
bit
and
put
it
into
his
mouth
well
said
Ginny
slowly
helping
herself
to
a
bit
of
egg
too
if
you
really
want
to
talk
to
Sirius
I
expect
we
could
think
of
a
way
to
do
it
come
on
said
Harry
dully
with
Umbridge
policing
the
fires
and
reading
all
our
mail
the
thing
about
growing
up
with
Fred
and
George
said
Ginny
thoughtfully
is
that
you
sort
of
start
thinking
anythings
possible
if
youve
got
enough
nerve
harry
looked
at
her
perhaps
it
was
the
effect
of
the
chocolate
Lupin
had
always
advised
eating
some
after
encounters
with
Dementors
or
simply
because
he
had
finally
spoken
aloud
the
wish
that
had
been
burning
inside
him
for
a
week
but
he
felt
a
bit
more
hopeful
what
do
you
think
you
are
doing
oh
damn
whispered
Ginny
jumping
to
her
feet
i
forgot
Madam
Pince
was
swooping
down
on
them
her
shriveled
face
contorted
with
rage
chocolate
in
the
library
she
screamed
out
out
out
and
whipping
out
her
wand
she
caused
Harrys
books
bag
and
ink
bottle
to
chase
him
and
Ginny
from
the
library
whacking
them
repeatedly
over
the
head
as
they
ran
as
though
to
underline
the
importance
of
their
upcoming
examinations
a
batch
of
pamphlets
leaflets
and
notices
concerning
various
wizarding
careers
appeared
on
the
tables
in
Gryffindor
tower
shortly
before
the
end
of
the
holidays
along
with
yet
another
notice
on
the
board
which
read
all
fifth-years
are
required
to
attend
a
short
meeting
with
their
Head
of
House
during
the
first
week
of
the
summer
term
to
discuss
their
future
careers
times
of
individual
appointments
are
listed
below
harry
looked
down
the
list
and
found
that
he
was
expected
in
Professor
McGonagalls
office
at
half
past
two
on
Monday
which
would
mean
missing
most
of
Divination
he
and
the
other
fifth
years
spent
a
considerable
part
of
the
final
weekend
of
the
Easter
break
reading
all
the
careers
information
that
had
been
left
there
for
their
perusal
well
I
dont
fancy
Healing
said
Ron
on
the
last
evening
of
the
holidays
he
was
immersed
in
a
leaflet
that
carried
the
crossed
bone-and-wand
emblem
of
st.
Mungos
on
its
front
it
says
here
you
need
at
least
E
at
newt
level
in
Potions
Herbology
Transfiguration
Charms
and
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
i
mean
blimey
dont
want
much
do
they
well
its
a
very
responsible
job
isnt
it
said
Hermione
absently
she
was
poring
over
a
bright
pink
and
orange
leaflet
that
was
headed
so
you
think
youd
like
to
work
in
muggle
relations
you
dont
seem
to
need
many
qualifications
to
liaise
with
Muggles
all
they
want
is
an
owl
in
Muggle
Studies
Much
more
important
is
your
enthusiasm
patience
and
a
good
sense
of
fun
youd
need
more
than
a
good
sense
of
fun
to
liaise
with
my
uncle
said
Harry
darkly
good
sense
of
when
to
duck
more
like
he
was
halfway
through
a
pamphlet
on
wizard
banking
listen
to
this
Are
you
seeking
a
challenging
career
involving
travel
adventure
and
substantial
danger-related
treasure
bonuses
then
consider
a
position
with
Gringotts
Wizarding
Bank
who
are
currently
recruiting
Curse-Breakers
for
thrilling
opportunities
abroad
they
want
arithmancy
though
you
could
do
it
Hermione
i
dont
much
fancy
banking
said
Hermione
vaguely
now
immersed
in
have
you
got
what
it
takes
to
train
security
trolls
hey
said
a
voice
in
Harrys
ear
he
looked
round
Fred
and
George
had
come
to
join
them
ginnys
had
a
word
with
us
about
you
said
Fred
stretching
out
his
legs
on
the
table
in
front
of
them
and
causing
several
booklets
on
careers
with
the
Ministry
of
Magic
to
slide
off
on
to
the
floor
she
says
you
need
to
talk
to
Sirius
what
said
Hermione
sharply
freezing
with
her
hand
halfway
towards
picking
up
make
A
bang
at
the
department
of
magical
accidents
and
catastrophes
yeah
said
Harry
trying
to
sound
casual
yeah
I
thought
Id
like
dont
be
so
ridiculous
said
Hermione
straightening
up
and
looking
at
him
as
though
she
could
not
believe
her
eyes
with
Umbridge
groping
around
in
the
fires
and
frisking
all
the
owls
well
we
think
we
can
find
a
way
around
that
said
George
stretching
and
smiling
its
a
simple
matter
of
causing
a
diversion
now
you
might
have
noticed
that
we
have
been
rather
quiet
on
the
mayhem
front
during
the
Easter
holidays
what
was
the
point
we
asked
ourselves
of
disrupting
leisure
time
continued
Fred
no
point
at
all
we
answered
ourselves
and
of
course
wed
have
messed
up
peoples
studying
too
which
would
be
the
very
last
thing
wed
want
to
do
he
gave
Hermione
a
sanctimonious
little
nod
she
looked
rather
taken
aback
by
this
thoughtfulness
but
its
business
as
usual
from
tomorrow
Fred
continued
briskly
and
if
were
going
to
be
causing
a
bit
of
uproar
why
not
do
it
so
that
Harry
can
have
his
chat
with
Sirius
yes
but
still
said
Hermione
with
an
air
of
explaining
something
very
simple
to
somebody
very
obtuse
even
if
you
do
cause
a
diversion
how
is
Harry
supposed
to
talk
to
him
umbridges
office
said
Harry
quietly
he
had
been
thinking
about
it
for
a
fortnight
and
could
come
up
with
no
alternative
umbridge
herself
had
told
him
that
the
only
fire
that
was
not
being
watched
was
her
own
are
you
insane
said
Hermione
in
a
hushed
voice
ron
had
lowered
his
leaflet
on
jobs
in
the
Cultivated
Fungus
Trade
and
was
watching
the
conversation
warily
i
dont
think
so
said
Harry
shrugging
and
how
are
you
going
to
get
in
there
in
the
first
place
harry
was
ready
for
this
question
siriuss
knife
he
said
excuse
me
christmas
before
last
Sirius
gave
me
a
knife
thatll
open
any
lock
said
Harry
so
even
if
shes
bewitched
the
door
so
Alohomora
wont
work
which
I
bet
she
has
what
do
you
think
about
this
hermione
demanded
of
Ron
and
Harry
was
reminded
irresistibly
of
Mrs
weasley
appealing
to
her
husband
during
Harrys
first
dinner
in
Grimmauld
place
i
dunno
said
Ron
looking
alarmed
at
being
asked
to
give
an
opinion
if
Harry
wants
to
do
it
its
up
to
him
isnt
it
spoken
like
a
true
friend
and
Weasley
said
Fred
clapping
Ron
hard
on
the
back
right
then
were
thinking
of
doing
it
tomorrow
just
after
lessons
because
it
should
cause
maximum
impact
if
everybodys
in
the
corridors
Harry
well
set
it
off
in
the
east
wing
somewhere
draw
her
right
away
from
her
own
office
I
reckon
we
should
be
able
to
guarantee
you
what
twenty
minutes
he
said
looking
at
George
easy
said
George
what
sort
of
diversion
is
it
asked
Ron
youll
see
little
bro
said
Fred
as
he
and
George
got
up
again
at
least
you
will
if
you
trot
along
to
Gregory
the
Smarmys
corridor
round
about
five
oclock
tomorrow
harry
awoke
very
early
the
next
day
feeling
almost
as
anxious
as
he
had
done
on
the
morning
of
his
disciplinary
hearing
at
the
Ministry
of
Magic
it
was
not
only
the
prospect
of
breaking
into
umbridges
office
and
using
her
fire
to
speak
to
Sirius
that
was
making
him
feel
nervous
though
that
was
certainly
bad
enough
today
also
happened
to
be
the
first
time
Harry
would
be
in
close
proximity
to
Snape
since
Snape
had
thrown
him
out
of
his
office
after
lying
in
bed
for
a
while
thinking
about
the
day
ahead
Harry
got
up
very
quietly
and
moved
across
to
the
window
beside
Nevilles
bed
and
stared
out
on
a
truly
glorious
morning
the
sky
was
a
clear
misty
opalescent
blue
directly
ahead
of
him
Harry
could
see
the
towering
beech
tree
below
which
his
father
had
once
tormented
Snape
he
was
not
sure
what
Sirius
could
possibly
say
to
him
that
would
make
up
for
what
he
had
seen
in
the
Pensieve
but
he
was
desperate
to
hear
Siriuss
own
account
of
what
had
happened
to
know
of
any
mitigating
factors
there
might
have
been
any
excuse
at
all
for
his
fathers
behavior
something
caught
Harrys
attention
movement
on
the
edge
of
the
Forbidden
Forest
harry
squinted
into
the
sun
and
saw
Hagrid
emerging
from
between
the
trees
he
seemed
to
be
limping
as
Harry
watched
Hagrid
staggered
to
the
door
of
his
cabin
and
disappeared
inside
it
harry
watched
the
cabin
for
several
minutes
hagrid
did
not
emerge
again
but
smoke
furled
from
the
chimney
so
Hagrid
could
not
be
so
badly
injured
that
he
was
unequal
to
stoking
the
fire
harry
turned
away
from
the
window
headed
back
to
his
trunk
and
started
to
dress
with
the
prospect
of
forcing
entry
into
Umbridges
office
ahead
Harry
had
never
expected
the
day
to
be
a
restful
one
but
he
had
not
reckoned
on
Hermiones
almost
continual
attempts
to
dissuade
him
from
what
he
was
planning
to
do
at
five
oclock
for
the
first
time
ever
she
was
at
least
as
inattentive
to
Professor
Binns
in
History
of
Magic
as
Harry
and
Ron
were
keeping
up
a
stream
of
whispered
admonitions
that
Harry
tried
very
hard
to
ignore
and
if
she
does
catch
you
there
apart
from
being
expelled
shell
be
able
to
guess
youve
been
talking
to
Snuffles
and
this
time
I
expect
shell
force
you
to
drink
Veritaserum
and
answer
her
questions
hermione
said
Ron
in
a
low
and
indignant
voice
are
you
going
to
stop
telling
Harry
off
and
listen
to
Binns
or
am
I
going
to
have
to
take
my
own
notes
you
take
notes
for
a
change
it
wont
kill
you
by
the
time
they
reached
the
dungeons
neither
Harry
nor
Ron
was
speaking
to
Hermione
undeterred
she
took
advantage
of
their
silence
to
maintain
an
uninterrupted
flow
of
dire
warnings
all
uttered
under
her
breath
in
a
vehement
hiss
that
caused
Seamus
to
waste
five
whole
minutes
checking
his
cauldron
for
leaks
snape
meanwhile
seemed
to
have
decided
to
act
as
though
Harry
were
invisible
harry
was
of
course
well-used
to
this
tactic
as
it
was
one
of
Uncle
Vernons
favorites
and
on
the
whole
was
grateful
he
had
to
suffer
nothing
worse
in
fact
compared
to
what
he
usually
had
to
endure
from
snape
in
the
way
of
taunts
and
snide
remarks
he
found
the
new
approach
something
of
an
improvement
and
was
pleased
to
find
that
when
left
well
alone
he
was
able
to
concoct
an
invigoration
Draught
quite
easily
at
the
end
of
the
lesson
he
scooped
some
of
the
potion
into
a
flask
corked
it
and
took
it
up
to
Snapes
desk
for
marking
feeling
that
he
might
at
last
have
scraped
an
E
he
had
just
turned
away
when
he
heard
a
smashing
noise
malfoy
gave
a
gleeful
yell
of
laughter
harry
whipped
around
his
potion
sample
lay
in
pieces
on
the
floor
and
Snape
was
surveying
him
with
a
look
of
gloating
pleasure
whoops
he
said
softly
another
zero
then
Potter
harry
was
too
incensed
to
speak
he
strode
back
to
his
cauldron
intending
to
fill
another
flask
and
force
Snape
to
mark
it
but
saw
to
his
horror
that
the
rest
of
the
contents
had
vanished
im
sorry
said
Hermione
with
her
hands
over
her
mouth
im
really
sorry
Harry
i
thought
youd
finished
so
I
cleared
up
harry
could
not
bring
himself
to
answer
when
the
bell
rang
he
hurried
out
of
the
dungeon
without
a
backwards
glance
and
made
sure
that
he
found
himself
a
seat
between
Neville
and
seamus
for
lunch
so
that
Hermione
could
not
start
nagging
him
again
about
using
Umbridges
office
he
was
in
such
a
bad
mood
by
the
time
he
got
to
Divination
that
he
had
quite
forgotten
his
careers
appointment
with
Professor
McGonagall
remembering
it
only
when
Ron
asked
him
why
he
wasnt
in
her
office
he
hurtled
back
upstairs
and
arrived
out
of
breath
only
a
few
minutes
late
sorry
Professor
he
panted
as
he
closed
the
door
i
forgot
no
matter
Potter
she
said
briskly
but
as
she
spoke
somebody
else
sniffed
from
the
corner
harry
looked
round
professor
Umbridge
was
sitting
there
a
clipboard
on
her
knee
a
fussy
little
pie-frill
around
her
neck
and
a
small
horribly
smug
smile
on
her
face
sit
down
Potter
said
Professor
McGonagall
tersely
her
hands
shook
slightly
as
she
shuffled
the
many
pamphlets
littering
her
desk
harry
sat
down
with
his
back
to
Umbridge
and
did
his
best
to
pretend
he
could
not
hear
the
scratching
of
her
quill
on
her
clipboard
well
Potter
this
meeting
is
to
talk
over
any
career
ideas
you
might
have
and
to
help
you
decide
which
subjects
you
should
continue
into
the
sixth
and
seventh
years
said
Professor
mcGonagall
have
you
had
any
thoughts
about
what
you
would
like
to
do
after
you
leave
hogwarts
er
said
Harry
he
was
finding
the
scratching
noise
from
behind
him
very
distracting
yes
professor
McGonagall
prompted
Harry
well
I
thought
of
maybe
being
an
Auror
Harry
mumbled
youd
need
top
grades
for
that
said
Professor
McGonagall
extracting
a
small
dark
leaflet
from
under
the
mass
on
her
desk
and
opening
it
they
ask
for
a
minimum
of
five
NEWTs
and
nothing
under
Exceeds
Expectations
grade
I
see
then
you
would
be
required
to
undergo
a
stringent
series
of
character
and
aptitude
tests
at
the
Auror
office
its
a
difficult
career
path
Potter
they
only
take
the
best
in
fact
I
dont
think
anybody
has
been
taken
on
in
the
last
three
years
at
this
moment
Professor
Umbridge
gave
a
very
tiny
cough
as
though
she
was
trying
to
see
how
quietly
she
could
do
it
professor
McGonagall
ignored
her
youll
want
to
know
which
subjects
you
ought
to
take
I
suppose
she
went
on
talking
a
little
louder
than
before
yes
said
Harry
defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
I
suppose
naturally
said
Professor
McGonagall
crisply
i
would
also
advise
professor
Umbridge
gave
another
cough
a
little
more
audible
this
time
professor
McGonagall
closed
her
eyes
for
a
moment
opened
them
again
and
continued
as
though
nothing
had
happened
i
would
also
advise
Transfiguration
because
Aurors
frequently
need
to
Transfigure
or
untransfigure
in
their
work
and
I
ought
to
tell
you
now
Potter
that
I
do
not
accept
students
into
my
newt
classes
unless
they
have
achieved
Exceeds
Expectations
or
higher
at
Ordinary
Wizarding
Level
id
say
youre
averaging
Acceptable
at
the
moment
so
youll
need
to
put
in
some
good
hard
work
before
the
exams
to
stand
a
chance
of
continuing
then
you
ought
to
do
Charms
always
useful
and
Potions
yes
Potter
Potions
she
added
with
the
merest
flicker
of
a
smile
poisons
and
antidotes
are
essential
study
for
Aurors
and
I
must
tell
you
that
Professor
Snape
absolutely
refuses
to
take
students
who
get
anything
other
than
Outstanding
in
their
OWLs
so
professor
Umbridge
gave
her
most
pronounced
cough
yet
may
I
offer
you
a
cough
drop
Dolores
professor
McGonagall
asked
curtly
without
looking
at
Professor
Umbridge
oh
no
thank
you
very
much
said
Umbridge
with
that
simpering
laugh
Harry
hated
so
much
i
just
wondered
whether
I
could
make
the
teensiest
interruption
Minerva
i
daresay
youll
find
you
can
said
Professor
McGonagall
through
tightly
gritted
teeth
i
was
just
wondering
whether
mr.
Potter
has
quite
the
temperament
for
an
Auror
said
Professor
Umbridge
sweetly
were
you
said
Professor
McGonagall
haughtily
well
Potter
she
continued
as
though
there
had
been
no
interruption
if
you
are
serious
in
this
ambition
I
would
advise
you
to
concentrate
hard
on
bringing
your
Transfiguration
and
Potions
up
to
scratch
i
see
Professor
Flitwick
has
graded
you
between
Acceptable
and
Exceeds
Expectations
for
the
last
two
years
so
your
Charmwork
seems
satisfactory
as
for
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
your
marks
have
been
generally
high
Professor
Lupin
in
particular
thought
you
are
you
quite
sure
you
wouldnt
like
a
cough
drop
Dolores
oh
no
need
thank
you
Minerva
simpered
Professor
Umbridge
who
had
just
coughed
her
loudest
yet
i
was
just
concerned
that
you
might
not
have
Harrys
most
recent
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
marks
in
front
of
you
im
quite
sure
I
slipped
in
a
note
what
this
thing
said
Professor
McGonagall
in
a
tone
of
revulsion
as
she
pulled
a
sheet
of
pink
parchment
from
between
the
leaves
of
Harrys
folder
she
glanced
down
it
her
eyebrows
slightly
raised
then
placed
it
back
into
the
folder
without
comment
yes
as
I
was
saying
Potter
Professor
Lupin
thought
you
showed
a
pronounced
aptitude
for
the
subject
and
obviously
for
an
Auror
did
you
not
understand
my
note
Minerva
asked
Professor
Umbridge
in
honeyed
tones
quite
forgetting
to
cough
of
course
I
understood
it
said
Professor
McGonagall
her
teeth
clenched
so
tightly
the
words
came
out
a
little
muffled
well
then
I
am
confused
im
afraid
I
dont
quite
understand
how
you
can
give
mr.
Potter
false
hope
that
false
hope
repeated
Professor
McGonagall
still
refusing
to
look
round
at
Professor
umbridge
he
has
achieved
high
marks
in
all
his
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
tests
im
terribly
sorry
to
have
to
contradict
you
Minerva
but
as
you
will
see
from
my
note
Harry
has
been
achieving
very
poor
results
in
his
classes
with
me
i
should
have
made
my
meaning
plainer
said
Professor
McGonagall
turning
at
last
to
look
umbridge
directly
in
the
eyes
he
has
achieved
high
marks
in
all
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
tests
set
by
a
competent
teacher
professor
Umbridges
smile
vanished
as
suddenly
as
a
light
bulb
blowing
she
sat
back
in
her
chair
turned
a
sheet
on
her
clipboard
and
began
scribbling
very
fast
indeed
her
bulging
eyes
rolling
from
side
to
side
professor
McGonagall
turned
back
to
Harry
her
thin
nostrils
flared
her
eyes
burning
any
questions
Potter
yes
said
Harry
what
sort
of
character
and
aptitude
tests
do
the
Ministry
do
on
you
if
you
get
enough
NEWTs
well
youll
need
to
demonstrate
the
ability
to
react
well
to
pressure
and
so
forth
said
professor
McGonagall
perseverance
and
dedication
because
Auror
training
takes
a
further
three
years
not
to
mention
very
high
skills
in
practical
Defense
it
will
mean
a
lot
more
study
even
after
youve
left
school
so
unless
youre
prepared
to
i
think
youll
also
find
said
Umbridge
her
voice
very
cold
now
that
the
Ministry
looks
into
the
records
of
those
applying
to
be
Aurors
their
criminal
records
unless
youre
prepared
to
take
even
more
exams
after
Hogwarts
you
should
really
look
at
another
which
means
that
this
boy
has
as
much
chance
of
becoming
an
Auror
as
Dumbledore
has
of
ever
returning
to
this
school
a
very
good
chance
then
said
Professor
McGonagall
potter
has
a
criminal
record
said
Umbridge
loudly
potter
has
been
cleared
of
all
charges
said
McGonagall
even
more
loudly
professor
Umbridge
stood
up
she
was
so
short
that
this
did
not
make
a
great
deal
of
difference
but
her
fussy
simpering
demeanour
had
given
place
to
a
hard
fury
that
made
her
broad
flabby
face
look
oddly
sinister
potter
has
no
chance
whatsoever
of
becoming
an
Auror
professor
McGonagall
got
to
her
feet
too
and
in
her
case
this
was
a
much
more
impressive
move
she
towered
over
Professor
Umbridge
potter
she
said
in
ringing
tones
I
will
assist
you
to
become
an
Auror
if
it
is
the
last
thing
I
do
if
I
have
to
coach
you
nightly
I
will
make
sure
you
achieve
the
required
results
the
Minister
for
Magic
will
never
employ
Harry
Potter
said
Umbridge
her
voice
rising
furiously
there
may
well
be
a
new
Minister
for
Magic
by
the
time
Potter
is
ready
to
join
shouted
professor
McGonagall
aha
shrieked
Professor
Umbridge
pointing
a
stubby
finger
at
McGonagall
yes
yes
yes
yes
of
course
thats
what
you
want
isnt
it
Minerva
McGonagall
you
want
Cornelius
Fudge
replaced
by
Albus
Dumbledore
you
think
youll
be
where
I
am
dont
you
Senior
undersecretary
to
the
Minister
and
Headmistress
to
boot
you
are
raving
said
Professor
McGonagall
superbly
disdainful
potter
that
concludes
our
careers
consultation
harry
swung
his
bag
over
his
shoulder
and
hurried
out
of
the
room
not
daring
to
look
at
professor
Umbridge
he
could
hear
her
and
Professor
McGonagall
continuing
to
shout
at
each
other
all
the
way
back
along
the
corridor
professor
Umbridge
was
still
breathing
as
though
she
had
just
run
a
race
when
she
strode
into
their
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
lesson
that
afternoon
i
hope
youve
thought
better
of
what
you
were
planning
to
do
Harry
Hermione
whispered
the
moment
they
had
opened
their
books
to
Chapter
thirty-four
Non-Retaliation
and
Negotiation
umbridge
looks
like
shes
in
a
really
bad
mood
already
every
now
and
then
Umbridge
shot
glowering
looks
at
Harry
who
kept
his
head
down
staring
at
Defensive
Magical
Theory
his
eyes
unfocused
thinking
he
could
just
imagine
Professor
McGonagalls
reaction
if
he
was
caught
trespassing
in
Professor
umbridges
office
mere
hours
after
she
had
vouched
for
him
there
was
nothing
to
stop
him
simply
going
back
to
Gryffindor
Tower
and
hoping
that
some
time
during
the
next
summer
holidays
he
would
have
a
chance
to
ask
Sirius
about
the
scene
he
had
witnessed
in
the
pensieve
nothing
except
that
the
thought
of
taking
this
sensible
course
of
action
made
him
feel
as
though
a
lead
weight
had
dropped
into
his
stomach
and
then
there
was
the
matter
of
fred
and
George
whose
diversion
was
already
planned
not
to
mention
the
knife
Sirius
had
given
him
which
was
currently
residing
in
his
schoolbag
along
with
his
fathers
old
Invisibility
cloak
but
the
fact
remained
that
if
he
was
caught
dumbledore
sacrificed
himself
to
keep
you
in
school
Harry
whispered
Hermione
raising
her
book
to
hide
her
face
from
Umbridge
and
if
you
get
thrown
out
today
it
will
all
have
been
for
nothing
he
could
abandon
the
plan
and
simply
learn
to
live
with
the
memory
of
what
his
father
had
done
on
a
summers
day
more
than
twenty
years
ago
and
then
he
remembered
Sirius
in
the
fire
upstairs
in
the
Gryffindor
common
room
youre
less
like
your
father
than
I
thought
the
risk
wouldve
been
what
made
it
fun
for
james
but
did
he
want
to
be
like
his
father
any
more
harry
dont
do
it
please
dont
do
it
hermione
said
in
anguished
tones
as
the
bell
rang
at
the
end
of
the
class
he
did
not
answer
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
ron
seemed
determined
to
give
neither
his
opinion
nor
his
advice
he
would
not
look
at
Harry
though
when
Hermione
opened
her
mouth
to
try
dissuading
Harry
some
more
he
said
in
a
low
voice
Give
it
a
rest
okay
he
can
make
up
his
own
mind
harrys
heart
beat
very
fast
as
he
left
the
classroom
he
was
halfway
along
the
corridor
outside
when
he
heard
the
unmistakable
sounds
of
a
diversion
going
off
in
the
distance
there
were
screams
and
yells
reverberating
from
somewhere
above
them
people
exiting
the
classrooms
all
around
Harry
were
stopping
in
their
tracks
and
looking
up
at
the
ceiling
fearfully
umbridge
came
pelting
out
of
her
classroom
as
fast
as
her
short
legs
would
carry
her
pulling
out
her
wand
she
hurried
off
in
the
opposite
direction
it
was
now
or
never
harry
please
hermione
pleaded
weakly
but
he
had
made
up
his
mind
hitching
his
bag
more
securely
on
to
his
shoulder
he
set
off
at
a
run
weaving
in
and
out
of
students
now
hurrying
in
the
opposite
direction
to
see
what
all
the
fuss
was
about
in
the
east
wing
harry
reached
the
corridor
to
Umbridges
office
and
found
it
deserted
dashing
behind
a
large
suit
of
armor
whose
helmet
creaked
around
to
watch
him
he
pulled
open
his
bag
seized
Siriuss
knife
and
donned
the
Invisibility
Cloak
he
then
crept
slowly
and
carefully
back
out
from
behind
the
suit
of
armor
and
along
the
corridor
until
he
reached
Umbridges
door
he
inserted
the
blade
of
the
magical
knife
into
the
crack
around
it
and
moved
it
gently
up
and
down
then
withdrew
it
there
was
a
tiny
click
and
the
door
swung
open
he
ducked
inside
the
office
closed
the
door
quickly
behind
him
and
looked
around
nothing
was
moving
except
the
horrible
kittens
that
were
still
frolicking
on
the
wall
plates
above
the
confiscated
broomsticks
harry
pulled
off
his
Cloak
and
striding
over
to
the
fireplace
found
what
he
was
looking
for
within
seconds
a
small
box
containing
glittering
Floo
powder
he
crouched
down
in
front
of
the
empty
grate
his
hands
shaking
he
had
never
done
this
before
though
he
thought
he
knew
how
it
must
work
sticking
his
head
into
the
fireplace
he
took
a
large
pinch
of
powder
and
dropped
it
on
to
the
logs
stacked
neatly
beneath
him
they
exploded
at
once
into
emerald
green
flames
number
twelve
Grimmauld
Place
harry
said
loudly
and
clearly
it
was
one
of
the
most
curious
sensations
he
had
ever
experienced
he
had
traveled
by
Floo
powder
before
of
course
but
then
it
had
been
his
entire
body
that
had
spun
around
and
around
in
the
flames
through
the
network
of
wizarding
fireplaces
that
stretched
over
the
country
this
time
his
knees
remained
firm
upon
the
cold
floor
of
Umbridges
office
and
only
his
head
hurtled
through
the
emerald
fire
and
then
as
abruptly
as
it
had
begun
the
spinning
stopped
feeling
rather
sick
and
as
though
he
were
wearing
an
exceptionally
hot
muffler
around
his
head
Harry
opened
his
eyes
to
find
that
he
was
looking
up
out
of
the
kitchen
fireplace
at
the
long
wooden
table
where
a
man
sat
poring
over
a
piece
of
parchment
sirius
the
man
jumped
and
looked
around
it
was
not
Sirius
but
Lupin
harry
he
said
looking
thoroughly
shocked
what
are
you
whats
happened
is
everything
all
right
yeah
said
Harry
i
just
wondered
I
mean
I
just
fancied
a
a
chat
with
Sirius
ill
call
him
said
Lupin
getting
to
his
feet
still
looking
perplexed
he
went
upstairs
to
look
for
Kreacher
he
seems
to
be
hiding
in
the
attic
again
and
Harry
saw
Lupin
hurry
out
of
the
kitchen
now
he
was
left
with
nothing
to
look
at
but
the
chair
and
table
legs
he
wondered
why
Sirius
had
never
mentioned
how
very
uncomfortable
it
was
to
speak
out
of
the
fire
his
knees
were
already
objecting
painfully
to
their
prolonged
contact
with
Umbridges
hard
stone
floor
lupin
returned
with
Sirius
at
his
heels
moments
later
what
is
it
said
Sirius
urgently
sweeping
his
long
dark
hair
out
of
his
eyes
and
dropping
to
the
ground
in
front
of
the
fire
so
that
he
and
Harry
were
on
a
level
lupin
knelt
down
too
looking
very
concerned
are
you
all
right
do
you
need
help
no
said
Harry
its
nothing
like
that
i
just
wanted
to
talk
about
my
dad
they
exchanged
a
look
of
great
surprise
but
Harry
did
not
have
time
to
feel
awkward
or
embarrassed
his
knees
were
becoming
sorer
by
the
second
and
he
guessed
five
minutes
had
already
passed
from
the
start
of
the
diversion
George
had
only
guaranteed
him
twenty
he
therefore
plunged
immediately
into
the
story
of
what
he
had
seen
in
the
Pensieve
when
he
had
finished
neither
Sirius
nor
Lupin
spoke
for
a
moment
then
Lupin
said
quietly
I
wouldnt
like
you
to
judge
your
father
on
what
you
saw
there
Harry
he
was
only
fifteen
im
fifteen
said
Harry
heatedly
look
Harry
said
Sirius
placatingly
James
and
Snape
hated
each
other
from
the
moment
they
set
eyes
on
each
other
it
was
just
one
of
those
things
you
can
understand
that
cant
you
i
think
james
was
everything
Snape
wanted
to
be
he
was
popular
he
was
good
at
Quidditch
good
at
pretty
much
everything
and
Snape
was
just
this
little
oddball
who
was
up
to
his
eyes
in
the
dark
Arts
and
James
whatever
else
he
may
have
appeared
to
you
Harry
always
hated
the
dark
Arts
yeah
said
Harry
but
he
just
attacked
Snape
for
no
good
reason
just
because
well
just
because
you
said
you
were
bored
he
finished
with
a
slightly
apologetic
note
in
his
voice
im
not
proud
of
it
said
Sirius
quickly
lupin
looked
sideways
at
Sirius
then
said
Look
Harry
what
youve
got
to
understand
is
that
your
father
and
Sirius
were
the
best
in
the
school
at
whatever
they
did
everyone
thought
they
were
the
height
of
cool
if
they
sometimes
got
a
bit
carried
away
if
we
were
sometimes
arrogant
little
berks
you
mean
said
Sirius
lupin
smiled
he
kept
messing
up
his
hair
said
Harry
in
a
pained
voice
sirius
and
Lupin
laughed
id
forgotten
he
used
to
do
that
said
Sirius
affectionately
was
he
playing
with
the
Snitch
said
Lupin
eagerly
yeah
said
Harry
watching
uncomprehendingly
as
Sirius
and
Lupin
beamed
reminiscently
well
i
thought
he
was
a
bit
of
an
idiot
of
course
he
was
a
bit
of
an
idiot
said
Sirius
bracingly
we
were
all
idiots
well
not
Moony
so
much
he
said
fairly
looking
at
Lupin
but
Lupin
shook
his
head
did
I
ever
tell
you
to
lay
off
Snape
he
said
did
I
ever
have
the
guts
to
tell
you
I
thought
you
were
out
of
order
yeah
well
said
Sirius
you
made
us
feel
ashamed
of
ourselves
sometimes
that
was
something
and
said
Harry
doggedly
determined
to
say
everything
that
was
on
his
mind
now
he
was
here
he
kept
looking
over
at
the
girls
by
the
lake
hoping
they
were
watching
him
oh
well
he
always
made
a
fool
of
himself
whenever
Lily
was
around
said
Sirius
shrugging
he
couldnt
stop
himself
showing
off
whenever
he
got
near
her
how
come
she
married
him
harry
asked
miserably
she
hated
him
nah
she
didnt
said
Sirius
she
started
going
out
with
him
in
seventh
year
said
Lupin
once
James
had
deflated
his
head
a
bit
said
Sirius
and
stopped
hexing
people
just
for
the
fun
of
it
said
Lupin
even
Snape
said
Harry
well
said
Lupin
slowly
Snape
was
a
special
case
I
mean
he
never
lost
an
opportunity
to
curse
James
so
you
couldnt
really
expect
James
to
take
that
lying
down
could
you
and
my
mum
was
okay
with
that
she
didnt
know
too
much
about
it
to
tell
you
the
truth
said
Sirius
i
mean
James
didnt
take
snape
on
dates
with
her
and
jinx
him
in
front
of
her
did
he
sirius
frowned
at
Harry
who
was
still
looking
unconvinced
look
he
said
your
father
was
the
best
friend
I
ever
had
and
he
was
a
good
person
a
lot
of
people
are
idiots
at
the
age
of
fifteen
he
grew
out
of
it
yeah
okay
said
Harry
heavily
i
just
never
thought
Id
feel
sorry
for
Snape
now
you
mention
it
said
Lupin
a
faint
crease
between
his
eyebrows
how
did
Snape
react
when
he
found
youd
seen
all
this
he
told
me
hed
never
teach
me
Occlumency
again
said
Harry
indifferently
like
thats
a
big
disappoint
he
what
shouted
Sirius
causing
Harry
to
jump
and
inhale
a
mouthful
of
ashes
are
you
serious
Harry
said
Lupin
quickly
hes
stopped
giving
you
lessons
yeah
said
Harry
surprised
at
what
he
considered
a
great
over-reaction
but
its
okay
I
dont
care
its
a
bit
of
a
relief
to
tell
you
the
im
coming
up
there
to
have
a
word
with
Snape
said
Sirius
forcefully
and
he
actually
made
to
stand
up
but
Lupin
wrenched
him
back
down
again
if
anyones
going
to
tell
Snape
it
will
be
me
he
said
firmly
but
Harry
first
of
all
youre
to
go
back
to
Snape
and
tell
him
that
on
no
account
is
he
to
stop
giving
you
lessons
when
dumbledore
hears
i
cant
tell
him
that
hed
kill
me
said
Harry
outraged
you
didnt
see
him
when
we
got
out
of
the
Pensieve
harry
there
is
nothing
so
important
as
you
learning
Occlumency
said
Lupin
sternly
do
you
understand
me
nothing
okay
okay
said
Harry
thoroughly
discomposed
not
to
mention
annoyed
ill
ill
try
and
say
something
to
him
but
it
wont
be
he
fell
silent
he
could
hear
distant
footsteps
is
that
Kreacher
coming
downstairs
no
said
Sirius
glancing
behind
him
it
must
be
somebody
your
end
harrys
heart
skipped
several
beats
id
better
go
he
said
hastily
and
pulled
his
head
backwards
out
of
the
Grimmauld
Place
fire
for
a
moment
his
head
seemed
to
be
revolving
on
his
shoulders
then
he
found
himself
kneeling
in
front
of
Umbridges
fire
with
it
firmly
back
on
and
watching
the
emerald
flames
flicker
and
die
quickly
quickly
he
heard
a
wheezy
voice
mutter
right
outside
the
office
door
ah
shes
left
it
open
harry
dived
for
the
Invisibility
Cloak
and
had
just
managed
to
pull
it
back
over
himself
when
filch
burst
into
the
office
he
looked
absolutely
delighted
about
something
and
was
talking
to
himself
feverishly
as
he
crossed
the
room
pulled
open
a
drawer
in
Umbridges
desk
and
began
rifling
through
the
papers
inside
it
approval
for
Whipping
approval
for
Whipping
i
can
do
it
at
last
theyve
had
it
coming
to
them
for
years
he
pulled
out
a
piece
of
parchment
kissed
it
then
shuffled
rapidly
back
out
of
the
door
clutching
it
to
his
chest
harry
leapt
to
his
feet
and
making
sure
he
had
his
bag
and
that
the
Invisibility
Cloak
was
completely
covering
him
he
wrenched
open
the
door
and
hurried
out
of
the
office
after
Filch
who
was
hobbling
along
faster
than
Harry
had
ever
seen
him
go
one
landing
down
from
Umbridges
office
Harry
thought
it
was
safe
to
become
visible
again
he
pulled
off
the
Cloak
shoved
it
in
his
bag
and
hurried
onwards
there
was
a
great
deal
of
shouting
and
movement
coming
from
the
Entrance
Hall
he
ran
down
the
marble
staircase
and
found
what
looked
like
most
of
the
school
assembled
there
it
was
just
like
the
night
when
Trelawney
had
been
sacked
students
were
standing
all
around
the
walls
in
a
great
ring
some
of
them
Harry
noticed
covered
in
a
substance
that
looked
very
like
stinksap
teachers
and
ghosts
were
also
in
the
crowd
prominent
among
the
onlookers
were
members
of
the
Inquisitorial
Squad
who
were
all
looking
exceptionally
pleased
with
themselves
and
Peeves
who
was
bobbing
overhead
gazed
down
at
Fred
and
George
who
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
with
the
unmistakable
look
of
two
people
who
had
just
been
cornered
so
said
Umbridge
triumphantly
harry
realized
she
was
standing
just
a
few
stairs
in
front
of
him
once
more
looking
down
upon
her
prey
so
you
think
it
amusing
to
turn
a
school
corridor
into
a
swamp
do
you
pretty
amusing
yeah
said
Fred
looking
up
at
her
without
the
slightest
sign
of
fear
filch
elbowed
his
way
closer
to
Umbridge
almost
crying
with
happiness
ive
got
the
form
Headmistress
he
said
hoarsely
waving
the
piece
of
parchment
Harry
had
just
seen
him
take
from
her
desk
ive
got
the
form
and
Ive
got
the
whips
waiting
oh
let
me
do
it
now
very
good
Argus
she
said
you
two
she
went
on
gazing
down
at
Fred
and
George
are
about
to
learn
what
happens
to
wrongdoers
in
my
school
you
know
what
said
Fred
i
dont
think
we
are
he
turned
to
his
twin
george
said
Fred
I
think
weve
outgrown
full-time
education
yeah
Ive
been
feeling
that
way
myself
said
George
lightly
time
to
test
our
talents
in
the
real
world
dyou
reckon
asked
Fred
definitely
said
George
and
before
Umbridge
could
say
a
word
they
raised
their
wands
and
said
together
accio
brooms
harry
heard
a
loud
crash
somewhere
in
the
distance
looking
to
his
left
he
ducked
just
in
time
fred
and
Georges
broomsticks
one
still
trailing
the
heavy
chain
and
iron
peg
with
which
umbridge
had
fastened
them
to
the
wall
were
hurtling
along
the
corridor
towards
their
owners
they
turned
left
streaked
down
the
stairs
and
stopped
sharply
in
front
of
the
twins
the
chain
clattering
loudly
on
the
flagged
stone
floor
we
wont
be
seeing
you
Fred
told
Professor
Umbridge
swinging
his
leg
over
his
broomstick
yeah
dont
bother
to
keep
in
touch
said
George
mounting
his
own
fred
looked
around
at
the
assembled
students
at
the
silent
watchful
crowd
if
anyone
fancies
buying
a
Portable
Swamp
as
demonstrated
upstairs
come
to
number
ninety-three
Diagon
Alley
Weasleys
Wizarding
Wheezes
he
said
in
a
loud
voice
our
new
premises
special
discounts
to
Hogwarts
students
who
swear
theyre
going
to
use
our
products
to
get
rid
of
this
old
bat
added
George
pointing
at
Professor
Umbridge
stop
them
shrieked
Umbridge
but
it
was
too
late
as
the
Inquisitorial
Squad
closed
in
fred
and
George
kicked
off
from
the
floor
shooting
fifteen
feet
into
the
air
the
iron
peg
swinging
dangerously
below
fred
looked
across
the
hall
at
the
poltergeist
bobbing
on
his
level
above
the
crowd
give
her
hell
from
us
Peeves
and
Peeves
who
Harry
had
never
seen
take
an
order
from
a
student
before
swept
his
belled
hat
from
his
head
and
sprang
to
a
salute
as
Fred
and
George
wheeled
about
to
tumultuous
applause
from
the
students
below
and
sped
out
of
the
open
front
doors
into
the
glorious
sunset
chapter
thirty
grawp
the
story
of
Fred
and
Georges
flight
to
freedom
was
retold
so
often
over
the
next
few
days
that
harry
could
tell
it
would
soon
become
the
stuff
of
Hogwarts
legend
within
a
week
even
those
who
had
been
eye-witnesses
were
half-convinced
they
had
seen
the
twins
dive-bomb
Umbridge
on
their
brooms
and
pelt
her
with
Dungbombs
before
zooming
out
of
the
doors
in
the
immediate
aftermath
of
their
departure
there
was
a
great
wave
of
talk
about
copying
them
harry
frequently
heard
students
saying
things
like
Honestly
some
days
I
just
feel
like
jumping
on
my
broom
and
leaving
this
place
or
else
One
more
lesson
like
that
and
I
might
just
do
a
Weasley
fred
and
George
had
made
sure
nobody
was
likely
to
forget
them
too
soon
for
one
thing
they
had
not
left
instructions
on
how
to
remove
the
swamp
that
now
filled
the
corridor
on
the
fifth
floor
of
the
east
wing
umbridge
and
Filch
had
been
observed
trying
different
means
of
removing
it
but
without
success
eventually
the
area
was
roped
off
and
Filch
gnashing
his
teeth
furiously
was
given
the
task
of
punting
students
across
it
to
their
classrooms
harry
was
certain
that
teachers
like
McGonagall
or
Flitwick
could
have
removed
the
swamp
in
an
instant
but
just
as
in
the
case
of
Fred
and
Georges
Wildfire
whiz-bangs
they
seemed
to
prefer
to
watch
umbridge
struggle
then
there
were
the
two
large
broom-shaped
holes
in
Umbridges
office
door
through
which
fred
and
Georges
Cleansweeps
had
smashed
to
rejoin
their
masters
filch
fitted
a
new
door
and
removed
Harrys
Firebolt
to
the
dungeons
where
it
was
rumored
Umbridge
had
set
an
armed
security
troll
to
guard
it
however
her
troubles
were
far
from
over
inspired
by
Fred
and
Georges
example
a
great
number
of
students
were
now
vying
for
the
newly
vacant
positions
of
Troublemakers-in-Chief
in
spite
of
the
new
door
somebody
managed
to
slip
a
hairy-snouted
Niffler
into
Umbridges
office
which
promptly
tore
the
place
apart
in
its
search
for
shiny
objects
leapt
on
Umbridge
when
she
entered
and
tried
to
gnaw
the
rings
off
her
stubby
fingers
dungbombs
and
Stink
Pellets
were
dropped
so
frequently
in
the
corridors
that
it
became
the
new
fashion
for
students
to
perform
Bubble-Head
Charms
on
themselves
before
leaving
lessons
which
ensured
them
a
supply
of
fresh
air
even
though
it
gave
them
all
the
peculiar
appearance
of
wearing
upside-down
goldfish
bowls
on
their
heads
filch
prowled
the
corridors
with
a
horsewhip
ready
in
his
hands
desperate
to
catch
miscreants
but
the
problem
was
that
there
were
now
so
many
of
them
he
never
knew
which
way
to
turn
the
inquisitorial
Squad
was
attempting
to
help
him
but
odd
things
kept
happening
to
its
members
warrington
of
the
Slytherin
Quidditch
team
reported
to
the
hospital
wing
with
a
horrible
skin
complaint
that
made
him
look
as
though
he
had
been
coated
in
cornflakes
Pansy
Parkinson
to
hermiones
delight
missed
all
her
lessons
the
following
day
as
she
had
sprouted
antlers
meanwhile
it
became
clear
just
how
many
Skiving
Snackboxes
Fred
and
George
had
managed
to
sell
before
leaving
Hogwarts
umbridge
only
had
to
enter
her
classroom
for
the
students
assembled
there
to
faint
vomit
develop
dangerous
fevers
or
else
spout
blood
from
both
nostrils
shrieking
with
rage
and
frustration
she
attempted
to
trace
the
mysterious
symptoms
to
their
source
but
the
students
told
her
stubbornly
they
were
suffering
from
Umbridge
itis
after
putting
four
successive
classes
in
detention
and
failing
to
discover
their
secret
she
was
forced
to
give
up
and
allow
the
bleeding
swooning
sweating
and
vomiting
students
to
leave
her
classes
in
droves
but
not
even
the
users
of
the
Snackboxes
could
compete
with
that
master
of
chaos
Peeves
who
seemed
to
have
taken
Freds
parting
words
deeply
to
heart
cackling
madly
he
soared
through
the
school
upending
tables
bursting
out
of
blackboards
toppling
statues
and
vases
twice
he
shut
Mrs
norris
inside
a
suit
of
armor
from
which
she
was
rescued
yowling
loudly
by
the
furious
caretaker
peeves
smashed
lanterns
and
snuffed
out
candles
juggled
burning
torches
over
the
heads
of
screaming
students
caused
neatly
stacked
piles
of
parchment
to
topple
into
fires
or
out
of
windows
flooded
the
second
floor
when
he
pulled
off
all
the
taps
in
the
bathrooms
dropped
a
bag
of
tarantulas
in
the
middle
of
the
Great
Hall
during
breakfast
and
whenever
he
fancied
a
break
spent
hours
at
a
time
floating
along
after
Umbridge
and
blowing
loud
raspberries
every
time
she
spoke
none
of
the
staff
but
Filch
seemed
to
be
stirring
themselves
to
help
her
indeed
a
week
after
fred
and
Georges
departure
Harry
witnessed
Professor
McGonagall
walking
right
past
Peeves
who
was
determinedly
loosening
a
crystal
chandelier
and
could
have
sworn
he
heard
her
tell
the
poltergeist
out
of
the
corner
of
her
mouth
It
unscrews
the
other
way
to
cap
matters
Montague
had
still
not
recovered
from
his
sojourn
in
the
toilet
he
remained
confused
and
disorientated
and
his
parents
were
to
be
observed
one
Tuesday
morning
striding
up
the
front
drive
looking
extremely
angry
should
we
say
something
said
Hermione
in
a
worried
voice
pressing
her
cheek
against
the
charms
window
so
that
she
could
see
mr.
and
Mrs
montague
marching
inside
about
what
happened
to
him
in
case
it
helps
Madam
Pomfrey
cure
him
course
not
hell
recover
said
Ron
indifferently
anyway
more
trouble
for
Umbridge
isnt
it
said
Harry
in
a
satisfied
voice
he
and
Ron
both
tapped
the
teacups
they
were
supposed
to
be
charming
with
their
wands
harrys
spouted
four
very
short
legs
that
could
not
reach
the
desk
and
wriggled
pointlessly
in
midair
rons
grew
four
very
thin
spindly
legs
that
hoisted
the
cup
off
the
desk
with
great
difficulty
trembled
for
a
few
seconds
then
folded
causing
the
cup
to
crack
into
two
reparo
said
Hermione
quickly
mending
Rons
cup
with
a
wave
of
her
wand
thats
all
very
well
but
what
if
Montagues
permanently
injured
who
cares
said
Ron
irritably
while
his
teacup
stood
up
drunkenly
again
trembling
violently
at
the
knees
montague
shouldnt
have
tried
to
take
all
those
points
from
Gryffindor
should
he
if
you
want
to
worry
about
anyone
Hermione
worry
about
me
you
she
said
catching
her
teacup
as
it
scampered
happily
away
across
the
desk
on
four
sturdy
little
willow-patterned
legs
and
replacing
it
in
front
of
her
why
should
I
be
worried
about
you
when
Mums
next
letter
finally
gets
through
Umbridges
screening
process
said
Ron
bitterly
now
holding
his
cup
up
while
its
frail
legs
tried
feebly
to
support
its
weight
Im
going
to
be
in
deep
trouble
i
wouldnt
be
surprised
if
shes
sent
another
Howler
but
itll
be
my
fault
Fred
and
George
left
you
wait
said
Ron
darkly
shell
say
I
shouldve
stopped
them
leaving
I
shouldve
grabbed
the
ends
of
their
brooms
and
hung
on
or
something
yeah
itll
be
all
my
fault
well
if
she
does
say
that
itll
be
very
unfair
you
couldnt
have
done
anything
but
Im
sure
she
wont
I
mean
if
its
really
true
theyve
got
premises
in
Diagon
Alley
they
must
have
been
planning
this
for
ages
yeah
but
thats
another
thing
how
did
they
get
premises
said
Ron
hitting
his
teacup
so
hard
with
his
wand
that
its
legs
collapsed
again
and
it
lay
twitching
before
him
its
a
bit
dodgy
isnt
it
theyll
need
loads
of
Galleons
to
afford
the
rent
on
a
place
in
Diagon
Alley
shell
want
to
know
what
theyve
been
up
to
to
get
their
hands
on
that
sort
of
gold
well
yes
that
occurred
to
me
too
said
Hermione
allowing
her
teacup
to
jog
in
neat
little
circles
around
Harrys
whose
stubby
little
legs
were
still
unable
to
touch
the
desktop
Ive
been
wondering
whether
Mundungus
has
persuaded
them
to
sell
stolen
goods
or
something
awful
he
hasnt
said
Harry
curtly
how
do
you
know
said
Ron
and
Hermione
together
because
Harry
hesitated
but
the
moment
to
confess
finally
seemed
to
have
come
there
was
no
good
to
be
gained
in
keeping
silent
if
it
meant
anyone
suspected
that
Fred
and
George
were
criminals
because
they
got
the
gold
from
me
i
gave
them
my
Triwizard
winnings
last
June
there
was
a
shocked
silence
then
Hermiones
teacup
jogged
right
over
the
edge
of
the
desk
and
smashed
on
the
floor
oh
Harry
you
didnt
she
said
yes
I
did
said
Harry
mutinously
and
I
dont
regret
it
either
i
didnt
need
the
gold
and
theyll
be
great
at
running
a
joke
shop
but
this
is
excellent
said
Ron
looking
thrilled
its
all
your
fault
Harry
Mum
cant
blame
me
at
all
can
I
tell
her
yeah
I
suppose
youd
better
said
Harry
dully
specially
if
she
thinks
theyre
receiving
stolen
cauldrons
or
something
hermione
said
nothing
at
all
for
the
rest
of
the
lesson
but
Harry
had
a
shrewd
suspicion
that
her
self-restraint
was
bound
to
crack
before
long
sure
enough
once
they
had
left
the
castle
for
break
and
were
standing
around
in
the
weak
May
sunshine
she
fixed
Harry
with
a
beady
eye
and
opened
her
mouth
with
a
determined
air
harry
interrupted
her
before
she
had
even
started
its
no
good
nagging
me
its
done
he
said
firmly
fred
and
George
have
got
the
gold
spent
a
good
bit
of
it
too
by
the
sounds
of
it
and
I
cant
get
it
back
from
them
and
I
dont
want
to
so
save
your
breath
Hermione
i
wasnt
going
to
say
anything
about
Fred
and
George
she
said
in
an
injured
voice
ron
snorted
disbelievingly
and
Hermione
threw
him
a
very
dirty
look
no
I
wasnt
she
said
angrily
as
a
matter
of
fact
I
was
going
to
ask
Harry
when
hes
going
to
go
back
to
Snape
and
ask
for
more
Occlumency
lessons
harrys
heart
sank
once
they
had
exhausted
the
subject
of
Fred
and
Georges
dramatic
departure
which
admittedly
had
taken
many
hours
Ron
and
Hermione
had
wanted
to
hear
news
of
Sirius
as
Harry
had
not
confided
in
them
the
reason
he
had
wanted
to
talk
to
Sirius
in
the
first
place
it
had
been
hard
to
think
of
what
to
tell
them
he
had
ended
up
saying
truthfully
that
sirius
wanted
Harry
to
resume
Occlumency
lessons
he
had
been
regretting
this
ever
since
hermione
would
not
let
the
subject
drop
and
kept
reverting
to
it
when
Harry
least
expected
it
you
cant
tell
me
youve
stopped
having
funny
dreams
Hermione
said
now
because
Ron
told
me
you
were
muttering
in
your
sleep
again
last
night
harry
threw
Ron
a
furious
look
ron
had
the
grace
to
look
ashamed
of
himself
you
were
only
muttering
a
bit
he
mumbled
apologetically
something
about
just
a
bit
further
i
dreamed
I
was
watching
you
lot
play
Quidditch
Harry
lied
brutally
i
was
trying
to
get
you
to
stretch
out
a
bit
further
to
grab
the
Quaffle
rons
ears
went
red
harry
felt
a
kind
of
vindictive
pleasure
he
had
not
of
course
dreamed
anything
of
the
sort
last
night
he
had
once
again
made
the
journey
along
the
Department
of
Mysteries
corridor
he
had
passed
through
the
circular
room
then
the
room
full
of
clicking
and
dancing
light
until
he
found
himself
again
inside
that
cavernous
room
full
of
shelves
on
which
were
ranged
dusty
glass
spheres
he
had
hurried
straight
towards
row
number
ninety-seven
turned
left
and
ran
along
it
it
had
probably
been
then
that
he
had
spoken
aloud
just
a
bit
further
for
he
felt
his
conscious
self
struggling
to
wake
and
before
he
had
reached
the
end
of
the
row
he
had
found
himself
lying
in
bed
again
gazing
up
at
the
canopy
of
his
four-poster
you
are
trying
to
block
your
mind
arent
you
said
Hermione
looking
beadily
at
Harry
you
are
keeping
going
with
your
Occlumency
of
course
I
am
said
Harry
trying
to
sound
as
though
this
question
was
insulting
but
not
quite
meeting
her
eye
the
truth
was
he
was
so
intensely
curious
about
what
was
hidden
in
that
room
full
of
dusty
orbs
that
he
was
quite
keen
for
the
dreams
to
continue
the
problem
was
that
with
just
under
a
month
to
go
until
the
exams
and
every
free
moment
devoted
to
revision
his
mind
seemed
so
saturated
with
information
when
he
went
to
bed
he
found
it
very
difficult
to
get
to
sleep
at
all
and
when
he
did
his
overwrought
brain
presented
him
most
nights
with
stupid
dreams
about
the
exams
he
also
suspected
that
part
of
his
mind
the
part
that
often
spoke
in
Hermiones
voice
now
felt
guilty
on
the
occasions
it
strayed
down
that
corridor
ending
in
the
black
door
and
sought
to
wake
him
before
he
could
reach
the
journeys
end
you
know
said
Ron
whose
ears
were
still
flaming
red
if
Montague
doesnt
recover
before
slytherin
play
Hufflepuff
we
might
be
in
with
a
chance
of
winning
the
Cup
yeah
I
spose
so
said
Harry
glad
of
a
change
of
subject
i
mean
weve
won
one
lost
one
if
Slytherin
lose
to
Hufflepuff
next
Saturday
yeah
thats
right
said
Harry
losing
track
of
what
he
was
agreeing
to
cho
Chang
had
just
walked
across
the
courtyard
determinedly
not
looking
at
him
the
final
match
of
the
Quidditch
season
Gryffindor
versus
Ravenclaw
was
to
take
place
on
the
last
weekend
of
May
although
Slytherin
had
been
narrowly
defeated
by
Hufflepuff
in
their
last
match
Gryffindor
were
not
daring
to
hope
for
victory
due
mainly
though
of
course
nobody
said
it
to
him
to
Rons
abysmal
goal-keeping
record
he
however
seemed
to
have
found
a
new
optimism
i
mean
I
cant
get
any
worse
can
I
he
told
Harry
and
Hermione
grimly
over
breakfast
on
the
morning
of
the
match
nothing
to
lose
now
is
there
you
know
said
Hermione
as
she
and
Harry
walked
down
to
the
pitch
a
little
later
in
the
midst
of
a
very
excitable
crowd
I
think
Ron
might
do
better
without
Fred
and
George
around
they
never
exactly
gave
him
a
lot
of
confidence
luna
Lovegood
overtook
them
with
what
appeared
to
be
a
live
eagle
perched
on
top
of
her
head
oh
gosh
I
forgot
said
Hermione
watching
the
eagle
flapping
its
wings
as
Luna
walked
serenely
past
a
group
of
cackling
and
pointing
Slytherins
cho
will
be
playing
wont
she
harry
who
had
not
forgotten
this
merely
grunted
they
found
seats
in
the
topmost
row
of
the
stands
it
was
a
fine
clear
day
Ron
could
not
wish
for
better
and
Harry
found
himself
hoping
against
hope
that
Ron
would
not
give
the
Slytherins
cause
for
more
rousing
choruses
of
Weasley
is
our
King
lee
Jordan
who
had
been
very
dispirited
since
Fred
and
George
had
left
was
commentating
as
usual
as
the
teams
zoomed
out
on
to
the
pitch
he
named
the
players
with
something
less
than
his
usual
gusto
bradley
davies
chang
he
said
and
Harry
felt
his
stomach
perform
less
of
a
back
flip
more
a
feeble
lurch
as
Cho
walked
out
on
to
the
pitch
her
shiny
black
hair
rippling
in
the
slight
breeze
he
was
not
sure
what
he
wanted
to
happen
any
more
except
that
he
could
not
stand
any
more
rows
even
the
sight
of
her
chatting
animatedly
to
Roger
Davies
as
they
prepared
to
mount
their
brooms
caused
him
only
a
slight
twinge
of
jealousy
and
theyre
off
said
Lee
and
Davies
takes
the
Quaffle
immediately
Ravenclaw
Captain
davies
with
the
Quaffle
he
dodges
Johnson
he
dodges
Bell
he
dodges
Spinnet
as
well
hes
going
straight
for
goal
hes
going
to
shoot
and
and
Lee
swore
very
loudly
and
hes
scored
harry
and
Hermione
groaned
with
the
rest
of
the
Gryffindors
predictably
horribly
the
slytherins
on
the
other
side
of
the
stands
began
to
sing
Weasley
cannot
save
a
thing
He
cannot
block
a
single
ring
harry
said
a
hoarse
voice
in
Harrys
ear
hermione
harry
looked
round
and
saw
Hagrids
enormous
bearded
face
sticking
between
the
seats
apparently
he
had
squeezed
his
way
all
along
the
row
behind
for
the
first
and
second-years
he
had
just
passed
had
a
ruffled
flattened
look
about
them
for
some
reason
Hagrid
was
bent
double
as
though
anxious
not
to
be
seen
though
he
was
still
at
least
four
feet
taller
than
everybody
else
listen
he
whispered
can
yeh
come
with
me
now
while
evryones
watchin
the
match

Hagrid
asked
Harry
till
the

Hagrid
no
Harry
its

while
evryones
lookin
the
other
way

hagrids
nose
was
gently
dripping
blood
his
eyes
were
both
blackened
harry
had
not
seen
him
this
close-up
since
his
return
to
the
school
he
looked
utterly
woebegone
course
said
Harry
at
once
course
well
come
he
and
Hermione
edged
back
along
their
row
of
seats
causing
much
grumbling
among
the
students
who
had
to
stand
up
for
them
the
people
in
Hagrids
row
were
not
complaining
merely
attempting
to
make
themselves
as
small
as
possible
i
ppreciate
this
you
two
I
really
do
said
Hag
rid
as
they
reached
the
stairs
he
kept
looking
around
nervously
as
they
descended
towards
the
lawn
below
i
jus
hope
she
doesn
notice
us

you
mean
Umbridge
said
Harry
she
wont
shes
got

Inquisitorial
Squad

with
her
didnt
you
see
she
must
be
expecting
trouble
at
the
match
yeah
well
a
bit
o
trouble
wouldn
hurt
said
Hagrid
pausing
to
peer
around
the
edge
of
the
stands
to
make
sure
the
stretch
of
lawn
between
there
and
his
cabin
was
deserted
give
us
more
time
what
is
it
Hagrid
said
Hermione
looking
up
at
him
with
a
concerned
expression
on
her
face
as
they
hurried
across
the
grass
towards
the
edge
of
the
Forest
yeh
yehll
see
in
a
mo
said
Hagrid
looking
over
his
shoulder
as
a
great
roar
rose
from
the
stands
behind
them
hey
did
someone
jus
score
itll
be
Ravenclaw
said
Harry
heavily
good
good
said
Hagrid
distractedly
thas
good
they
had
to
jog
to
keep
up
with
him
as
he
strode
across
the
lawn
looking
around
with
every
other
step
when
they
reached
his
cabin
Hermione
turned
automatically
left
towards
the
front
door
hagrid
however
walked
straight
past
it
into
the
shade
of
the
trees
on
the
outermost
edge
of
the
Forest
where
he
picked
up
a
crossbow
that
was
leaning
against
a
tree
when
he
realized
they
were
no
longer
with
him
he
turned
were
goin
in
here
he
said
jerking
his
shaggy
head
behind
him
into
the
Forest
said
Hermione
perplexed
yeah
said
Hagrid
cmon
now
quick
before
were
spotted
harry
and
Hermione
looked
at
each
other
then
ducked
into
the
cover
of
the
trees
behind
Hagrid
who
was
already
striding
away
from
them
into
the
green
gloom
his
crossbow
over
his
arm
harry
and
Hermione
ran
to
catch
up
with
him
hagrid
why
are
you
armed
said
Harry
jus
a
precaution
said
Hagrid
shrugging
his
massive
shoulders
you

crossbow

day

Thestrals
said
Hermione
timidly
nah
well
we
weren
goin
in
so
far
then
said
Hagrid
an
anyway
tha
was
before
Firenze
left
the
Forest
wasn
it
why
does
Firenze
leaving
make
a
difference
asked
Hermione
curiously
cause
the
other
centaurs
are
good
an
riled
at
me
thas
why
said
Hagrid
quietly
glancing
around
they
used
ter
be
well
yeh
couldn
call
em
friendly
but
we
got
on
all
righ
kept
emselves
to
emselves
bu
always
turned
up
if
I
wanted
a
word
not
any
more
he
sighed
deeply
firenze
said
theyre
angry
because
he
went
to
work
for
Dumbledore
Harry
said
tripping
on
a
protruding
root
because
he
was
busy
watching
Hagrids
profile
yeah
said
Hagrid
heavily
well
angry
doesn
cover
it
ruddy
livid
if
I
hadn
stepped
in
I
reckon
theydve
kicked
Firenze
ter
death
they
attacked
him
said
Hermione
sounding
shocked
yep
said
Hagrid
gruffly
forcing
his
way
through
several
low-hanging
branches
he
had
half
the
herd
on
to
him
and
you
stopped
it
said
Harry
amazed
and
impressed
by
yourself
course
I
did
couldnt
stand
by
an
watch
em
kill
im
could
I
said
Hagrid
lucky
I
was
passin
really
an
Idve
thought
Firenze
mighta
remembered
tha
before
he
started
sendin
me
stupid
warnins
he
added
hotly
and
unexpectedly
harry
and
Hermione
looked
at
each
other
startled
but
Hagrid
scowling
did
not
elaborate
anyway
he
said
breathing
a
little
more
heavily
than
usual
since
then
the
other
centaursve
bin
livid
with
me
an
the
trouble
is
theyve
got
a
lot
of
influence
in
the
Forest
cleverest
creatures
in
here
is
that
why
were
here
Hagrid
asked
Hermione
the
centaurs
ah
no
said
Hagrid
shaking
his
head
dismissively
no
its
not
them
well
o
course
they
could
complicate
the
problem
yeah
but
yehll
see
what
I
mean
in
a
bit
on
this
incomprehensible
note
he
fell
silent
and
forged
a
little
ahead
taking
one
stride
for
every
three
of
theirs
so
that
they
had
great
trouble
keeping
up
with
him
the
path
was
becoming
increasingly
overgrown
and
the
trees
grew
so
closely
together
as
they
walked
further
and
further
into
the
Forest
that
it
was
as
dark
as
dusk
they
were
soon
a
long
way
past
the
clearing
where
Hagrid
had
shown
them
the
Thestrals
but
Harry
felt
no
sense
of
unease
until
Hagrid
stepped
unexpectedly
off
the
path
and
began
wending
his
way
in
and
out
of
trees
towards
the
dark
heart
of
the
Forest
hagrid
said
Harry
fighting
his
way
through
thickly
knotted
brambles
over
which
Hagrid
had
stepped
with
ease
and
remembering
very
vividly
what
had
happened
to
him
on
the
other
occasion
he
had
stepped
off
the
Forest
path
where
are
we
going
bit
further
said
Hagrid
over
his
shoulder
cmon
Harry
we
need
ter
keep
together
now
it
was
a
great
struggle
to
keep
up
with
Hagrid
what
with
branches
and
thickets
of
thorn
through
which
Hagrid
marched
as
easily
as
if
they
were
cobwebs
but
which
snagged
Harry
and
hermiones
robes
frequently
entangling
them
so
severely
that
they
had
to
stop
for
minutes
at
a
time
to
free
themselves
harrys
arms
and
legs
were
soon
covered
in
small
cuts
and
scratches
they
were
so
deep
in
the
Forest
now
that
sometimes
all
Harry
could
see
of
Hagrid
in
the
gloom
was
a
massive
dark
shape
ahead
of
him
any
sound
seemed
threatening
in
the
muffled
silence
the
breaking
of
a
twig
echoed
loudly
and
the
tiniest
rustle
of
movement
even
though
it
might
have
been
made
by
an
innocent
sparrow
caused
Harry
to
peer
through
the
gloom
for
a
culprit
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
had
never
managed
to
get
this
far
into
the
Forest
without
meeting
some
kind
of
creature
their
absence
struck
him
as
rather
ominous
hagrid
would
it
be
all
right
if
we
lit
our
wands
said
Hermione
quietly
er
all
righ
Hagrid
whispered
back
in
fact
he
stopped
suddenly
and
turned
around
Hermione
walked
right
into
him
and
was
knocked
over
backwards
harry
caught
her
just
before
she
hit
the
Forest
floor
maybe
we
bes
jus
stop
fer
a
momen
so
I
can
fill
yeh
in
said
Hagrid
before
we
ge
there
like
good
said
Hermione
as
Harry
set
her
back
on
her
feet
they
both
murmured
Lumos
and
their
wand-tips
ignited
hagrids
face
swam
through
the
gloom
by
the
light
of
the
two
wavering
beams
and
Harry
saw
again
that
he
looked
nervous
and
sad
righ
said
Hagrid
well
see
the
thing
is
he
took
a
great
breath
well
theres
a
good
chance
Im
goin
ter
be
gettin
the
sack
any
day
now
he
said
harry
and
Hermione
looked
at
each
other
then
back
at
him
but
youve
lasted
this
long
Hermione
said
tentatively
what
makes
you
think
umbridge
reckons
it
was
me
that
put
tha
Niffler
in
her
office
and
was
it
said
Harry
before
he
could
stop
himself
no
it
ruddy

said
Hagrid
indignantly
ony
any-thin

magical
creatures
an
she

front
o
the
whole
school
like
she
did
with
Trelawney
harry
and
Hermione
both
made
noises
of
protest
but
Hagrid
overrode
them
with
a
wave
of
one
of
his
enormous
hands
its
not
the
end
o
the
world
Ill
be
able
ter
help
Dumbledore

useful

the
Order

Grubbly-Plank

through
yer
exams
fine
his
voice
trembled
and
broke
don
worry
abou
me
he
said
hastily
as
Hermione
made
to
pat
his
arm
he
pulled
his
enormous
spotted
handkerchief
from
the
pocket
of
his
waistcoat
and
mopped
his
eyes
with
it
look
I
wouldn
be
tellin
yer
this
at
all
if
I
didn
have
ter
see
if
I
go

I

Ill
Ill

an
Ron
if
hes
willin
of
course
well
help
you
said
Harry
at
once
what
do
you
want
us
to
do
hagrid
gave
a
great
sniff
and
patted
Harry
wordlessly
on
the
shoulder
with
such
force
Harry
was
knocked
sideways
into
a
tree
i
knew
yehd
say
yes
said
Hagrid
into
his
handkerchief
but
I
won
never
forget
well
cmon
jus
a
little
bit
further
through
here
watch
yerselves
now
theres
nettles
they
walked
on
in
silence
for
another
fifteen
minutes
Harry
had
opened
his
mouth
to
ask
how
much
further
they
had
to
go
when
Hagrid
threw
out
his
right
arm
to
signal
that
they
should
stop
really
easy
he
said
softly
very
quiet
now
they
crept
forwards
and
Harry
saw
that
they
were
facing
a
large
smooth
mound
of
earth
nearly
as
tall
as
Hagrid
that
he
thought
with
a
jolt
of
dread
was
sure
to
be
the
lair
of
some
enormous
animal
trees
had
been
ripped
up
at
the
roots
all
around
the
mound
so
that
it
stood
on
a
bare
patch
of
ground
surrounded
by
heaps
of
trunks
and
boughs
that
formed
a
kind
of
fence
or
barricade
behind
which
Harry
Hermione
and
Hagrid
now
stood
sleepin
breathed
Hagrid
sure
enough
Harry
could
hear
a
distant
rhythmic
rumbling
that
sounded
like
a
pair
of
enormous
lungs
at
work
he
glanced
sideways
at
Hermione
who
was
gazing
at
the
mound
with
her
mouth
slightly
open
she
looked
utterly
terrified
hagrid
she
said
in
a
whisper
barely
audible
over
the
sound
of
the
sleeping
creature
who
is
he
harry
found
this
an
odd
question
what
is
it
was
the
one
he
had
been
planning
on
asking
hagrid
you
told
us
said
Hermione
her
wand
now
shaking
in
her
hand
you
told
us
none
of
them
wanted
to
come
harry
looked
from
her
to
Hagrid
and
then
as
realization
hit
him
he
looked
back
at
the
mound
with
a
small
gasp
of
horror
the
great
mound
of
earth
on
which
he
Hermione
and
Hagrid
could
easily
have
stood
was
moving
slowly
up
and
down
in
time
with
the
deep
grunting
breathing
it
was
not
a
mound
at
all
it
was
the
curved
back
of
what
was
clearly
well
no
he
didn
want
ter
come
said
Hagrid
sounding
desperate
but
I
had
ter
bring
him
hermione
I
had
ter
but
why
asked
Hermione
who
sounded
as
though
she
wanted
to
cry
why
what
oh
Hagrid
i
knew
if
I
jus
got
him
back
said
Hagrid
sounding
close
to
tears
himself
an
an
taught
him
a
few
manners
Id
be
able
ter
take
him
outside
an
show
evryone
hes
harmless
harmless
said
Hermione
shrilly
and
Hagrid
made
frantic
hushing
noises
with
his
hands
as
the
enormous
creature
before
them
grunted
loudly
and
shifted
in
its
sleep
hes
been
hurting
you
all
this
time
hasnt
he
thats
why
youve
had
all
these
injuries
he
don
know
his
own
strength
said
Hagrid
earnestly
an
hes
gettin
better
hes
not
fightin
so
much
any
more
so
this
is
why
it
took
you
two
months
to
get
home
said
Hermione
distractedly
oh
Hagrid
why
did
you
bring
him
back
if
he
didnt
want
to
come
wouldnt
he
have
been
happier
with
his
own
people
they
were
all
bullyin
him
Hermione
cause
hes
so
small
said
Hagrid
small
said
Hermione
small
hermione
I
couldn
leave
him
said
Hagrid
tears
now
trickling
down
his
bruised
face
into
his
beard
see
hes
my
brother
hermione
simply
stared
at
him
her
mouth
open
hagrid
when
you
say
brother
said
Harry
slowly
d
o
you
mean
well
half-brother
amended
Hagrid
turns
out
me
mother
took
up
with
another
giant
when
she
left
me
dad
an
she
went
an
had
Grawp

said
Harry
yeah
well
thas
what

name
said
Hagrid
anxiously
he
don
speak
a
lot
of
English
ive
bin
tryin
ter
teach
him
anyway
she
don
seem
ter
have
liked
him
much
moren
she
liked
me

giantesses
what
counts
is
producin
good
big
kids
and
hes
always
been
a
bit
on
the
runty
side
fer
a
giant
ony
sixteen
foot
oh
yes
tiny
said
Hermione
with
a
kind
of
hysterical
sarcasm
absolutely
minuscule
he
was
bein
kicked
aroun
by
all
o
them
I
jus
couldn
leave
him
did
Madame
Maxime
want
to
bring
him
back
asked
Harry
she
well
she
could
see
it
was
right
importan
ter
me
said
Hagrid
twisting
his
enormous
hands
bu
bu
she
got
a
bit
tired
o
him
after
a
while
I
must
admit
so
we
split
up
on
the
journey
home
she
promised
not
ter
tell
anyone
though
how
on
earth
did
you
get
him
back
without
anyone
noticing
said
Harry
well
thas
why
it
took
so
long
see
said
Hagrid
could
ony
travel
by
nigh
an
through
wild
country
an
stuff
course
he
covers
the
ground
pretty
well
when
he
wants
ter
but
he
kep
wantin
ter
go
back
oh
Hagrid
why
on
earth
didnt
you
let
him
said
Hermione
flopping
down
on
to
a
ripped
up
tree
and
burying
her
face
in
her
hands
what
do
you
think
youre
going
to
do
with
a
violent
giant
who
doesnt
even
want
to
be
here
well
now
violent
thas
a
bit
harsh
said
Hagrid
still
twisting
his
hands
agitatedly
ill
admit
he
mighta
taken
a
couple
o
swings
at
me
when
hes
bin
in
a
bad
mood
but
hes
gettin
better
loads
better
settlin
down
well
what
are
those
ropes
for
then
harry
asked
he
had
just
noticed
ropes
thick
as
saplings
stretching
from
around
the
trunks
of
the
largest
nearby
trees
towards
the
place
where
Grawp
lay
curled
on
the
ground
with
his
back
to
them
you
have
to
keep
him
tied
up
said
Hermione
faintly
well
yeah
said
Hagrid
looking
anxious
see
its
like
I
say
he
doesn
really
know
is
own
strength
harry
understood
now
why
there
had
been
such
a
suspicious
lack
of
any
other
living
creature
in
this
part
of
the
Forest
so
what
is
it
you
want
Harry
and
Ron
and
me
to
do
hermione
asked
apprehensively
look
after
him
said
Hagrid
croakily
after
Im
gone
harry
and
Hermione
exchanged
miserable
looks
Harry
uncomfortably
aware
that
he
had
already
promised
Hagrid
that
he
would
do
whatever
he
asked
what
what
does
that
involve
exactly
hermione
enquired
not
food
or
anythin
said
Hagrid
eagerly
he
can
get
his
own
food
no
problem
birds
an
deer
an
stuff
no
its
company
he
needs
if
I
jus
knew
someone
was
carryin
on
tryin
ter
help
him
a
bit
teachin
him
yeh
know
harry
said
nothing
but
turned
to
look
back
at
the
gigantic
form
lying
asleep
on
the
ground
in
front
of
them
unlike
Hagrid
who
simply
looked
like
an
oversized
human
Grawp
looked
strangely
misshapen
what
Harry
had
taken
to
be
a
vast
mossy
boulder
to
the
left
of
the
great
earthen
mound
he
now
recognized
as
Grawps
head
it
was
much
larger
in
proportion
to
the
body
than
a
human
head
and
was
almost
perfectly
round
and
covered
with
tightly
curling
close-growing
hair
the
color
of
bracken
the
rim
of
a
single
large
fleshy
ear
was
visible
on
top
of
the
head
which
seemed
to
sit
rather
like
Uncle
Vernons
directly
upon
the
shoulders
with
little
or
no
neck
in
between
the
back
under
what
looked
like
a
dirty
brownish
smock
comprised
of
animal
skins
sewn
roughly
together
was
very
broad
and
as
Grawp
slept
it
seemed
to
strain
a
little
at
the
rough
seams
of
the
skins
the
legs
were
curled
up
under
the
body
harry
could
see
the
soles
of
enormous
filthy
bare
feet
large
as
sledges
resting
one
on
top
of
the
other
on
the
earthy
Forest
floor
you
want
us
to
teach
him
Harry
said
in
a
hollow
voice
he
now
understood
what
Firenzes
warning
had
meant
his
attempt
is
not
working
he
would
do
better
to
abandon
it
of
course
the
other
creatures
who
lived
in
the
Forest
would
have
heard
Hagrids
fruitless
attempts
to
teach
grawp
English
yeah
even
if
yeh
jus
talk
ter
him
a
bit
said
Hagrid
hopefully
cause
I
reckon
if
he
can
talk
ter
people
hell
understand
more
that
we
all
like
im
really
an
want
im
ter
stay
harry
looked
at
Hermione
who
peered
back
at
him
from
between
the
fingers
over
her
face
kind
of
makes
you
wish
we
had
Norbert
back
doesnt
it
he
said
and
she
gave
a
very
shaky
laugh
yehll
do
it
then
said
Hagrid
who
did
not
seem
to
have
caught
what
Harry
had
just
said
well
said
Harry
already
bound
by
his
promise
well
try
Hagrid
i
knew
I
could
count
on
yeh
Harry
Hagrid
said
beaming
in
a
very
watery
way
and
dabbing
at
his
face
with
his
handkerchief
again
an
I
don
want
yeh
ter
put
yerself
out
too
much
like
know
yehve
got
exams
if
yeh
could
jus
nip
down
here
in
yer
Invisibility
Cloak
maybe
once
a
week
an
have
a
little
chat
with
im
ill
wake
im
up
then
introduce
yeh
wha
no
said
Hermione
jumping
up
hagrid
no
dont
wake
him
really
we
dont
need
but
Hagrid
had
already
stepped
over
the
great
tree
trunk
in
front
of
them
and
was
proceeding
towards
Grawp
when
he
was
about
ten
feet
away
he
lifted
a
long
broken
bough
from
the
ground
smiled
reassuringly
over
his
shoulder
at
Harry
and
Hermione
then
poked
Grawp
hard
in
the
middle
of
the
back
with
the
end
of
the
bough
the
giant
gave
a
roar
that
echoed
around
the
silent
Forest
birds
in
the
treetops
overhead
rose
twittering
from
their
perches
and
soared
away
in
front
of
Harry
and
Hermione
meanwhile
the
gigantic
Grawp
was
rising
from
the
ground
which
shuddered
as
he
placed
an
enormous
hand
upon
it
to
push
himself
on
to
his
knees
he
turned
his
head
to
see
who
and
what
had
disturbed
him
all
righ
Grawpy
said
Hagrid
in
a
would-be
cheery
voice
backing
away
with
the
long
bough
raised
ready
to
poke
Grawp
again
had
a
nice
sleep
eh
harry
and
Hermione
retreated
as
far
as
they
could
while
still
keeping
the
giant
within
their
sights
grawp
knelt
between
two
trees
he
had
not
yet
uprooted
they
looked
up
into
his
startlingly
huge
face
that
resembled
a
grey
full
moon
swimming
in
the
gloom
of
the
clearing
it
was
as
though
the
features
had
been
hewn
on
to
a
great
stone
ball
the
nose
was
stubby
and
shapeless
the
mouth
lopsided
and
full
of
misshapen
yellow
teeth
the
size
of
half-bricks
the
eyes
small
by
giant
standards
were
a
muddy
greenish-brown
and
just
now
were
half-gummed
together
with
sleep
grawp
raised
dirty
knuckles
each
as
big
as
a
cricket
ball
to
his
eyes
rubbed
vigorously
then
without
warning
pushed
himself
to
his
feet
with
surprising
speed
and
agility
oh
my
harry
heard
Hermione
squeal
terrified
beside
him
the
trees
to
which
the
other
ends
of
the
ropes
around
Grawps
wrists
and
ankles
were
attached
creaked
ominously
he
was
as
Hagrid
had
said
at
least
sixteen
feet
tall
gazing
blearily
around
grawp
reached
out
a
hand
the
size
of
a
beach
umbrella
seized
a
birds
nest
from
the
upper
branches
of
a
towering
pine
and
turned
it
upside-down
with
a
roar
of
apparent
displeasure
that
there
was
no
bird
in
it
eggs
fell
like
grenades
towards
the
ground
and
Hagrid
threw
his
arms
over
his
head
to
protect
himself
anyway
Grawpy
shouted
Hagrid
looking
up
apprehensively
in
case
of
further
falling
eggs
ive
brought
some
friends
ter
meet
yeh
remember
I
told
yeh
I
might
remember
when
I
said
i
might
have
ter
go
on
a
little
trip
an
leave
them
ter
look
after
yeh
fer
a
bit
remember
that
grawpy
but
Grawp
merely
gave
another
low
roar
it
was
hard
to
say
whether
he
was
listening
to
Hagrid
or
whether
he
even
recognized
the
sounds
Hagrid
was
making
as
speech
he
had
now
seized
the
top
of
the
pine
tree
and
was
pulling
it
towards
him
evidently
for
the
simple
pleasure
of
seeing
how
far
it
would
spring
back
when
he
let
go
now
Grawpy
don
do
that
shouted
Hagrid
thas
how
you
ended
up
pullin
up
the
others
and
sure
enough
Harry
could
see
the
earth
around
the
trees
roots
beginning
to
crack
i
got
company
for
yeh
hagrid
shouted
company
see
look
down
yeh
big
buffoon
I
brought
yeh
some
friends
oh
Hagrid

moaned
Hermione
but
Hagrid
had
already
raised
the
bough
again
and
gave
grawps
knee
a
sharp
poke
the
giant
let
go
of
the
top
of
the
tree
which
swayed
alarmingly
and
deluged
Hagrid
with
a
rain
of
pine
needles
and
looked
down
this
said
Hagrid
hastening
over
to
where
Harry
and
Hermione
stood
is
Harry
Grawp
harry
Potter
he
migh
be
comin
ter
visit
yeh
if
I
have
ter
go
away
understand
the
giant
had
only
just
realized
that
Harry
and
Hermione
were
there
they
watched
in
great
trepidation
as
he
lowered
his
huge
boulder
of
a
head
so
that
he
could
peer
blearily
at
them
an
this
is
Hermione
see
her
Hagrid
hesitated
turning
to
Hermione
he
said
Would
yeh
mind
if
he
called
yeh
Hermy
Hermione
ony
its
a
difficult
name
fer
him
ter
remember
no
not
at

squeaked
Hermione
this
is
Hermy
Grawp
an
shes
gonna
be
comin
an
all
isn
tha
nice
eh
two
friends
fer
yeh
ter
grawpy
no
grawps
hand
had
shot
out
of
nowhere
towards
Hermione
Harry
seized
her
and
pulled
her
backwards
behind
the
tree
so
that
Grawps
fist
scraped
the
trunk
but
closed
on
thin
air
bad
boy
grawpy
they
heard
Hagrid
yelling
as
Hermione
clung
to
Harry
behind
the
tree
shaking
and
whimpering
very
bad
boy
yeh
don
grab
ouch
harry
poked
his
head
out
from
around
the
trunk
and
saw
Hagrid
lying
on
his
back
his
hand
over
his
nose
grawp
apparently
losing
interest
had
straightened
up
and
was
again
engaged
in
pulling
back
the
pine
as
far
as
it
would
go
righ
said
Hagrid
thickly
getting
up
with
one
hand
pinching
his
bleeding
nose
and
the
other
grasping
his
crossbow
well
there
yeh
are
yehve
met
him
an
an
now
hell
know
yeh
when
yeh
come
back
yeah
well
he
looked
up
at
Grawp
who
was
now
pulling
back
the
pine
with
an
expression
of
detached
pleasure
on
his
boulderish
face
the
roots
were
creaking
as
he
ripped
them
away
from
the
ground
well
I
reckon
thas
enough
fer
one
day
said
Hagrid
well
er
well
go
back
now
shall
we
harry
and
Hermione
nodded
hagrid
shouldered
his
crossbow
again
and
still
pinching
his
nose
led
the
way
back
into
the
trees
nobody
spoke
for
a
while
not
even
when
they
heard
the
distant
crash
that
meant
Grawp
had
pulled
over
the
pine
tree
at
last
hermiones
face
was
pale
and
set
harry
could
not
think
of
a
single
thing
to
say
what
on
earth
was
going
to
happen
when
somebody
found
out
that
Hagrid
had
hidden
Grawp
in
the
Forbidden
Forest
and
he
had
promised
that
he
Ron
and
Hermione
would
continue
Hagrids
totally
pointless
attempts
to
civilize
the
giant
how
could
Hagrid
even
with
his
immense
capacity
to
delude
himself
that
fanged
monsters
were
loveably
harmless
fool
himself
that
Grawp
would
ever
be
fit
to
mix
with
humans
hold
it
said
Hagrid
abruptly
just
as
Harry
and
Hermione
were
struggling
through
a
patch
of
thick
knotgrass
behind
him
he
pulled
an
arrow
out
of
the
quiver
over
his
shoulder
and
fitted
it
into
the
crossbow
harry
and
Hermione
raised
their
wands
now
that
they
had
stopped
walking
they
too
could
hear
movement
close
by
oh
blimey
said
Hagrid
quietly
i
thought
we
told
you
Hagrid
said
a
deep
male
voice
that
you
are
no
longer
welcome
here
a
mans
naked
torso
seemed
for
an
instant
to
be
floating
towards
them
through
the
dappled
green
half-light
then
they
saw
that
his
waist
joined
smoothly
into
a
horses
chestnut
body
this
centaur
had
a
proud
high-cheekboned
face
and
long
black
hair
like
Hagrid
he
was
armed
a
quiverful
of
arrows
and
a
longbow
were
slung
over
his
shoulders
how
are
yeh
Magorian
said
Hagrid
warily
the
trees
behind
the
centaur
rustled
and
four
or
five
more
centaurs
emerged
behind
him
harry
recognized
the
black-bodied
and
bearded
Bane
whom
he
had
met
nearly
four
years
ago
on
the
same
night
he
had
met
Firenze
bane
gave
no
sign
that
he
had
ever
seen
Harry
before
so
he
said
with
a
nasty
inflection
in
his
voice
before
turning
immediately
to
Magorian
we
agreed
I
think
what
we
would
do
if
this
human
ever
showed
his
face
in
the
Forest
again
this
human
now
am
I
said
Hagrid
testily
jus
fer
stoppin
all
of
yeh
committin
murder
you
ought
not
to
have
meddled
Hagrid
said
Magorian
our
ways
are
not
yours
nor
are
our
laws
firenze
has
betrayed
and
dishonored
us
i
dunno
how
yehwork
that
out
said
Hagrid
impatiently
hes
done
nothin
except
help
Albus
Dumbledore
firenze
has
entered
into
servitude
to
humans
said
a
grey
centaur
with
a
hard
deeply
lined
face
servitude
said
Hagrid
scathingly
hes
doin
Dumbledore
a
favor
is
all
he
is
peddling
our
knowledge
and
secrets
among
humans
said
Magorian
quietly
there
can
be
no
return
from
such
disgrace
if
yeh
say
so
said
Hagrid
shrugging
but
personally
I
think
yehre
makin
a
big
mistake
as
are
you
human
said
Bane
coming
back
into
our
Forest
when
we
warned
you
now
yeh
listen
ter
me
said
Hagrid
angrily
ill
have
less
of
the
our
Forest
if
its
all
the
same
ter
yeh
its
not
up
ter
yeh
who
comes
an
goes
in
here
no
more
is
it
up
to
you
Hagrid
said
Magorian
smoothly
i
shall
let
you
pass
today
because
you
are
accompanied
by
your
young
theyre
not
his
interrupted
Bane
contemptuously
students
Magorian
from
up
at
the
school
they
have
probably
already
profited
from
the
traitor
Firenzes
teachings
nevertheless
said
Magorian
calmly
the
slaughter
of
foals
is
a
terrible
crime
we
do
not
touch
the
innocent
today
Hagrid
you
pass
henceforth
stay
away
from
this
place
you
forfeited
the
friendship
of
the
centaurs
when
you
helped
the
traitor
Firenze
escape
us
i
won
be
kept
outta
the
Fores
by
a
bunch
o
old
mules
like
yeh
said
Hagrid
loudly
hagrid
said
Hermione
in
a
high-pitched
and
terrified
voice
as
both
Bane
and
the
grey
centaur
pawed
at
the
ground
lets
go
please
lets
go
hagrid
moved
forwards
but
his
crossbow
was
still
raised
and
his
eyes
were
still
fixed
threateningly
upon
Magorian
we
know
what
you
are
keeping
in
the
Forest
Hagrid
magorian
called
after
them
as
the
centaurs
slipped
out
of
sight
and
our
tolerance
is
waning
hagrid
turned
and
gave
every
appearance
of
wanting
to
walk
straight
back
to
Magorian
yehll
tolerate
im
as
long
as
hes
here
its
as
much
his
Forest
as
yours
he
yelled
as
Harry
and
Hermione
both
pushed
with
all
their
might
against
Hagrids
moleskin
waistcoat
in
an
effort
to
keep
him
moving
forwards
still
scowling
he
looked
down
his
expression
changed
to
mild
surprise
at
the
sight
of
them
both
pushing
him
he
seemed
not
to
have
felt
it
calm
down
you
two
he
said
turning
to
walk
on
while
they
panted
along
behind
him
ruddy
old
mules
though
eh
hagrid
said
Hermione
breathlessly
skirting
the
patch
of
nettles
they
had
passed
on
their
way
there
if
the
centaurs
dont
want
humans
in
the
Forest
it
doesnt
really
look
as
though
Harry
and
i
will
be
able
ah
you
heard
what
they
said
said
Hagrid
dismissively
they
wouldnt
hurt
foals
I
mean
kids
anyway
we
can
let
ourselves
be
pushed
aroun
by
that
lot
nice
try
Harry
murmured
to
Hermione
who
looked
crestfallen
at
last
they
rejoined
the
path
and
after
another
ten
minutes
the
trees
began
to
thin
they
were
able
to
see
patches
of
clear
blue
sky
again
and
in
the
distance
the
definite
sounds
of
cheering
and
shouting
was
that
another
goal
asked
Hagrid
pausing
in
the
shelter
of
the
trees
as
the
Quidditch
stadium
came
into
view
or
dyeh
reckon
the
match
is
over
i
dont
know
said
Hermione
miserably
harry
saw
that
she
looked
much
the
worse
for
wear
her
hair
was
full
of
twigs
and
leaves
her
robes
were
ripped
in
several
places
and
there
were
numerous
scratches
on
her
face
and
arms
he
knew
he
must
look
little
better
i
reckon
its
over
yeh
know
said
Hagrid
still
squinting
towards
the
stadium
look
theres
people
comin
out
already
if
yeh
two
hurry
yehll
be
able
ter
blend
in
with
the
crowd
an
no
onell
know
yeh
werent
there
good
idea
said
Harry
well
see
you
later
then
Hagrid
i
dont
believe
him
said
Hermione
in
a
very
unsteady
voice
the
moment
they
were
out
of
earshot
of
Hagrid
i
dont
believe
him
i
really
dont
believe
him
calm
down
said
Harry
calm
down
she
said
feverishly
a
giant
a
giant
in
the
Forest
and
were
supposed
to
give
him
English
lessons
always
assuming
of
course
we
can
get
past
the
herd
of
murderous
centaurs
on
the
way
in
and
out
i
dont
believe
him
we
havent
got
to
do
anything
yet
harry
tried
to
reassure
her
in
a
quiet
voice
as
they
joined
a
stream
of
jabbering
Hufflepuffs
heading
back
towards
the
castle
hes
not
asking
us
to
do
anything
unless
he
gets
chucked
out
and
that
might
not
even
happen
oh
come
off
it
Harry
said
Hermione
angrily
stopping
dead
in
her
tracks
so
that
the
people
behind
had
to
swerve
to
avoid
her
of
course
hes
going
to
be
chucked
out
and
to
be
perfectly
honest
after
what
weve
just
seen
who
can
blame
Umbridge
there
was
a
pause
in
which
Harry
glared
at
her
and
her
eyes
filled
slowly
with
tears
you
didnt
mean
that
said
Harry
quietly
no
well
all
right
i
didnt
she
said
wiping
her
eyes
angrily
but
why
does
he
have
to
make
life
so
difficult
for
himself
for
us
i
dunno
weasley
is
our
King
Weasley
is
our
King
He
didnt
let
the
Quaffle
in
Weasley
is
our
King
and
I
wish
theyd
stop
singing
that
stupid
song
said
Hermione
miserably
havent
they
gloated
enough
a
great
tide
of
students
was
moving
up
the
sloping
lawns
from
the
pitch
oh
lets
get
in
before
we
have
to
meet
the
Slytherins
said
Hermione
weasley
can
save
anything
He
never
leaves
a
single
ring
Thats
why
Gryffindors
all
sing
weasley
is
our
King
hermione
said
Harry
slowly
the
song
was
growing
louder
but
it
was
issuing
not
from
a
crowd
of
green-and-silver-clad
slytherins
but
from
a
mass
of
red
and
gold
moving
slowly
towards
the
castle
bearing
a
solitary
figure
upon
its
many
shoulders
weasley
is
our
King
Weasley
is
our
King
He
didnt
let
the
Quaffle
in
Weasley
is
our
King
no
said
Hermione
in
a
hushed
voice
yes
said
Harry
loudly
harry
hermione
yelled
Ron
waving
the
silver
Quidditch
cup
in
the
air
and
looking
quite
beside
himself
we
did
it
we
won
they
beamed
up
at
him
as
he
passed
there
was
a
scrum
at
the
door
of
the
castle
and
Rons
head
got
rather
badly
bumped
on
the
lintel
but
nobody
seemed
to
want
to
put
him
down
still
singing
the
crowd
squeezed
itself
into
the
Entrance
Hall
and
out
of
sight
harry
and
Hermione
watched
them
go
beaming
until
the
last
echoing
strains
of
Weasley
is
our
King
died
away
then
they
turned
to
each
other
their
smiles
fading
well
save
our
news
till
tomorrow
shall
we
said
Harry
yes
all
right
said
Hermione
wearily
im
not
in
any
hurry
they
climbed
the
steps
together
at
the
front
doors
both
instinctively
looked
back
at
the
forbidden
Forest
harry
was
not
sure
whether
or
not
it
was
his
imagination
but
he
rather
thought
he
saw
a
small
cloud
of
birds
erupting
into
the
air
over
the
tree
tops
in
the
distance
almost
as
though
the
tree
in
which
they
had
been
nesting
had
just
been
pulled
up
by
the
roots
chapter
thirty-one
w.l.s
rons
euphoria
at
helping
Gryffindor
scrape
the
Quidditch
cup
was
such
that
he
couldnt
settle
to
anything
next
day
all
he
wanted
to
do
was
talk
over
the
match
so
Harry
and
Hermione
found
it
very
difficult
to
find
an
opening
in
which
to
mention
Grawp
not
that
either
of
them
tried
very
hard
neither
was
keen
to
be
the
one
to
bring
Ron
back
to
reality
in
quite
such
a
brutal
fashion
as
it
was
another
fine
warm
day
they
persuaded
him
to
join
them
in
revising
under
the
beech
tree
at
the
edge
of
the
lake
where
they
had
less
chance
of
being
overheard
than
in
the
common
room
ron
was
not
particularly
keen
on
this
idea
at
first
he
was
thoroughly
enjoying
being
patted
on
the
back
by
every
Gryffindor
who
walked
past
his
chair
not
to
mention
the
occasional
outbursts
of
Weasley
is
our
King
but
after
a
while
he
agreed
that
some
fresh
air
might
do
him
good
they
spread
their
books
out
in
the
shade
of
the
beech
tree
and
sat
down
while
Ron
talked
them
through
his
first
save
of
the
match
for
what
felt
like
the
dozenth
time
well
I
mean
Id
already
let
in
that
one
of
Daviess
so
I
wasnt
feeling
all
that
confident
but
I
dunno
when
Bradley
came
towards
me
just
out
of
nowhere
I
thought
you
can
do
this
and
I
had
about
a
second
to
decide
which
way
to
fly
you
know
because
he
looked
like
he
was
aiming
for
the
right
goalhoop
my
right
obviously
his
left
but
I
had
a
funny
feeling
that
he
was
feinting
and
so
I
took
the
chance
and
flew
left
his
right
I
mean
and
well
you
saw
what
happened
he
concluded
modestly
sweeping
his
hair
back
quite
unnecessarily
so
that
it
looked
interestingly
windswept
and
glancing
around
to
see
whether
the
people
nearest
to
them
a
bunch
of
gossiping
third-year
Hufflepuffs
had
heard
him
and
then
when
Chambers
came
at
me
about
five
minutes
later
What
ron
asked
having
stopped
mid-sentence
at
the
look
on
harrys
face
why
are
you
grinning
im
not
said
Harry
quickly
and
looked
down
at
his
Transfiguration
notes
attempting
to
straighten
his
face
the
truth
was
that
Ron
had
just
reminded
Harry
forcibly
of
another
gryffindor
Quidditch
player
who
had
once
sat
rumpling
his
hair
under
this
very
tree
im
just
glad
we
won
thats
all
yeah
said
Ron
slowly
savoring
the
words
we
won
did
you
see
the
look
on
Changs
face
when
Ginny
got
the
Snitch
right
out
from
under
her
nose
i
suppose
she
cried
did
she
said
Harry
bitterly
well
yeah
more
out
of
temper
than
anything
though
ron
frowned
slightly
but
you
saw
her
chuck
her
broom
away
when
she
got
back
to
the
ground
didnt
you
er
said
Harry
well
actually
no
Ron
said
Hermione
with
a
heavy
sigh
putting
down
her
book
and
looking
at
him
apologetically
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
only
bit
of
the
match
Harry
and
I
saw
was
daviess
first
goal
rons
carefully
ruffled
hair
seemed
to
wilt
with
disappointment
you
didnt
watch
he
said
faintly
looking
from
one
to
the
other
you
didnt
see
me
make
any
of
those
saves
well
no
said
Hermione
stretching
out
a
placatory
hand
towards
him
but
Ron
we
didnt
want
to
leave
we
had
to
yeah
said
Ron
whose
face
was
growing
rather
red
how
come
it
was
Hagrid
said
Harry
he
decided
to
tell
us
why
hes
been
covered
in
injuries
ever
since
he
got
back
from
the
giants
he
wanted
us
to
go
into
the
Forest
with
him
we
had
no
choice
you
know
how
he
gets
anyway
the
story
was
told
in
five
minutes
by
the
end
of
which
Rons
indignation
had
been
replaced
by
a
look
of
total
incredulity
he
brought
one
back
and
hid
it
in
the
Forest
yep
said
Harry
grimly
no
said
Ron
as
though
by
saying
this
he
could
make
it
untrue
no
he
cant
have
well
he
has
said
Hermione
firmly
grawps
about
sixteen
feet
tall
enjoys
ripping
up
twenty-foot
pine
trees
and
knows
me
she
snorted
as
Hermy
ron
gave
a
nervous
laugh
and
Hagrid
wants
us
to
teach
him
English
yeah
said
Harry
hes
lost
his
mind
said
Ron
in
an
almost
awed
voice
yes
said
Hermione
irritably
turning
a
page
of
Intermediate
Transfiguration
and
glaring
at
a
series
of
diagrams
showing
an
owl
turning
into
a
pair
of
opera
glasses
yes
Im
starting
to
think
he
has
but
unfortunately
he
made
Harry
and
me
promise
well
youre
just
going
to
have
to
break
your
promise
thats
all
said
Ron
firmly
i
mean
come
on
weve
got
exams
and
were
about
that
far
he
held
up
his
hand
to
show
thumb
and
forefinger
almost
touching
from
being
chucked
out
as
it
is
and
anyway
remember
Norbert
remember
Aragog
have
we
ever
come
off
better
for
mixing
with
any
of
Hagrids
monster
mates
i
know
its
just
that
we
promised
said
Hermione
in
a
small
voice
ron
smoothed
his
hair
flat
again
looking
preoccupied
well
he
sighed
Hagrid
hasnt
been
sacked
yet
has
he
hes
hung
on
this
long
maybe
hell
hang
on
till
the
end
of
term
and
we
wont
have
to
go
near
Grawp
at
all
the
castle
grounds
were
gleaming
in
the
sunlight
as
though
freshly
painted
the
cloudless
sky
smiled
at
itself
in
the
smoothly
sparkling
lake
the
satin
green
lawns
rippled
occasionally
in
a
gentle
breeze
june
had
arrived
but
to
the
fifth-years
this
meant
only
one
thing
their
OWLs
were
upon
them
at
last
their
teachers
were
no
longer
setting
them
homework
lessons
were
devoted
to
revising
those
topics
the
teachers
thought
most
likely
to
come
up
in
the
exams
the
purposeful
feverish
atmosphere
drove
nearly
everything
but
the
OWLs
from
Harrys
mind
though
he
did
wonder
occasionally
during
Potions
lessons
whether
Lupin
had
ever
told
Snape
that
he
must
continue
giving
Harry
Occlumency
tuition
if
he
had
then
Snape
had
ignored
Lupin
as
thoroughly
as
he
was
now
ignoring
Harry
this
suited
Harry
very
well
he
was
quite
busy
and
tense
enough
without
extra
classes
with
Snape
and
to
his
relief
Hermione
was
much
too
preoccupied
these
days
to
badger
him
about
Occlumency
she
was
spending
a
lot
of
time
muttering
to
herself
and
had
not
laid
out
any
elf
clothes
for
days
she
was
not
the
only
person
acting
oddly
as
the
OWLs
drew
steadily
nearer
ernie
Macmillan
had
developed
an
irritating
habit
of
interrogating
people
about
their
study
habits
how
many
hours
dyou
think
youre
doing
a
day
he
demanded
of
Harry
and
Ron
as
they
queued
outside
Herbology
a
manic
gleam
in
his
eyes
i
dunno
said
Ron
a
few
more
or
less
than
eight
less
I
spose
said
Ron
looking
slightly
alarmed
im
doing
eight
said
Ernie
puffing
out
his
chest
eight
or
nine
im
getting
an
hour
in
before
breakfast
every
day
eights
my
average
i
can
do
ten
on
a
good
weekend
day
i
did
nine
and
a
half
on
Monday
not
so
good
on
Tuesday
only
seven
and
a
quarter
then
on
Wednesday
harry
was
deeply
thankful
that
Professor
Sprout
ushered
them
into
greenhouse
three
at
that
point
forcing
Ernie
to
abandon
his
recital
meanwhile
Draco
Malfoy
had
found
a
different
way
to
induce
panic
of
course
its
not
what
you
know
he
was
heard
to
tell
Crabbe
and
Goyle
loudly
outside
potions
a
few
days
before
the
exams
were
to
start
its
who
you
know
now
Fathers
been
friendly
with
the
head
of
the
Wizarding
Examinations
Authority
for
years
old
Griselda
marchbanks
weve
had
her
round
for
dinner
and
everything
do
you
think
thats
true
hermione
whispered
in
alarm
to
Harry
and
Ron
nothing
we
can
do
about
it
if
it
is
said
Ron
gloomily
i
dont
think
its
true
said
Neville
quietly
from
behind
them
because
Griselda
Marchbanks
is
a
friend
of
my
grans
and
shes
never
mentioned
the
Malfoys
whats
she
like
Neville
asked
Hermione
at
once
is
she
strict
bit
like
Gran
really
said
Neville
in
a
subdued
voice
knowing
her
wont
hurt
your
chances
though
will
it
ron
told
him
encouragingly
oh
I
dont
think
it
will
make
any
difference
said
Neville
still
more
miserably
grans
always
telling
Professor
Marchbanks
Im
not
as
good
as
my
dad
well
you
saw
what
shes
like
at
St
mungos
Neville
looked
fixedly
at
the
floor
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
glanced
at
each
other
but
didnt
know
what
to
say
it
was
the
first
time
Neville
had
acknowledged
that
they
had
met
at
the
wizarding
hospital
meanwhile
a
flourishing
black-market
trade
in
aids
to
concentration
mental
agility
and
wakefulness
had
sprung
up
among
the
fifth
and
seventh-years
harry
and
Ron
were
much
tempted
by
the
bottle
of
Baruffios
Brain
Elixir
offered
to
them
by
Ravenclaw
sixth-year
Eddie
carmichael
who
swore
it
was
solely
responsible
for
the
nine
Outstanding
OWLs
he
had
gained
the
previous
summer
and
was
offering
a
whole
pint
for
a
mere
twelve
Galleons
ron
assured
harry
he
would
reimburse
him
for
his
half
the
moment
he
left
Hogwarts
and
got
a
job
but
before
they
could
close
the
deal
Hermione
had
confiscated
the
bottle
from
Carmichael
and
poured
the
contents
down
a
toilet
hermione
we
wanted
to
buy
that
shouted
Ron
dont
be
stupid
she
snarled
you
might
as
well
take
Harold
Dingles
powdered
dragon
claw
and
have
done
with
it
dingles
got
powdered
dragon
claw
said
Ron
eagerly
not
any
more
said
Hermione
i
confiscated
that
too
none
of
these
things
actually
work
you
know
dragon
claw
does
work
said
Ron
its
supposed
to
be
incredible
really
gives
your
brain
a
boost
you
come
over
all
cunning
for
a
few
hours
Hermione
let
me
have
a
pinch
go
on
it
cant
hurt
this
stuff
can
said
Hermione
grimly
ive
had
a
look
at
it
and
its
actually
dried
Doxy
droppings
this
information
took
the
edge
off
Harry
and
Rons
desire
for
brain
stimulants
they
received
their
examination
timetables
and
details
of
the
procedure
for
OWLs
during
their
next
Transfiguration
lesson
as
you
can
see
Professor
McGonagall
told
the
class
as
they
copied
down
the
dates
and
times
of
their
exams
from
the
blackboard
your
OWLs
are
spread
over
two
successive
weeks
you
will
sit
the
theory
exams
in
the
mornings
and
the
practice
in
the
afternoons
your
practical
astronomy
examination
will
of
course
take
place
at
night
now
I
must
warn
you
that
the
most
stringent
anti-cheating
charms
have
been
applied
to
your
examination
papers
auto-Answer
Quills
are
banned
from
the
examination
hall
as
are
remembralls
Detachable
Cribbing
Cuffs
and
Self-Correcting
Ink
every
year
I
am
afraid
to
say
seems
to
harbor
at
least
one
student
who
thinks
that
he
or
she
can
get
around
the
Wizarding
examinations
Authoritys
rules
i
can
only
hope
that
it
is
nobody
in
Gryffindor
our
new
headmistress
Professor
McGonagall
pronounced
the
word
with
the
same
look
on
her
face
that
Aunt
Petunia
had
whenever
she
was
contemplating
a
particularly
stubborn
bit
of
dirt
has
asked
the
Heads
of
House
to
tell
their
students
that
cheating
will
be
punished
most
severely
because
of
course
your
examination
results
will
reflect
upon
the
Headmistresss
new
regime
at
the
school
professor
McGonagall
gave
a
tiny
sigh
Harry
saw
the
nostrils
of
her
sharp
nose
flare
however
that
is
no
reason
not
to
do
your
very
best
you
have
your
own
futures
to
think
about
please
Professor
said
Hermione
her
hand
in
the
air
when
will
we
find
out
our
results
an
owl
will
be
sent
to
you
some
time
in
July
said
Professor
McGonagall
excellent
said
Dean
Thomas
in
an
audible
whisper
so
we
dont
have
to
worry
about
it
till
the
holidays
harry
imagined
sitting
in
his
bedroom
in
Privet
Drive
in
six
weeks
time
waiting
for
his
owl
results
well
he
thought
dully
at
least
he
would
be
sure
of
one
bit
of
post
next
summer
their
first
examination
Theory
of
Charms
was
scheduled
for
Monday
morning
harry
agreed
to
test
Hermione
after
lunch
on
Sunday
but
regretted
it
almost
at
once
she
was
very
agitated
and
kept
snatching
the
book
back
from
him
to
check
that
she
had
got
the
answer
completely
right
finally
hitting
him
hard
on
the
nose
with
the
sharp
edge
of
Achievements
in
Charming
why
dont
you
just
do
it
yourself
he
said
firmly
handing
the
book
back
to
her
his
eyes
watering
meanwhile
Ron
was
reading
two
years
worth
of
Charms
notes
with
his
fingers
in
his
ears
his
lips
moving
soundlessly
Seamus
Finnigan
was
lying
flat
on
his
back
on
the
floor
reciting
the
definition
of
a
Substantive
Charm
while
Dean
checked
it
against
The
Standard
Book
of
Spells
grade
and
Parvati
and
Lavender
who
were
practicing
basic
Locomotion
Charms
were
making
their
pencil-cases
race
each
other
around
the
edge
of
the
table
dinner
was
a
subdued
affair
that
night
harry
and
Ron
did
not
talk
much
but
ate
with
gusto
having
studied
hard
all
day
hermione
on
the
other
hand
kept
putting
down
her
knife
and
fork
and
diving
under
the
table
for
her
bag
from
which
she
would
seize
a
book
to
check
some
fact
or
figure
ron
was
just
telling
her
that
she
ought
to
eat
a
decent
meal
or
she
would
not
sleep
that
night
when
her
fork
slid
from
her
limp
fingers
and
landed
with
a
loud
tinkle
on
her
plate
oh
my
goodness
she
said
faintly
staring
into
the
Entrance
Hall
is
that
them
is
that
the
examiners
harry
and
Ron
whipped
around
on
their
bench
through
the
doors
to
the
Great
Hall
they
could
see
Umbridge
standing
with
a
small
group
of
ancient-looking
witches
and
wizards
umbridge
harry
was
pleased
to
see
looked
rather
nervous
shall
we
go
and
have
a
closer
look
said
Ron
harry
and
Hermione
nodded
and
they
hastened
towards
the
double
doors
into
the
Entrance
Hall
slowing
down
as
they
stepped
over
the
threshold
to
walk
sedately
past
the
examiners
harry
thought
Professor
Marchbanks
must
be
the
tiny
stooped
witch
with
a
face
so
lined
it
looked
as
though
it
had
been
draped
in
cobwebs
Umbridge
was
speaking
to
her
deferentially
professor
marchbanks
seemed
to
be
a
little
deaf
she
was
answering
Professor
Umbridge
very
loudly
considering
they
were
only
a
foot
apart
journey
was
fine
journey
was
fine
weve
made
it
plenty
of
times
before
she
said
impatiently
now
I
havent
heard
from
Dumbledore
lately
she
added
peering
around
the
Hall
as
though
hopeful
he
might
suddenly
emerge
from
a
broom
cupboard
no
idea
where
he
is
I
suppose
none
at
all
said
Umbridge
shooting
a
malevolent
look
at
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
who
were
now
dawdling
around
the
foot
of
the
stairs
as
Ron
pretended
to
do
up
his
shoelace
but
I
daresay
the
Ministry
of
Magic
will
track
him
down
soon
enough
i
doubt
it
shouted
tiny
Professor
Marchbanks
not
if
Dumbledore
doesnt
want
to
be
found
should
know
examined
him
personally
in
Transfiguration
and
Charms
when
he
did
NEWTs
did
things
with
a
wand
Id
never
seen
before
yes
well
said
Professor
Umbridge
as
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
dragged
their
feet
up
the
marble
staircase
as
slowly
as
they
dared
let
me
show
you
to
the
staff
room
i
daresay
youd
like
a
cup
of
tea
after
your
journey
it
was
an
uncomfortable
sort
of
an
evening
everyone
was
trying
to
do
some
last-minute
revising
but
nobody
seemed
to
be
getting
very
far
harry
went
to
bed
early
but
then
lay
awake
for
what
felt
like
hours
he
remembered
his
careers
consultation
and
McGonagalls
furious
declaration
that
she
would
help
him
become
an
Auror
if
it
was
the
last
thing
she
did
he
wished
he
had
expressed
a
more
achievable
ambition
now
that
exam
time
was
here
he
knew
he
was
not
the
only
one
lying
awake
but
none
of
the
others
in
the
dormitory
spoke
and
finally
one
by
one
they
fell
asleep
none
of
the
fifth-years
talked
very
much
at
breakfast
next
day
either
Parvati
was
practicing
incantations
under
her
breath
while
the
salt
cellar
in
front
of
her
twitched
Hermione
was
rereading
Achievements
in
Charming
so
fast
that
her
eyes
appeared
blurred
and
Neville
kept
dropping
his
knife
and
fork
and
knocking
over
the
marmalade
once
breakfast
was
over
the
fifth
and
seventh-years
milled
around
in
the
Entrance
Hall
while
the
other
students
went
off
to
lessons
then
at
half
past
nine
they
were
called
forwards
class
by
class
to
re-enter
the
Great
Hall
which
had
been
rearranged
exactly
as
Harry
had
seen
it
in
the
pensieve
when
his
father
Sirius
and
Snape
had
been
taking
their
OWLs
the
four
house
tables
had
been
removed
and
replaced
instead
with
many
tables
for
one
all
facing
the
staff-table
end
of
the
Hall
where
Professor
McGonagall
stood
facing
them
when
they
were
all
seated
and
quiet
she
said
You
may
begin
and
turned
over
an
enormous
hour-glass
on
the
desk
beside
her
on
which
there
were
also
spare
quills
ink
bottles
and
rolls
of
parchment
harry
turned
over
his
paper
his
heart
thumping
hard
three
rows
to
his
right
and
four
seats
ahead
Hermione
was
already
scribbling
and
lowered
his
eyes
to
the
first
question
a
Give
the
incantation
and
b
describe
the
wand
movement
required
to
make
objects
fly
harry
had
a
fleeting
memory
of
a
club
soaring
high
into
the
air
and
landing
loudly
on
the
thick
skull
of
a
troll
smiling
slightly
he
bent
over
the
paper
and
began
to
write
well
it
wasnt
too
bad
was
it
asked
Hermione
anxiously
in
the
Entrance
Hall
two
hours
later
still
clutching
the
exam
paper
im
not
sure
I
did
myself
justice
on
Cheering
Charms
I
just
ran
out
of
time
did
you
put
in
the
counter-charm
for
hiccoughs
i
wasnt
sure
whether
I
ought
to
it
felt
like
too
much
and
on
question
twenty-three
hermione
said
Ron
sternly
weve
been
through
this
before
were
not
going
through
every
exam
afterwards
its
bad
enough
doing
them
once
the
fifth-years
ate
lunch
with
the
rest
of
the
school
the
four
house
tables
had
reappeared
for
the
lunch
hour
then
they
trooped
off
into
the
small
chamber
beside
the
Great
Hall
where
they
were
to
wait
until
called
for
their
practical
examination
as
small
groups
of
students
were
called
forwards
in
alphabetical
order
those
left
behind
muttered
incantations
and
practiced
wand
movements
occasionally
poking
each
other
in
the
back
or
eye
by
mistake
hermiones
name
was
called
trembling
she
left
the
chamber
with
Anthony
Goldstein
Gregory
goyle
and
Daphne
Greengrass
students
who
had
already
been
tested
did
not
return
afterwards
so
Harry
and
Ron
had
no
idea
how
Hermione
had
done
shell
be
fine
remember
she
got
a
hundred
and
twelve
percent
on
one
of
our
Charms
tests
said
Ron
ten
minutes
later
Professor
Flitwick
called
Parkinson
Pansy
Patil
Padma
Patil
Parvati
potter
Harry
good
luck
said
Ron
quietly
harry
walked
into
the
Great
Hall
clutching
his
wand
so
tightly
his
hand
shook
professor
Tofty
is
free
Potter
squeaked
Professor
Flitwick
who
was
standing
just
inside
the
door
he
pointed
Harry
towards
what
looked
like
the
very
oldest
and
baldest
examiner
who
was
sitting
behind
a
small
table
in
a
far
corner
a
short
distance
from
Professor
Marchbanks
who
was
halfway
through
testing
Draco
Malfoy
potter
is
it
said
Professor
Tofty
consulting
his
notes
and
peering
over
his
pince-nez
at
Harry
as
he
approached
the
famous
Potter
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
Harry
distinctly
saw
Malfoy
throw
a
scathing
look
over
at
him
the
wine-glass
Malfoy
had
been
levitating
fell
to
the
floor
and
smashed
harry
could
not
suppress
a
grin
Professor
Tofty
smiled
back
at
him
encouragingly
thats
it
he
said
in
his
quavery
old
voice
no
need
to
be
nervous
now
if
I
could
ask
you
to
take
this
egg
cup
and
make
it
do
some
cartwheels
for
me
on
the
whole
Harry
thought
it
went
rather
well
his
Levitation
Charm
was
certainly
much
better
than
Malfoys
had
been
though
he
wished
he
had
not
mixed
up
the
incantations
for
Color
change
and
Growth
Charms
so
that
the
rat
he
was
supposed
to
be
turning
orange
swelled
shockingly
and
was
the
size
of
a
badger
before
Harry
could
rectify
his
mistake
he
was
glad
hermione
had
not
been
in
the
Hall
at
the
time
and
neglected
to
mention
it
to
her
afterwards
he
could
tell
Ron
though
Ron
had
caused
a
dinner
plate
to
mutate
into
a
large
mushroom
and
had
no
idea
how
it
had
happened
there
was
no
time
to
relax
that
night
they
went
straight
to
the
common
room
after
dinner
and
submerged
themselves
in
revision
for
Transfiguration
next
day
Harry
went
to
bed
with
his
head
buzzing
with
complex
spell
models
and
theories
he
forgot
the
definition
of
a
Switching
Spell
during
his
written
paper
next
morning
but
thought
his
practical
could
have
been
a
lot
worse
at
least
he
managed
to
Vanish
the
whole
of
his
iguana
whereas
poor
Hannah
Abbott
lost
her
head
completely
at
the
next
table
and
somehow
managed
to
multiply
her
ferret
into
a
flock
of
flamingos
causing
the
examination
to
be
halted
for
ten
minutes
while
the
birds
were
captured
and
carried
out
of
the
Hall
they
had
their
Herbology
exam
on
Wednesday
other
than
a
small
bite
from
a
Fanged
Geranium
harry
felt
he
had
done
reasonably
well
and
then
on
Thursday
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
here
for
the
first
time
Harry
felt
sure
he
had
passed
he
had
no
problem
with
any
of
the
written
questions
and
took
particular
pleasure
during
the
practical
examination
in
performing
all
the
counter-jinxes
and
defensive
spells
right
in
front
of
Umbridge
who
was
watching
coolly
from
near
the
doors
into
the
Entrance
Hall
oh
bravo
cried
Professor
Tofty
who
was
examining
Harry
again
when
Harry
demonstrated
a
perfect
Boggart
banishing
spell
very
good
indeed
well
I
think
thats
all
Potter
unless
he
leaned
forwards
a
little
i
heard
from
my
dear
friend
Tiberius
Ogden
that
you
can
produce
a
Patronus
for
a
bonus
point
harry
raised
his
wand
looked
directly
at
Umbridge
and
imagined
her
being
sacked
expecto
patronum
his
silver
stag
erupted
from
the
end
of
his
wand
and
cantered
the
length
of
the
Hall
all
of
the
examiners
looked
around
to
watch
its
progress
and
when
it
dissolved
into
silver
mist
Professor
tofty
clapped
his
veined
and
knotted
hands
enthusiastically
excellent
he
said
very
well
Potter
you
may
go
as
Harry
passed
Umbridge
beside
the
door
their
eyes
met
there
was
a
nasty
smile
playing
around
her
wide
slack
mouth
but
he
did
not
care
unless
he
was
very
much
mistaken
and
he
was
not
planning
on
telling
anybody
in
case
he
was
he
had
just
achieved
an
Outstanding
owl
on
Friday
Harry
and
Ron
had
a
day
off
while
Hermione
sat
her
Ancient
Runes
exam
and
as
they
had
the
whole
weekend
in
front
of
them
they
permitted
themselves
a
break
from
revision
they
stretched
and
yawned
beside
the
open
window
through
which
warm
summer
air
was
wafting
as
they
played
wizard
chess
harry
could
see
Hagrid
in
the
distance
teaching
a
class
on
the
edge
of
the
Forest
he
was
trying
to
guess
what
creatures
they
were
examining
he
thought
it
must
be
unicorns
because
the
boys
seemed
to
be
standing
back
a
little
when
the
portrait
hole
opened
and
Hermione
clambered
in
looking
thoroughly
bad-tempered
how
were
the
Runes
said
Ron
yawning
and
stretching
i
mistranslated
ehwaz
said
Hermione
furiously
it
means
partnership
not
Defense
I
mixed
it
up
with
eihwaz
ah
well
said
Ron
lazily
thats
only
one
mistake
isnt
it
youll
still
get
oh
shut
up
said
Hermione
angrily
it
could
be
the
one
mistake
that
makes
the
difference
between
a
pass
and
a
fail
and
whats
more
someones
put
another
Niffler
in
Umbridges
office
i
dont
know
how
they
got
it
through
that
new
door
but
I
just
walked
past
there
and
Umbridge
is
shrieking
her
head
off
by
the
sound
of
it
it
tried
to
take
a
chunk
out
of
her
leg
good
said
Harry
and
Ron
together
it
is
not
good
said
Hermione
hotly
she
thinks
its
Hagrid
doing
it
remember
and
we
do
not
want
Hagrid
chucked
out
hes
teaching
at
the
moment
she
cant
blame
him
said
Harry
gesturing
out
of
the
window
oh
youre
so
naive
sometimes
Harry
you
really
think
Umbridge
will
wait
for
proof
said
hermione
who
seemed
determined
to
be
in
a
towering
temper
and
she
swept
off
towards
the
girls
dormitories
banging
the
door
behind
her
such
a
lovely
sweet-tempered
girl
said
Ron
very
quietly
prodding
his
queen
forward
to
beat
up
one
of
Harrys
knights
hermiones
bad
mood
persisted
for
most
of
the
weekend
though
Harry
and
Ron
found
it
quite
easy
to
ignore
as
they
spent
most
of
Saturday
and
Sunday
revising
for
Potions
on
Monday
the
exam
which
Harry
had
been
looking
forward
to
least
and
which
he
was
sure
would
be
the
downfall
of
his
ambitions
to
become
an
Auror
sure
enough
he
found
the
written
paper
difficult
though
he
thought
he
might
have
got
full
marks
on
the
question
about
Polyjuice
Potion
he
could
describe
its
effects
accurately
having
taken
it
illegally
in
his
second
year
the
afternoon
practical
was
not
as
dreadful
as
he
had
expected
it
to
be
with
Snape
absent
from
the
proceedings
he
found
that
he
was
much
more
relaxed
than
he
usually
was
while
making
potions
neville
who
was
sitting
very
near
Harry
also
looked
happier
than
Harry
had
ever
seen
him
during
a
Potions
class
when
Professor
Marchbanks
said
Step
away
from
your
cauldrons
please
the
examination
is
over
Harry
corked
his
sample
flask
feeling
that
he
might
not
have
achieved
a
good
grade
but
he
had
with
luck
avoided
a
fail
only
four
exams
left
said
Parvati
Patil
wearily
as
they
headed
back
to
Gryffindor
common
room
only
said
Hermione
snappishly
ive
got
Arithmancy
and
its
probably
the
toughest
subject
there
is
nobody
was
foolish
enough
to
snap
back
so
she
was
unable
to
vent
her
spleen
on
any
of
them
and
was
reduced
to
telling
off
some
first-years
for
giggling
too
loudly
in
the
common
room
harry
was
determined
to
perform
well
in
Tuesdays
Care
of
Magical
Creatures
exam
so
as
not
to
let
Hagrid
down
the
practical
examination
took
place
in
the
afternoon
on
the
lawn
on
the
edge
of
the
Forbidden
Forest
where
students
were
required
to
correctly
identify
the
Knarl
hidden
among
a
dozen
hedgehogs
the
trick
was
to
offer
them
all
milk
in
turn
Knarls
highly
suspicious
creatures
whose
quills
had
many
magical
properties
generally
went
berserk
at
what
they
saw
as
an
attempt
to
poison
them
then
demonstrate
correct
handling
of
a
Bowtruckle
feed
and
clean
out
a
Fire
Crab
without
sustaining
serious
burns
and
choose
from
a
wide
selection
of
food
the
diet
they
would
give
a
sick
unicorn
harry
could
see
Hagrid
watching
anxiously
out
of
his
cabin
window
when
Harrys
examiner
a
plump
little
witch
this
time
smiled
at
him
and
told
him
he
could
leave
Harry
gave
Hagrid
a
fleeting
thumbs-up
before
heading
back
to
the
castle
the
Astronomy
theory
paper
on
Wednesday
morning
went
well
enough
harry
was
not
convinced
he
had
got
the
names
of
all
Jupiters
moons
right
but
was
at
least
confident
that
none
of
them
was
inhabited
by
mice
they
had
to
wait
until
evening
for
their
practical
Astronomy
the
afternoon
was
devoted
instead
to
Divination
even
by
Harrys
low
standards
in
Divination
the
exam
went
very
badly
he
might
as
well
have
tried
to
see
moving
pictures
on
the
desktop
as
in
the
stubbornly
blank
crystal
ball
he
lost
his
head
completely
during
tea-leaf
reading
saying
it
looked
to
him
as
though
Professor
Marchbanks
would
shortly
be
meeting
a
round
dark
soggy
stranger
and
rounded
off
the
whole
fiasco
by
mixing
up
the
life
and
head
lines
on
her
palm
and
informing
her
that
she
ought
to
have
died
the
previous
Tuesday
well
we
were
always
going
to
fail
that
one
said
Ron
gloomily
as
they
ascended
the
marble
staircase
he
had
just
made
Harry
feel
rather
better
by
telling
him
how
he
had
told
the
examiner
in
detail
about
the
ugly
man
with
a
wart
on
his
nose
in
his
crystal
ball
only
to
look
up
and
realize
he
had
been
describing
his
examiners
reflection
we
shouldnt
have
taken
the
stupid
subject
in
the
first
place
said
Harry
still
at
least
we
can
give
it
up
now
yeah
said
Harry
no
more
pretending
we
care
what
happens
when
Jupiter
and
Uranus
get
too
friendly
and
from
now
on
I
dont
care
if
my
tea-leaves
spell
die
Ron
die
Im
just
chucking
them
in
the
bin
where
they
belong
harry
laughed
just
as
Hermione
came
running
up
behind
them
he
stopped
laughing
at
once
in
case
it
annoyed
her
well
I
think
Ive
done
all
right
in
Arithmancy
she
said
and
Harry
and
Ron
both
sighed
with
relief
just
time
for
a
quick
look
over
our
star-charts
before
dinner
then
when
they
reached
the
top
of
the
Astronomy
Tower
at
eleven
oclock
they
found
a
perfect
night
for
stargazing
cloudless
and
still
the
grounds
were
bathed
in
silvery
moonlight
and
there
was
a
slight
chill
in
the
air
each
of
them
set
up
his
or
her
telescope
and
when
Professor
Marchbanks
gave
the
word
proceeded
to
fill
in
the
blank
star-chart
they
had
been
given
professors
Marchbanks
and
Tofty
strolled
among
them
watching
as
they
entered
the
precise
positions
of
the
stars
and
planets
they
were
observing
all
was
quiet
except
for
the
rustle
of
parchment
the
occasional
creak
of
a
telescope
as
it
was
adjusted
on
its
stand
and
the
scribbling
of
many
quills
half
an
hour
passed
then
an
hour
the
little
squares
of
reflected
gold
light
flickering
on
the
ground
below
started
to
vanish
as
lights
in
the
castle
windows
were
extinguished
as
Harry
completed
the
constellation
Orion
on
his
chart
however
the
front
doors
of
the
castle
opened
directly
below
the
parapet
where
he
was
standing
so
that
light
spilled
down
the
stone
steps
a
little
way
across
the
lawn
harry
glanced
down
as
he
made
a
slight
adjustment
to
the
position
of
his
telescope
and
saw
five
or
six
elongated
shadows
moving
over
the
brightly
lit
grass
before
the
doors
swung
shut
and
the
lawn
became
a
sea
of
darkness
once
more
harry
put
his
eye
back
to
his
telescope
and
refocused
it
now
examining
Venus
he
looked
down
at
his
chart
to
enter
the
planet
there
but
something
distracted
him
pausing
with
his
quill
suspended
over
the
parchment
he
squinted
down
into
the
shadowy
grounds
and
saw
half
a
dozen
figures
walking
over
the
lawn
if
they
had
not
been
moving
and
the
moonlight
had
not
been
gilding
the
tops
of
their
heads
they
would
have
been
indistinguishable
from
the
dark
ground
on
which
they
walked
even
at
this
distance
Harry
had
a
funny
feeling
he
recognized
the
walk
of
the
squattest
of
them
who
seemed
to
be
leading
the
group
he
could
not
think
why
Umbridge
would
be
taking
a
stroll
outside
after
midnight
much
less
accompanied
by
five
others
then
somebody
coughed
behind
him
and
he
remembered
that
he
was
halfway
through
an
exam
he
had
quite
forgotten
Venuss
position
jamming
his
eye
to
his
telescope
he
found
it
again
and
was
once
more
about
to
enter
it
on
his
chart
when
alert
for
any
odd
sound
he
heard
a
distant
knock
which
echoed
through
the
deserted
grounds
followed
immediately
by
the
muffled
barking
of
a
large
dog
he
looked
up
his
heart
hammering
there
were
lights
on
in
Hagrids
windows
and
the
people
he
had
observed
crossing
the
lawn
were
now
silhouetted
against
them
the
door
opened
and
he
distinctly
saw
six
sharply
defined
figures
walk
over
the
threshold
the
door
closed
again
and
there
was
silence
harry
felt
very
uneasy
he
glanced
around
to
see
whether
Ron
or
Hermione
had
noticed
what
he
had
but
Professor
Marchbanks
came
walking
behind
him
at
that
moment
and
not
wanting
to
look
as
though
he
was
sneaking
looks
at
anyone
elses
work
Harry
hastily
bent
over
his
starchart
and
pretended
to
be
adding
notes
to
it
while
really
peering
over
the
top
of
the
parapet
towards
Hagrids
cabin
figures
were
now
moving
across
the
cabin
windows
temporarily
blocking
the
light
he
could
feel
Professor
Marchbankss
eyes
on
the
back
of
his
neck
and
pressed
his
eye
again
to
his
telescope
staring
up
at
the
moon
though
he
had
marked
its
position
an
hour
ago
but
as
professor
Marchbanks
moved
on
he
heard
a
roar
from
the
distant
cabin
that
echoed
through
the
darkness
right
to
the
top
of
the
Astronomy
Tower
several
of
the
people
around
Harry
ducked
out
from
behind
their
telescopes
and
peered
instead
in
the
direction
of
Hagrids
cabin
professor
Tofty
gave
another
dry
little
cough
try
and
concentrate
now
boys
and
girls
he
said
softly
most
people
returned
to
their
telescopes
harry
looked
to
his
left
hermione
was
gazing
transfixed
at
Hagrids
cabin
ahem
twenty
minutes
to
go
said
Professor
Tofty
hermione
jumped
and
returned
at
once
to
her
star-chart
Harry
looked
down
at
his
own
and
noticed
that
he
had
mislabelled
Venus
as
Mars
he
bent
to
correct
it
there
was
a
loud
bang
from
the
grounds
several
people
cried
Ouch
when
they
poked
themselves
in
the
face
with
the
ends
of
their
telescopes
as
they
hastened
to
see
what
was
going
on
below
hagrids
door
had
burst
open
and
by
the
light
flooding
out
of
the
cabin
they
saw
him
quite
clearly
a
massive
figure
roaring
and
brandishing
his
fists
surrounded
by
six
people
all
of
whom
judging
by
the
tiny
threads
of
red
light
they
were
casting
in
his
direction
seemed
to
be
attempting
to
Stun
him
no
cried
Hermione
my
dear
said
Professor
Tofty
in
a
scandalised
voice
this
is
an
examination
but
nobody
was
paying
the
slightest
attention
to
their
star-charts
any
more
jets
of
red
light
were
still
flying
about
beside
Hagrids
cabin
yet
somehow
they
seemed
to
be
bouncing
off
him
he
was
still
upright
and
still
as
far
as
Harry
could
see
fighting
cries
and
yells
echoed
across
the
grounds
a
man
yelled
Be
reasonable
Hagrid
hagrid
roared
Reasonable
be
damned
yeh
won
take
me
like
this
Dawlish
harry
could
see
the
tiny
outline
of
Fang
attempting
to
defend
Hagrid
leaping
repeatedly
at
the
wizards
surrounding
him
until
a
Stunning
Spell
caught
him
and
he
fell
to
the
ground
hagrid
gave
a
howl
of
fury
lifted
the
culprit
bodily
from
the
ground
and
threw
him
the
man
flew
what
looked
like
ten
feet
and
did
not
get
up
again
hermione
gasped
both
hands
over
her
mouth
harry
looked
round
at
Ron
and
saw
that
he
too
was
looking
scared
none
of
them
had
ever
seen
hagrid
in
a
real
temper
before
look
squealed
Parvati
who
was
leaning
over
the
parapet
and
pointing
to
the
foot
of
the
castle
where
the
front
doors
had
opened
again
more
light
was
spilling
out
on
to
the
dark
lawn
and
a
single
long
black
shadow
was
now
rippling
across
the
lawn
now
really
said
Professor
Tofty
anxiously
only
sixteen
minutes
left
you
know
but
nobody
paid
him
the
slightest
attention
they
were
watching
the
person
now
sprinting
towards
the
battle
beside
Hagrids
cabin
how
dare
you
the
figure
shouted
as
she
ran
how
dare
you
its
McGonagall
whispered
Hermione
leave
him
alone
alone
I
say
said
Professor
McGonagalls
voice
through
the
darkness
on
what
grounds
are
you
attacking
him
he
has
done
nothing
nothing
to
warrant
such
hermione
Parvati
and
Lavender
all
screamed
no
fewer
than
four
Stunners
had
shot
from
the
figures
around
the
cabin
toward
Professor
McGonagall
halfway
between
cabin
and
castle
the
red
beams
collided
with
her
for
a
moment
she
looked
luminous
illuminated
by
an
eerie
red
glow
then
was
lifted
right
off
her
feet
landed
hard
on
her
back
and
moved
no
more
galloping
gargoyles
shouted
Professor
Tofty
who
seemed
to
have
forgotten
the
exam
completely
not
so
much
as
a
warning
outrageous
behavior
cowards
bellowed
Hagrid
his
voice
carring
clearly
to
the
top
of
the
tower
and
several
lights
flickered
back
on
inside
the
castle
ruddy
cowards
have
some
O
that
an
that
oh
my
gasped
Hermione
hagrid
took
two
massive
swipes
at
his
closest
attackers
judging
by
their
immediate
collapse
they
had
been
knocked
cold
harry
saw
Hagrid
double
over
and
thought
he
had
finally
been
overcome
by
a
spell
but
on
the
contrary
next
moment
Hagrid
was
standing
again
with
what
appeared
to
be
a
sack
on
his
back
then
Harry
realized
that
Fangs
limp
body
was
draped
around
his
shoulders
get
him
get
him
screamed
Umbridge
but
her
remaining
helper
seemed
highly
reluctant
to
go
within
reach
of
Hagrids
fists
indeed
he
was
backing
away
so
fast
he
tripped
over
one
of
his
unconscious
colleagues
and
fell
over
hagrid
had
turned
and
begun
to
run
with
Fang
still
hung
around
his
neck
umbridge
sent
one
last
Stunning
Spell
after
him
but
it
missed
and
Hagrid
running
full-pelt
towards
the
distant
gates
disappeared
into
the
darkness
there
was
a
long
minutes
quivering
silence
as
everybody
gazed
open-mouthed
into
the
grounds
then
Professor
Toftys
voice
said
feebly
Um
five
minutes
to
go
everybody
though
he
had
only
filled
in
two-thirds
of
his
chart
Harry
was
desperate
for
the
exam
to
end
when
it
came
at
last
he
Ron
and
Hermione
forced
their
telescopes
haphazardly
back
into
their
holders
and
dashed
back
down
the
spiral
staircase
none
of
the
students
were
going
to
bed
they
were
all
talking
loudly
and
excitedly
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
about
what
they
had
witnessed
that
evil
woman
gasped
Hermione
who
seemed
to
be
having
difficulty
talking
due
to
rage
trying
to
sneak
up
on
Hagrid
in
the
dead
of
night
she
clearly
wanted
to
avoid
another
scene
like
Trelawneys
said
Ernie
Macmillan
sagely
squeezing
over
to
join
them
hagrid
did
well
didnt
he
said
Ron
who
looked
more
alarmed
than
impressed
how
come
all
the
spells
bounced
off
him
itll
be
his
giant
blood
said
Hermione
shakily
its
very
hard
to
Stun
a
giant
theyre
like
trolls
really
tough
but
poor
Professor
McGonagall
four
Stunners
straight
in
the
chest
and
shes
not
exactly
young
is
she
dreadful
dreadful
said
Ernie
shaking
his
head
pompously
well
Im
off
to
bed
night
all
people
around
them
were
drifting
away
still
talking
excitedly
about
what
they
had
just
seen
at
least
they
didnt
get
to
take
Hagrid
off
to
Azkaban
said
Ron
i
spect
hes
gone
to
join
dumbledore
hasnt
he
i
suppose
so
said
Hermione
who
looked
tearful
oh
this
is
awful
I
really
thought
dumbledore
would
be
back
before
long
but
now
weve
lost
Hagrid
too
they
traipsed
back
to
the
Gryffindor
common
room
to
find
it
full
the
commotion
out
in
the
grounds
had
woken
several
people
who
had
hastened
to
rouse
their
friends
seamus
and
Dean
who
had
arrived
ahead
of
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
were
now
telling
everyone
what
they
had
seen
and
heard
from
the
top
of
the
Astronomy
Tower
but
why
sack
Hagrid
now
asked
Angelina
Johnson
shaking
her
head
its
not
like
trelawney
hes
been
teaching
much
better
than
usual
this
year
umbridge
hates
part-humans
said
Hermione
bitterly
flopping
down
into
an
armchair
she
was
always
going
to
try
and
get
Hagrid
out
and
she
thought
Hagrid
was
putting
Nifflers
in
her
office
piped
up
Katie
Bell
oh
blimey
said
Lee
Jordan
covering
his
mouth
its
me
whos
been
putting
the
Nifflers
in
her
office
fred
and
George
left
me
a
couple
Ive
been
levitating
them
in
through
her
window
shed
have
sacked
him
anyway
said
Dean
he
was
too
close
to
Dumbledore
thats
true
said
Harry
sinking
into
an
armchair
beside
Hermiones
i
just
hope
Professor
McGonagalls
all
right
said
Lavender
tearfully
they
carried
her
back
up
to
the
castle
we
watched
through
the
dormitory
window
said
Colin
creevey
She
didnt
look
very
well
madam
Pomfrey
will
sort
her
out
said
Alicia
Spinnet
firmly
shes
never
failed
yet
it
was
nearly
four
in
the
morning
before
the
common
room
cleared
harry
felt
wide
awake
the
image
of
Hagrid
sprinting
away
into
the
dark
was
haunting
him
he
was
so
angry
with
Umbridge
he
could
not
think
of
a
punishment
bad
enough
for
her
though
Rons
suggestion
of
having
her
fed
to
a
box
of
starving
Blast-Ended
Skrewts
had
its
merits
he
fell
asleep
contemplating
hideous
revenges
and
arose
from
bed
three
hours
later
feeling
distinctly
unrested
their
final
exam
History
of
Magic
was
not
to
take
place
until
that
afternoon
harry
would
very
much
have
liked
to
go
back
to
bed
after
breakfast
but
he
had
been
counting
on
the
morning
for
a
spot
of
last-minute
revision
so
instead
he
sat
with
his
head
in
his
hands
by
the
common-room
window
trying
hard
not
to
doze
off
as
he
read
through
some
of
the
notes
stacked
three-and-a-half
feet
high
that
Hermione
had
lent
him
the
fifth-years
entered
the
Great
Hall
at
two
oclock
and
took
their
places
in
front
of
their
facedown
examination
papers
harry
felt
exhausted
he
just
wanted
this
to
be
over
so
that
he
could
go
and
sleep
then
tomorrow
he
and
Ron
were
going
to
go
down
to
the
Quidditch
pitch
he
was
going
to
have
a
fly
on
Rons
broom
and
savor
their
freedom
from
revision
turn
over
your
papers
said
Professor
Marchbanks
from
the
front
of
the
Hall
flicking
over
the
giant
hour-glass
you
may
begin
harry
stared
fixedly
at
the
first
question
it
was
several
seconds
before
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
had
not
taken
in
a
word
of
it
there
was
a
wasp
buzzing
distractingly
against
one
of
the
high
windows
slowly
tortuously
he
at
last
began
to
write
an
answer
he
was
finding
it
very
difficult
to
remember
names
and
kept
confusing
dates
he
simply
skipped
question
four
In
your
opinion
did
wand
legislation
contribute
to
or
lead
to
better
control
of
goblin
riots
of
the
eighteenth
century
thinking
that
he
would
go
back
to
it
if
he
had
time
at
the
end
he
had
a
stab
at
question
five
How
wasthe
Statute
of
Secrecy
breached
in
and
what
measures
were
introduced
to
prevent
a
recurrence
but
had
a
nagging
suspicion
that
he
had
missed
several
important
points
he
had
a
feeling
vampires
had
come
into
the
story
somewhere
he
looked
ahead
for
a
question
he
could
definitely
answer
and
his
eyes
alighted
upon
number
ten
Describe
the
circumstances
that
led
to
the
form
ation
of
the
International
Confederation
of
wizards
and
explain
why
the
warlocks
of
Liechtenstein
refused
to
join
i
know
this
Harry
thought
though
his
brain
felt
torpid
and
slack
he
could
visualize
a
heading
in
Hermiones
handwriting
The
formation
of
the
International
Confederation
of
Wizards
he
had
read
those
notes
only
this
morning
he
began
to
write
looking
up
now
and
again
to
check
the
large
hour-glass
on
the
desk
beside
professor
Marchbanks
he
was
sitting
right
behind
Parvati
Patil
whose
long
dark
hair
fell
below
the
back
of
her
chair
once
or
twice
he
found
himself
staring
at
the
tiny
golden
lights
that
glistened
in
it
when
she
moved
her
head
slightly
and
had
to
give
his
own
head
a
little
shake
to
clear
it
the
first
Supreme
Mugwump
of
the
International
Confederation
of
Wizards
was
Pierre
bonaccord
but
his
appointment
was
contested
by
the
wizarding
community
of
Liechtenstein
because
all
around
Harry
quills
were
scratching
on
parchment
like
scurrying
burrowing
rats
the
sun
was
very
hot
on
the
back
of
his
head
what
was
it
that
Bonaccord
had
done
to
offend
the
wizards
of
Liechtenstein
harry
had
a
feeling
it
had
something
to
do
with
trolls
he
gazed
blankly
at
the
back
of
Parvatis
head
again
if
he
could
only
perform
Legilimency
and
open
a
window
in
the
back
of
her
head
and
see
what
it
was
about
trolls
that
had
caused
the
breach
between
Pierre
bonaccord
and
Liechtenstein
harry
closed
his
eyes
and
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
so
that
the
glowing
red
of
his
eyelids
grew
dark
and
cool
bonaccord
had
wanted
to
stop
troll-hunting
and
give
the
trolls
rights
but
liechtenstein
was
having
problems
with
a
tribe
of
particularly
vicious
mountain
trolls
that
was
it
he
opened
his
eyes
they
stung
and
watered
at
the
sight
of
the
blazing
white
parchment
slowly
he
wrote
two
lines
about
the
trolls
then
read
through
what
he
had
done
so
far
it
did
not
seem
very
informative
or
detailed
yet
he
was
sure
Hermiones
notes
on
the
Confederation
had
gone
on
for
pages
and
pages
he
closed
his
eyes
again
trying
to
see
them
trying
to
remember
the
Confederation
had
met
for
the
first
time
in
France
yes
he
had
written
that
already
goblins
had
tried
to
attend
and
been
ousted
he
had
written
that
too
and
nobody
from
Liechtenstein
had
wanted
to
come
think
he
told
himself
his
face
in
his
hands
while
all
around
him
quills
scratched
out
neverending
answers
and
the
sand
trickled
through
the
hour-glass
at
the
front
he
was
walking
along
the
cool
dark
corridor
to
the
Department
of
Mysteries
again
walking
with
a
firm
and
purposeful
tread
breaking
occasionally
into
a
run
determined
to
reach
his
destination
at
last
the
black
door
swung
open
for
him
as
usual
and
here
he
was
in
the
circular
room
with
its
many
doors
straight
across
the
stone
floor
and
through
the
second
door
patches
of
dancing
light
on
the
walls
and
floor
and
that
odd
mechanical
clicking
but
no
time
to
explore
he
must
hurry
he
jogged
the
last
few
feet
to
the
third
door
which
swung
open
just
like
the
others
once
again
he
was
in
the
cathedral-sized
room
full
of
shelves
and
glass
spheres
his
heart
was
beating
very
fast
now
he
was
going
to
get
there
this
time
when
he
reached
number
ninety-seven
he
turned
left
and
hurried
along
the
aisle
between
two
rows
but
there
was
a
shape
on
the
floor
at
the
very
end
a
black
shape
moving
on
the
floor
like
a
wounded
animal
harrys
stomach
contracted
with
fear
with
excitement
a
voice
issued
from
his
own
mouth
a
high
cold
voice
empty
of
any
human
kindness
take
it
for
me
lift
it
down
now
i
cannot
touch
it
but
you
can
the
black
shape
on
the
floor
shifted
a
little
harry
saw
a
long-fingered
white
hand
clutching
a
wand
rise
at
the
end
of
his
own
arm
heard
the
high
cold
voice
say
Crucio
the
man
on
the
floor
let
out
a
scream
of
pain
attempted
to
stand
but
fell
back
writhing
harry
was
laughing
he
raised
his
wand
the
curse
lifted
and
the
figure
groaned
and
became
motionless
lord
Voldemort
is
waiting
very
slowly
his
arms
trembling
the
man
on
the
ground
raised
his
shoulders
a
few
inches
and
lifted
his
head
his
face
was
bloodstained
and
gaunt
twisted
in
pain
yet
rigid
with
defiance
youll
have
to
kill
me
whispered
Sirius
undoubtedly
I
shall
in
the
end
said
the
cold
voice
but
you
will
fetch
it
for
me
first
Black
you
think
you
have
felt
pain
thus
far
think
again
we
have
hours
ahead
of
us
and
nobody
to
hear
you
scream
but
somebody
screamed
as
Voldemort
lowered
his
wand
again
somebody
yelled
and
fell
sideways
off
a
hot
desk
on
to
the
cold
stone
floor
Harry
awoke
as
he
hit
the
ground
still
yelling
his
scar
on
fire
as
the
Great
Hall
erupted
all
around
him
chapter
thirty-two
out
of
the
Fire
im
not
going
i
dont
need
the
hospital
wing
i
dont
want
he
was
gibbering
as
he
tried
to
pull
away
from
Professor
Tofty
who
was
looking
at
Harry
with
much
concern
after
helping
him
out
into
the
Entrance
Hall
with
the
students
all
around
them
staring
im
Im
fine
sir
Harry
stammered
wiping
the
sweat
from
his
face
really
i
just
fell
asleep
had
a
nightmare
pressure
of
examinations
said
the
old
wizard
sympathetically
patting
Harry
shakily
on
the
shoulder
it
happens
young
man
it
happens
now
a
cooling
drink
of
water
and
perhaps
you
will
be
ready
to
return
to
the
Great
Hall
the
examination
is
nearly
over
but
you
may
be
able
to
round
off
your
last
answer
nicely
yes
said
Harry
wildly
i
mean
no
ive
done
done
as
much
as
I
can
I
think
very
well
very
well
said
the
old
wizard
gently
i
shall
go
and
collect
your
examination
paper
and
I
suggest
that
you
go
and
have
a
nice
lie
down
ill
do
that
said
Harry
nodding
vigorously
thanks
very
much
the
second
that
the
old
mans
heels
disappeared
over
the
threshold
into
the
Great
Hall
Harry
ran
up
the
marble
staircase
hurtled
along
the
corridors
so
fast
the
portraits
he
passed
muttered
reproaches
up
more
flights
of
stairs
and
finally
burst
like
a
hurricane
through
the
double
doors
of
the
hospital
wing
causing
Madam
Pomfrey
who
had
been
spooning
some
bright
blue
liquid
into
Montagues
open
mouth
to
shriek
in
alarm
potter
what
do
you
think
youre
doing
i
need
to
see
Professor
McGonagall
gasped
Harry
the
breath
tearing
his
lungs
now
its
urgent
shes
not
here
Potter
said
Madam
Pomfrey
sadly
she
was
transferred
to
st.
Mungos
this
morning
four
Stunning
Spells
straight
to
the
chest
at
her
age
its
a
wonder
they
didnt
kill
her
shes
gone
said
Harry
shocked
the
bell
rang
just
outside
the
dormitory
and
he
heard
the
usual
distant
rumbling
of
students
starting
to
flood
out
into
the
corridors
above
and
below
him
he
remained
quite
still
looking
at
madam
Pomfrey
terror
was
rising
inside
him
there
was
nobody
left
to
tell
dumbledore
had
gone
Hagrid
had
gone
but
he
had
always
expected
Professor
McGonagall
to
be
there
irascible
and
inflexible
perhaps
but
always
dependably
solidly
present
i
dont
wonder
youre
shocked
Potter
said
Madam
Pomfrey
with
a
kind
of
fierce
approval
in
her
face
as
if
one
of
them
could
have
Stunned
Minerva
McGonagall
face-on
by
daylight
cowardice
thats
what
it
was
despicable
cowardice
if
I
wasnt
worried
what
would
happen
to
you
students
without
me
Id
resign
in
protest
yes
said
Harry
blankly
he
wheeled
around
and
strode
blindly
from
the
hospital
wing
into
the
teeming
corridor
where
he
stood
buffeted
by
the
crowd
panic
expanding
inside
him
like
poison
gas
so
that
his
head
swam
and
he
could
not
think
what
to
do
ron
and
Hermione
said
a
voice
in
his
head
he
was
running
again
pushing
students
out
of
the
way
oblivious
to
their
angry
protests
he
sprinted
back
down
two
floors
and
was
at
the
top
of
the
marble
staircase
when
he
saw
them
hurrying
towards
him
harry
said
Hermione
at
once
looking
very
frightened
what
happened
are
you
all
right
are
you
ill
where
have
you
been
demanded
Ron
come
with
me
Harry
said
quickly
come
on
Ive
got
to
tell
you
something
he
led
them
along
the
first-floor
corridor
peering
through
doorways
and
at
last
found
an
empty
classroom
into
which
he
dived
closing
the
door
behind
Ron
and
Hermione
the
moment
they
were
inside
and
leaned
against
it
facing
them
voldemorts
got
Sirius
what
how
dyou
saw
it
just
now
when
I
fell
asleep
in
the
exam
but
but
where
how
said
Hermione
whose
face
was
white
i
dunno
how
said
Harry
but
I
know
exactly
where
theres
a
room
in
the
Department
of
mysteries
full
of
shelves
covered
in
these
little
glass
balls
and
theyre
at
the
end
of
row
ninety-seven
hes
trying
to
use
Sirius
to
get
whatever
it
is
he
wants
from
in
there
hes
torturing
him
says
hell
end
by
killing
him
harry
found
his
voice
was
shaking
as
were
his
knees
he
moved
over
to
a
desk
and
sat
down
on
it
trying
to
master
himself
howre
we
going
to
get
there
he
asked
them
there
was
a
moments
silence
then
Ron
said
g-get
there
get
to
the
Department
of
Mysteries
so
we
can
rescue
Sirius
harry
said
loudly
but
Harry
said
Ron
weakly
what
what
said
Harry
he
could
not
understand
why
they
were
both
gaping
at
him
as
though
he
was
asking
them
something
unreasonable
harry
said
Hermione
in
a
rather
frightened
voice
er
how
how
did
Voldemort
get
into
the
Ministry
of
Magic
without
anybody
realizing
he
was
there
how
do
I
know
bellowed
Harry
the
question
is
how
were
going
to
get
in
there
but
harry
think
about
this
said
Hermione
taking
a
step
towards
him
its
five
oclock
in
the
afternoon
the
Ministry
of
Magic
must
be
full
of
workers
how
would
Voldemort
and
sirius
have
got
in
without
being
seen
harry
theyre
probably
the
two
most
wanted
wizards
in
the
world
you
think
they
could
get
into
a
building
full
of
Aurors
undetected
i
dunno
Voldemort
used
an
Invisibility
Cloak
or
something
harry
shouted
anyway
the
department
of
Mysteries
has
always
been
completely
empty
whenever
Ive
been
youve
never
been
there
Harry
said
Hermione
quietly
youve
dreamed
about
the
place
thats
all
theyre
not
normal
dreams
harry
shouted
in
her
face
standing
up
and
taking
a
step
closer
to
her
in
turn
he
wanted
to
shake
her
how
dyou
explain
Rons
dad
then
what
was
all
that
about
how
come
I
knew
what
had
happened
to
him
hes
got
a
point
said
Ron
quietly
looking
at
Hermione
but
this
is
just
just
sounds
unlikely
said
Hermione
desperately
harry
how
on
earth
could
Voldemort
have
got
hold
of
Sirius
when
hes
been
in
Grimmauld
Place
all
the
time
sirius
mightve
cracked
and
just
wanted
some
fresh
air
said
Ron
sounding
worried
hes
been
desperate
to
get
out
of
that
house
for
ages
but
why
Hermione
persisted
why
on
earth
would
Voldemort
want
to
use
Sirius
to
get
the
weapon
or
whatever
the
thing
is
i
dunno
there
could
be
loads
of
reasons
harry
yelled
at
her
maybe
Sirius
is
just
someone
voldemort
doesnt
care
about
seeing
hurt
you
know
what
Ive
just
thought
of
something
said
Ron
in
a
hushed
voice
siriuss
brother
was
a
Death
Eater
wasnt
he
maybe
he
told
Sirius
the
secret
of
how
to
get
the
weapon
yeah
and
thats
why
Dumbledores
been
so
keen
to
keep
Sirius
locked
up
all
the
time
said
harry
look
Im
sorry
cried
Hermione
but
neither
of
you
is
making
sense
and
weve
got
no
proof
for
any
of
this
no
proof
Voldemort
and
Sirius
are
even
there
hermione
Harrys
seen
them
said
Ron
rounding
on
her
okay
she
said
looking
frightened
yet
determined
Ive
just
got
to
say
this
what
you
this
isnt
a
criticism
Harry
but
you
do
sort
of
i
mean
dont
you
think
youve
got
a
bit
of
a
a
saving-people
thing
she
said
he
glared
at
her
and
whats
that
supposed
to
mean
a
saving-people
thing
well
you
she
looked
more
apprehensive
than
ever
i
mean
last
year
for
instance
in
the
lake
during
the
Tournament
you
shouldnt
have
i
mean
you
didnt
need
to
save
that
little
Delacour
girl
you
got
a
bit
carried
away
a
wave
of
hot
prickly
anger
swept
through
Harrys
body
how
could
she
remind
him
of
that
blunder
now
i
mean
it
was
really
great
of
you
and
everything
said
Hermione
quickly
looking
positively
petrified
at
the
look
on
Harrys
face
everyone
thought
it
was
a
wonderful
thing
to
do
thats
funny
said
Harry
through
gritted
teeth
because
I
definitely
remember
Ron
saying
Id
wasted
time
acting
the
hero
is
that
what
you
think
this
is
you
reckon
I
want
to
act
the
hero
again
no
no
no
said
Hermione
looking
aghast
thats
not
what
I
mean
at
all
well
spit
out
what
youve
got
to
say
because
were
wasting
time
here
harry
shouted
im
trying
to
say
Voldemort
knows
you
Harry
he
took
Ginny
down
into
the
Chamber
of
secrets
to
lure
you
there
its
the
kind
of
thing
he
does
he
knows
youre
the
the
sort
of
person
whod
go
to
Siriuss
aid
what
if
hes
just
trying
to
get
you
into
the
Department
of
Myst
hermione
it
doesnt
matter
if
hes
done
it
to
get
me
there
or
not
theyve
taken
McGonagall
to
st.
Mungos
there
isnt
anyone
from
the
Order
left
at
Hogwarts
who
we
can
tell
and
if
we
dont
go
Sirius
is
dead
but
Harry
what
if
your
dream
was
was
just
that
a
dream
harry
let
out
a
roar
of
frustration
hermione
actually
stepped
back
from
him
looking
alarmed
you
dont
get
it
harry
shouted
at
her
Im
not
having
nightmares
Im
not
just
dreaming
what
dyou
think
all
the
Occlumency
was
for
why
dyou
think
Dumbledore
wanted
me
prevented
from
seeing
these
things
because
theyre
real
Hermione
Sirius
is
trapped
Ive
seen
him
voldemorts
got
him
and
no
one
else
knows
and
that
means
were
the
only
ones
who
can
save
him
and
if
you
dont
want
to
do
it
fine
but
Im
going
understand
and
if
I
remember
rightly
you
didnt
have
a
problem
with
my
saving-people
thing
when
it
was
you
I
was
saving
from
the
Dementors
or
he
rounded
on
Ron
when
it
was
your
sister
I
was
saving
from
the
basilisk
i
never
said
I
had
a
problem
said
Ron
heatedly
but
Harry
youve
just
said
it
said
Hermione
fiercely
Dumbledore
wanted
you
to
learn
to
shut
these
things
out
of
your
mind
if
youd
done
Occlumency
properly
youd
never
have
seen
this
if
you
think
im
just
going
to
act
like
I
havent
seen
sirius
told
you
there
was
nothing
more
important
than
you
learning
to
close
your
mind
well
I
expect
hed
say
something
different
if
he
knew
what
id
just
the
classroom
door
opened
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
whipped
around
ginny
walked
in
looking
curious
closely
followed
by
Luna
who
as
usual
looked
as
though
she
had
drifted
in
accidentally
hi
said
Ginny
uncertainly
we
recognized
Harrys
voice
what
are
you
yelling
about
never
you
mind
said
Harry
roughly
ginny
raised
her
eyebrows
theres
no
need
to
take
that
tone
with
me
she
said
coolly
I
was
only
wondering
whether
I
could
help
well
you
cant
said
Harry
shortly
youre
being
rather
rude
you
know
said
Luna
serenely
harry
swore
and
turned
away
the
very
last
thing
he
wanted
now
was
a
conversation
with
Luna
lovegood
wait
said
Hermione
suddenly
wait
harry
they
can
help
harry
and
Ron
looked
at
her
listen
she
said
urgently
Harry
we
need
to
establish
whether
Sirius
really
has
left
headquarters
ive
told
you
I
saw
harry
Im
begging
you
please
said
Hermione
desperately
please
lets
just
check
that
Sirius
isnt
at
home
before
we
go
charging
off
to
London
if
we
find
out
hes
not
there
then
I
swear
I
wont
try
to
stop
you
ill
come
Ill
d
do
whatever
it
takes
to
try
and
save
him
sirius
is
being
tortured
now
shouted
Harry
we
havent
got
time
to
waste
but
if
this
is
a
trick
of
Voldemorts
Harry
weve
got
to
check
weve
got
to
how
harry
demanded
howre
we
going
to
check
well
have
to
use
Umbridges
fire
and
see
if
we
can
contact
him
said
Hermione
who
looked
positively
terrified
at
the
thought
well
draw
Umbridge
away
again
but
well
need
lookouts
and
thats
where
we
can
use
Ginny
and
Luna
though
clearly
struggling
to
understand
what
was
going
on
Ginny
said
immediately
Yeah
well
do
it
and
Luna
said
When
you
say
Sirius
are
you
talking
about
Stubby
Boardman
nobody
answered
her
okay
Harry
said
aggressively
to
Hermione
Okay
if
you
can
think
of
a
way
of
doing
this
quickly
Im
with
you
otherwise
Im
going
to
the
Department
of
Mysteries
right
now
the
Department
of
Mysteries
said
Luna
looking
mildly
surprised
but
how
are
you
going
to
get
there
again
Harry
ignored
her
right
said
Hermione
twisting
her
hands
together
and
pacing
up
and
down
between
the
desks
right
well
one
of
us
has
to
go
and
find
Umbridge
and
and
send
her
off
in
the
wrong
direction
keep
her
away
from
her
office
they
could
tell
her
I
dont
know
that
Peeves
is
up
to
something
awful
as
usual
ill
do
it
said
Ron
at
once
ill
tell
her
Peeves
is
smashing
up
the
Transfiguration
department
or
something
its
miles
away
from
her
office
come
to
think
of
it
I
could
probably
persuade
peeves
to
do
it
if
I
met
him
on
the
way
it
was
a
mark
of
the
seriousness
of
the
situation
that
Hermione
made
no
objection
to
the
smashing
up
of
the
Transfiguration
department
okay
she
said
her
brow
furrowed
as
she
continued
to
pace
now
we
need
to
keep
students
right
away
from
her
office
while
we
force
entry
or
some
Slytherins
bound
to
go
and
tip
her
off
luna
and
I
can
stand
at
either
end
of
the
corridor
said
Ginny
promptly
and
warn
people
not
to
go
down
there
because
someones
let
off
a
load
of
Garrotting
Gas
hermione
looked
surprised
at
the
readiness
with
which
Ginny
had
come
up
with
this
lie
Ginny
shrugged
and
said
Fred
and
George
were
planning
to
do
it
before
they
left
okay
said
Hermione
well
then
Harry
you
and
I
will
be
under
the
Invisibility
Cloak
and
well
sneak
into
the
office
and
you
can
talk
to
Sirius
hes
not
there
Hermione
i
mean
you
can
can
check
whether
Sirius
is
at
home
or
not
while
I
keep
watch
I
dont
think
you
should
be
in
there
alone
Lees
already
proved
the
windows
a
weak
spot
sending
those
nifflers
through
it
even
through
his
anger
and
impatience
Harry
recognized
Hermiones
offer
to
accompany
him
into
Umbridges
office
as
a
sign
of
solidarity
and
loyalty
okay
thanks
he
muttered
right
well
even
if
we
do
all
of
that
I
dont
think
were
going
to
be
able
to
bank
on
more
than
five
minutes
said
Hermione
looking
relieved
that
Harry
seemed
to
have
accepted
the
plan
not
with
Filch
and
the
wretched
Inquisitorial
Squad
floating
around
five
minutesll
be
enough
said
Harry
cmon
lets
go
now
said
Hermione
looking
shocked
of
course
now
said
Harry
angrily
what
did
you
think
were
going
to
wait
until
after
dinner
or
something
hermione
Sirius
is
being
tortured
right
now
i
oh
all
right
she
said
desperately
you
go
and
get
the
Invisibility
Cloak
and
well
meet
you
at
the
end
of
Umbridges
corridor
okay
harry
didnt
answer
but
flung
himself
out
of
the
room
and
began
to
fight
his
way
through
the
milling
crowds
outside
two
floors
up
he
met
Seamus
and
Dean
who
hailed
him
jovially
and
told
him
they
were
planning
a
dusk-till-dawn
end-of-exams
celebration
in
the
common
room
harry
barely
heard
them
he
scrambled
through
the
portrait
hole
while
they
were
still
arguing
about
how
many
black-market
Butterbeers
they
would
need
and
was
climbing
back
out
of
it
the
invisibility
Cloak
and
Siriuss
knife
secure
in
his
bag
before
they
noticed
he
had
left
them
harry
dyou
want
to
chip
in
a
couple
of
Galleons
harold
Dingle
reckons
he
could
sell
us
some
firewhisky
but
Harry
was
already
tearing
away
back
along
the
corridor
and
a
couple
of
minutes
later
was
jumping
the
last
few
stairs
to
join
Ron
Hermione
Ginny
and
Luna
who
were
huddled
together
at
the
end
of
Umbridges
corridor
got
it
he
panted
ready
to
go
then
all
right
whispered
Hermione
as
a
gang
of
loud
sixth-years
passed
them
so
Ron
you
go
and
head
Umbridge
off
ginny
Luna
if
you
can
start
moving
people
out
of
the
corridor
harry
and
I
will
get
the
Cloak
on
and
wait
until
the
coast
is
clear
ron
strode
away
his
bright-red
hair
visible
right
to
the
end
of
the
passage
meanwhile
Ginnys
equally
vivid
head
bobbed
between
the
jostling
students
surrounding
them
in
the
other
direction
trailed
by
Lunas
blonde
one
get
over
here
muttered
Hermione
tugging
at
Harrys
wrist
and
pulling
him
back
into
a
recess
where
the
ugly
stone
head
of
a
medieval
wizard
stood
muttering
to
itself
on
a
column
are
are
you
sure
youre
okay
Harry
youre
still
very
pale
im
fine
he
said
shortly
tugging
the
Invisibil
i
ty
Cloak
from
out
of
his
bag
in
truth
his
scar
was
aching
but
not
so
badly
that
he
thought
Voldemort
had
yet
dealt
Sirius
a
fatal
blow
it
had
hurt
much
worse
than
this
when
Voldemort
had
been
punishing
Avery
here
he
said
he
threw
the
Invisibility
Cloak
over
both
of
them
and
they
stood
listening
carefully
over
the
Latin
mumblings
of
the
bust
in
front
of
them
you
cant
come
down
here
ginny
was
calling
to
the
crowd
no
sorry
youre
going
to
have
to
go
round
by
the
swivelling
staircase
someones
let
off
Garrotting
Gas
just
along
here
they
could
hear
people
complaining
one
surly
voice
said
I
cant
see
no
gas
thats
because
its
colorless
said
Ginny
in
a
convincingly
exasperated
voice
but
if
you
want
to
walk
through
it
carry
on
then
well
have
your
body
as
proof
for
the
next
idiot
who
doesnt
believe
us
slowly
the
crowd
thinned
the
news
about
the
Garrotting
Gas
seemed
to
have
spread
people
were
not
coming
this
way
any
more
when
at
last
the
surrounding
area
was
quite
clear
hermione
said
quietly
I
think
thats
as
good
as
were
going
to
get
Harry
come
on
lets
do
it
they
moved
forwards
covered
by
the
Cloak
luna
was
standing
with
her
back
to
them
at
the
far
end
of
the
corridor
as
they
passed
Ginny
Hermione
whispered
Good
one
dont
forget
the
signal
whats
the
signal
muttered
Harry
as
they
approached
Umbridges
door
a
loud
chorus
of
Weasly
is
our
King
if
they
see
Umbridge
coming
replied
Hermione
as
Harry
inserted
the
blade
of
Siriuss
knife
in
the
crack
between
door
and
wall
the
lock
clicked
open
and
they
entered
the
office
the
garish
kittens
were
basking
in
the
late-afternoon
sunshine
that
was
warming
their
plates
but
otherwise
the
office
was
as
still
and
unoccupied
as
last
time
hermione
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
i
thought
she
might
have
added
extra
security
after
the
second
Niffler
they
pulled
off
the
Cloak
Hermione
hurried
over
to
the
window
and
stood
out
of
sight
peering
down
into
the
grounds
with
her
wand
out
harry
dashed
over
to
the
fireplace
seized
the
pot
of
floo
powder
and
threw
a
pinch
into
the
grate
causing
emerald
flames
to
burst
into
life
there
he
knelt
down
quickly
thrust
his
head
into
the
dancing
fire
and
cried
Number
twelve
Grimmauld
place
his
head
began
to
spin
as
though
he
had
just
got
off
a
fair-ground
ride
though
his
knees
remained
firmly
planted
on
the
cold
office
floor
he
kept
his
eyes
screwed
up
against
the
whirling
ash
and
when
the
spinning
stopped
he
opened
them
to
find
himself
looking
out
at
the
long
cold
kitchen
of
Grimmauld
Place
there
was
nobody
there
he
had
expected
this
yet
was
not
prepared
for
the
molten
wave
of
dread
and
panic
that
seemed
to
burst
through
his
stomach
at
the
sight
of
the
deserted
room
sirius
he
shouted
sirius
are
you
there
his
voice
echoed
around
the
room
but
there
was
no
answer
except
a
tiny
scuffing
sound
to
the
right
of
the
fire
whos
there
he
called
wondering
whether
it
was
just
a
mouse
kreacher
the
house-elf
crept
into
view
he
looked
highly
delighted
about
something
though
he
seemed
to
have
recently
sustained
a
nasty
injury
to
both
hands
which
were
heavily
bandaged
its
the
Potter
boys
head
in
the
fire
Kreacher
informed
the
empty
kitchen
stealing
furtive
oddly
triumphant
glances
at
Harry
what
has
he
come
for
Kreacher
wonders
wheres
Sirius
Kreacher
harry
demanded
the
house-elf
gave
a
wheezy
chuckle
master
has
gone
out
Harry
Potter
wheres
he
gone
wheres
he
gone
Kreacher
kreacher
merely
cackled
im
warning
you
said
Harry
fully
aware
that
his
scope
for
inflicting
punishment
upon
kreacher
was
almost
non-existent
in
this
position
what
about
Lupin
mad-Eye
any
of
them
are
any
of
them
there
nobody
here
but
Kreacher
said
the
elf
gleefully
and
turning
away
from
Harry
he
began
to
walk
slowly
towards
the
door
at
the
end
of
the
kitchen
kreacher
thinks
he
will
have
a
little
chat
with
his
mistress
now
yes
he
hasnt
had
a
chance
in
a
long
time
Kreachers
master
has
been
keeping
him
away
from
her
where
has
Sirius
gone
harry
yelled
after
the
elf
kreacher
has
he
gone
to
the
Department
of
mysteries
kreacher
stopped
in
his
tracks
harry
could
just
make
out
the
back
of
his
bald
head
through
the
forest
of
chair
legs
before
him
master
does
not
tell
poor
Kreacher
where
he
is
going
said
the
elf
quietly
but
you
know
shouted
Harry
dont
you
you
know
where
he
is
there
was
a
moments
silence
then
the
elf
let
out
his
loudest
cackle
yet
master
will
not
come
back
from
the
Department
of
Mysteries
he
said
gleefully
kreacher
and
his
mistress
are
alone
again
and
he
scurried
forwards
and
disappeared
through
the
door
to
the
hall
you
but
before
he
could
utter
a
single
curse
or
insult
Harry
felt
a
great
pain
at
the
top
of
his
head
he
inhaled
a
lot
of
ash
and
choking
found
himself
being
dragged
backwards
through
the
flames
until
with
a
horrible
abruptness
he
was
staring
up
into
the
wide
pallid
face
of
Professor
umbridge
who
had
dragged
him
backwards
out
of
the
fire
by
the
hair
and
was
now
bending
his
neck
back
as
far
as
it
would
go
as
though
she
were
going
to
slit
his
throat
you
think
she
whispered
bending
Harrys
neck
back
even
further
so
that
he
was
looking
up
at
the
ceiling
that
after
two
Nifflers
I
was
going
to
let
one
more
foul
scavenging
little
creature
enter
my
office
without
my
knowledge
i
had
Stealth
Sensoring
Spells
placed
all
around
my
doorway
after
the
last
one
got
in
you
foolish
boy
take
his
wand
she
barked
at
someone
he
could
not
see
and
he
felt
a
hand
grope
inside
the
chest
pocket
of
his
robes
and
remove
the
wand
hers
too
harry
heard
a
scuffle
over
by
the
door
and
knew
that
Hermione
had
also
just
had
her
wand
wrested
from
her
i
want
to
know
why
you
are
in
my
office
said
Umbridge
shaking
the
fist
clutching
his
hair
so
that
he
staggered
i
was
trying
to
get
my
Firebolt
harry
croaked
liar
she
shook
his
head
again
your
Firebolt
is
under
strict
guard
in
the
dungeons
as
you
very
well
know
Potter
you
had
your
head
in
my
fire
with
whom
have
you
been
communicating
no
one
said
Harry
trying
to
pull
away
from
her
he
felt
several
hairs
part
company
with
his
scalp
liar
shouted
Umbridge
she
threw
him
from
her
and
he
slammed
into
the
desk
now
he
could
see
Hermione
pinioned
against
the
wall
by
Millicent
Bulstrode
malfoy
was
leaning
on
the
windowsill
smirking
as
he
threw
Harrys
wand
into
the
air
one-handed
and
caught
it
again
there
was
a
commotion
outside
and
several
large
Slytherins
entered
each
gripping
Ron
Ginny
luna
and
to
Harrys
bewilderment
Neville
who
was
trapped
in
a
stranglehold
by
Crabbe
and
looked
in
imminent
danger
of
suffocation
all
four
of
them
had
been
gagged
got
em
all
said
Warrington
shoving
Ron
roughly
forwards
into
the
room
that
one
he
poked
a
thick
finger
at
Neville
tried
to
stop
me
taking
her
he
pointed
at
Ginny
who
was
trying
to
kick
the
shins
of
the
large
Slytherin
girl
holding
her
so
I
brought
him
along
too
good
good
said
Umbridge
watching
Ginnys
struggles
well
it
looks
as
though
Hogwarts
will
shortly
be
a
weasley-free
zone
doesnt
it
malfoy
laughed
loudly
and
sycophantically
umbridge
gave
her
wide
complacent
smile
and
settled
herself
into
a
chintz-covered
armchair
blinking
up
at
her
captives
like
a
toad
in
a
flowerbed
so
Potter
she
said
you
stationed
lookouts
around
my
office
and
you
sent
this
buffoon
she
nodded
at
Ron
Malfoy
laughed
even
louder
to
tell
me
the
poltergeist
was
wreaking
havoc
in
the
Transfiguration
department
when
I
knew
perfectly
well
that
he
was
busy
smearing
ink
on
the
eyepieces
of
all
the
school
telescopes
mr.
Filch
having
just
informed
me
so
clearly
it
was
very
important
for
you
to
talk
to
somebody
was
it
Albus
Dumbledore
or
the
half-breed
Hagrid
i
doubt
it
was
Minerva
McGonagall
I
hear
she
is
still
too
ill
to
talk
to
anyone
malfoy
and
a
few
of
the
other
members
of
the
Inquisitorial
Squad
laughed
some
more
at
that
harry
found
he
was
so
full
of
rage
and
hatred
he
was
shaking
its
none
of
your
business
who
I
talk
to
he
snarled
umbridges
slack
face
seemed
to
tighten
very
well
she
said
in
her
most
dangerous
and
falsely
sweet
voice
very
well
Mr
Potter
offered
you
the
chance
to
tell
me
freely
you
refused
i
have
no
alternative
but
to
force
you
draco
fetch
Professor
Snape
malfoy
stowed
Harrys
wand
inside
his
robes
and
left
the
room
smirking
but
Harry
hardly
noticed
he
had
just
realized
something
he
could
not
believe
he
had
been
so
stupid
as
to
forget
it
he
had
thought
that
all
the
members
of
the
Order
all
those
who
could
help
him
save
Sirius
were
gone
but
he
had
been
wrong
there
was
still
a
member
of
the
Order
of
the
Phoenix
at
hogwarts
Snape
there
was
silence
in
the
office
except
for
the
fidgetings
and
scufflings
resulting
from
the
slytherins
efforts
to
keep
Ron
and
the
others
under
control
rons
lip
was
bleeding
on
to
umbridges
carpet
as
he
struggled
against
Warringtons
half-nelson
Ginny
was
still
trying
to
stamp
on
the
feet
of
the
sixth-year
girl
who
had
both
her
upper
arms
in
a
tight
grip
Neville
was
turning
steadily
more
purple
in
the
face
while
tugging
at
Crabbes
arms
and
Hermione
was
attempting
in
vain
to
throw
Millicent
Bulstrode
off
her
luna
however
stood
limply
by
the
side
of
her
captor
gazing
vaguely
out
of
the
window
as
though
rather
bored
by
the
proceedings
harry
looked
back
at
Umbridge
who
was
watching
him
closely
he
kept
his
face
deliberately
smooth
and
blank
as
footsteps
were
heard
in
the
corridor
outside
and
Draco
Malfoy
entered
the
room
closely
followed
by
Snape
you
wanted
to
see
me
Headmistress
said
Snape
looking
around
at
all
the
pairs
of
struggling
students
with
an
expression
of
complete
indifference
ah
Professor
Snape
said
Umbridge
smiling
widely
and
standing
up
again
yes
I
would
like
another
bottle
of
Veritaserum
as
quick
as
you
can
please
you
took
my
last
bottle
to
interrogate
Potter
he
said
surveying
her
coolly
through
his
greasy
curtains
of
black
hair
surely
you
did
not
use
it
all
i
told
you
that
three
drops
would
be
sufficient
umbridge
flushed
you
can
make
some
more
cant
you
she
said
her
voice
becoming
more
sweetly
girlish
as
it
always
did
when
she
was
furious
certainly
said
Snape
his
lip
curling
it
takes
a
full
moon-cycle
to
mature
so
I
should
have
it
ready
for
you
in
around
a
month
a
month
squawked
Umbridge
swelling
toadishly
a
month
but
I
need
it
this
evening
snape
i
have
just
found
Potter
using
my
fire
to
communicate
with
a
person
or
persons
unknown
really
said
Snape
showing
his
first
faint
sign
of
interest
as
he
looked
round
at
Harry
well
it
doesnt
surprise
me
potter
has
never
shown
much
inclination
to
follow
school
rules
his
cold
dark
eyes
were
boring
into
Harrys
who
met
his
gaze
unflinchingly
concentrating
hard
on
what
he
had
seen
in
his
dream
willing
Snape
to
read
it
in
his
mind
to
understand
i
wish
to
interrogate
him
repeated
Umbridge
angrily
and
Snape
looked
away
from
Harry
back
into
her
furiously
quivering
face
i
wish
you
to
provide
me
with
a
potion
that
will
force
him
to
tell
me
the
truth
i
have
already
told
you
said
Snape
smoothly
that
I
have
no
further
stocks
of
Veritaserum
unless
you
wish
to
poison
Potter
and
I
assure
you
I
would
have
the
greatest
sympathy
with
you
if
you
did
I
cannot
help
you
the
only
trouble
is
that
most
venoms
act
too
fast
to
give
the
victim
much
time
for
truth-telling
snape
looked
back
at
Harry
who
stared
at
him
frantic
to
communicate
without
words
voldemorts
got
Sirius
in
the
Department
of
Mysteries
he
thought
desperately
voldemorts
got
Sirius
you
are
on
probation
shrieked
Professor
Umbridge
and
Snape
looked
back
at
her
his
eyebrows
slightly
raised
you
are
being
deliberately
unhelpful
i
expected
better
Lucius
Malfoy
always
speaks
most
highly
of
you
now
get
out
of
my
office
snape
gave
her
an
ironic
bow
and
turned
to
leave
harry
knew
his
last
chance
of
letting
the
order
know
what
was
going
on
was
walking
out
of
the
door
hes
got
Padfoot
he
shouted
hes
got
Padfoot
at
the
place
where
its
hidden
snape
had
stopped
with
his
hand
on
Umbridges
door
handle
padfoot
cried
Professor
Umbridge
looking
eagerly
from
Harry
to
Snape
what
is
Padfoot
where
what
is
hidden
what
does
he
mean
Snape
snape
looked
round
at
Harry
his
face
was
inscrutable
harry
could
not
tell
whether
he
had
understood
or
not
but
he
did
not
dare
speak
more
plainly
in
front
of
Umbridge
i
have
no
idea
said
Snape
coldly
potter
when
I
want
nonsense
shouted
at
me
I
shall
give
you
a
Babbling
Beverage
and
Crabbe
loosen
your
hold
a
little
if
Longbottom
suffocates
it
will
mean
a
lot
of
tedious
paperwork
and
I
am
afraid
I
shall
have
to
mention
it
on
your
reference
if
ever
you
apply
for
a
job
he
closed
the
door
behind
him
with
a
snap
leaving
Harry
in
a
state
of
worse
turmoil
than
before
snape
had
been
his
very
last
hope
he
looked
at
Umbridge
who
seemed
to
be
feeling
the
same
way
her
chest
was
heaving
with
rage
and
frustration
very
well
she
said
and
she
pulled
out
her
wand
very
well
i
am
left
with
no
alternative
this
is
more
than
a
matter
of
school
discipline
this
is
an
issue
of
Ministry
security
yes
yes
she
seemed
to
be
talking
herself
into
something
she
was
shifting
her
weight
nervously
from
foot
to
foot
staring
at
Harry
beating
her
wand
against
her
empty
palm
and
breathing
heavily
as
he
watched
her
Harry
felt
horribly
powerless
without
his
own
wand
you
are
forcing
me
Potter
i
do
not
want
to
said
Umbridge
still
moving
restlessly
on
the
spot
but
sometimes
circumstances
justify
the
use
i
am
sure
the
Minister
will
understand
that
I
had
no
choice
malfoy
was
watching
her
with
a
hungry
expression
on
his
face
the
Cruciatus
Curse
ought
to
loosen
your
tongue
said
Umbridge
quietly
no
shrieked
Hermione
professor
Umbridge
its
illegal
but
Umbridge
took
no
notice
there
was
a
nasty
eager
excited
look
on
her
face
that
Harry
had
never
seen
before
she
raised
her
wand
the
Minister
wouldnt
want
you
to
break
the
law
Professor
Umbridge
cried
Hermione
what
Cornelius
doesnt
know
wont
hurt
him
said
Umbridge
who
was
now
panting
slightly
as
she
pointed
her
wand
at
different
parts
of
Harrys
body
in
turn
apparently
trying
to
decide
where
it
would
hurt
most
he
never
knew
I
ordered
Dementors
to
go
after
Potter
last
summer
but
he
was
delighted
to
be
given
the
chance
to
expel
him
all
the
same
it
was
you
gasped
Harry
you
sent
the
Dementors
after
me
somebody
had
to
act
breathed
Umbridge
as
her
wand
came
to
rest
pointing
directly
at
Harrys
forehead
they
were
all
bleating
about
silencing
you
somehow
discrediting
you
but
I
was
the
one
who
actually
did
something
about
it
only
you
wriggled
out
of
that
one
didnt
you
Potter
not
today
though
not
now
And
taking
a
deep
breath
she
cried
Cruc
no
shouted
Hermione
in
a
cracked
voice
from
behind
Millicent
Bulstrode
no
Harry
well
have
to
tell
her
no
way
yelled
Harry
staring
at
the
little
of
Hermione
he
could
see
well
have
to
Harry
shell
force
it
out
of
you
anyway
whats
whats
the
point
and
Hermione
began
to
cry
weakly
into
the
back
of
Millicent
Bulstrodes
robes
millicent
stopped
trying
to
squash
her
against
the
wall
immediately
and
dodged
out
of
her
way
looking
disgusted
well
well
well
said
Umbridge
looking
triumphant
little
Miss
question-all
is
going
to
give
us
some
answers
come
on
then
girl
come
on
er
my
nee
no
shouted
Ron
through
his
gag
ginny
was
staring
at
Hermione
as
though
she
had
never
seen
her
before
neville
still
choking
for
breath
was
gazing
at
her
too
but
Harry
had
just
noticed
something
though
Hermione
was
sobbing
desperately
into
her
hands
there
was
no
trace
of
a
tear
im
Im
sorry

said
Hermione
but
I
cant
stand
it
thats
right
thats
right
girl
said
Umbridge
seizing
Hermione
by
the
shoulders
thrusting
her
into
the
abandoned
chintz
chair
and
leaning
over
her
now
then
with
whom
was
Potter
communicating
just
now
well
gulped
Hermione
into
her
hands
well
he
was
trying
to
speak
to
Professor
Dumbledore
ron
froze
his
eyes
wide
Ginny
stopped
trying
to
stamp
on
her
Slytherin
captors
toes
and
even
luna
looked
mildly
surprised
fortunately
the
attention
of
Umbridge
and
her
minions
was
focused
too
exclusively
upon
Hermione
to
notice
these
suspicious
signs
dumbledore
said
Umbridge
eagerly
you
know
where
Dumbledore
is
then
well
no
sobbed
Hermione
weve
tried
the
Leaky
Cauldron
in
Diagon
Alley
and
the
Three
broomsticks
and
even
the
Hogs
Head
idiot
girl
Dumbledore
wont
be
sitting
in
a
pub
when
the
whole
Ministrys
looking
for
him
shouted
Umbridge
disappointment
etched
in
every
sagging
line
of
her
face
but
but
we
needed
to
tell
him
something
important
wailed
Hermione
holding
her
hands
more
tightly
over
her
face
not
Harry
knew
out
of
anguish
but
to
disguise
the
continued
absence
of
tears
yes
said
Umbridge
with
a
sudden
resurgence
of
excitement
what
was
it
you
wanted
to
tell
him
we
we
wanted
to
tell
him
its
r
ready
choked
H
ermione

ready
demanded
Umbridge
and
now
she
grabbed
Hermiones
shoulders
again
and
shook
her
slightly
whats
ready
girl
the
the
weapon
said
Hermione
weapon
weapon
said
Umbridge
and
her
eyes
seemed
to
pop
with
excitement
you
have
been
developing
some
method
of
resistance
a
weapon
you
could
use
against
the
Ministry
on
professor
Dumbledores
orders
of
course
y
y
yes
gasped
Hermione
but
he
had
to
leave
before
it
was
finished
and
n
n
now
weve
finished
it
for
him
and
we
c
c
cant
find
him
t
t
to
tell
him
what
kind
of
weapon
is
it
said
Umbridge
harshly
her
stubby
hands
still
tight
on
Hermiones
shoulders
we
dont
r
r
really
understand
it
said
Hermione
sniffing
loudly
we
j
j
just
did
what
P
P
Professor
Dumbledore
told
us
t
t
to
do
umbridge
straightened
up
looking
exultant
lead
me
to
the
weapon
she
said
im
not
showing
them
said
Hermione
shrilly
looking
around
at
the
Slytherins
through
her
fingers
it
is
not
for
you
to
set
conditions
said
Professor
Umbridge
harshly
fine
said
Hermione
now
sobbing
into
her
hands
again
fine
let
them
see
it
I
hope
they
use
it
on
you
in
fact
I
wish
youd
invite
loads
and
loads
of
people
to
come
and
see
th
that
would
serve
you
right
oh
Id
love
it
if
the
wh
whole
school
knew
where
it
was
and
how
to
u
use
it
and
then
if
you
annoy
any
of
them
theyll
be
able
to
s
sort
you
out
these
words
had
a
powerful
impact
on
Umbridge
she
glanced
swiftly
and
suspiciously
around
at
her
Inquisitorial
Squad
her
bulging
eyes
resting
for
a
moment
on
Malfoy
who
was
too
slow
to
disguise
the
look
of
eagerness
and
greed
that
had
appeared
on
his
face
umbridge
contemplated
Hermione
for
another
long
moment
then
spoke
in
what
she
clearly
thought
was
a
motherly
voice
all
right
dear
lets
make
it
just
you
and
me
and
well
take
Potter
too
shall
we
get
up
now
professor
said
Malfoy
eagerly
Professor
Umbridge
I
think
some
of
the
Squad
should
come
with
you
to
look
after
i
am
a
fully
qualified
Ministry
official
Malfoy
do
you
really
think
I
cannot
manage
two
wandless
teenagers
alone
asked
Umbridge
sharply
in
any
case
it
does
not
sound
as
though
this
weapon
is
something
that
schoolchildren
should
see
you
will
remain
here
until
I
return
and
make
sure
none
of
these
she
gestured
around
at
Ron
Ginny
Neville
and
Luna
escape
all
right
said
Malfoy
looking
sulky
and
disappointed
and
you
two
can
go
ahead
of
me
and
show
me
the
way
said
Umbridge
pointing
at
Harry
and
hermione
with
her
wand
lead
on
chapter
thirty-three
fight
and
Flight
harry
had
no
idea
what
Hermione
was
planning
or
even
whether
she
had
a
plan
he
walked
half
a
pace
behind
her
as
they
headed
down
the
corridor
outside
Umbridges
office
knowing
it
would
look
very
suspicious
if
he
appeared
not
to
know
where
they
were
going
he
did
not
dare
attempt
to
talk
to
her
Umbridge
was
walking
so
closely
behind
them
that
he
could
hear
her
ragged
breathing
hermione
led
the
way
down
the
stairs
into
the
Entrance
Hall
the
din
of
loud
voices
and
the
clatter
of
cutlery
on
plates
echoed
from
out
of
the
double
doors
to
the
Great
Hall
it
seemed
incredible
to
Harry
that
twenty
feet
away
were
people
who
were
enjoying
dinner
celebrating
the
end
of
exams
not
a
care
in
the
world
hermione
walked
straight
out
of
the
oak
front
doors
and
down
the
stone
steps
into
the
balmy
evening
air
the
sun
was
falling
towards
the
tops
of
the
trees
in
the
Forbidden
Forest
now
and
as
hermione
marched
purposefully
across
the
grass
Umbridge
jogging
to
keep
up
their
long
dark
shadows
rippled
over
the
grass
behind
them
like
cloaks
its
hidden
in
Hagrids
hut
is
it
said
Umbridge
eagerly
in
Harrys
ear
of
course
not
said
Hermione
scathingly
hagrid
might
have
set
it
off
accidentally
yes
said
Umbridge
whose
excitement
seemed
to
be
mounting
yes
he
would
have
done
of
course
the
great
half-breed
oaf
she
laughed
harry
felt
a
strong
urge
to
swing
round
and
seize
her
by
the
throat
but
resisted
his
scar
was
throbbing
in
the
soft
evening
air
but
it
had
not
yet
burned
white-hot
as
he
knew
it
would
if
Voldemort
had
moved
in
for
the
kill
then
where
is
it
asked
Umbridge
with
a
hint
of
uncertainty
in
her
voice
as
Hermione
continued
to
stride
towards
the
Forest
in
there
of
course
said
Hermione
pointing
into
the
dark
trees
it
had
to
be
somewhere
that
students
werent
going
to
find
it
accidentally
didnt
it
of
course
said
Umbridge
though
she
sounded
a
little
apprehensive
now
of
course
very
well
then
you
two
stay
ahead
of
me
can
we
have
your
wand
then
if
were
going
first
harry
asked
her
no
I
dont
think
so
mr.
Potter
said
Umbridge
sweetly
poking
him
in
the
back
with
it
the
ministry
places
a
rather
higher
value
on
my
life
than
yours
Im
afraid
as
they
reached
the
cool
shade
of
the
first
trees
Harry
tried
to
catch
Hermiones
eye
walking
into
the
Forest
without
wands
seemed
to
him
to
be
more
foolhardy
than
anything
they
had
done
so
far
this
evening
she
however
merely
gave
Umbridge
a
contemptuous
glance
and
plunged
straight
into
the
trees
moving
at
such
a
pace
that
Umbridge
with
her
shorter
legs
had
difficulty
in
keeping
up
is
it
very
far
in
umbridge
asked
as
her
robe
ripped
on
a
bramble
oh
yes
said
Hermione
yes
its
well
hidden
harrys
misgivings
increased
hermione
was
not
taking
the
path
they
had
followed
to
visit
grawp
but
the
one
he
followed
three
years
ago
to
the
lair
of
the
monster
Aragog
hermione
had
not
been
with
him
on
that
occasion
he
doubted
she
had
any
idea
what
danger
lay
at
the
end
of
it
er
are
you
sure
this
is
the
right
way
he
asked
her
pointedly
oh
yes
she
said
in
a
steely
voice
crashing
through
the
undergrowth
with
what
he
thought
was
a
wholly
unnecessary
amount
of
noise
behind
them
Umbridge
tripped
over
a
fallen
sapling
neither
of
them
paused
to
help
her
up
again
Hermione
merely
strode
on
calling
loudly
over
her
shoulder
Its
a
bit
further
in
hermione
keep
your
voice
down
Harry
muttered
hurrying
to
catch
up
with
her
anything
could
be
listening
in
here
i
want
us
heard
she
answered
quietly
as
Umbridge
jogged
noisily
after
them
youll
see
they
walked
on
for
what
seemed
a
long
time
until
they
were
once
again
so
deep
into
the
Forest
that
the
dense
tree
canopy
blocked
out
all
light
harry
had
the
feeling
he
had
had
before
in
the
forest
one
of
being
watched
by
unseen
eyes
how
much
further
demanded
Umbridge
angrily
from
behind
him
not
far
now
shouted
Hermione
as
they
emerged
into
a
dim
dank
clearing
just
a
little
bit
an
arrow
flew
through
the
air
and
landed
with
a
menacing
thud
in
the
tree
just
over
her
head
the
air
was
suddenly
full
of
the
sound
of
hooves
Harry
could
feel
the
Forest
floor
trembling
umbridge
gave
a
little
scream
and
pushed
him
in
front
of
her
like
a
shield
he
wrenched
himself
free
of
her
and
turned
around
fifty
centaurs
were
emerging
on
every
side
their
bows
raised
and
loaded
pointing
at
Harry
Hermione
and
Umbridge
they
backed
slowly
into
the
center
of
the
clearing
Umbridge
uttering
odd
little
whimpers
of
terror
harry
looked
sideways
at
Hermione
she
was
wearing
a
triumphant
smile
who
are
you
said
a
voice
harry
looked
left
the
chestnut-bodied
centaur
called
Magorian
was
walking
towards
them
out
of
the
circle
his
bow
like
those
of
the
others
was
raised
on
Harrys
right
Umbridge
was
still
whimpering
her
wand
trembling
violently
as
she
pointed
it
at
the
advancing
centaur
i
asked
you
who
are
you
human
said
Magorian
rou
ghly
i
am
Dolores
Umbridge
said
Umbridge
in
a
high-p
i
tched
terrified
voice
senior
undersecretary
to
the
Minister
for
Magic
and
Headmistress
and
High
Inquisitor
of
Hogwarts
you
are
from
the
Ministry
of
Magic
said
Magorian
as
many
of
the
centaurs
in
the
surrounding
circle
shifted
restlessly
thats
right
said
Umbridge
in
an
even
higher
voice
so
be
very
careful
by
the
laws
laid
down
by
the
Department
for
the
Regulation
and
Control
of
Magical
Creatures
any
attack
by
half-breeds
such
as
yourselves
on
a
human
what
did
you
call
us
shouted
a
wild-looking
black
centaur
whom
Harry
recognized
as
Bane
there
was
a
great
deal
of
angry
muttering
and
tightening
of
bowstrings
around
them
dont
call
them
that
hermione
said
furiously
but
Umbridge
did
not
appear
to
have
heard
her
still
pointing
her
shaking
wand
at
Magorian
she
continued
Law
Fifteen
B
states
clearly
that
any
attack
by
a
magical
creature
who
is
deemed
to
have
near-human
intelligence
and
therefore
considered
responsible
for
its
actions
near-human
intelligence
repeated
Magorian
as
Bane
and
several
others
roared
with
rage
and
pawed
the
ground
we
consider
that
a
great
insult
human
our
intelligence
thankfully
far
outstrips
your
own
what
are
you
doing
in
our
Forest
bellowed
the
hard-faced
grey
centaur
Harry
and
Hermione
had
seen
on
their
last
trip
into
the
Forest
why
are
you
here
your
Forest
said
Umbridge
shaking
now
not
only
with
fright
but
also
it
seemed
with
indignation
i
would
remind
you
that
you
live
here
only
because
the
Ministry
of
Magic
permits
you
certain
areas
of
land
an
arrow
flew
so
close
to
her
head
that
it
caught
at
her
mousy
hair
in
passing
she
let
out
an
earsplitting
scream
and
threw
her
hands
over
her
head
while
some
of
the
centaurs
bellowed
their
approval
and
others
laughed
raucously
the
sound
of
their
wild
neighing
laughter
echoing
around
the
dimly
lit
clearing
and
the
sight
of
their
pawing
hooves
was
extremely
unnerving
whose
Forest
is
it
now
human
bellowed
Bane
filthy
half-breeds
she
screamed
her
hands
still
tight
over
her
head
beasts
uncontrolled
animals
be
quiet
shouted
Hermione
but
it
was
too
late
Umbridge
pointed
her
wand
at
Magorian
and
screamed
Incarcerous
ropes
flew
out
of
midair
like
thick
snakes
wrapping
themselves
tightly
around
the
centaurs
torso
and
trapping
his
arms
he
gave
a
cry
of
rage
and
reared
on
to
his
hind
legs
attempting
to
free
himself
while
the
other
centaurs
charged
harry
grabbed
Hermione
and
pulled
her
to
the
ground
face
down
on
the
Forest
floor
he
knew
a
moment
of
terror
as
hooves
thundered
around
him
but
the
centaurs
leapt
over
and
around
them
bellowing
and
screaming
with
rage
nooooo
he
heard
Umbridge
shriek
noooooo
i
am
Senior
Undersecretary
you
cannot
unhand
me
you
animals
nooooo
harry
saw
a
flash
of
red
light
and
knew
she
had
attempted
to
Stun
one
of
them
then
she
screamed
very
loudly
lifting
his
head
a
few
inches
Harry
saw
that
Umbridge
had
been
seized
from
behind
by
Bane
and
lifted
high
into
the
air
wriggling
and
yelling
with
fright
her
wand
fell
from
her
hand
to
the
ground
and
Harrys
heart
leapt
if
he
could
just
reach
it
but
as
he
stretched
out
a
hand
towards
it
a
centaurs
hoof
descended
upon
the
wand
and
it
broke
cleanly
in
half
now
roared
a
voice
in
Harrys
ear
and
a
thick
hairy
arm
descended
from
thin
air
and
dragged
him
upright
hermione
too
had
been
pulled
to
her
feet
over
the
plunging
many-colored
backs
and
heads
of
the
centaurs
Harry
saw
Umbridge
being
borne
away
through
the
trees
by
Bane
screaming
non-stop
her
voice
grew
fainter
and
fainter
until
they
could
no
longer
hear
it
over
the
trampling
of
hooves
surrounding
them
and
these
said
the
hard-faced
grey
centaur
holding
Hermione
they
are
young
said
a
slow
doleful
voice
from
behind
Harry
we
do
not
attack
foals
they
brought
her
here
Ronan
replied
the
centaur
who
had
such
a
firm
grip
on
Harry
and
they
are
not
so
young
he
is
nearing
manhood
this
one
he
shook
Harry
by
the
neck
of
his
robes
please
said
Hermione
breathlessly
please
dont
attack
us
we
dont
think
like
her
we
arent
ministry
of
Magic
employees
we
only
came
in
here
because
we
hoped
youd
drive
her
off
for
us
harry
knew
at
once
from
the
look
on
the
face
of
the
grey
centaur
holding
Hermione
that
she
had
made
a
terrible
mistake
in
saying
this
the
grey
centaur
threw
back
his
head
his
back
legs
stamping
furiously
and
bellowed
You
see
Ronan
they
already
have
the
arrogance
of
their
kind
so
we
were
to
do
your
dirty
work
were
we
human
girl
we
were
to
act
as
your
servants
drive
away
your
enemies
like
obedient
hounds
no
said
Hermione
in
a
horrorstruck
squeak
please
I
didnt
mean
that
i
just
hoped
youd
be
able
to
to
help
us
but
she
seemed
to
be
going
from
bad
to
worse
we
do
not
help
humans
snarled
the
centaur
holding
Harry
tightening
his
grip
and
rearing
a
little
at
the
same
time
so
that
Harrys
feet
left
the
ground
momentarily
we
are
a
race
apart
and
proud
to
be
so
we
will
not
permit
you
to
walk
from
here
boasting
that
we
did
your
bidding
were
not
going
to
say
anything
like
that
harry
shouted
we
know
you
didnt
do
what
you
did
because
we
wanted
you
to
but
nobody
seemed
to
be
listening
to
him
a
bearded
centaur
towards
the
back
of
the
crowd
shouted
They
came
here
unasked
they
must
pay
the
consequences
a
roar
of
approval
met
these
words
and
a
dun-colored
centaur
shouted
They
can
join
the
woman
you
said
you
didnt
hurt
the
innocent
shouted
Hermione
real
tears
sliding
down
her
face
now
we
havent
done
anything
to
hurt
you
we
havent
used
wands
or
threats
we
just
want
to
go
back
to
school
please
let
us
go
back
we
are
not
all
like
the
traitor
Firenze
human
girl
shouted
the
grey
centaur
to
more
neighing
roars
of
approval
from
his
fellows
perhaps
you
thought
us
pretty
talking
horses
we
are
an
ancient
people
who
will
not
stand
wizard
invasions
and
insults
we
do
not
recognize
your
laws
we
do
not
acknowledge
your
superiority
we
are
but
they
did
not
hear
what
else
centaurs
were
for
at
that
moment
there
came
a
crashing
noise
on
the
edge
of
the
clearing
so
loud
that
all
of
them
Harry
Hermione
and
the
fifty
or
so
centaurs
filling
the
clearing
looked
around
harrys
centaur
let
him
fall
to
the
ground
again
as
his
hands
flew
to
his
bow
and
quiver
of
arrows
hermione
had
been
dropped
too
and
Harry
hurried
towards
her
as
two
thick
tree
trunks
parted
ominously
and
the
monstrous
form
of
Grawp
the
giant
appeared
in
the
gap
the
centaurs
nearest
him
backed
into
those
behind
the
clearing
was
now
a
forest
of
bows
and
arrows
waiting
to
be
fired
all
pointing
upwards
at
the
enormous
greyish
face
now
looming
over
them
from
just
beneath
the
thick
canopy
of
branches
grawps
lopsided
mouth
was
gaping
stupidly
they
could
see
his
bricklike
yellow
teeth
glimmering
in
the
half-light
his
dull
sludgecolored
eyes
narrowed
as
he
squinted
down
at
the
creatures
at
his
feet
broken
ropes
trailed
from
both
ankles
he
opened
his
mouth
even
wider
hagger
harry
did
not
know
what
hagger
meant
or
what
language
it
was
from
nor
did
he
much
care
he
was
watching
Grawps
feet
which
were
almost
as
long
as
Harrys
whole
body
hermione
gripped
his
arm
tightly
the
centaurs
were
quite
silent
staring
up
at
the
giant
whose
huge
round
head
moved
from
side
to
side
as
he
continued
to
peer
amongst
them
as
though
looking
for
something
he
had
dropped
hagger
he
said
again
more
insistently
get
away
from
here
giant
called
Magorian
you
are
not
welcome
among
us
these
words
seemed
to
make
no
impression
whatsoever
on
Grawp
he
stooped
a
little
the
centaurs
arms
tensed
on
their
bows
then
bellowed
hagger
a
few
of
the
centaurs
looked
worried
now
hermione
however
gave
a
gasp
harry
she
whispered
i
think
hes
trying
to
say
Hagrid
at
this
precise
moment
Grawp
caught
sight
of
them
the
only
two
humans
in
a
sea
of
centaurs
he
lowered
his
head
another
foot
or
so
staring
intently
at
them
harry
could
feel
Hermione
shaking
as
Grawp
opened
his
mouth
wide
again
and
said
in
a
deep
rumbling
voice
Hermy
goodness
said
Hermione
gripping
Harrys
arm
so
tightly
it
was
growing
numb
and
looking
as
though
she
was
about
to
faint
he
he
remembered
hermy
roared
Grawp
where
hagger
i
dont
know
squealed
Hermione
terrified
im
sorry
Grawp
I
dont
know
grawp
want
hagger
one
of
the
giants
massive
hands
reached
down
hermione
let
out
a
real
scream
ran
a
few
steps
backwards
and
fell
over
devoid
of
a
wand
Harry
braced
himself
to
punch
kick
bite
or
whatever
else
it
took
as
the
hand
swooped
towards
him
and
knocked
a
snow-white
centaur
off
his
legs
it
was
what
the
centaurs
had
been
waiting
for
Grawps
outstretched
fingers
were
a
foot
from
harry
when
fifty
arrows
soared
through
the
air
at
the
giant
peppering
his
enormous
face
causing
him
to
howl
with
pain
and
rage
and
straighten
up
rubbing
his
face
with
his
enormous
hands
breaking
off
the
arrow
shafts
but
forcing
the
arrowheads
in
still
deeper
he
yelled
and
stamped
his
enormous
feet
and
the
centaurs
scattered
out
of
the
way
pebble-sized
droplets
of
Grawps
blood
showered
Harry
as
he
pulled
Hermione
to
her
feet
and
the
pair
of
them
ran
as
fast
as
they
could
for
the
shelter
of
the
trees
once
there
they
looked
back
Grawp
was
snatching
blindly
at
the
centaurs
as
blood
ran
down
his
face
they
were
retreating
in
disorder
galloping
away
through
the
trees
on
the
other
side
of
the
clearing
harry
and
Hermione
watched
Grawp
give
another
roar
of
fury
and
plunge
after
them
smashing
more
trees
aside
as
he
went
oh
no
said
Hermione
quaking
so
badly
that
her
knees
gave
way
oh
that
was
horrible
and
he
might
kill
them
all
im
not
that
fussed
to
be
honest
said
Harry
bitterly
the
sounds
of
the
galloping
centaurs
and
the
blundering
giant
grew
fainter
and
fainter
as
Harry
listened
to
them
his
scar
gave
another
great
throb
and
a
wave
of
terror
swept
over
him
they
had
wasted
so
much
time
they
were
even
further
from
rescuing
Sirius
than
they
had
been
when
he
had
had
the
vision
not
only
had
Harry
managed
to
lose
his
wand
but
they
were
stuck
in
the
middle
of
the
Forbidden
Forest
with
no
means
of
transport
whatsoever
smart
plan
he
spat
at
Hermione
having
to
release
some
of
his
fury
really
smart
plan
where
do
we
go
from
here
we
need
to
get
back
up
to
the
castle
said
Hermione
faintly
by
the
time
weve
done
that
Siriusll
probably
be
dead
said
Harry
kicking
a
nearby
tree
in
temper
a
high-pitched
chattering
started
up
overhead
and
he
looked
up
to
see
an
angry
bowtruckle
flexing
its
long
twiglike
fingers
at
him
well
we
cant
do
anything
without
wands
said
Hermione
hopelessly
dragging
herself
up
again
anyway
Harry
how
exactly
were
you
planning
to
get
all
the
way
to
London
yeah
we
were
just
wondering
that
said
a
familiar
voice
from
behind
her
harry
and
Hermione
moved
together
instinctively
and
peered
through
the
trees
ron
came
into
sight
closely
followed
by
Ginny
Neville
and
Luna
all
of
them
looked
a
little
the
worse
for
wear
there
were
several
long
scratches
running
the
length
of
Ginnys
cheek
a
large
purple
lump
was
swelling
above
Nevilles
right
eye
Rons
lip
was
bleeding
worse
than
ever
but
all
were
looking
rather
pleased
with
themselves
so
said
Ron
pushing
aside
a
low-hanging
branch
and
holding
out
Harrys
wand
had
any
ideas
how
did
you
get
away
asked
Harry
in
amazement
taking
his
wand
from
Ron
couple
of
Stunners
a
Disarming
Charm
Neville
brought
off
a
really
nice
little
Impediment
jinx
said
Ron
airily
now
handing
back
Hermiones
wand
too
but
Ginny
was
best
she
got
malfoy
Bat
Bogey
Hex
it
was
superb
his
whole
face
was
covered
in
the
great
flapping
things
anyway
we
saw
you
out
of
the
window
heading
into
the
Forest
and
followed
whatve
you
done
with
Umbridge
she
got
carried
away
said
Harry
by
a
herd
of
centaurs
and
they
left
you
behind
asked
Ginny
looking
astonished
no
they
got
chased
off
by
Grawp
said
Harry
whos
Grawp
luna
asked
interestedly
hagrids
little
brother
said
Ron
promptly
anyway
never
mind
that
now
harry
what
did
you
find
out
in
the
fire
has
You-Know-Who
got
Sirius
or
yes
said
Harry
as
his
scar
gave
another
painful
prickle
and
Im
sure
Sirius
is
still
alive
but
I
cant
see
how
were
going
to
get
there
to
help
him
they
all
fell
silent
looking
rather
scared
the
problem
facing
them
seemed
insurmountable
well
well
have
to
fly
wont
we
said
Luna
in
the
closest
thing
to
a
matter-of-fact
voice
harry
had
ever
heard
her
use
okay
said
Harry
irritably
rounding
on
her
first
of
all
we
arent
doing
anything
if
youre
including
yourself
in
that
and
second
of
all
Rons
the
only
one
with
a
broomstick
that
isnt
being
guarded
by
a
security
troll
so
ive
got
a
broom
said
Ginny
yeah
but
youre
not
coming
said
Ron
angrily
excuse
me
but
I
care
what
happens
to
Sirius
as
much
as
you
do
said
Ginny
her
jaw
set
so
that
her
resemblance
to
Fred
and
George
was
suddenly
striking
youre
too
Harry
began
but
Ginny
said
fiercely
Im
three
years
older
than
you
were
when
you
fought
You-Know-Who
over
the
Sorcerers
Stone
and
its
because
of
me
that
Malfoys
stuck
back
in
Umbridges
office
with
giant
flying
bogies
attacking
him
yeah
but
we
were
all
in
the
D
a
together
said
Neville
quietly
it
was
all
supposed
to
be
about
fighting
you-Know-Who
wasnt
it
and
this
is
the
first
chance
weve
had
to
do
something
real
or
was
that
all
just
a
game
or
something
no
of
course
it
wasnt
said
Harry
impatiently
then
we
should
come
too
said
Neville
simply
we
want
to
help
thats
right
said
Luna
smiling
happily
harrys
eyes
met
Rons
he
knew
Ron
was
thinking
exactly
what
he
was
if
he
could
have
chosen
any
members
of
the
D
a.
in
addition
to
himself
Ron
and
Hermione
to
join
him
in
the
attempt
to
rescue
Sirius
he
would
not
have
picked
Ginny
Neville
or
Luna
well
it
doesnt
matter
anyway
said
Harry
through
gritted
teeth
because
we
still
dont
know
how
to
get
there
i
thought
wed
settled
that
said
Luna
maddeningly
were
flying
look
said
Ron
barely
containing
his
anger
you
might
be
able
to
fly
without
a
broomstick
but
the
rest
of
us
cant
sprout
wings
whenever
we
there
are
ways
of
flying
other
than
with
broomsticks
said
Luna
serenely
i
spose
were
going
to
ride
on
the
back
of
the
Kacky
Snorgle
or
whatever
it
is
ron
demanded
the
Crumple-Horned
Snorkack
cant
fly
said
Luna
in
a
dignified
voice
but
they
can
and
hagrid
says
theyre
very
good
at
finding
places
their
riders
are
looking
for
harry
whirled
round
standing
between
two
trees
their
white
eyes
gleaming
eerily
were
two
thestrals
watching
the
whispered
conversation
as
though
they
understood
every
word
yes
he
whispered
moving
towards
them
they
tossed
their
reptilian
heads
throwing
back
long
black
manes
and
Harry
stretched
out
his
hand
eagerly
and
patted
the
nearest
ones
shining
neck
how
could
he
ever
have
thought
them
ugly
is
it
those
mad
horse
things
said
Ron
uncertainly
staring
at
a
point
slightly
to
the
left
of
the
thestral
Harry
was
patting
those
ones
you
cant
see
unless
youve
watched
someone
snuff
it
yeah
said
Harry
how
many
just
two
well
we
need
three
said
Hermione
who
was
still
looking
a
little
shaken
but
determined
just
the
same
four
Hermione
said
Ginny
scowling
i
think
there
are
six
of
us
actually
said
Luna
calmly
counting
dont
be
stupid
we
cant
all
go
said
Harry
angrily
look
you
three
he
pointed
at
Neville
ginny
and
Luna
youre
not
involved
in
this
youre
not
they
burst
into
more
protests
his
scar
gave
another
more
painful
twinge
every
moment
they
delayed
was
precious
he
did
not
have
time
to
argue
okay
fine
its
your
choice
he
said
curtly
but
unless
we
can
find
more
Thestrals
youre
not
going
to
be
able
oh
more
of
them
will
come
said
Ginny
confidently
who
like
Ron
was
squinting
in
quite
the
wrong
direction
apparently
under
the
impression
that
she
was
looking
at
the
horses
what
makes
you
think
that
because
in
case
you
hadnt
noticed
you
and
Hermione
are
both
covered
in
blood
she
said
coolly
and
we
know
Hagrid
lures
Thestrals
with
raw
meat
thats
probably
why
these
two
turned
up
in
the
first
place
harry
felt
a
soft
tug
on
his
robes
at
that
moment
and
looked
down
to
see
the
closest
Thestral
licking
his
sleeve
which
was
damp
with
Grawps
blood
okay
then
he
said
a
bright
idea
occurring
Ron
and
I
will
take
these
two
and
go
ahead
and
hermione
can
stay
here
with
you
three
and
shell
attract
more
Thestrals
im
not
staying
behind
said
Hermione
furiously
theres
no
need
said
Luna
smiling
look
here
come
more
now
you
two
must
really
smell
harry
turned
no
fewer
than
six
or
seven
Thestrals
were
picking
their
way
through
the
trees
their
great
leathery
wings
folded
tight
to
their
bodies
their
eyes
gleaming
through
the
darkness
he
had
no
excuse
now
all
right
he
said
angrily
pick
one
and
get
on
then
chapter
thirty-four
the
Department
of
Mysteries
harry
wound
his
hand
tightly
into
the
mane
of
the
nearest
Thestral
placed
a
foot
on
a
stump
nearby
and
scrambled
clumsily
on
to
the
horses
silken
back
it
did
not
object
but
twisted
its
head
around
fangs
bared
and
attempted
to
continue
its
eager
licking
of
his
robes
he
found
there
was
a
way
of
lodging
his
knees
behind
the
wing
joints
that
made
him
feel
more
secure
then
looked
around
at
the
others
neville
had
heaved
himself
over
the
back
of
the
next
thestral
and
was
now
attempting
to
swing
one
short
leg
over
the
creatures
back
luna
was
already
in
place
sitting
side-saddle
and
adjusting
her
robes
as
though
she
did
this
every
day
ron
Hermione
and
Ginny
however
were
still
standing
motionless
on
the
spot
open-mouthed
and
staring
what
he
said
howre
we
supposed
to
get
on
said
Ron
faintly
when
we
cant
see
the
things
oh
its
easy
said
Luna
sliding
obligingly
from
her
Thestral
and
marching
over
to
him
hermione
and
Ginny
come
here
she
pulled
them
over
to
the
other
Thestrals
standing
around
and
one
by
one
managed
to
help
them
on
to
the
back
of
their
mount
all
three
looked
extremely
nervous
as
she
wound
their
hands
into
their
horses
mane
and
told
them
to
grip
tightly
before
she
got
back
on
to
her
own
steed
this
is
mad
Ron
murmured
moving
his
free
hand
gingerly
up
and
down
his
horses
neck
mad
if
I
could
just
see
it
youd
better
hope
it
stays
invisible
said
Harry
darkly
we
all
ready
then
they
all
nodded
and
he
saw
five
pairs
of
knees
tighten
beneath
their
robes
okay
he
looked
down
at
the
back
of
his
Thestrals
glossy
black
head
and
swallowed
ministry
of
Magic
visitors
entrance
London
then
he
said
uncertainly
er
if
you
know
where
to
go
for
a
moment
Harrys
Thestral
did
nothing
at
all
then
with
a
sweeping
movement
that
nearly
unseated
him
the
wings
on
either
side
extended
the
horse
crouched
slowly
then
rocketed
upwards
so
fast
and
so
steeply
that
Harry
had
to
clench
his
arms
and
legs
tightly
around
the
horse
to
avoid
sliding
backwards
over
its
bony
rump
he
closed
his
eyes
and
pressed
his
face
down
into
the
horses
silky
mane
as
they
burst
through
the
topmost
branches
of
the
trees
and
soared
out
into
a
blood-red
sunset
harry
did
not
think
he
had
ever
moved
so
fast
the
Thestral
streaked
over
the
castle
its
wide
wings
hardly
beating
the
cooling
air
was
slapping
Harrys
face
eyes
screwed
up
against
the
rushing
wind
he
looked
round
and
saw
his
five
fellows
soaring
along
behind
him
each
of
them
bent
as
low
as
possible
into
the
neck
of
their
Thestral
to
protect
themselves
from
his
slipstream
they
were
over
the
Hogwarts
grounds
they
had
passed
Hogsmeade
Harry
could
see
mountains
and
gullies
below
them
as
the
daylight
began
to
fail
Harry
saw
small
collections
of
lights
as
they
passed
over
more
villages
then
a
winding
road
on
which
a
single
car
was
beetling
its
way
home
through
the
hills
this
is
bizarre
harry
barely
heard
Ron
yell
from
somewhere
behind
him
and
he
imagined
how
it
must
feel
to
be
speeding
along
at
this
height
with
no
visible
means
of
support
twilight
fell
the
sky
was
turning
to
a
light
dusky
purple
littered
with
tiny
silver
stars
and
soon
only
the
lights
of
Muggle
towns
gave
them
any
clue
of
how
far
from
the
ground
they
were
or
how
very
fast
they
were
traveling
harrys
arms
were
wrapped
tightly
around
his
horses
neck
as
he
willed
it
to
go
even
faster
how
much
time
had
elapsed
since
he
had
seen
Sirius
lying
on
the
department
of
Mysteries
floor
how
much
longer
would
Sinus
be
able
to
resist
Voldemort
all
harry
knew
for
sure
was
that
his
godfather
had
neither
done
as
Voldemort
wanted
nor
died
for
he
was
convinced
that
either
outcome
would
have
caused
him
to
feel
Voldemorts
jubilation
or
fury
course
through
his
own
body
making
his
scar
sear
as
painfully
as
it
had
on
the
night
Mr
weasley
was
attacked
on
they
flew
through
the
gathering
darkness
Harrys
face
felt
stiff
and
cold
his
legs
numb
from
gripping
the
Thestrals
sides
so
tightly
but
he
did
not
dare
shift
his
position
lest
he
slip
he
was
deaf
from
the
thundering
rush
of
air
in
his
ears
and
his
mouth
was
dry
and
frozen
from
the
cold
night
wind
he
had
lost
all
sense
of
how
far
they
had
come
all
his
faith
was
in
the
beast
beneath
him
still
streaking
purposefully
through
the
night
barely
flapping
its
wings
as
it
sped
ever
onwards
if
they
were
too
late
hes
still
alive
hes
still
fighting
I
can
feel
it
if
Voldemort
decided
Sirius
was
not
going
to
crack
id
know
harrys
stomach
gave
a
jolt
the
Thestrals
head
was
suddenly
pointing
towards
the
ground
and
he
actually
slid
forwards
a
few
inches
along
its
neck
they
were
descending
at
last
he
thought
he
heard
a
shriek
behind
him
and
twisted
around
dangerously
but
could
see
no
sign
of
a
falling
body
presumably
they
had
all
received
a
shock
from
the
change
of
direction
just
as
he
had
and
now
bright
orange
lights
were
growing
larger
and
rounder
on
all
sides
they
could
see
the
tops
of
buildings
streams
of
headlights
like
luminous
insect
eyes
squares
of
pale
yellow
that
were
windows
quite
suddenly
it
seemed
they
were
hurtling
towards
the
pavement
Harry
gripped
the
Thestral
with
every
last
ounce
of
his
strength
braced
for
a
sudden
impact
but
the
horse
touched
the
dark
ground
as
lightly
as
a
shadow
and
Harry
slid
from
its
back
looking
around
at
the
street
where
the
overflowing
skip
still
stood
a
short
way
from
the
vandalized
telephone
box
both
drained
of
color
in
the
flat
orange
glare
of
the
streetlights
ron
landed
a
short
way
off
and
toppled
immediately
from
his
Thestral
on
to
the
pavement
never
again
he
said
struggling
to
his
feet
he
made
as
though
to
stride
away
from
his
thestral
but
unable
to
see
it
collided
with
its
hindquarters
and
almost
fell
over
again
never
ever
again
that
was
the
worst
hermione
and
Ginny
touched
down
on
either
side
of
him
both
slid
off
their
mounts
a
little
more
gracefully
than
Ron
though
with
similar
expressions
of
relief
at
being
back
on
firm
ground
neville
jumped
down
shaking
and
Luna
dismounted
smoothly
where
do
we
go
from
here
then
she
asked
Harry
in
a
politely
interested
voice
as
though
this
was
all
a
rather
interesting
day-trip
over
here
he
said
he
gave
his
Thestral
a
quick
grateful
pat
then
led
the
way
quickly
to
the
battered
telephone
box
and
opened
the
door
come
on
he
urged
the
others
as
they
hesitated
ron
and
Ginny
marched
in
obediently
Hermione
Neville
and
Luna
squashed
themselves
in
after
them
Harry
took
one
glance
back
at
the
Thestrals
now
foraging
for
scraps
of
rotten
food
inside
the
skip
then
forced
himself
into
the
box
after
Luna
whoevers
nearest
the
receiver
dial
six
two
four
four
two
he
said
ron
did
it
his
arm
bent
bizarrely
to
reach
the
dial
as
it
whirred
back
into
place
the
cool
female
voice
sounded
inside
the
box
welcome
to
the
Ministry
of
Magic
please
state
your
name
and
business
harry
Potter
Ron
Weasley
Hermione
Granger
Harry
said
very
quickly
Ginny
Weasley
neville
Longbottom
Luna
Lovegood
were
here
to
save
someone
unless
your
Ministry
can
do
it
first
thank
you
said
the
cool
female
voice
visitors
please
take
the
badges
and
attach
them
to
the
front
of
your
robes
half
a
dozen
badges
slid
out
of
the
metal
chute
where
returned
coins
normally
appeared
hermione
scooped
them
up
and
handed
them
mutely
to
Harry
over
Ginnys
head
he
glanced
at
the
topmost
one
Harry
Potter
Rescue
Mission
visitors
to
the
Ministry
you
are
required
to
submit
to
a
search
and
present
your
wands
for
registration
at
the
security
desk
which
is
located
at
the
far
end
of
the
Atrium
fine
harry
said
loudly
as
his
scar
gave
another
throb
now
can
we
move
the
floor
of
the
telephone
box
shuddered
and
the
pavement
rose
up
past
its
glass
windows
the
scavenging
Thestrals
were
sliding
out
of
sight
blackness
closed
over
their
heads
and
with
a
dull
grinding
noise
they
sank
down
into
the
depths
of
the
Ministry
of
Magic
a
chink
of
soft
golden
light
hit
their
feet
and
widening
rose
up
their
bodies
harry
bent
his
knees
and
held
his
wand
as
ready
as
he
could
in
such
cramped
conditions
as
he
peered
through
the
glass
to
see
whether
anybody
was
waiting
for
them
in
the
Atrium
but
it
seemed
to
be
completely
empty
the
light
was
dimmer
than
it
had
been
by
day
there
were
no
fires
burning
under
the
mantelpieces
set
into
the
walls
but
as
the
lift
slid
smoothly
to
a
halt
he
saw
that
golden
symbols
continued
to
twist
sinuously
in
the
dark
blue
ceiling
the
Ministry
of
Magic
wishes
you
a
pleasant
evening
said
the
womans
voice
the
door
of
the
telephone
box
burst
open
Harry
toppled
out
of
it
closely
followed
by
Neville
and
Luna
the
only
sound
in
the
Atrium
was
the
steady
rush
of
water
from
the
golden
fountain
where
jets
from
the
wands
of
the
witch
and
wizard
the
point
of
the
centaurs
arrow
the
tip
of
the
goblins
hat
and
the
house-elfs
ears
continued
to
gush
into
the
surrounding
pool
come
on
said
Harry
quietly
and
the
six
of
them
sprinted
off
down
the
hall
Harry
in
the
lead
past
the
fountain
towards
the
desk
where
the
security
man
who
had
weighed
Harrys
wand
had
sat
and
which
was
now
deserted
harry
felt
sure
there
ought
to
be
a
security
person
there
sure
that
their
absence
was
an
ominous
sign
and
his
feeling
of
foreboding
increased
as
they
passed
through
the
golden
gates
to
the
lifts
he
pressed
the
nearest
down
button
and
a
lift
clattered
into
sight
almost
immediately
the
golden
grilles
slid
apart
with
a
great
echoing
clanking
and
they
dashed
inside
harry
stabbed
the
number
nine
button
the
grilles
closed
with
a
bang
and
the
lift
began
to
descend
jangling
and
rattling
harry
had
not
realized
how
noisy
the
lifts
were
on
the
day
he
had
come
with
Mr
weasley
he
was
sure
the
din
would
raise
every
security
person
within
the
building
yet
when
the
lift
halted
the
cool
female
voice
said
Department
of
Mysteries
and
the
grilles
slid
open
they
stepped
out
into
the
corridor
where
nothing
was
moving
but
the
nearest
torches
flickering
in
the
rush
of
air
from
the
lift
harry
turned
towards
the
plain
black
door
after
months
and
months
of
dreaming
about
it
he
was
here
at
last
lets
go
he
whispered
and
he
led
the
way
down
t
he
corridor
Luna
right
behind
him
gazing
around
with
her
mouth
slightly
open
okay
listen
said
Harry
stopping
again
within
six
feet
of
the
door
maybe
maybe
a
couple
of
people
should
stay
here
as
a
as
a
lookout
and
and
howre
we
going
to
let
you
know
somethings
coming
asked
Ginny
her
eyebrows
raised
you
could
be
miles
away
were
coming
with
you
Harry
said
Neville
lets
get
on
with
it
said
Ron
firmly
harry
still
did
not
want
to
take
them
all
with
him
but
it
seemed
he
had
no
choice
he
turned
to
face
the
door
and
walked
forwards
just
as
it
had
in
his
dream
it
swung
open
and
he
marched
over
the
threshold
the
others
at
his
heels
they
were
standing
in
a
large
circular
room
everything
in
here
was
black
including
the
floor
and
ceiling
identical
unmarked
handleless
black
doors
were
set
at
intervals
all
around
the
black
walls
interspersed
with
branches
of
candles
whose
flames
burned
blue
their
cool
shimmering
light
reflected
in
the
shining
marble
floor
made
it
look
as
though
there
was
dark
water
underfoot
someone
shut
the
door
Harry
muttered
he
regretted
giving
this
order
the
moment
Neville
had
obeyed
it
without
the
long
chink
of
light
from
the
torchlit
corridor
behind
them
the
place
became
so
dark
that
for
a
moment
the
only
things
they
could
see
were
the
bunches
of
shivering
blue
flames
on
the
walls
and
their
ghostly
reflections
in
the
floor
in
his
dream
Harry
had
always
walked
purposefully
across
this
room
to
the
door
immediately
opposite
the
entrance
and
walked
on
but
there
were
around
a
dozen
doors
here
just
as
he
was
gazing
ahead
at
the
doors
opposite
him
trying
to
decide
which
was
the
right
one
there
was
a
great
rumbling
noise
and
the
candles
began
to
move
sideways
the
circular
wall
was
rotating
hermione
grabbed
Harrys
arm
as
though
frightened
the
floor
might
move
too
but
it
did
not
for
a
few
seconds
the
blue
flames
around
them
were
blurred
to
resemble
neon
lines
as
the
wall
sped
around
then
quite
as
suddenly
as
it
had
started
the
rumbling
stopped
and
everything
became
stationary
once
again
harrys
eyes
had
blue
streaks
burned
into
them
it
was
all
he
could
see
what
was
that
about
whispered
Ron
fearfully
i
think
it
was
to
stop
us
knowing
which
door
we
came
in
through
said
Ginny
in
a
hushed
voice
harry
realized
at
once
she
was
right
he
could
no
sooner
identify
the
exit
door
than
locate
an
ant
on
the
jet-black
floor
and
the
door
through
which
they
needed
to
proceed
could
be
any
one
of
the
dozen
surrounding
them
howre
we
going
to
get
back
out
said
Neville
uncomfortably
well
that
doesnt
matter
now
said
Harry
forcefully
blinking
to
try
to
erase
the
blue
lines
from
his
vision
and
clutching
his
wand
tighter
than
ever
we
wont
need
to
get
out
till
weve
found
Sirius
dont
go
calling
for
him
though
hermione
said
urgently
but
Harry
had
never
needed
her
advice
less
his
instinct
was
to
keep
as
quiet
as
possible
where
do
we
go
then
Harry
ron
asked
i
dont
Harry
began
he
swallowed
in
the
dreams
I
went
through
the
door
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
from
the
lifts
into
a
dark
room
thats
this
one
and
then
I
went
through
another
door
into
a
room
that
kind
of
glitters
we
should
try
a
few
doors
he
said
hastily
Ill
know
the
right
way
when
I
see
it
cmon
he
marched
straight
at
the
door
now
facing
him
the
others
following
close
behind
him
set
his
left
hand
against
its
cool
shining
surface
raised
his
wand
ready
to
strike
the
moment
it
opened
and
pushed
it
swung
open
easily
after
the
darkness
of
the
first
room
the
lamps
hanging
low
on
golden
chains
from
this
ceiling
gave
the
impression
that
this
long
rectangular
room
was
much
brighter
though
there
were
no
glittering
shimmering
lights
as
Harry
had
seen
in
his
dreams
the
place
was
quite
empty
except
for
a
few
desks
and
in
the
very
middle
of
the
room
an
enormous
glass
tank
of
deep
green
liquid
big
enough
for
all
of
them
to
swim
in
a
number
of
pearly-white
objects
were
drifting
around
lazily
in
it
whatre
those
things
whispered
Ron
dunno
said
Harry
are
they
fish
breathed
Ginny
aquavirius
Maggots
said
Luna
excitedly
dad
said
the
Ministry
were
breeding
no
said
Hermione
she
sounded
odd
she
moved
forward
to
look
through
the
side
of
the
tank
theyre
brains
brains
yes
i
wonder
what
theyre
doing
with
them
harry
joined
her
at
the
tank
sure
enough
there
could
be
no
mistake
now
he
saw
them
at
close
quarters
glimmering
eerily
they
drifted
in
and
out
of
sight
in
the
depths
of
the
green
liquid
looking
something
like
slimy
cauliflowers
lets
get
out
of
here
said
Harry
this
isnt
right
we
need
to
try
another
door
there
are
doors
here
too
said
Ron
pointing
around
the
walls
harrys
heart
sank
how
big
was
this
place
in
my
dream
I
went
through
that
dark
room
into
the
second
one
he
said
i
think
we
should
go
back
and
try
from
there
so
they
hurried
back
into
the
dark
circular
room
the
ghostly
shapes
of
the
brains
were
now
swimming
before
Harrys
eyes
instead
of
the
blue
candle
flames
wait
said
Hermione
sharply
as
Luna
made
to
close
the
door
of
the
brain
room
behind
them
flagrate
she
drew
with
her
wand
in
midair
and
a
fiery
X
appeared
on
the
door
no
sooner
had
the
door
clicked
shut
behind
them
than
there
was
a
great
rumbling
and
once
again
the
wall
began
to
revolve
very
fast
but
now
there
was
a
great
red-gold
blur
in
amongst
the
faint
blue
and
when
all
became
still
again
the
fiery
cross
still
burned
showing
the
door
they
had
already
tried
good
thinking
said
Harry
okay
lets
try
this
one
again
he
strode
directly
at
the
door
facing
him
and
pushed
it
open
his
wand
still
raised
the
others
at
his
heels
this
room
was
larger
than
the
last
dimly
lit
and
rectangular
and
the
center
of
it
was
sunken
forming
a
great
stone
pit
some
twenty
feet
deep
they
were
standing
on
the
topmost
tier
of
what
seemed
to
be
stone
benches
running
all
around
the
room
and
descending
in
steep
steps
like
an
amphitheatre
or
the
courtroom
in
which
Harry
had
been
tried
by
the
Wizengamot
instead
of
a
chained
chair
however
there
was
a
raised
stone
dais
in
the
center
of
the
pit
on
which
stood
a
stone
archway
that
looked
so
ancient
cracked
and
crumbling
that
Harry
was
amazed
the
thing
was
still
standing
unsupported
by
any
surrounding
wall
the
archway
was
hung
with
a
tattered
black
curtain
or
veil
which
despite
the
complete
stillness
of
the
cold
surrounding
air
was
fluttering
very
slightly
as
though
it
had
just
been
touched
whos
there
said
Harry
jumping
down
on
to
the
bench
below
there
was
no
answering
voice
but
the
veil
continued
to
flutter
and
sway
careful
whispered
Hermione
harry
scrambled
down
the
benches
one
by
one
until
he
reached
the
stone
bottom
of
the
sunken
pit
his
footsteps
echoed
loudly
as
he
walked
slowly
towards
the
dais
the
pointed
archway
looked
much
taller
from
where
he
now
stood
than
it
had
when
hed
been
looking
down
on
it
from
above
still
the
veil
swayed
gently
as
though
somebody
had
just
passed
through
it
sirius
harry
spoke
again
but
more
quietly
now
that
he
was
nearer
he
had
the
strangest
feeling
that
there
was
someone
standing
right
behind
the
veil
on
the
other
side
of
the
archway
gripping
his
wand
very
tightly
he
edged
around
the
dais
but
there
was
nobody
there
all
that
could
be
seen
was
the
other
side
of
the
tattered
black
veil
lets
go
called
Hermione
from
halfway
up
the
stone
steps
this
isnt
right
Harry
come
on
lets
go
she
sounded
scared
much
more
scared
than
she
had
in
the
room
where
the
brains
swam
yet
harry
thought
the
archway
had
a
kind
of
beauty
about
it
old
though
it
was
the
gently
rippling
veil
intrigued
him
he
felt
a
very
strong
inclination
to
climb
up
on
the
dais
and
walk
through
it
harry
lets
go
okay
said
Hermione
more
forcefully
okay
he
said
but
did
not
move
he
had
just
heard
something
there
were
faint
whispering
murmuring
noises
coming
from
the
other
side
of
the
veil
what
are
you
saying
he
said
very
loudly
so
that
his
words
echoed
all
around
the
stone
benches
nobodys
talking
Harry
said
Hermione
now
moving
over
to
him
someones
whispering
behind
there
he
said
moving
out
of
her
reach
and
continuing
to
frown
at
the
veil
is
that
you
Ron
im
here
mate
said
Ron
appearing
around
the
side
of
the
archway
cant
anyone
else
hear
it
harry
demanded
for
the
whispering
and
murmuring
was
becoming
louder
without
really
meaning
to
put
it
there
he
found
his
foot
was
on
the
dais
i
can
hear
them
too
breathed
Luna
joining
them
around
the
side
of
the
archway
and
gazing
at
the
swaying
veil
there
are
people
in
there
what
do
you
mean
in
there
demanded
Hermione
jumping
down
from
the
bottom
step
and
sounding
much
angrier
than
the
occasion
warranted
there
isnt
any
in
there
its
just
an
archway
theres
no
room
for
anybody
to
be
there
harry
stop
it
come
away
she
grabbed
his
arm
and
pulled
but
he
resisted
harry
we
are
supposed
to
be
here
for
Sirius
she
said
in
a
high-pitched
strained
voice
sirius
Harry
repeated
still
gazing
mesmerized
at
the
continuously
swaying
veil
yeah
something
finally
slid
back
into
place
in
his
brain
Sirius
captured
bound
and
tortured
and
he
was
staring
at
this
archway
he
took
several
paces
back
from
the
dais
and
wrenched
his
eyes
from
the
veil
lets
go
he
said
thats
what
Ive
been
trying
to
well
come
on
then
said
Hermione
and
she
led
the
way
back
around
the
dais
on
the
other
side
Ginny
and
Neville
were
staring
apparently
entranced
at
the
veil
too
without
speaking
Hermione
took
hold
of
Ginnys
arm
Ron
grabbed
Nevilles
and
they
marched
them
firmly
back
to
the
lowest
stone
bench
and
clambered
all
the
way
back
up
to
the
door
what
dyou
reckon
that
arch
was
harry
asked
Hermione
as
they
regained
the
dark
circular
room
i
dont
know
but
whatever
it
was
it
was
dangerous
she
said
firmly
again
inscribing
a
fiery
cross
on
the
door
once
more
the
wall
span
and
became
still
again
harry
approached
another
door
at
random
and
pushed
it
did
not
move
whats
wrong
said
Hermione
its
locked
said
Harry
throwing
his
weight
at
the
door
but
it
didnt
budge
this
is
it
then
isnt
it
said
Ron
excitedly
joining
Harry
in
the
attempt
to
force
the
door
open
bound
to
be
get
out
of
the
way
said
Hermione
sharply
she
pointed
her
wand
at
the
place
where
a
lock
would
have
been
on
an
ordinary
door
and
said
Alohomora
nothing
happened
siriuss
knife
said
Harry
he
pulled
it
out
from
inside
his
robes
and
slid
it
into
the
crack
between
the
door
and
the
wall
the
others
all
watched
eagerly
as
he
ran
it
from
top
to
bottom
withdrew
it
and
then
flung
his
shoulder
again
at
the
door
it
remained
as
firmly
shut
as
ever
what
was
more
when
Harry
looked
down
at
the
knife
he
saw
the
blade
had
melted
right
were
leaving
that
room
said
Hermione
decisively
but
what
if
thats
the
one
said
Ron
staring
at
it
with
a
mixture
of
apprehension
and
longing
it
cant
be
Harry
could
get
through
all
the
doors
in
his
dream
said
Hermione
marking
the
door
with
another
fiery
cross
as
Harry
replaced
the
now-useless
handle
of
Siriuss
knife
in
his
pocket
you
know
what
could
be
in
there
said
Luna
eagerly
as
the
wall
started
to
spin
yet
again
something
blibbering
no
doubt
said
Hermione
under
her
breath
and
Neville
gave
a
nervous
little
laugh
the
wall
slid
to
a
halt
and
Harry
with
a
feeling
of
increasing
desperation
pushed
the
next
door
open
this
is
it
he
knew
it
at
once
by
the
beautiful
dancing
diamond-sparkling
light
as
Harrys
eyes
became
accustomed
to
the
brilliant
glare
he
saw
clocks
gleaming
from
every
surface
large
and
small
grandfather
and
carriage
hanging
in
spaces
between
the
bookcases
or
standing
on
desks
ranging
the
length
of
the
room
so
that
a
busy
relentless
ticking
filled
the
place
like
thousands
of
minuscule
marching
footsteps
the
source
of
the
dancing
diamond-bright
light
was
a
towering
crystal
ball
jar
that
stood
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
this
way
harrys
heart
was
pumping
frantically
now
that
he
knew
they
were
on
the
right
track
he
led
the
way
down
the
narrow
space
between
the
lines
of
desks
heading
as
he
had
done
in
his
dream
for
the
source
of
the
light
the
crystal
bell
jar
quite
as
tall
as
he
was
that
stood
on
a
desk
and
appeared
to
be
full
of
a
billowing
glittering
wind
oh
look
said
Ginny
as
they
drew
nearer
pointing
at
the
very
heart
of
the
bell
jar
drifting
along
in
the
sparkling
current
inside
was
a
tiny
jewel-bright
egg
as
it
rose
in
the
jar
it
cracked
open
and
a
hummingbird
emerged
which
was
carried
to
the
very
top
of
the
jar
but
as
it
fell
on
the
draught
its
feathers
became
bedraggled
and
damp
again
and
by
the
time
it
had
been
borne
back
to
the
bottom
of
the
jar
it
had
been
enclosed
once
more
in
its
egg
keep
going
said
Harry
sharply
because
Ginny
showed
signs
of
wanting
to
stop
and
watch
the
eggs
progress
back
into
a
bird
you
dawdled
enough
by
that
old
arch
she
said
crossly
but
followed
him
past
the
bell
jar
to
the
only
door
behind
it
this
is
it
Harry
said
again
and
his
heart
was
now
pumping
so
hard
and
fast
he
felt
it
must
interfere
with
his
speech
its
through
here
he
glanced
around
at
them
all
they
had
their
wands
out
and
looked
suddenly
serious
and
anxious
he
looked
back
at
the
door
and
pushed
it
swung
open
they
were
there
they
had
found
the
place
high
as
a
church
and
full
of
nothing
but
towering
shelves
covered
in
small
dusty
glass
orbs
they
glimmered
dully
in
the
light
issuing
from
more
candle-brackets
set
at
intervals
along
the
shelves
like
those
in
the
circular
room
behind
them
their
flames
were
burning
blue
the
room
was
very
cold
harry
edged
forward
and
peered
down
one
of
the
shadowy
aisles
between
two
rows
of
shelves
he
could
not
hear
anything
or
see
the
slightest
sign
of
movement
you
said
it
was
row
ninety-seven
whispered
Hermione
yeah
breathed
Harry
looking
up
at
the
end
of
the
closest
row
beneath
the
branch
of
blueglowing
candles
protruding
from
it
glimmered
the
silver
figure
fifty-three
we
need
to
go
right
I
think
whispered
Hermione
squinting
to
the
next
row
yes
thats
fifty-four
keep
your
wands
ready
Harry
said
softly
they
crept
forward
glancing
behind
them
as
they
went
on
down
the
long
alleys
of
shelves
the
further
ends
of
which
were
in
near-total
darkness
tiny
yellowing
labels
had
been
stuck
beneath
each
glass
orb
on
the
shelves
some
of
them
had
a
weird
liquid
glow
others
were
as
dull
and
dark
within
as
blown
light
bulbs
they
passed
row
eighty-four
eighty-five
harry
was
listening
hard
for
the
slightest
sound
of
movement
but
Sirius
might
be
gagged
now
or
else
unconscious
or
said
an
unbidden
voice
inside
his
head
he
might
already
be
dead
id
have
felt
it
he
told
himself
his
heart
now
hammering
against
his
Adams
apple
Id
already
know
ninety-seven
whispered
Hermione
they
stood
grouped
around
the
end
of
the
row
gazing
down
the
alley
beside
it
there
was
nobody
there
hes
right
down
at
the
end
said
Harry
whose
mouth
had
become
slightly
dry
you
cant
see
properly
from
here
and
he
led
them
between
the
towering
rows
of
glass
balls
some
of
which
glowed
softly
as
they
passed
he
should
be
near
here
whispered
Harry
convinced
that
every
step
was
going
to
bring
the
ragged
form
of
Sirius
into
view
on
the
darkened
floor
anywhere
here
really
close
harry
said
Hermione
tentatively
but
he
did
not
want
to
respond
his
mouth
was
very
dry
somewhere
about
here
he
said
they
had
reached
the
end
of
the
row
and
emerged
into
more
dim
candlelight
there
was
nobody
there
all
was
echoing
dusty
silence
he
might
be
harry
whispered
hoarsely
peering
down
the
next
alley
or
maybe
he
hurried
to
look
down
the
one
beyond
that
harry
said
Hermione
again
what
he
snarled
i
dont
think
Sirius
is
here
nobody
spoke
harry
did
not
want
to
look
at
any
of
them
he
felt
sick
he
did
not
understand
why
Sirius
was
not
here
he
had
to
be
here
this
was
where
he
Harry
had
seen
him
he
ran
up
the
space
at
the
end
of
the
rows
staring
down
them
empty
aisle
after
empty
aisle
flickered
past
he
ran
the
other
way
back
past
his
staring
companions
there
was
no
sign
of
sirius
anywhere
nor
any
hint
of
a
struggle
harry
ron
called
what
he
did
not
want
to
hear
what
Ron
had
to
say
did
not
want
to
hear
Ron
tell
him
he
had
been
stupid
or
suggest
that
they
ought
to
go
back
to
Hogwarts
but
the
heat
was
rising
in
his
face
and
he
felt
as
though
he
would
like
to
skulk
down
here
in
the
darkness
for
a
long
while
before
facing
the
brightness
of
the
Atrium
above
and
the
others
accusing
stares
have
you
seen
this
said
Ron
what
said
Harry
but
eagerly
this
time
it
had
to
be
a
sign
that
Sirius
had
been
there
a
clue
he
strode
back
to
where
they
were
all
standing
a
little
way
down
row
ninety-seven
but
found
nothing
except
Ron
staring
at
one
of
the
dusty
glass
spheres
on
the
shelf
what
harry
repeated
glumly
its
its
got
your
name
on
said
Ron
harry
moved
a
little
closer
ron
was
pointing
at
one
of
the
small
glass
spheres
that
glowed
with
a
dull
inner
light
though
it
was
very
dusty
and
appeared
not
to
have
been
touched
for
many
years
my
name
said
Harry
blankly
he
stepped
forwards
not
as
tall
as
Ron
he
had
to
crane
his
neck
to
read
the
yellowish
label
affixed
to
the
shelf
right
beneath
the
dusty
glass
ball
in
spidery
writing
was
written
a
date
of
some
sixteen
years
previously
and
below
that
p.t.
to
A
p.w.b.d
dark
Lord
and
Harry
Potter
harry
stared
at
it
what
is
it
ron
asked
sounding
unnerved
whats
your
name
doing
down
here
he
glanced
along
at
the
other
labels
on
that
stretch
of
shelf
im
not
here
he
said
sounding
perplexed
none
of
the
rest
of
us
are
here
harry
I
dont
think
you
should
touch
it
said
Hermione
sharply
as
he
stretched
out
his
hand
why
not
he
said
its
something
to
do
with
me
isnt
it
dont
Harry
said
Neville
suddenly
harry
looked
at
him
nevilles
round
face
was
shining
slightly
with
sweat
he
looked
as
though
he
could
not
take
much
more
suspense
its
got
my
name
on
said
Harry
and
feeling
slightly
reckless
he
closed
his
fingers
around
the
dusty
balls
surface
he
had
expected
it
to
feel
cold
but
it
did
not
on
the
contrary
it
felt
as
though
it
had
been
lying
in
the
sun
for
hours
as
though
the
glow
of
light
within
was
warming
it
expecting
even
hoping
that
something
dramatic
was
going
to
happen
something
exciting
that
might
make
their
long
and
dangerous
journey
worthwhile
after
all
Harry
lifted
the
glass
ball
down
from
its
shelf
and
stared
at
it
nothing
whatsoever
happened
the
others
moved
in
closer
around
Harry
gazing
at
the
orb
as
he
brushed
it
free
of
the
clogging
dust
and
then
from
right
behind
them
a
drawling
voice
spoke
very
good
Potter
now
turn
around
nice
and
slowly
and
give
that
to
me
chapter
thirty-five
beyond
the
Veil
black
shapes
were
emerging
out
of
thin
air
all
around
them
blocking
their
way
left
and
right
eyes
glinted
through
slits
in
hoods
a
dozen
lit
wand
tips
were
pointing
directly
at
their
hearts
ginny
gave
a
gasp
of
horror
to
me
Potter
repeated
the
drawling
voice
of
Lucius
Malfoy
as
he
held
out
his
hand
palm
up
harrys
insides
plummeted
sickeningly
they
were
trapped
and
outnumbered
two
to
one
to
me
said
Malfoy
yet
again
wheres
Sirius
harry
said
several
of
the
Death
Eaters
laughed
a
harsh
female
voice
from
the
midst
of
the
shadowy
figures
to
Harrys
left
said
triumphantly
The
Dark
Lord
always
knows
always
echoed
Malfoy
softly
now
give
me
the
prophecy
Potter
i
want
to
know
where
Sirius
is
i
want
to
know
where
Sirius
is
mimicked
the
woman
to
his
left
she
and
her
fellow
Death
Eaters
had
closed
in
so
that
they
were
mere
feet
away
from
Harry
and
the
others
the
light
from
their
wands
dazzling
Harrys
eyes
youve
got
him
said
Harry
ignoring
the
rising
panic
in
his
chest
the
dread
he
had
been
fighting
since
they
had
first
entered
the
ninety-seventh
row
hes
here
i
know
he
is
the
little
baby
woke
up
fwightened
and
fort
what
it
dweamed
was
twoo
said
the
woman
in
a
horrible
mock
baby
voice
harry
felt
Ron
stir
beside
him
dont
do
anything
Harry
muttered
not
yet
the
woman
who
had
mimicked
him
let
out
a
raucous
scream
of
laughter
you
hear
him
you
hear
him
giving
instructions
to
the
other
children
as
though
he
thinks
of
fighting
us
oh
you
dont
know
Potter
as
I
do
Bellatrix
said
Malfoy
softly
he
has
a
great
weakness
for
heroics
the
Dark
Lord
understands
this
about
him
now
give
me
the
prophecy
Potter
i
know
Sirius
is
here
said
Harry
though
panic
w
as
causing
his
chest
to
constrict
and
he
felt
as
though
he
could
not
breathe
properly
i
know
youve
got
him
more
of
the
Death
Eaters
laughed
though
the
woman
laughed
loudest
of
all
its
time
you
learned
the
difference
between
life
and
dreams
Potter
said
Malfoy
now
give
me
the
prophecy
or
we
start
using
wands
go
on
then
said
Harry
raising
his
own
wand
to
chest
height
as
he
did
so
the
five
wands
of
ron
Hermione
Neville
Ginny
and
Luna
rose
on
either
side
of
him
the
knot
in
Harrys
stomach
tightened
if
Sirius
really
was
not
here
he
had
led
his
friends
to
their
deaths
for
no
reason
at
all
but
the
Death
Eaters
did
not
strike
hand
over
the
prophecy
and
no
one
need
get
hurt
said
Malfoy
coolly
it
was
Harrys
turn
to
laugh
yeah
right
he
said
i
give
you
this
prophecy
is
it
and
youll
just
let
us
skip
off
home
will
you
the
words
were
hardly
out
of
his
mouth
when
the
female
Death
Eater
shrieked
Accio
proph
harry
was
just
ready
for
her
he
shouted
Protego
before
she
had
finished
her
spell
and
though
the
glass
sphere
slipped
to
the
tips
of
his
fingers
he
managed
to
cling
on
to
it
oh
he
knows
how
to
play
little
bitty
baby
Potter
she
said
her
mad
eyes
staring
through
the
slits
in
her
hood
very
well
then
i
told
you
no
lucius
Malfoy
roared
at
the
woman
if
you
smash
it
harrys
mind
was
racing
the
Death
Eaters
wanted
this
dusty
spun-glass
sphere
he
had
no
interest
in
it
he
just
wanted
to
get
them
all
out
of
this
alive
to
make
sure
none
of
his
friends
paid
a
terrible
price
for
his
stupidity
the
woman
stepped
forward
away
from
her
fellows
and
pulled
off
her
hood
azkaban
had
hollowed
Bellatrix
Lestranges
face
making
it
gaunt
and
skull-like
but
it
was
alive
with
a
feverish
fanatical
glow
you
need
more
persuasion
she
said
her
chest
rising
and
falling
rapidly
very
well
take
the
smallest
one
she
ordered
the
Death
Eaters
beside
her
let
him
watch
while
we
torture
the
little
girl
ill
do
it
harry
felt
the
others
close
in
around
Ginny
he
stepped
sideways
so
that
he
was
right
in
front
of
her
the
prophecy
held
up
to
his
chest
youll
have
to
smash
this
if
you
want
to
attack
any
of
us
he
told
Bellatrix
i
dont
think
your
boss
will
be
too
pleased
if
you
come
back
without
it
will
he
she
did
not
move
she
merely
stared
at
him
the
tip
of
her
tongue
moistening
her
thin
mouth
so
said
Harry
what
kind
of
prophecy
are
we
talking
about
anyway
he
could
not
think
what
to
do
but
to
keep
talking
nevilles
arm
was
pressed
against
his
and
he
could
feel
him
shaking
he
could
feel
one
of
the
others
quickened
breath
on
the
back
of
his
head
he
was
hoping
they
were
all
thinking
hard
about
ways
to
get
out
of
this
because
his
mind
was
blank
what
kind
of
prophecy
repeated
Bellatrix
the
grin
fading
from
her
face
you
jest
Harry
potter
nope
not
jesting
said
Harry
his
eyes
flicking
from
Death
Eater
to
Death
Eater
looking
for
a
weak
link
a
space
through
which
they
could
escape
how
come
Voldemort
wants
it
several
of
the
Death
Eaters
let
out
low
hisses
you
dare
speak
his
name
whispered
Bellatrix
yeah
said
Harry
maintaining
his
tight
grip
on
the
glass
ball
expecting
another
attempt
to
bewitch
it
from
him
yeah
Ive
got
no
problem
with
saying
Vol
shut
your
mouth
bellatrix
shrieked
you
dare
speak
his
name
with
your
unworthy
lips
you
dare
besmirch
it
with
your
half-bloods
tongue
you
dare
did
you
know
hes
a
half-blood
too
said
Harry
recklessly
hermione
gave
a
little
moan
in
his
ear
voldemort
yeah
his
mother
was
a
witch
but
his
dad
was
a
Muggle
or
has
he
been
telling
you
lot
hes
pure-blood
stupef
no
a
jet
of
red
light
had
shot
from
the
end
of
Bellatrix
Lestranges
wand
but
Malfoy
had
deflected
it
his
spell
caused
hers
to
hit
the
shelf
a
foot
to
the
left
of
Harry
and
several
of
the
glass
orbs
there
shattered
two
figures
pearly-white
as
ghosts
fluid
as
smoke
unfurled
themselves
from
the
fragments
of
broken
glass
upon
the
floor
and
each
began
to
speak
their
voices
vied
with
each
other
so
that
only
fragments
of
what
they
were
saying
could
be
heard
over
Malfoy
and
Bellatrixs
shouts
at
the
solstice
will
come
a
new
said
the
figure
of
an
old
bearded
man
do
not
attack
we
need
the
prophecy
he
dared
he
dares
shrieked
Bellatrix
incoherently
he
stands
there
filthy
half-blood
wait
until
weve
got
the
prophecy
bawled
Malfoy
and
none
will
come
after
said
the
figure
of
a
young
woman
the
two
figures
that
had
burst
from
the
shattered
spheres
had
melted
into
thin
air
nothing
remained
of
them
or
their
erstwhile
homes
but
fragments
of
glass
upon
the
floor
they
had
however
given
Harry
an
idea
the
problem
was
going
to
be
conveying
it
to
the
others
you
havent
told
me
whats
so
special
about
this
prophecy
Im
supposed
to
be
handing
over
he
said
playing
for
time
he
moved
his
foot
slowly
sideways
feeling
around
for
someone
elses
do
not
play
games
with
us
Potter
said
Malfoy
im
not
playing
games
said
Harry
half
his
mind
on
the
conversation
half
on
his
wandering
foot
and
then
he
found
someones
toes
and
pressed
down
upon
them
a
sharp
intake
of
breath
behind
him
told
him
they
were
Hermiones
what
she
whispered
dumbledore
never
told
you
the
reason
you
bear
that
scar
was
hidden
in
the
bowels
of
the
department
of
Mysteries
malfoy
sneered
i
what
said
Harry
and
for
a
moment
he
quite
forgot
his
plan
what
about
my
scar
what
whispered
Hermione
more
urgently
behind
him
can
this
be
said
Malfoy
sounding
maliciously
delighted
some
of
the
Death
Eaters
were
laughing
again
and
under
cover
of
their
laughter
Harry
hissed
to
Hermione
moving
his
lips
as
little
as
possible
Smash
shelves
dumbledore
never
told
you
malfoy
repeated
well
this
explains
why
you
didnt
come
earlier
Potter
the
Dark
Lord
wondered
why
when
I
say
now
you
didnt
come
running
when
he
showed
you
the
place
where
it
was
hidden
in
your
dreams
he
thought
natural
curiosity
would
make
you
want
to
hear
the
exact
wording
did
he
said
Harry
behind
him
he
felt
rather
than
heard
Hermione
passing
his
message
to
the
others
and
he
sought
to
keep
talking
to
distract
the
Death
Eaters
so
he
wanted
me
to
come
and
get
it
did
he
why
why
malfoy
sounded
incredulously
delighted
because
the
only
people
who
are
permitted
to
retrieve
a
prophecy
from
the
Department
of
Mysteries
Potter
are
those
about
whom
it
was
made
as
the
Dark
Lord
discovered
when
he
attempted
to
use
others
to
steal
it
for
him
and
why
did
he
want
to
steal
a
prophecy
about
me
about
both
of
you
Potter
about
both
of
you
havent
you
ever
wondered
why
the
Dark
Lord
tried
to
kill
you
as
a
baby
harry
stared
into
the
slitted
eye-holes
through
which
Malfoys
grey
eyes
were
gleaming
was
this
prophecy
the
reason
Harrys
parents
had
died
the
reason
he
carried
his
lightning-bolt
scar
was
the
answer
to
all
of
this
clutched
in
his
hand
someone
made
a
prophecy
about
Voldemort
and
me
he
said
quietly
gazing
at
Lucius
Malfoy
his
fingers
tightening
over
the
warm
glass
sphere
in
his
hand
it
was
hardly
larger
than
a
Snitch
and
still
gritty
with
dust
and
hes
made
me
come
and
get
it
for
him
why
couldnt
he
come
and
get
it
himself
get
it
himself
shrieked
Bellatrix
over
a
cackle
of
mad
laughter
the
Dark
Lord
walk
into
the
Ministry
of
Magic
when
they
are
so
sweetly
ignoring
his
return
the
Dark
Lord
reveal
himself
to
the
Aurors
when
at
the
moment
they
are
wasting
their
time
on
my
dear
cousin
so
hes
got
you
doing
his
dirty
work
for
him
has
he
said
Harry
like
he
tried
to
get
Sturgis
to
steal
it
and
Bode
very
good
Potter
very
good
said
Malfoy
slowly
but
the
Dark
Lord
knows
you
are
not
unintell
now
yelled
Harry
five
different
voices
behind
him
bellowed
reducto
five
curses
flew
in
five
different
directions
and
the
shelves
opposite
them
exploded
as
they
hit
the
towering
structure
swayed
as
a
hundred
glass
spheres
burst
apart
pearly-white
figures
unfurled
into
the
air
and
floated
there
their
voices
echoing
from
who
knew
what
long-dead
past
amid
the
torrent
of
crashing
glass
and
splintered
wood
now
raining
down
upon
the
floor
run
harry
yelled
as
the
shelves
swayed
precariously
and
more
glass
spheres
began
to
fall
from
above
he
seized
a
handful
of
Hermiones
robes
and
dragged
her
forwards
holding
one
arm
over
his
head
as
chunks
of
shelf
and
shards
of
glass
thundered
down
upon
them
a
Death
eater
lunged
forwards
through
the
cloud
of
dust
and
Harry
elbowed
him
hard
in
the
masked
face
they
were
all
yelling
there
were
cries
of
pain
and
thunderous
crashes
as
the
shelves
collapsed
upon
themselves
weirdly
echoing
fragments
of
the
Seers
unleashed
from
their
spheres
harry
found
the
way
ahead
clear
and
saw
Ron
Ginny
and
Luna
sprint
past
him
their
arms
over
their
heads
something
heavy
struck
him
on
the
side
of
the
face
but
he
merely
ducked
his
head
and
sprinted
onwards
a
hand
caught
him
by
the
shoulder
he
heard
Hermione
shout
Stupefy
the
hand
released
him
at
once
they
were
at
the
end
of
row
ninety-seven
Harry
turned
right
and
began
to
sprint
in
earnest
he
could
hear
footsteps
right
behind
him
and
Hermiones
voice
urging
Neville
on
straight
ahead
the
door
through
which
they
had
come
was
ajar
Harry
could
see
the
glittering
light
of
the
bell
jar
he
pelted
through
the
doorway
the
prophecy
still
clutched
tight
and
safe
in
his
hand
and
waited
for
the
others
to
hurtle
over
the
threshold
before
slamming
the
door
behind
them
colloportus
gasped
Hermione
and
the
door
sealed
itself
with
an
odd
squelching
noise
where
where
are
the
others
gasped
Harry
he
had
thought
Ron
Luna
and
Ginny
were
ahead
of
them
that
they
would
be
waiting
in
this
room
but
there
was
nobody
there
they
must
have
gone
the
wrong
way
whispered
Hermione
terror
in
her
face
listen
whispered
Neville
footsteps
and
shouts
echoed
from
behind
the
door
they
had
just
sealed
Harry
put
his
ear
close
to
the
door
to
listen
and
heard
Lucius
Malfoy
roar
Leave
Nott
leave
him
I
say
his
injuries
will
be
nothing
to
the
Dark
Lord
compared
to
losing
that
prophecy
jugson
come
back
here
we
need
to
organize
well
split
into
pairs
and
search
and
dont
forget

asked
Harry
trembling
from
head
to
foot
well
we
dont
stand
here
waiting
for
them
to
find
us
for
a
start
said
Harry
lets
get
away
from
this
door
they
ran
as
quietly
as
they
could
past
the
shimmering
bell
jar
where
the
tiny
egg
was
hatching
and
unhatching
towards
the
exit
into
the
circular
hallway
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
they
were
almost
there
when
Harry
heard
something
large
and
heavy
collide
with
the
door
Hermione
had
charmed
shut
stand
aside
said
a
rough
voice
alahomora
as
the
door
flew
open
Harry
Hermione
and
Neville
dived
under
desks
they
could
see
the
bottom
of
the
two
Death
Eaters
robes
drawing
nearer
their
feet
moving
rapidly
they
mightve
run
straight
through
to
the
hall
said
the
rough
voice
check
under
the
desks
said
another
harry
saw
the
knees
of
the
Death
Eaters
bend
poking
his
wand
out
from
under
the
desk
he
shouted
stupefy
a
jet
of
red
light
hit
the
nearest
Death
Eater
he
fell
backwards
into
a
grandfather
clock
and
knocked
it
over
the
second
Death
Eater
however
had
leapt
aside
to
avoid
Harrys
spell
and
was
pointing
his
own
wand
at
Hermione
who
was
crawling
out
from
under
the
desk
to
get
a
better
aim
avada
harry
launched
himself
across
the
floor
and
grabbed
the
Death
Eater
around
the
knees
causing
him
to
topple
and
his
aim
to
go
awry
neville
overturned
a
desk
in
his
anxiety
to
help
and
pointing
his
wand
wildly
at
the
struggling
pair
he
cried
expelliarmus
both
Harrys
and
the
Death
Eaters
wands
flew
out
of
their
hands
and
soared
back
towards
the
entrance
to
the
Hall
of
Prophecy
both
scrambled
to
their
feet
and
charged
after
them
the
Death
eater
in
front
Harry
hot
on
his
heels
and
Neville
bringing
up
the
rear
plainly
horrorstruck
by
what
he
had
done
get
out
of
the
way
Harry
yelled
Neville
clearly
determined
to
repair
the
damage
harry
flung
himself
sideways
as
Neville
took
aim
again
and
shouted
stupefy
the
jet
of
red
light
had
flown
right
over
the
Death
Eaters
shoulder
and
hit
a
glass-fronted
cabinet
on
the
wall
full
of
variously
shaped
hour-glasses
the
cabinet
fell
to
the
floor
and
burst
apart
glass
flying
everywhere
sprang
back
up
on
to
the
wall
fully
mended
then
fell
down
again
and
shattered
the
Death
Eater
had
snatched
up
his
wand
which
lay
on
the
floor
beside
the
glittering
bell
jar
harry
ducked
down
behind
another
desk
as
the
man
turned
his
mask
had
slipped
so
that
he
couldnt
see
he
ripped
it
off
with
his
free
hand
and
shouted
stup
stupefy
screamed
Hermione
who
had
just
caught
up
with
them
the
jet
of
red
light
hit
the
death
Eater
in
the
middle
of
his
chest
he
froze
his
arm
still
raised
his
wand
fell
to
the
floor
with
a
clatter
and
he
collapsed
backwards
towards
the
bell
jar
harry
expected
to
hear
a
dunk
for
the
man
to
hit
solid
glass
and
slide
off
the
jar
on
to
the
floor
but
instead
his
head
sank
through
the
surface
of
the
bell
jar
as
though
it
were
nothing
but
a
soap
bubble
and
he
came
to
rest
sprawled
on
his
back
on
the
table
with
his
head
lying
inside
the
jar
full
of
glittering
wind
accio
wand
cried
Hermione
harrys
wand
flew
from
a
dark
corner
into
her
hand
and
she
threw
it
to
him
thanks
he
said
right
lets
get
out
of
look
out
said
Neville
horrified
he
was
staring
at
the
Death
Eaters
head
in
the
bell
jar
all
three
of
them
raised
their
wands
again
but
none
of
them
struck
they
were
all
gazing
openmouthed
appalled
at
what
was
happening
to
the
mans
head
it
was
shrinking
very
fast
growing
balder
and
balder
the
black
hair
and
stubble
retracting
into
his
skull
his
cheeks
becoming
smooth
his
skull
round
and
covered
with
a
peachlike
fuzz
a
babys
head
now
sat
grotesquely
on
top
of
the
thick
muscled
neck
of
the
Death
Eater
as
he
struggled
to
get
up
again
but
even
as
they
watched
their
mouths
open
the
head
began
to
swell
to
its
previous
proportions
again
thick
black
hair
was
sprouting
from
the
pate
and
chin
its
Time
said
Hermione
in
an
awestruck
voice
time
the
Death
Eater
shook
his
ugly
head
again
trying
to
clear
it
but
before
he
could
pull
himself
together
it
began
to
shrink
back
to
babyhood
once
more
there
was
a
shout
from
a
room
nearby
then
a
crash
and
a
scream
ron
harry
yelled
turning
quickly
from
the
monstrous
transformation
taking
place
before
them
ginny
luna
harry
hermione
screamed
the
Death
Eater
had
pulled
his
head
out
of
the
bell
jar
his
appearance
was
utterly
bizarre
his
tiny
babys
head
bawling
loudly
while
his
thick
arms
flailed
dangerously
in
all
directions
narrowly
missing
Harry
who
had
ducked
harry
raised
his
wand
but
to
his
amazement
Hermione
seized
his
arm
you
cant
hurt
a
baby
there
was
no
time
to
argue
the
point
Harry
could
hear
more
footsteps
growing
louder
from
the
hall
of
Prophecy
and
knew
too
late
that
he
ought
not
to
have
shouted
and
given
away
their
position
come
on
he
said
and
leaving
the
ugly
baby-headed
Death
Eater
staggering
behind
them
they
took
off
for
the
door
that
stood
open
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
leading
back
into
the
black
hallway
they
had
run
halfway
towards
it
when
Harry
saw
through
the
open
door
two
more
Death
Eaters
running
across
the
black
room
towards
them
veering
left
he
burst
instead
into
a
small
dark
cluttered
office
and
slammed
the
door
behind
them
collo
began
Hermione
but
before
she
could
complete
the
spell
the
door
had
burst
open
and
the
two
Death
Eaters
had
come
hurtling
inside
with
a
cry
of
triumph
both
yelled
impedimenta
harry
Hermione
and
Neville
were
all
knocked
backwards
off
their
feet
Neville
was
thrown
over
the
desk
and
disappeared
from
view
Hermione
smashed
into
a
bookcase
and
was
promptly
deluged
in
a
cascade
of
heavy
books
the
back
of
Harrys
head
slammed
into
the
stone
wall
behind
him
tiny
lights
burst
in
front
of
his
eyes
and
for
a
moment
he
was
too
dizzy
and
bewildered
to
react
weve
got
him
yelled
the
Death
Eater
nearest
Harry
in
an
office
off
silencio
cried
Hermione
and
the
mans
voice
was
extinguished
he
continued
to
mouth
through
the
hole
in
his
mask
but
no
sound
came
out
he
was
thrust
aside
by
his
fellow
Death
eater
petrificus
Totalus
shouted
Harry
as
the
second
Death
Eater
raised
his
wand
his
arms
and
legs
snapped
together
and
he
fell
forwards
face
down
on
to
the
rug
at
Harrys
feet
stiff
as
a
board
and
unable
to
move
well
done
Ha
but
the
Death
Eater
Hermione
had
just
struck
dumb
made
a
sudden
slashing
movement
with
his
wand
a
streak
of
what
looked
like
purple
flame
passed
right
across
Hermiones
chest
she
gave
a
tiny
Oh
as
though
of
surprise
and
crumpled
on
to
the
floor
where
she
lay
motionless
hermione
harry
fell
to
his
knees
beside
her
as
Neville
crawled
rapidly
towards
her
from
under
the
desk
his
wand
held
up
in
front
of
him
the
Death
Eater
kicked
out
hard
at
Nevilles
head
as
he
emerged
his
foot
broke
Nevilles
wand
in
two
and
connected
with
his
face
neville
gave
a
howl
of
pain
and
recoiled
clutching
his
mouth
and
nose
harry
twisted
around
his
own
wand
held
high
and
saw
that
the
Death
Eater
had
ripped
off
his
mask
and
was
pointing
his
wand
directly
at
Harry
who
recognized
the
long
pale
twisted
face
from
the
Daily
Prophet
Antonin
Dolohov
the
wizard
who
had
murdered
the
Prewetts
dolohov
grinned
with
his
free
hand
he
pointed
from
the
prophecy
still
clutched
in
Harrys
hand
to
himself
then
at
Hermione
though
he
could
no
longer
speak
his
meaning
could
not
have
been
clearer
give
me
the
prophecy
or
you
get
the
same
as
her
like
you
wont
kill
us
all
anyway
the
moment
I
hand
it
over
said
Harry
a
whine
of
panic
inside
his
head
was
preventing
him
thinking
properly
he
had
one
hand
on
hermiones
shoulder
which
was
still
warm
yet
did
not
dare
look
at
her
properly
dont
let
her
be
dead
dont
let
her
be
dead
its
my
fault
if
shes
dead
whaddever
you
do
Harry
said
Neville
fiercely
from
under
the
desk
lowering
his
hands
to
show
a
clearly
broken
nose
and
blood
pouring
down
his
mouth
and
chin
dond
gib
it
to
him
then
there
was
a
crash
outside
the
door
and
Dolohov
looked
over
his
shoulder
the
baby-headed
death
Eater
had
appeared
in
the
doorway
his
head
bawling
his
great
fists
still
flailing
uncontrollably
at
everything
around
him
harry
seized
his
chance
petrificus
totalus
the
spell
hit
Dolohov
before
he
could
block
it
and
he
toppled
forwards
across
his
comrade
both
of
them
rigid
as
boards
and
unable
to
move
an
inch
hermione
Harry
said

as
the
baby-headed
Death
Eater

Neville
crawling
out

to

blood
streaming
from
his
rapidly
swelling
nose
i

neville
groped
for
Hermiones
wrist
dats
a
pulse
Harry
Ib
sure
id
is
such
a
powerful
wave
of
relief
swept
through
Harry
that
for
a
moment
he
felt
light-headed
shes
alive
yeah
I
dink
so
there
was
a
pause
in
which
Harry
listened
hard
for
the
sound
of
more
footsteps
but
all
he
could
hear
were
the
whimpers
and
blunderings
of
the
baby-headed
Death
Eater
in
the
next
room
neville
were
not
far
from
the
exit
Harry
whispered

circular

Death
Eaters

lift

Neville
mopping
his
bleeding
nose
with
his
sleeve
and
frowning
at
Harry

Harry

I
ab
he
stood
up
and
seized
one
of
Hermiones
arms
glaring
at
Harry
who
hesitated
then
grabbed
the
other
and
helped
hoist
Hermiones
limp
form
over
Nevilles
shoulders
wait
said
Harry
snatching
up
Hermiones
wand
from
the
floor
and
shoving
it
into
Nevilles
hand
youd
better
take
this
neville
kicked
aside
the
broken
fragments
of
his
own
wand
as
they
walked
slowly
towards
the
door
my
grans
going
do
kill

said
Neville
thickly
blood
spattering
from
his
nose
as
he
spoke
dat
was
by
dads
old
wand
harry
stuck
his
head
out
of
the
door
and
looked
around
cautiously
the
baby-headed
Death
Eater
was
screaming
and
banging
into
things
toppling
grandfather
clocks
and
overturning
desks
bawling
and
confused
while
the
glass-fronted
cabinet
that
Harry
now
suspected
had
contained
time-Turners
continued
to
fall
shatter
and
repair
itself
on
the
wall
behind
them
hes
never
going
to
notice
us
he
whispered
cmon
keep
close
behind
me
they
crept
out
of
the
office
and
back
towards
the
door
into
the
black
hallway
which
now
seemed
completely
deserted
they
walked
a
few
steps
forwards
Neville
tottering
slightly
due
to
hermiones
weight
the
door
of
the
Time
Room
swung
shut
behind
them
and
the
walls
began
to
rotate
once
more
the
recent
blow
on
the
back
of
Harrys
head
seemed
to
have
unsteadied
him
he
narrowed
his
eyes
swaying
slightly
until
the
walls
stopped
moving
again
with
a
sinking
heart
harry
saw
that
Hermiones
fiery
crosses
had
faded
from
the
doors
so
which
way
dyou
reck
but
before
they
could
make
a
decision
as
to
which
way
to
try
a
door
to
their
right
sprang
open
and
three
people
fell
out
of
it
ron
croaked
Harry
dashing
towards
them
ginny
are
you
all
harry
said
Ron
giggling
weakly
lurching
forwards
seizing
the
front
of
Harrys
robes
and
gazing
at
him
with
unfocused
eyes
there
you
are
ha
ha
ha
you
look
funny
Harry
youre
all
messed
up
rons
face
was
very
white
and
something
dark
was
trickling
from
the
corner
of
his
mouth
next
moment
his
knees
had
given
way
but
he
still
clutched
the
front
of
Harrys
robes
so
that
Harry
was
pulled
into
a
kind
of
bow
ginny
harry
said
fearfully
what
happened
but
Ginny
shook
her
head
and
slid
down
the
wall
into
a
sitting
position
panting
and
holding
her
ankle
i
think
her
ankles
broken
I
heard
something
crack
whispered
Luna
who
was
bending
over
her
and
who
alone
seemed
to
be
unhurt
four
of
them
chased
us
into
a
dark
room
full
of
planets
it
was
a
very
odd
place
some
of
the
time
we
were
just
floating
in
the
dark
harry
we
saw
Uranus
up
close
said
Ron
still
giggling
feebly
get
it
Harry
we
saw
Uranus
ha
ha
ha
a
bubble
of
blood
grew
at
the
corner
of
Rons
mouth
and
burst
anyway
one
of
them
grabbed
Ginnys
foot
I
used
the
Reductor
Curse
and
blew
up
Pluto
in
his
face
but
luna
gestured
hopelessly
at
Ginny
who
was
breathing
in
a
very
shallow
way
her
eyes
still
closed
and
what
about
Ron
said
Harry
fearfully
as
Ron
continued
to
giggle
still
hanging
off
the
front
of
Harrys
robes
i
dont
know
what
they
hit
him
with
said
Luna
sadly
but
hes
gone
a
bit
funny
I
could
hardly
get
him
along
at
all
harry
said
Ron
pulling
Harrys
ear
down
to
his
mouth
and
still
giggling
weakly
you
know
who
this
girl
is
Harry
shes
Loony
loony
Lovegood
ha
ha
ha
weve
got
to
get
out
of
here
said
Harry
firmly
luna
can
you
help
Ginny
yes
said
Luna
sticking
her
wand
behind
her
ear
for
safekeeping
then
putting
an
arm
around
ginnys
waist
and
pulling
her
up
its
only
my
ankle
I
can
do
it
myself
said
Ginny
impatiently
but
next
moment
she
had
collapsed
sideways
and
grabbed
Luna
for
support
harry
pulled
Rons
arm
over
his
shoulder
just
as
so
many
months
ago
he
had
pulled
Dudleys
he
looked
around
they
had
a
one
in
twelve
chance
of
getting
the
exit
right
first
time
he
heaved
Ron
towards
a
door
they
were
within
a
few
feet
of
it
when
another
door
across
the
hall
burst
open
and
three
Death
Eaters
sped
in
led
by
Bellatrix
Lestrange
there
they
are
she
shrieked
stunning
Spells
shot
across
the
room
Harry
smashed
his
way
through
the
door
ahead
flung
Ron
unceremoniously
from
him
and
ducked
back
to
help
Neville
in
with
Hermione
they
were
all
over
the
threshold
just
in
time
to
slam
the
door
against
Bellatrix
colloportus
shouted
Harry
and
he
heard
three
bodies
slam
into
the
door
on
the
other
side
it
doesnt
matter
said
a
mans
voice
there
are
other
ways
in
weve
got
them
theyre
here
harry
span
around
they
were
back
in
the
Brain
Room
and
sure
enough
there
were
doors
all
around
the
walls
he
could
hear
footsteps
in
the
hall
behind
them
as
more
Death
Eaters
came
running
to
join
the
first
luna
Neville
help
me
the
three
of
them
tore
around
the
room
sealing
the
doors
as
they
went
Harry
crashed
into
a
table
and
rolled
over
the
top
of
it
in
his
haste
to
reach
the
next
door
colloportus
there
were
footsteps
running
along
behind
the
doors
every
now
and
then
another
heavy
body
would
launch
itself
against
one
so
it
creaked
and
shuddered
Luna
and
Neville
were
bewitching
the
doors
along
the
opposite
wall
then
as
Harry
reached
the
very
top
of
the
room
he
heard
luna
cry
colloaaaaaaaaargh
he
turned
in
time
to
see
her
flying
through
the
air
five
Death
Eaters
were
surging
into
the
room
through
the
door
she
had
not
reached
in
time
Luna
hit
a
desk
slid
over
its
surface
and
on
to
the
floor
on
the
other
side
where
she
lay
sprawled
as
still
as
Hermione
get
Potter
shrieked
Bellatrix
and
she
ran
at
him
he
dodged
her
and
sprinted
back
up
the
room
he
was
safe
as
long
as
they
thought
they
might
hit
the
prophecy
hey
said
Ron
who
had
staggered
to
his
feet
and
was
now
tottering
drunkenly
towards
Harry
giggling
hey
Harry
there
are
brains
in
here
ha
h
a
ha
isnt
that
weird
Harry
ron
get
out
of
the
way
get
down
but
Ron
had
already
pointed
his
wand
at
the
tank
honest
Harry
theyre
brains
look
Accio
brain
the
scene
seemed
momentarily
frozen
harry
Ginny
and
Neville
and
each
of
the
Death
Eaters
turned
in
spite
of
themselves
to
watch
the
top
of
the
tank
as
a
brain
burst
from
the
green
liquid
like
a
leaping
fish
for
a
moment
it
seemed
suspended
in
midair
then
it
soared
towards
Ron
spinning
as
it
came
and
what
looked
like
ribbons
of
moving
images
flew
from
it
unraveling
like
rolls
of
film
ha
ha
ha
Harry
look
at
it
said
Ron
watching
it
disgorge
its
gaudy
innards
Harry
come
and
touch
it
bet
its
weird
ron
no
harry
did
not
know
what
would
happen
if
Ron
touched
the
tentacles
of
thought
now
flying
behind
the
brain
but
he
was
sure
it
would
not
be
anything
good
he
darted
forwards
but
Ron
had
already
caught
the
brain
in
his
outstretched
hands
the
moment
they
made
contact
with
his
skin
the
tentacles
began
wrapping
themselves
around
rons
arms
like
ropes
harry
look
whats
happen
No
no
I
dont
like
it
no
stop
stop
but
the
thin
ribbons
were
spinning
around
Rons
chest
now
he
tugged
and
tore
at
them
as
the
brain
was
pulled
tight
against
him
like
an
octopuss
body
diffindo
yelled
Harry
trying
to
sever
the
feelers
wrapping
themselves
tightly
around
Ron
before
his
eyes
but
they
would
not
break
ron
fell
over
still
thrashing
against
his
bonds
harry
itll
suffocate
him
screamed
Ginny
immobilized
by
her
broken
ankle
on
the
floor
then
a
jet
of
red
light
flew
from
one
of
the
Death
Eaters
wands
and
hit
her
squarely
in
the
face
she
keeled
over
sideways
and
lay
there
unconscious
stubefy
shouted
Neville
wheeling
around
and
waving
Hermiones
wand
at
the
oncoming
death
Eaters
stubefy
stubefy
but
nothing
happened
one
of
the
Death
Eaters
shot
their
own
Stunning
Spell
at
Neville
it
missed
him
by
inches
harry
and
Neville
were
now
the
only
two
left
fighting
the
five
Death
Eaters
two
of
whom
sent
off
streams
of
silver
light
like
arrows
which
missed
but
left
craters
in
the
wall
behind
them
harry
ran
for
it
as
Bellatrix
Lestrange
raced
right
at
him
holding
the
prophecy
high
above
his
head
he
sprinted
back
up
the
room
all
he
could
think
of
doing
was
to
draw
the
Death
Eaters
away
from
the
others
it
seemed
to
have
worked
they
streaked
after
him
knocking
chairs
and
tables
flying
but
not
daring
to
bewitch
him
in
case
they
hurt
the
prophecy
and
he
dashed
through
the
only
door
still
open
the
one
through
which
the
Death
Eaters
themselves
had
come
inwardly
praying
that
neville
would
stay
with
Ron
and
find
some
way
of
releasing
him
he
ran
a
few
feet
into
the
new
room
and
felt
the
floor
vanish
he
was
falling
down
steep
stone
step
after
steep
stone
step
bouncing
on
every
tier
until
at
last
with
a
crash
that
knocked
all
the
breath
out
of
his
body
he
landed
flat
on
his
back
in
the
sunken
pit
where
the
stone
archway
stood
on
its
dais
the
whole
room
was
ringing
with
the
Death
eaters
laughter
he
looked
up
and
saw
the
five
who
had
been
in
the
Brain
Room
descending
towards
him
while
as
many
more
emerged
through
other
doorways
and
began
leaping
from
bench
to
bench
towards
him
harry
got
to
his
feet
though
his
legs
were
trembling
so
badly
they
barely
supported
him
the
prophecy
was
still
miraculously
unbroken
in
his
left
hand
his
wand
clutched
tightly
in
his
right
he
backed
away
looking
around
trying
to
keep
all
the
Death
Eaters
within
his
sight
the
back
of
his
legs
hit
something
solid
he
had
reached
the
dais
where
the
archway
stood
he
climbed
backwards
onto
it
the
Death
Eaters
all
halted
gazing
at
him
some
were
panting
as
hard
as
he
was
one
was
bleeding
badly
Dolohov
freed
of
the
Body-Bind
Curse
was
leering
his
wand
pointing
straight
at
Harrys
face
potter

race

Lucius
Malfoy
pulling
off
his
mask
now
hand

the
prophecy
like
a
good

the
others
go
and
Ill

said
Harry
desperately
a
few
of
the
Death
Eaters
laughed
you
are
not
in
a
position
to
bargain
Potter
said
Lucius
Malfoy
his
pale
face
flushed
with
pleasure
you

ten
of
us
and
only
one
of
you
or

Dumbledore

shouted
a
voice
from
above
them
hes
still

harrys
heart
sank
Neville
was
scrambling
down
the
stone
benches
towards
them
Hermiones
wand
held
fast
in
his
trembling
hand
neville
no

Ron

shouted
again
pointing
his
wand
at
each
Death
Eater
in
turn
stubefy
stube
one
of
the
largest
Death
Eaters
seized
Neville
from
behind
pinioning
his
arms
to
his
sides
he
struggled
and
kicked
several
of
the
Death
Eaters
laughed
its
Longbottom

sneered
Lucius
Malfoy
well

grandmother

members

cause

death

as
a
great
shock
longbottom
repeated
Bellatrix
and
a
truly
evil
smile
lit
her
gaunt
face
why
I
have
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
your
parents
boy
i
doe

roared
Neville
and
he
fought
so
hard
against
his
captors
encircling
grip
that
the
Death
Eater
shouted
Someone
Stun
him
no
no
no
said
Bellatrix
she
looked
transported
alive
with
excitement
as
she
glanced
at
harry
then
back
at
Neville
no
lets
see
how
long
Longbottom
lasts
before
he
cracks
like
his
parents
unless
Potter
wants
to
give
us
the
prophecy
dond

id

roared
Neville
who
seemed
beside
himself
kicking
and
writhing
as
Bellatrix
drew
nearer
to
him
and
his
captor
her
wand
raised
dond
gib
id
do
dem
harry
bellatrix
raised
her
wand
crucio
neville
screamed
his
legs
drawn
up
to
his
chest
so
that
the
Death
Eater
holding
him
was
momentarily
holding
him
off
the
ground
the
Death
Eater
dropped
him
and
he
fell
to
the
floor
twitching
and
screaming
in
agony
that
was
just
a
taster
said
Bellatrix
raising
her
wand
so
that
Nevilles
screams
stopped
and
he
lay
sobbing
at
her
feet
she
turned
and
gazed
up
at
Harry
now
Potter
either
give
us
the
prophecy
or
watch
your
little
friend
die
the
hard
way
harry
did
not
have
to
think
there
was
no
choice
the
prophecy
was
hot
with
the
heat
of
his
clutching
hand
as
he
held
it
out
malfoy
jumped
forwards
to
take
it
then
high
above
them
two
more
doors
burst
open
and
five
more
people
sprinted
into
the
room
sirius
Lupin
Moody
Tonks
and
Kingsley
malfoy
turned
and
raised
his
wand
but
Tonks
had
already
sent
a
Stunning
Spell
right
at
him
harry
did
not
wait
to
see
whether
it
had
made
contact
but
dived
off
the
dais
out
of
the
way
the
death
Eaters
were
completely
distracted
by
the
appearance
of
the
members
of
the
Order
who
were
now
raining
spells
down
upon
them
as
they
jumped
from
step
to
step
towards
the
sunken
floor
through
the
darting
bodies
the
flashes
of
light
Harry
could
see
Neville
crawling
along
he
dodged
another
jet
of
red
light
and
flung
himself
flat
on
the
ground
to
reach
Neville
are
you
okay
he
yelled
as
another
spell
soared
inches
over
their
heads
yes
said
Neville
trying
to
pull
himself
up
and
Ron
i
dink
hes
all
righd
he
was
still
fighding
de
brain
when
I
lefd
the
stone
floor
between
them
exploded
as
a
spell
hit
it
leaving
a
crater
right
where
Nevilles
hand
had
been
only
seconds
before
both
scrambled
away
from
the
spot
then
a
thick
arm
came
out
of
nowhere
seized
Harry
around
the
neck
and
pulled
him
upright
so
that
his
toes
were
barely
touching
the
floor
give
it
to
me
growled
a
voice
in
his
ear
give
me
the
prophecy
the
man
was
pressing
so
tightly
on
Harrys
windpipe
that
he
could
not
breathe
through
watering
eyes
he
saw
Sirius
dueling
with
a
Death
Eater
some
ten
feet
away
Kingsley
was
fighting
two
at
once
Tonks
still
halfway
up
the
tiered
seats
was
firing
spells
down
at
Bellatrix
nobody
seemed
to
realize
that
Harry
was
dying
he
turned
his
wand
backwards
towards
the
mans
side
but
had
no
breath
to
utter
an
incantation
and
the
mans
free
hand
was
groping
towards
the
hand
in
which
Harry
was
grasping
the
prophecy
aargh
neville
had
come
lunging
out
of
nowhere
unable
to
articulate
a
spell
he
had
jabbed
Hermiones
wand
hard
into
the
eyehole
of
the
Death
Eaters
mask
the
man
relinquished
Harry
at
once
with
a
howl
of
pain
harry
whirled
around
to
face
him
and
gasped
stupefy
the
Death
Eater
keeled
over
backwards
and
his
mask
slipped
off
it
was
Macnair
Buckbeaks
would-be
killer
one
of
his
eyes
now
swollen
and
bloodshot
thanks
harry
said
to
Neville
pulling
him
aside
as
Sirius
and
his
Death
Eater
lurched
past
dueling
so
fiercely
that
their
wands
were
blurs
then
Harrys
foot
made
contact
with
something
round
and
hard
and
he
slipped
for
a
moment
he
thought
he
had
dropped
the
prophecy
but
then
he
saw
Moodys
magical
eye
spinning
away
across
the
floor
its
owner
was
lying
on
his
side
bleeding
from
the
head
and
his
attacker
was
now
bearing
down
upon
Harry
and
Neville
Dolohov
his
long
pale
face
twisted
with
glee
tarantallegra
he
shouted
his
wand
pointing
at
Neville
whose
legs
went
immediately
into
a
kind
of
frenzied
tap-dance
unbalancing
him
and
causing
him
to
fall
to
the
floor
again
now
potter
he
made
the
same
slashing
movement
with
his
wand
that
he
had
used
on
Hermione
just
as
Harry
yelled
Protego
harry
felt
something
streak
across
his
face
like
a
blunt
knife
the
force
of
it
knocked
him
sideways
and
he
fell
over
Nevilles
jerking
legs
but
the
Shield
Charm
had
stopped
the
worst
of
the
spell
dolohov
raised
his
wand
again
accio
proph
sirius
had
hurtled
out
of
nowhere
rammed
Dolohov
with
his
shoulder
and
sent
him
flying
out
of
the
way
the
prophecy
had
again
flown
to
the
tips
of
Harrys
fingers
but
he
had
managed
to
cling
on
to
it
now
Sirius
and
Dolohov
were
dueling
their
wands
flashing
like
swords
sparks
flying
from
their
wand-tips
dolohov
drew
back
his
wand
to
make
the
same
slashing
movement
he
had
used
on
Harry
and
hermione
springing
up
Harry
yelled
Petrificus
Totalus
once
again
Dolohovs
arms
and
legs
snapped
together
and
he
keeled
over
backwards
landing
with
a
crash
on
his
back
nice
one
shouted
Sirius
forcing
Harrys
head
down
as
a
pair
of
Stunning
Spells
flew
towards
them
now
I
want
you
to
get
out
of
they
both
ducked
again
a
jet
of
green
light
had
narrowly
missed
Sirius
across
the
room
Harry
saw
Tonks
fall
from
halfway
up
the
stone
steps
her
limp
form
toppling
from
stone
seat
to
stone
seat
and
Bellatrix
triumphant
running
back
towards
the
fray
harry
take
the
prophecy
grab
Neville
and
run
sirius
yelled
dashing
to
meet
Bellatrix
harry
did
not
see
what
happened
next
Kingsley
swayed
across
his
field
of
vision
battling
with
the
pockmarked
and
no
longer
masked
Rookwood
another
jet
of
green
light
flew
over
Harrys
head
as
he
launched
himself
towards
Neville
can
you
stand
he
bellowed
in
Nevilles
ear
as
Nevilles
legs
jerked
and
twitched
uncontrollably
put
your
arm
round
my
neck
neville
did
so
Harry
heaved
Nevilles
legs
were
still
flying
in
every
direction
they
would
not
support
him
and
then
out
of
nowhere
a
man
lunged
at
them
both
fell
backwards
Nevilles
legs
waving
wildly
like
an
overturned
beetles
Harry
with
his
left
arm
held
up
in
the
air
to
try
to
save
the
small
glass
ball
from
being
smashed
the
prophecy
give
me
the
prophecy
Potter
snarled
Lucius
Malfoys
voice
in
his
ear
and
harry
felt
the
tip
of
Malfoys
wand
pressing
hard
between
his
ribs
no
get
off
me
neville
catch
it
harry
flung
the
prophecy
across
the
floor
Neville
spun
himself
around
on
his
back
and
scooped
the
ball
to
his
chest
malfoy
pointed
the
wand
instead
at
Neville
but
Harry
jabbed
his
own
wand
back
over
his
shoulder
and
yelled
Impedimenta
malfoy
was
blasted
off
his
back
as
Harry
scrambled
up
again
he
looked
around
and
saw
Malfoy
smash
into
the
dais
on
which
Sirius
and
Bellatrix
were
now
dueling
malfoy
aimed
his
wand
at
harry
and
Neville
again
but
before
he
could
draw
breath
to
strike
Lupin
had
jumped
between
them
harry
round
up
the
others
and
go
harry
seized
Neville
by
the
shoulder
of
his
robes
and
lifted
him
bodily
on
to
the
first
tier
of
stone
steps
Nevilles
legs
twitched
and
jerked
and
would
not
support
his
weight
Harry
heaved
again
with
all
the
strength
he
possessed
and
they
climbed
another
step
a
spell
hit
the
stone
bench
at
Harrys
heel
it
crumbled
away
and
he
fell
back
to
the
step
below
neville
sank
to
the
ground
his
legs
still
jerking
and
thrashing
and
he
thrust
the
prophecy
into
his
pocket
come
on
said
Harry
desperately
hauling
at
Nevilles
robes
just
try
and
push
with
your
legs
he
gave
another
stupendous
heave
and
Nevilles
robes
tore
all
along
the
left
seam
the
small
spun-glass
ball
dropped
from
his
pocket
and
before
either
of
them
could
catch
it
one
of
nevilles
floundering
feet
kicked
it
it
flew
some
ten
feet
to
their
right
and
smashed
on
the
step
beneath
them
as
both
of
them
stared
at
the
place
where
it
had
broken
appalled
at
what
had
happened
a
pearly-white
figure
with
hugely
magnified
eyes
rose
into
the
air
unnoticed
by
any
but
them
harry
could
see
its
mouth
moving
but
in
all
the
crashes
and
screams
and
yells
surrounding
them
not
one
word
of
the
prophecy
could
he
hear
the
figure
stopped
speaking
and
dissolved
into
nothingness
harry
Ib
sorry
cried
Neville
his
face
anguished
as
his
legs
continued
to
flounder
ib
so
sorry
Harry
I
didnd
bean
do
it
doesnt
matter
harry
shouted
just
try
and
stand
lets
get
out
of
dubbledore
said
Neville
his
sweaty
face
suddenly
transported
staring
over
Harrys
shoulder
what
dubbledore
harry
turned
to
look
where
Neville
was
staring
directly
above
them
framed
in
the
doorway
from
the
Brain
Room
stood
Albus
Dumbledore
his
wand
aloft
his
face
white
and
furious
harry
felt
a
kind
of
electric
charge
surge
through
every
particle
of
his
body
they
were
saved
dumbledore
sped
down
the
steps
past
Neville
and
Harry
who
had
no
more
thoughts
of
leaving
dumbledore
was
already
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
when
the
Death
Eaters
nearest
realized
he
was
there
and
yelled
to
the
others
one
of
the
Death
Eaters
ran
for
it
scrabbling
like
a
monkey
up
the
stone
steps
opposite
dumbledores
spell
pulled
him
back
as
easily
and
effortlessly
as
though
he
had
hooked
him
with
an
invisible
line
only
one
pair
was
still
battling
apparently
unaware
of
the
new
arrival
harry
saw
Sirius
duck
bellatrixs
jet
of
red
light
he
was
laughing
at
her
come
on
you
can
do
better
than
that
he
yelled
his
voice
echoing
around
the
cavernous
room
the
second
jet
of
light
hit
him
squarely
on
the
chest
the
laughter
had
not
quite
died
from
his
face
but
his
eyes
widened
in
shock
harry
released
Neville
though
he
was
unaware
of
doing
so
he
was
jumping
down
the
steps
again
pulling
out
his
wand
as
Dumbledore
too
turned
towards
the
dais
it
seemed
to
take
Sirius
an
age
to
fall
his
body
curved
in
a
graceful
arc
as
he
sank
backwards
through
the
ragged
veil
hanging
from
the
arch
harry
saw
the
look
of
mingled
fear
and
surprise
on
his
godfathers
wasted
once-handsome
face
as
he
fell
through
the
ancient
doorway
and
disappeared
behind
the
veil
which
fluttered
for
a
moment
as
though
in
a
high
wind
then
fell
back
into
place
harry
heard
Bellatrix
Lestranges
triumphant
scream
but
knew
it
meant
nothing
Sirius
had
only
just
fallen
through
the
archway
he
would
reappear
from
the
other
side
any
second
but
Sirius
did
not
reappear
sirius
harry
yelled
sirius
he
had
reached
the
floor
his
breath
coming
in
searing
gasps
sirius
must
be
just
behind
the
curtain
he
Harry
would
pull
him
back
out
but
as
he
reached
the
ground
and
sprinted
towards
the
dais
Lupin
grabbed
Harry
around
the
chest
holding
him
back
theres
nothing
you
can
do
Harry
get
him
save
him
hes
only
just
gone
through
its
too
late
Harry
we
can
still
reach
him
Harry
struggled
hard
and
viciously
but
Lupin
would
not
let
go
theres
nothing
you
can
do
Harry
nothing
hes
gone
chapter
thirty-six
the
Only
One
He
Ever
Feared
he
hasnt
gone
harry
yelled
he
did
not
believe
it
he
would
not
believe
it
still
he
fought
Lupin
with
every
bit
of
strength
he
had
lupin
did
not
understand
people
hid
behind
that
curtain
Harry
had
heard
them
whispering
the
first
time
he
had
entered
the
room
sirius
was
hiding
simply
lurking
out
of
sight
sirius
he
bellowed
sirius
he
cant
come
back
Harry
said
Lupin
his
voice
breaking
as
he
struggled
to
contain
Harry
he
cant
come
back
because
hes
d
he
is
not
dead
roared
Harry
sirius
there
was
movement
going
on
around
them
pointless
bustling
the
flashes
of
more
spells
to
harry
it
was
meaningless
noise
the
deflected
curses
flying
past
them
did
not
matter
nothing
mattered
except
that
Lupin
should
stop
pretending
that
Sirius
who
was
standing
feet
from
them
behind
that
old
curtain
was
not
going
to
emerge
at
any
moment
shaking
back
his
dark
hair
and
eager
to
re-enter
the
battle
lupin
dragged
Harry
away
from
the
dais
harry
still
staring
at
the
archway
was
angry
at
Sirius
now
for
keeping
him
waiting
but
some
part
of
him
realized
even
as
he
fought
to
break
free
from
Lupin
that
Sirius
had
never
kept
him
waiting
before
sirius
had
risked
everything
always
to
see
Harry
to
help
him
if
sirius
was
not
reappearing
out
of
that
archway
when
Harry
was
yelling
for
him
as
though
his
life
depended
on
it
the
only
possible
explanation
was
that
he
could
not
come
back
that
he
really
was
dumbledore
had
most
of
the
remaining
Death
Eaters
grouped
in
the
middle
of
the
room
seemingly
immobilized
by
invisible
ropes
Mad-Eye
Moody
had
crawled
across
the
room
to
where
Tonks
lay
and
was
attempting
to
revive
her
behind
the
dais
there
were
still
hashes
of
light
grunts
and
cries
Kingsley
had
run
forward
to
continue
Siriuss
duel
with
Bellatrix
harry
neville
had
slid
down
the
stone
benches
one
by
one
to
the
place
where
Harry
stood
harry
was
no
longer
struggling
against
Lupin
who
maintained
a
precautionary
grip
on
his
arm
nevertheless
harry
ib
really
sorry
said
Neville
his
legs
were
still
dancing
uncontrollably
was
dad
man
was
Sirius
Black
a
a
friend
of
yours
harry
nodded
here
said
Lupin
quietly
and
pointing
his
wand
at
Nevilles
legs
he
said
Finite
the
spell
was
lifted
Nevilles
legs
fell
back
to
the
floor
and
remained
still
lupins
face
was
pale
lets
lets
find
the
others
where
are
they
all
Neville
lupin
turned
away
from
the
archway
as
he
spoke
it
sounded
as
though
every
word
was
causing
him
pain
deyre
all
back
dere
said
Neville
a
brain
addacked
Ron
bud
I
dink
hes
all
righd
and
herbiones
unconscious
bud
we
could
feel
a
bulse
there
was
a
loud
bang
and
a
yell
from
behind
the
dais
harry
saw
Kingsley
hit
the
ground
yelling
in
pain
Bellatrix
Lestrange
turned
tail
and
ran
as
Dumbledore
whipped
around
he
aimed
a
spell
at
her
but
she
deflected
it
she
was
halfway
up
the
steps
now
harry
no
cried
Lupin
but
Harry
had
already
ripped
his
arm
from
Lupins
slackened
grip
she
killed
sirius
bellowed
Harry
she
killed
him
ill
kill
her
and
he
was
off
scrambling
up
the
stone
benches
people
were
shouting
behind
him
but
he
did
not
care
the
hem
of
Bellatrixs
robes
whipped
out
of
sight
ahead
and
they
were
back
in
the
room
where
the
brains
were
swimming
she
aimed
a
curse
over
her
shoulder
the
tank
rose
into
the
air
and
tipped
harry
was
deluged
in
the
foul-smelling
potion
within
the
brains
slipped
and
slid
over
him
and
began
spinning
their
long
colored
tentacles
but
he
shouted
Wingardium
Leviosa
and
they
flew
off
him
up
into
the
air
slipping
and
sliding
he
ran
on
towards
the
door
he
leapt
over
Luna
who
was
groaning
on
the
floor
past
Ginny
who
said
Harry
what
past
Ron
who
giggled
feebly
and
hermione
who
was
still
unconscious
he
wrenched
open
the
door
into
the
circular
black
hall
and
saw
Bellatrix
disappearing
through
a
door
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
beyond
her
was
the
corridor
leading
back
to
the
lifts
he
ran
but
she
had
slammed
the
door
behind
her
and
the
walls
were
already
rotating
once
more
he
was
surrounded
by
streaks
of
blue
light
from
the
whirling
candelabra
wheres
the
exit
he
shouted
desperately
as
the
wall
rumbled
to
a
halt
again
wheres
the
way
out
the
room
seemed
to
have
been
waiting
for
him
to
ask
the
door
right
behind
him
flew
open
and
the
corridor
towards
the
lifts
stretched
ahead
of
him
torch-lit
and
empty
he
ran
he
could
hear
a
lift
clattering
ahead
he
sprinted
up
the
passageway
swung
around
the
corner
and
slammed
his
fist
on
to
the
button
to
call
a
second
lift
it
jangled
and
banged
lower
and
lower
the
grilles
slid
open
and
Harry
dashed
inside
now
hammering
the
button
marked
Atrium
the
doors
slid
shut
and
he
was
rising
he
forced
his
way
out
of
the
lift
before
the
grilles
were
fully
open
and
looked
around
bellatrix
was
almost
at
the
telephone
lift
at
the
other
end
of
the
hall
but
she
looked
back
as
he
sprinted
towards
her
and
aimed
another
spell
at
him
he
dodged
behind
the
Fountain
of
Magical
Brethren
the
spell
zoomed
past
him
and
hit
the
wrought
gold
gates
at
the
other
end
of
the
Atrium
so
that
they
rang
like
bells
there
were
no
more
footsteps
she
had
stopped
running
he
crouched
behind
the
statues
listening
come
out
come
out
little
Harry
she
called
in
her
mock
baby
voice
which
echoed
off
the
polished
wooden
floors
what
did
you
come
after
me
for
then
i
thought
you
were
here
to
avenge
my
dear
cousin
i
am
shouted
Harry
and
a
score
of
ghostly
Harrys
seemed
to
chorus
I
am
i
am
i
am
all
around
the
room
aaaaaah
did
you
love
him
little
baby
Potter
hatred
rose
in
Harry
such
as
he
had
never
known
before
he
flung
himself
out
from
behind
the
fountain
and
bellowed
Crucio
bellatrix
screamed
the
spell
had
knocked
her
off
her
feet
but
she
did
not
writhe
and
shriek
with
pain
as
Neville
had
she
was
already
back
on
her
feet
breathless
no
longer
laughing
harry
dodged
behind
the
golden
fountain
again
her
counter-spell
hit
the
head
of
the
handsome
wizard
which
was
blown
off
and
landed
twenty
feet
away
gouging
long
scratches
into
the
wooden
floor
never
used
an
Unforgivable
Curse
before
have
you
boy
she
yelled
she
had
abandoned
her
baby
voice
now
you
need
to
mean
them
Potter

need
to
really
want
to
cause
pain
to
enjoy
it
righteous
anger

hurt
me
for
long
Ill

you
how
it
is
done

I
ill
give
you
a
lesson
harry
was
edging
around
the
fountain
on
the
other
side
when
she
screamed
Crucio
and
he
was
forced
to
duck
down
again
as
the
centaurs
arm
holding
its
bow
span
off
and
landed
with
a
crash
on
the
floor
a
short
distance
from
the
golden
wizards
head
potter
you
cannot
win
against
me
she
cried
he
could
hear
her
moving
to
the
right
trying
to
get
a
clear
shot
of
him
he
backed
around
the
statue
away
from
her
crouching
behind
the
centaurs
legs
his
head
level
with
the
house-elfs
i
was
and
am
the
Dark
Lords
most
loyal
servant
i
learned
the
Dark
Arts
from
him
and
I
know
spells
of
such
power
that
you
pathetic
little
boy
can
never
hope
to
compete
stupefy
yelled
Harry
he
had
edged
right
around
to
where
the
goblin
stood
beaming
up
at
the
now
headless
wizard
and
taken
aim
at
her
back
as
she
peered
around
the
fountain
she
reacted
so
fast
he
barely
had
time
to
duck
protego
the
jet
of
red
light
his
own
Stunning
Spell
bounced
back
at
him
harry
scrambled
back
behind
the
fountain
and
one
of
the
goblins
ears
went
flying
across
the
room
potter
Im
going
to
give
you
one
chance
shouted
Bellatrix
give
me
the
prophecy
roll
it
out
towards
me
now
and
I
may
spare
your
life
well
youre
going
to
have
to
kill
me
because
its
gone
harry
roared
and
as
he
shouted
it
pain
seared
across
his
forehead
his
scar
was
on
fire
again
and
he
felt
a
surge
of
fury
that
was
quite
unconnected
with
his
own
rage
and
he
knows
said
Harry
with
a
mad
laugh
to
match
bellatrixs
own
your
dear
old
mate
Voldemort
knows
its
gone
hes
not
going
to
be
happy
with
you
is
he
what
what
do
you
mean
she
cried
and
for
the
first
time
there
was
fear
in
her
voice
the
prophecy
smashed
when
I
was
trying
to
get
Neville
up
the
steps
what
do
you
think
voldemortll
say
about
that
then
his
scar
seared
and
burned
the
pain
of
it
was
making
his
eyes
stream
liar
she
shrieked
but
he
could
hear
the
terror
behind
the
anger
now
youve
got
it
potter
and
you
will
give
it
to
me
accio
prophecy
accio
prophecy
harry
laughed
again
because
he
knew
it
would
incense
her
the
pain
building
in
his
head
so
badly
he
thought
his
skull
might
burst
he
waved
his
empty
hand
from
behind
the
one-eared
goblin
and
withdrew
it
quickly
as
she
sent
another
jet
of
green
light
flying
at
him
nothing
there
he
shouted
nothing
to
summon
it
smashed
and
nobody
heard
what
it
said
tell
your
boss
that
no
she
screamed
it
isnt
true
youre
lying
master
I
tried
I
tried
do
not
punish
me
dont
waste
your
breath
yelled
Harry
his
eyes
screwed
up
against
the
pain
in
his
scar
now
more
terrible
than
ever
he
cant
hear
you
from
here
cant
I
Potter
said
a
high
cold
voice
harry
opened
his
eyes
tall
thin
and
black-hooded
his
terrible
snakelike
face
white
and
gaunt
his
scarlet
slit-pupilled
eyes
staring
lord
Voldemort
had
appeared
in
the
middle
of
the
hall
his
wand
pointing
at
harry
who
stood
frozen
quite
unable
to
move
so
you
smashed
my
prophecy
said
Voldemort
softly
staring
at
Harry
with
those
pitiless
red
eyes
no
Bella
he
is
not
lying
i
see
the
truth
looking
at
me
from
within
his
worthless
mind
months
of
preparation
months
of
effort
and
my
Death
Eaters
have
let
Harry
Potter
thwart
me
again
master
I
am
sorry
I
knew
not
I
was
fighting
the
Animagus
Black
sobbed
Bellatrix
flinging
herself
down
at
Voldemorts
feet
as
he
paced
slowly
nearer
master
you
should
know
be
quiet
Bella
said
Voldemort
dangerously
i
shall
deal
with
you
in
a
moment
do
you
think
i
have
entered
the
Ministry
of
Magic
to
hear
your
sniveling
apologies
but
Master
he
is
here
he
is
below
voldemort
paid
no
attention
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
to
you
Potter
he
said
quietly
you
have
irked
me
too
often
for
too
long
avada
kedavra
harry
had
not
even
opened
his
mouth
to
resist
his
mind
was
blank
his
wand
pointing
uselessly
at
the
floor
but
the
headless
golden
statue
of
the
wizard
in
the
fountain
had
sprung
alive
leaping
from
its
plinth
to
land
with
a
crash
on
the
floor
between
Harry
and
Voldemort
the
spell
merely
glanced
off
its
chest
as
the
statue
flung
out
its
arms
to
protect
Harry
what
cried
Voldemort
staring
around
and
then
he
breathed
Dumbledore
harry
looked
behind
him
his
heart
pounding
dumbledore
was
standing
in
front
of
the
golden
gates
voldemort
raised
his
wand
and
another
jet
of
green
light
streaked
at
Dumbledore
who
turned
and
was
gone
in
a
whirling
of
his
cloak
next
second
he
had
reappeared
behind
Voldemort
and
waved
his
wand
towards
the
remnants
of
the
fountain
the
other
statues
sprang
to
life
the
statue
of
the
witch
ran
at
Bellatrix
who
screamed
and
sent
spells
streaming
uselessly
off
its
chest
before
it
dived
at
her
pinning
her
to
the
floor
meanwhile
the
goblin
and
the
house-elf
scuttled
towards
the
fireplaces
set
along
the
wall
and
the
one-armed
centaur
galloped
at
Voldemort
who
vanished
and
reappeared
beside
the
pool
the
headless
statue
thrust
Harry
backwards
away
from
the
fight
as
Dumbledore
advanced
on
Voldemort
and
the
golden
centaur
cantered
around
them
both
it
was
foolish
to
come
here
tonight
Tom
said
Dumbledore
calmly
the
Aurors
are
on
their
way
by
which
time
I
shall
be
gone
and
you
will
be
dead
spat
Voldemort
he
sent
another
killing
curse
at
Dumbledore
but
missed
instead
hitting
the
security
guards
desk
which
burst
into
flame
dumbledore
flicked
his
own
wand
the
force
of
the
spell
that
emanated
from
it
was
such
that
harry
though
shielded
by
his
golden
guard
felt
his
hair
stand
on
end
as
it
passed
and
this
time
voldemort
was
forced
to
conjure
a
shining
silver
shield
out
of
thin
air
to
deflect
it
the
spell
whatever
it
was
caused
no
visible
damage
to
the
shield
though
a
deep
gong-like
note
reverberated
from
it
an
oddly
chilling
sound
you
do
not
seek
to
kill
me
Dumbledore
called
Voldemort
his
scarlet
eyes
narrowed
over
the
top
of
the
shield
above
such
brutality
are
you
we
both
know
that
there
are
other
ways
of
destroying
a
man
Tom
Dumbledore
said
calmly
continuing
to
walk
towards
Voldemort
as
though
he
had
not
a
fear
in
the
world
as
though
nothing
had
happened
to
interrupt
his
stroll
up
the
hall
merely
taking
your
life
would
not
satisfy
me
I
admit
there
is
nothing
worse
than
death
Dumbledore
snarled
Voldemort
you
are
quite
wrong
said
Dumbledore
still
closing
in
upon
Voldemort
and
speaking
as
lightly
as
though
they
were
discussing
the
matter
over
drinks
harry
felt
scared
to
see
him
walking
along
undefended
shieldless
he
wanted
to
cry
out
a
warning
but
his
headless
guard
kept
shunting
him
backwards
towards
the
wall
blocking
his
every
attempt
to
get
out
from
behind
it
indeed
your
failure
to
understand
that
there
are
things
much
worse
than
death
has
always
been
your
greatest
weakness
another
jet
of
green
light
flew
from
behind
the
silver
shield
this
time
it
was
the
one-armed
centaur
galloping
in
front
of
Dumbledore
that
took
the
blast
and
shattered
into
a
hundred
pieces
but
before
the
fragments
had
even
hit
the
floor
Dumbledore
had
drawn
back
his
wand
and
waved
it
as
though
brandishing
a
whip
a
long
thin
flame
flew
from
the
tip
it
wrapped
itself
around
Voldemort
shield
and
all
for
a
moment
it
seemed
Dumbledore
had
won
but
then
the
fiery
rope
became
a
serpent
which
relinquished
its
hold
on
Voldemort
at
once
and
turned
hissing
furiously
to
face
Dumbledore
voldemort
vanished
the
snake
reared
from
the
floor
ready
to
strike
there
was
a
burst
of
flame
in
midair
above
Dumbledore
just
as
Voldemort
reappeared
standing
on
the
plinth
in
the
middle
of
the
pool
where
so
recently
the
five
statues
had
stood
look
out
harry
yelled
but
even
as
he
shouted
another
jet
of
green
light
flew
at
Dumbledore
from
Voldemorts
wand
and
the
snake
had
struck
fawkes
swooped
down
in
front
of
Dumbledore
opened
his
beak
wide
and
swallowed
the
jet
of
green
light
whole
he
burst
into
flame
and
fell
to
the
floor
small
wrinkled
and
flightless
at
the
same
moment
Dumbledore
brandished
his
wand
in
one
long
fluid
movement
the
snake
which
had
been
an
instant
from
sinking
its
fangs
into
him
flew
high
into
the
air
and
vanished
in
a
wisp
of
dark
smoke
and
the
water
in
the
pool
rose
up
and
covered
Voldemort
like
a
cocoon
of
molten
glass
for
a
few
seconds
Voldemort
was
visible
only
as
a
dark
rippling
faceless
figure
shimmering
and
indistinct
upon
the
plinth
clearly
struggling
to
throw
off
the
suffocating
mass
then
he
was
gone
and
the
water
fell
with
a
crash
back
into
its
pool
slopping
wildly
over
the
sides
drenching
the
polished
floor
master
screamed
Bellatrix
sure
it
was
over
sure
Voldemort
had
decided
to
flee
Harry
made
to
run
out
from
behind
his
statue
guard
but
Dumbledore
bellowed
Stay
where
you
are
Harry
for
the
first
time
Dumbledore
sounded
frightened
harry
could
not
see
why
the
hall
was
quite
empty
but
for
themselves
the
sobbing
Bellatrix
still
trapped
under
the
witch
statue
and
the
baby
phoenix
Fawkes
croaking
feebly
on
the
floor
and
then
harry's
scar
burst
open
and
he
knew
he
was
dead
it
was
pain
beyond
imagining
pain
past
endurance
he
was
gone
from
the
hall
he
was
locked
in
the
coils
of
a
creature
with
red
eyes
so
tightly
bound
that
Harry
did
not
know
where
his
body
ended
and
the
creatures
began
they
were
fused
together
bound
by
pain
and
there
was
no
escape
and
when
the
creature
spoke
it
used
Harrys
mouth
so
that
in
his
agony
he
felt
his
jaw
move
kill
me
now
Dumbledore
blinded
and
dying
every
part
of
him
screaming
for
release
Harry
felt
the
creature
use
him
again
if
death
is
nothing
Dumbledore
kill
the
boy
let
the
pain
stop
thought
Harry
let
him
kill
us
end
it
Dumbledore
death
is
nothing
compared
to
this
and
Ill
see
Sirius
again
and
as
Harrys
heart
filled
with
emotion
the
creatures
coils
loosened
the
pain
was
gone
Harry
was
lying
face
down
on
the
floor
his
glasses
gone
shivering
as
though
he
lay
upon
ice
not
wood
and
there
were
voices
echoing
through
the
hall
more
voices
than
there
should
have
been
harry
opened
his
eyes
saw
his
glasses
lying
by
the
heel
of
the
headless
statue
that
had
been
guarding
him
but
which
now
lay
flat
on
its
back
cracked
and
immobile
he
put
them
on
and
raised
his
head
a
little
to
find
Dumbledores
crooked
nose
inches
from
his
own
are
you
all
right
Harry
yes
said
Harry
shaking
so
violently
he
could
not
hold
his
head
up
properly
yeah
Im
wheres
Voldemort
where
who
are
all
these
whats
the
Atrium
was
full
of
people
the
floor
was
reflecting
the
emerald
green
flames
that
had
burst
into
life
in
all
the
fireplaces
along
one
wall
and
streams
of
witches
and
wizards
were
emerging
from
them
as
Dumbledore
pulled
him
back
to
his
feet
Harry
saw
the
tiny
gold
statues
of
the
house-elf
and
the
goblin
leading
a
stunned-looking
Cornelius
Fudge
forward
he
was
there
shouted
a
scarlet-robed
man
with
a
ponytail
who
was
pointing
at
a
pile
of
golden
rubble
on
the
other
side
of
the
hall
where
Bellatrix
had
lain
trapped
only
moments
before
i
saw
him
mr.
Fudge
I
swear
it
was
You-Know-Who
he
grabbed
a
woman
and
disapparated
i
know
Williamson
I
know
I
saw
him
too
gibbered
Fudge
who
was
wearing
pajamas
under
his
pinstriped
cloak
and
was
gasping
as
though
he
had
just
run
miles
merlins
beard
here
here
in
the
Ministry
of
Magic
great
heavens
above
it
doesnt
seem
possible
my
word
how
can
this
be
if
you
proceed
downstairs
into
the
Department
of
Mysteries
Cornelius
said
Dumbledore
apparently
satisfied
that
Harry
was
all
right
and
walking
forwards
so
that
the
newcomers
realized
he
was
there
for
the
first
time
a
few
of
them
raised
their
wands
others
simply
looked
amazed
the
statues
of
the
elf
and
goblin
applauded
and
Fudge
jumped
so
much
that
his
slipperclad
feet
left
the
floor
you
will
find
several
escaped
Death
Eaters
contained
in
the
Death
Chamber
bound
by
an
Anti-Disapparation
Jinx
and
awaiting
your
decision
as
to
what
to
do
with
them
dumbledore
gasped
Fudge
beside
himself
with
amazement
you-here-i-i
he
looked
wildly
around
at
the
Aurors
he
had
brought
with
him
and
it
could
not
have
been
clearer
that
he
was
in
half
a
mind
to
cry
Seize
him
cornelius
I
am
ready
to
fight
your
men
and
win
again
said
Dumbledore
in
a
thunderous
voice
but
a
few
minutes
ago
you
saw
proof
with
your
own
eyes
that
I
have
been
telling
you
the
truth
for
a
year
lord
Voldemort
has
returned
you
have
been
chasing
the
wrong
man
for
twelve
months
and
it
is
time
you
listened
to
sense
i
dont
well
blustered
Fudge
looking
around
as
though
hoping
somebody
was
going
to
tell
him
what
to
do
when
nobody
did
he
said
Very
well
Dawlish
williamson
go
down
to
the
department
of
Mysteries
and
see
dumbledore
you
you
will
need
to
tell
me
exactly
the
fountain
of
Magical
Brethren
what
happened
he
added
in
a
kind
of
whimper
staring
around
at
the
floor
where
the
remains
of
the
statues
of
the
witch
wizard
and
centaur
now
lay
scattered
we
can
discuss
that
after
I
have
sent
Harry
back
to
Hogwarts
said
Dumbledore
harry
Harry
Potter
fudge
wheeled
around
and
stared
at
Harry
who
was
still
standing
against
the
wall
beside
the
fallen
statue
that
had
guarded
him
during
Dumbledore
and
Voldemorts
duel
he
here
said
Fudge
goggling
at
Harry
why
whats
all
this
about
i
shall
explain
everything
repeated
Dumbledore
when
Harry
is
back
at
school
he
walked
away
from
the
pool
to
the
place
where
the
golden
wizards
head
lay
on
the
floor
he
pointed
his
wand
at
it
and
muttered
Portus
the
head
glowed
blue
and
trembled
noisily
against
the
wooden
floor
for
a
few
seconds
then
became
still
once
more
now
see
here
Dumbledore
said
Fudge
as
Dumbledore
picked
up
the
head
and
walked
back
to
Harry
carrying
it
you
havent
got
authorization
for
that
Portkey
you
cant
do
things
like
that
right
in
front
of
the
Minister
for
Magic
you
you
his
voice
faltered
as
Dumbledore
surveyed
him
magisterially
over
his
half-moon
spectacles
you
will
give
the
order
to
remove
Dolores
Umbridge
from
Hogwarts
said
Dumbledore
you
will
tell
your
Aurors
to
stop
searching
for
my
Care
of
Magical
Creatures
teacher
so
that
he
can
return
to
work
i
will
give
you
dumbledore
pulled
a
watch
with
twelve
hands
from
his
pocket
and
surveyed
it
half
an
hour
of
my
time
tonight
in
which
I
think
we
shall
be
more
than
able
to
cover
the
important
points
of
what
has
happened
here
after
that
I
shall
need
to
return
to
my
school
if
you
need
more
help
from
me
you
are
of
course
more
than
welcome
to
contact

fudge
goggled
worse
than
ever
his
mouth
was
open
and
his
round
face
grew
pinker
under
his
rumpled
grey
hair
i
you
dumbledore
turned
his
back
on
him
take
this
Portkey
Harry
he
held
out
the
golden
head
of
the
statue
and
Harry
placed
his
hand
on
it
past
caring
what
he
did
next
or
where
he
went
i
shall
see
you
in
half
an
hour
said
Dumbledore
quietly
One
two
three
harry
felt
the
familiar
sensation
of
a
hook
being
jerked
behind
his
navel
the
polished
wooden
floor
was
gone
from
beneath
his
feet
the
Atrium
Fudge
and
Dumbledore
had
all
disappeared
and
he
was
flying
forwards
in
a
whirlwind
of
color
and
sound

the
Lost
Prophecy
harrys
feet
hit
solid
ground
his
knees
buckled
a
little
and
the
golden
wizards
head
fell
with
a
resounding
dunk
to
the
floor
he
looked
around
and
saw
that
he
had
arrived
in
Dumbledores
office
everything
seemed
to
have
repaired
itself
during
the
Headmasters
absence
the
delicate
silver
instruments
stood
once
more
on
the
spindle-legged
tables
puffing
and
whirring
serenely
the
portraits
of
the
headmasters
and
headmistresses
were
snoozing
in
their
frames
heads
lolling
back
in
armchairs
or
against
the
edge
of
the
picture
harry
looked
through
the
window
there
was
a
cool
line
of
pale
green
along
the
horizon
dawn
was
approaching
the
silence
and
the
stillness
broken
only
by
the
occasional
grunt
or
snuffle
of
a
sleeping
portrait
was
unbearable
to
him
if
his
surroundings
could
have
reflected
the
feelings
inside
him
the
pictures
would
have
been
screaming
in
pain
he
walked
around
the
quiet
beautiful
office
breathing
quickly
trying
not
to
think
but
he
had
to
think
there
was
no
escape
it
was
his
fault
Sirius
had
died
it
was
all
his
fault
if
he
Harry
had
not
been
stupid
enough
to
fall
for
Voldemorts
trick
if
he
had
not
been
so
convinced
that
what
he
had
seen
in
his
dream
was
real
if
he
had
only
opened
his
mind
to
the
possibility
that
Voldemort
was
as
Hermione
had
said
banking
on
Harrys
love
of
playing
the
hero
it
was
unbearable
he
would
not
think
about
it
he
could
not
stand
it
there
was
a
terrible
hollow
inside
him
he
did
not
want
to
feel
or
examine
a
dark
hole
where
Sirius
had
been
where
Sirius
had
vanished
he
did
not
want
to
have
to
be
alone
with
that
great
silent
space
he
could
not
stand
it
a
picture
behind
him
gave
a
particularly
loud
grunting
snore
and
a
cool
voice
said
Ah
harry
Potter
phineas
Nigellus
gave
a
long
yawn
stretching
his
arms
as
he
surveyed
Harry
out
of
shrewd
narrow
eyes
and
what
brings
you
here
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
said
Phineas
eventually
This
office
is
supposed
to
be
barred
to
all
but
the
rightful
Headmaster
or
has
Dumbledore
sent
you
here
oh
dont
tell
me
he
gave
another
shuddering
yawn
another
message
for
my
worthless
great-great-grandson
harry
could
not
speak
phineas
Nigellus
did
not
know
that
Sirius
was
dead
but
Harry
could
not
tell
him
to
say
it
aloud
would
be
to
make
it
final
absolute
irretrievable
a
few
more
of
the
portraits
had
stirred
now
terror
of
being
interrogated
made
Harry
stride
across
the
room
and
seize
the
doorknob
it
would
not
turn
he
was
shut
in
i
hope
this
means
said
the
corpulent
red-nosed
wizard
who
hung
on
the
wall
behind
the
headmasters
desk
that
Dumbledore
will
soon
be
back
among
us
harry
turned
the
wizard
was
surveying
him
with
great
interest
harry
nodded
he
tugged
again
on
the
doorknob
behind
his
back
but
it
remained
immovable
oh
good
said
the
wizard
it
has
been
very
dull
without
him
very
dull
indeed
he
settled
himself
on
the
throne-like
chair
on
which
he
had
been
painted
and
smiled
benignly
upon
Harry
dumbledore
thinks
very
highly
of
you
as
I
am
sure
you
know
he
said
comfortably
oh
yes
holds
you
in
great
esteem
the
guilt
filling
the
whole
of
Harrys
chest
like
some
monstrous
weighty
parasite
now
writhed
and
squirmed
harry
could
not
stand
this
he
could
not
stand
being
himself
any
more
he
had
never
felt
more
trapped
inside
his
own
head
and
body
never
wished
so
intensely
that
he
could
be
somebody
anybody
else
the
empty
fireplace
burst
into
emerald
green
flame
making
Harry
leap
away
from
the
door
staring
at
the
man
spinning
inside
the
grate
as
Dumbledores
tall
form
unfolded
itself
from
the
fire
the
wizards
and
witches
on
the
surrounding
walls
jerked
awake
many
of
them
giving
cries
of
welcome
thank
you
said
Dumbledore
softly
he
did
not
look
at
Harry
at
first
but
walked
over
to
the
perch
beside
the
door
and
withdrew
from
an
inside
pocket
of
his
robes
the
tiny
ugly
featherless
Fawkes
whom
he
placed
gently
on
the
tray
of
soft
ashes
beneath
the
golden
post
where
the
full-grown
Fawkes
usually
stood
well
Harry
said
Dumbledore
finally
turning
away
from
the
baby
bird
you
will
be
pleased
to
hear
that
none
of
your
fellow
students
are
going
to
suffer
lasting
damage
from
the
nights
events
harry
tried
to
say
Good
but
no
sound
came
out
it
seemed
to
him
that
Dumbledore
was
reminding
him
of
the
amount
of
damage
he
had
caused
and
although
Dumbledore
was
for
once
looking
at
him
directly
and
although
his
expression
was
kindly
rather
than
accusatory
Harry
could
not
bear
to
meet
his
eyes
madam
Pomfrey
is
patching
everybody
up
said
Dumbledore
nymphadora
Tonks
may
need
to
spend
a
little
time
in
st.
Mungos
but
it
seems
she
will
make
a
full
recovery
harry
contented
himself
with
nodding
at
the
carpet
which
was
growing
lighter
as
the
sky
outside
grew
paler
he
was
sure
all
the
portraits
around
the
room
were
listening
closely
to
every
word
dumbledore
spoke
wondering
where
Dumbledore
and
Harry
had
been
and
why
there
had
been
injuries
i
know
how
youre
feeling
Harry
said
Dumbledore
very
quietly
no
you
dont
said
Harry
and
his
voice
was
suddenly
loud
and
strong
white-hot
anger
leapt
inside
him
Dumbledore
knew
nothing
about
his
feelings
you
see
Dumbledore
said
Phineas
Nigellus
slyly
Never
try
to
understand
the
students
they
hate
it
they
would
much
rather
be
tragically
misunderstood
wallow
in
self-pity
stew
in
their
own
thats
enough
Phineas
said
Dumbledore
harry
turned
his
back
on
Dumbledore
and
stared
determinedly
out
of
the
window
he
could
see
the
Quidditch
stadium
in
the
distance
sirius
had
appeared
there
once
disguised
as
the
shaggy
black
dog
so
he
could
watch
Harry
play
he
had
probably
come
to
see
whether
Harry
was
as
good
as
James
had
been
harry
had
never
asked
him
there
is
no
shame
in
what
you
are
feeling
Harry
said
Dumbledores
voice
on
the
contrary
the
fact
that
you
can
feel
pain
like
this
is
your
greatest
strength
harry
felt
the
white-hot
anger
lick
his
insides
blazing
in
the
terrible
emptiness
filling
him
with
the
desire
to
hurt
Dumbledore
for
his
calmness
and
his
empty
words
my
greatest
strength
is
it
said
Harry
his
voice
shaking
as
he
stared
out
at
the
Quidditch
stadium
no
longer
seeing
it
you
havent
got
a
clue
you
dont
know
what
dont
I
know
asked
Dumbledore
calmly
it
was
too
much
harry
turned
around
shaking
with
rage
i
dont
want
to
talk
about
how
I
feel
all
right
harry
suffering
like
this
proves
you
are
still
a
man
this
pain
is
part
of
being
human
then
I
dont
want
to
be
human
harry
roared
and
he
seized
the
delicate
silver
instrument
from
the
spindlelegged
table
beside
him
and
flung
it
across
the
room
it
shattered
into
a
hundred
tiny
pieces
against
the
wall
several
of
the
pictures
let
out
yells
of
anger
and
fright
and
the
portrait
of
Armando
Dippet
said
Really
i
dont
care
harry
yelled
at
them
snatching
up
a
lunascope
and
throwing
it
into
the
fireplace
ive
had
enough
ive
seen
enough
I
want
out
I
want
it
to
end
i
dont
care
any
more
he
seized
the
table
on
which
the
silver
instrument
had
stood
and
threw
that
too
it
broke
apart
on
the
floor
and
the
legs
rolled
in
different
directions
you
do
care
said
Dumbledore
he
had
not
flinched
or
made
a
single
move
to
stop
Harry
demolishing
his
office
his
expression
was
calm
almost
detached
you
care
so
much
you
feel
as
though
you
will
bleed
to
death
with
the
pain
of
it
i
dont
harry
screamed
so
loudly
that
he
felt
his
throat
might
tear
and
for
a
second
he
wanted
to
rush
at
Dumbledore
and
break
him
too
shatter
that
calm
old
face
shake
him
hurt
him
make
him
feel
some
tiny
part
of
the
horror
inside
himself
oh
yes
you
do
said
Dumbledore
still
more
calmly
you
have
now
lost
your
mother
your
father
and
the
closest
thing
to
a
parent
you
have
ever
known
of
course
you
care
you
dont
know
how
I
feel
harry
roared
you
standing
there
you
but
words
were
no
longer
enough
smashing
things
was
no
more
help
he
wanted
to
run
he
wanted
to
keep
running
and
never
look
back
he
wanted
to
be
somewhere
he
could
not
see
the
clear
blue
eyes
staring
at
him
that
hatefully
calm
old
face
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
ran
to
the
door
seized
the
doorknob
again
and
wrenched
at
it
but
the
door
would
not
open
harry
turned
back
to
Dumbledore
let
me
out
he
said
he
was
shaking
from
head
to
foot
no
said
Dumbledore
simply
for
a
few
seconds
they
stared
at
each
other
let
me
out
Harry
said
again
no
Dumbledore
repeated
if
you
dont
if
you
keep
me
in
here
if
you
don
t
let
me
by
all
means
continue
destroying
my
possessions
said
Dumbledore
serenely
i
daresay
I
have
too
many
he
walked
around
his
desk
and
sat
down
behind
it
watching
Harry
let
me
out
Harry
said
yet
again
in
a
voice
that
was
cold
and
almost
as
calm
as
dumbledores
not
until
I
have
had
my
say
said
Dumbledore
do
you
do
you
think
I
want
to
do
you
think
I
give
a
I
dont
care
what
youve
got
to
say
harry
roared
i
dont
want
to
hear
anything
youve
got
to
say
you
will
said
Dumbledore
steadily
because
you
are
not
nearly
as
angry
with
me
as
you
ought
to
be
if
you
are
to
attack
me
as
I
know
you
are
close
to
doing
I
would
like
to
have
thoroughly
earned
it
what
are
you
talking
it
is
my
fault
that
Sirius
died
said
Dumbledore
clearly
or
should
I
say
almost
entirely
my
fault
I
will
not
be
so
arrogant
as
to
claim
responsibility
for
the
whole
sirius
was
a
brave
clever
and
energetic
man
and
such
men
are
not
usually
content
to
sit
at
home
in
hiding
while
they
believe
others
to
be
in
danger
nevertheless
you
should
never
have
believed
for
an
instant
that
there
was
any
necessity
for
you
to
go
to
the
Department
of
Mysteries
tonight
if
I
had
been
open
with
you
Harry
as
I
should
have
been
you
would
have
known
a
long
time
ago
that
Voldemort
might
try
and
lure
you
to
the
Department
of
Mysteries
and
you
would
never
have
been
tricked
into
going
there
tonight
and
Sirius
would
not
have
had
to
come
after
you
that
blame
lies
with
me
and
with
me
alone
harry
was
still
standing
with
his
hand
on
the
doorknob
but
was
unaware
of
it
he
was
gazing
at
dumbledore
hardly
breathing
listening
yet
barely
understanding
what
he
was
hearing
please
sit
down
said
Dumbledore
it
was
not
an
order
it
was
a
request
harry
hesitated
then
walked
slowly
across
the
room
now
littered
with
silver
cogs
and
fragments
of
wood
and
took
the
seat
facing
Dumbledores
desk
am
I
to
understand
said
Phineas
Nigellus
slowly
from
Harrys
left
that
my
great-great-grandson
the
last
of
the
Blacks
is
dead
yes
Phineas
said
Dumbledore
i
dont
believe
it
said
Phineas
brusquely
harry
turned
his
head
in
time
to
see
Phineas
marching
out
of
his
portrait
and
knew
that
he
had
gone
to
visit
his
other
painting
in
Grimmauld
Place
he
would
walk
perhaps
from
portrait
to
portrait
calling
for
Sirius
through
the
house
harry
I
owe
you
an
explanation
said
Dumbledore
an
explanation
of
an
old
mans
mistakes
for
I
see
now
that
what
I
have
done
and
not
done
with
regard
to
you
bears
all
the
hallmarks
of
the
failings
of
age
youth
cannot
know
how
age
thinks
and
feels
but
old
men
are
guilty
if
they
forget
what
it
was
to
be
young
and
I
seem
to
have
forgotten
lately
the
sun
was
rising
properly
now
there
was
a
rim
of
dazzling
orange
visible
over
the
mountains
and
the
sky
above
it
was
colorless
and
bright
the
light
fell
upon
Dumbledore
upon
the
silver
of
his
eyebrows
and
beard
upon
the
lines
gouged
deeply
into
his
face
i
guessed
fifteen
years
ago
said
Dumbledore
when
I
saw
the
scar
on
your
forehead
what
it
might
mean
i
guessed
that
it
might
be
the
sign
of
a
connection
forged
between
you
and
voldemort
youve
told
me
this
before
Professor
said
Harry
bluntly
he
did
not
care
about
being
rude
he
did
not
care
about
anything
very
much
any
more
yes
said
Dumbledore
apologetically
yes
but
you
see
it
is
necessary
to
start
with
your
scar
for
it
became
apparent
shortly
after
you
rejoined
the
magical
world
that
I
was
correct
and
that
your
scar
was
giving
you
warnings
when
Voldemort
was
close
to
you
or
else
feeling
powerful
emotion
i
know
said
Harry
wearily
and
this
ability
of
yours
to
detect
Voldemorts
presence
even
when
he
is
disguised
and
to
know
what
he
is
feeling
when
his
emotions
are
roused
has
become
more
and
more
pronounced
since
Voldemort
returned
to
his
own
body
and
his
full
powers
harry
did
not
bother
to
nod
he
knew
all
of
this
already
more
recently
said
Dumbledore
I
became
concerned
that
Voldemort
might
realize
that
this
connection
between
you
exists
sure
enough
there
came
a
time
when
you
entered
so
far
into
his
mind
and
thoughts
that
he
sensed
your
presence
i
am
speaking
of
course
of
the
night
when
you
witnessed
the
attack
on
mr.
Weasley
yeah
Snape
told
me
Harry
muttered
professor
Snape
Harry
Dumbledore
corrected
him
quietly
but
did
you
not
wonder
why
it
was
not
I
who
explained
this
to
you
why
I
did
not
teach
you
Occlumency
why
I
had
not
so
much
as
looked
at
you
for
months
harry
looked
up
he
could
see
now
that
Dumbledore
looked
sad
and
tired
yeah
Harry
mumbled
yeah
I
wondered
you
see
Dumbledore
continued
I
believed
it
could
not
be
long
before
Voldemort
attempted
to
force
his
way
into
your
mind
to
manipulate
and
misdirect
your
thoughts
and
I
was
not
eager
to
give
him
more
incentives
to
do
so
i
was
sure
that
if
he
realized
that
our
relationship
was
or
had
ever
been
closer
than
that
of
headmaster
and
pupil
he
would
seize
his
chance
to
use
you
as
a
means
to
spy
on
me
i
feared
the
uses
to
which
he
would
put
you
the
possibility
that
he
might
try
and
possess
you
harry
I
believe
I
was
right
to
think
that
Voldemort
would
have
made
use
of
you
in
such
a
way
on
those
rare
occasions
when
we
had
close
contact
I
thought
I
saw
a
shadow
of
him
stir
behind
your
eyes
harry
remembered
the
feeling
that
a
dormant
snake
had
risen
in
him
ready
to
strike
in
those
moments
when
he
and
Dumbledore
had
made
eye-contact
voldemorts
aim
in
possessing
you
as
he
demonstrated
tonight
would
not
have
been
my
destruction
it
would
have
been
yours
he
hoped
when
he
possessed
you
briefly
a
short
while
ago
that
I
would
sacrifice
you
in
the
hope
of
killing
him
so
you
see
I
have
been
trying
in
distancing
myself
from
you
to
protect
you
Harry
an
old
mans
mistake
he
sighed
deeply
harry
was
letting
the
words
wash
over
him
he
would
have
been
so
interested
to
know
all
this
a
few
months
ago
but
now
it
was
meaningless
compared
to
the
gaping
chasm
inside
him
that
was
the
loss
of
Sirius
none
of
it
mattered
sirius
told
me
you
felt
Voldemort
awake
inside
you
the
very
night
that
you
had
the
vision
of
arthur
Weasleys
attack
i
knew
at
once
that
my
worst
fears
were
correct
Voldemort
had
realized
he
could
use
you
in
an
attempt
to
arm
you
against
Voldemorts
assaults
on
your
mind
I
arranged
Occlumency
lessons
with
Professor
Snape
he
paused
harry
watched
the
sunlight
which
was
sliding
slowly
across
the
polished
surface
of
dumbledores
desk
illuminate
a
silver
ink
pot
and
a
handsome
scarlet
quill
harry
could
tell
that
the
portraits
all
around
them
were
awake
and
listening
raptly
to
Dumbledores
explanation
he
could
hear
the
occasional
rustle
of
robes
the
slight
clearing
of
a
throat
phineas
Nigellus
had
still
not
returned
professor
Snape
discovered
Dumbledore
resumed
that
you
had
been
dreaming
about
the
door
to
the
Department
of
Mysteries
for
months
voldemort
of
course
had
been
obsessed
with
the
possibility
of
hearing
the
prophecy
ever
since
he
regained
his
body
and
as
he
dwelled
on
the
door
so
did
you
though
you
did
not
know
what
it
meant
and
then
you
saw
Rockwood
who
worked
in
the
Department
of
Mysteries
before
his
arrest
telling
Voldemort
what
we
had
known
all
along
that
the
prophecies
held
in
the
Ministry
of
magic
are
heavily
protected
only
the
people
to
whom
they
refer
can
lift
them
from
the
shelves
without
suffering
madness
in
this
case
either
Voldemort
himself
would
have
to
enter
the
ministry
of
Magic
and
risk
revealing
himself
at
last
or
else
you
would
have
to
take
it
for
him
it
became
a
matter
of
even
greater
urgency
that
you
should
master
Occlumency
but
I
didnt
muttered
Harry
he
said
it
aloud
to
try
and
ease
the
dead
weight
of
guilt
inside
him
a
confession
must
surely
relieve
some
of
the
terrible
pressure
squeezing
his
heart
i
didnt
practice
I
didnt
bother
I
couldve
stopped
myself
having
those
dreams
Hermione
kept
telling
me
to
do
it
if
I
had
hed
never
have
been
able
to
show
me
where
to
go
and
Sirius
wouldnt
sirius
wouldnt
something
was
erupting
inside
Harrys
head
a
need
to
justify
himself
to
explain
i
tried
to
check
hed
really
taken
Sirius
I
went
to
Umbridges
office
I
spoke
to
Kreacher
in
the
fire
and
he
said
Sirius
wasnt
there
he
said
hed
gone
kreacher
lied
said
Dumbledore
calmly
you
are
not
his
master
he
could
lie
to
you
without
even
needing
to
punish
himself
kreacher
intended
you
to
go
to
the
Ministry
of
Magic
he
he
sent
me
on
purpose
oh
yes
kreacher
I
am
afraid
has
been
serving
more
than
one
master
for
months
how
said
Harry
blankly
he
hasnt
been
out
of
Grimmauld
Place
for
years
kreacher
seized
his
opportunity
shortly
before
Christmas
said
Dumbledore
when
Sirius
apparently
shouted
at
him
to
get
out
he
took
Sirius
at
his
word
and
interpreted
this
as
an
order
to
leave
the
house
he
went
to
the
only
Black
family
member
for
whom
he
had
any
respect
left
blacks
cousin
Narcissa
sister
of
Bellatrix
and
wife
of
Lucius
Malfoy
how
do
you
know
all
this
harry
said
his
heart
was
beating
very
fast
he
felt
sick
he
remembered
worrying
about
Kreachers
odd
absence
over
Christmas
remembered
him
turning
up
again
in
the
attic
kreacher
told
me
last
night
said
Dumbledore
you
see
when
you
gave
Professor
Snape
that
cryptic
warning
he
realized
that
you
had
had
a
vision
of
Sirius
trapped
in
the
bowels
of
the
department
of
Mysteries
he
like
you
attempted
to
contact
Sirius
at
once
i
should
explain
that
members
of
the
Order
of
the
Phoenix
have
more
reliable
methods
of
communicating
than
the
fire
in
Dolores
Umbridges
office
professor
Snape
found
that
Sirius
was
alive
and
safe
in
grimmauld
Place
when
however
you
did
not
return
from
your
trip
into
the
Forest
with
Dolores
Umbridge
professor
Snape
grew
worried
that
you
still
believed
Sirius
to
be
a
captive
of
Lord
Voldemorts
he
alerted
certain
Order
members
at
once
dumbledore
heaved
a
great
sigh
and
continued
Alastor
Moody
Nymphadora
Tonks
Kingsley
shacklebolt
and
Remus
Lupin
were
at
Headquarters
when
he
made
contact
all
agreed
to
go
to
your
aid
at
once
professor
Snape
requested
that
Sirius
remain
behind
as
he
needed
somebody
to
remain
at
Headquarters
to
tell
me
what
had
happened
for
I
was
due
there
at
any
moment
in
the
meantime
he
Professor
Snape
intended
to
search
the
Forest
for
you
but
Sirius
did
not
wish
to
remain
behind
while
the
others
went
to
search
for
you
he
delegated
to
Kreacher
the
task
of
telling
me
what
had
happened
and
so
it
was
that
when
I
arrived
in
grimmauld
Place
shortly
after
they
had
all
left
for
the
Ministry
it
was
the
elf
who
told
me
laughing
fit
to
burst
where
Sirius
had
gone
he
was
laughing
said
Harry
in
a
hollow
voice
oh
yes
said
Dumbledore
you
see
Kreacher
was
not
able
to
betray
us
totally
he
is
not
secret
Keeper
for
the
Order
he
could
not
give
the
Malfoys
our
whereabouts
or
tell
them
any
of
the
Orders
confidential
plans
that
he
had
been
forbidden
to
reveal
he
was
bound
by
the
enchantments
of
his
kind
which
is
to
say
that
he
could
not
disobey
a
direct
order
from
his
master
Sirius
but
he
gave
Narcissa
information
of
the
sort
that
is
very
valuable
to
Voldemort
yet
must
have
seemed
much
too
trivial
for
Sirius
to
think
of
banning
him
from
repeating
it
like
what
said
Harry
like
the
fact
that
the
person
Sirius
cared
most
about
in
the
world
was
you
said
Dumbledore
quietly
like
the
fact
that
you
were
coming
to
regard
Sirius
as
a
mixture
of
father
and
brother
voldemort
knew
already
of
course
that
Sirius
was
in
the
Order
and
that
you
knew
where
he
was
but
Kreachers
information
made
him
realize
that
the
one
person
for
whom
you
would
go
to
any
lengths
to
rescue
was
Sirius
Black
harrys
lips
were
cold
and
numb
so
when
I
asked
Kreacher
if
Sirius
was
there
last
night
the
Malfoys
undoubtedly
on
Voldemorts
instructions
had
told
him
he
must
find
a
way
of
keeping
Sirius
out
of
the
way
once
you
had
seen
the
vision
of
Sirius
being
tortured
then
if
you
decided
to
check
whether
Sirius
was
at
home
or
not
Kreacher
would
be
able
to
pretend
he
was
not
kreacher
injured
Buckbeak
the
Hippogriff
yesterday
and
at
the
moment
when
you
made
your
appearance
in
the
fire
Sirius
was
upstairs
tending
to
him
there
seemed
to
be
very
little
air
in
Harrys
lungs
his
breathing
was
quick
and
shallow
and
Kreacher
told
you
all
this
and
laughed
he
croaked
he
did
not
wish
to
tell
me
said
Dumbledore
but
I
am
a
sufficiently
accomplished
Legilimens
myself
to
know
when
I
am
being
lied
to
and
I
persuaded
him
to
tell
me
the
full
story
before
I
left
for
the
Department
of
Mysteries
and
whispered
Harry
his
hands
curled
in
cold
fists
on
his
knees
and
Hermione
kept
telling
us
to
be
nice
to
him
she
was
quite
right
Harry
said
Dumbledore
i
warned
Sirius
when
we
adopted
twelve
grimmauld
Place
as
our
Headquarters
that
Kreacher
must
be
treated
with
kindness
and
respect
also
told
him
that
Kreacher
could
be
dangerous
to
us
i
do
not
think
Sinus
took
me
very
seriously
or
that
he
ever
saw
Kreacher
as
a
being
with
feelings
as
acute
as
a
humans
dont
you
blame
dont
you
talk
about
Sirius
like
Harrys
breath
was
constricted
he
could
not
get
the
words
out
properly
but
the
rage
that
had
subsided
briefly
flared
in
him
again
he
would
not
let
Dumbledore
criticize
Sirius
kreachers
a
lying
foul
he
deserved
kreacher
is
what
he
has
been
made
by
wizards
Harry
said
Dumbledore
yes
he
is
to
be
pitied
his
existence
has
been
as
miserable
as
your
friend
Dobbys
he
was
forced
to
do
Siriuss
bidding
because
Sirius
was
the
last
of
the
family
to
which
he
was
enslaved
but
he
felt
no
true
loyalty
to
him
and
whatever
Kreachers
faults
it
must
be
admitted
that
Sirius
did
nothing
to
make
Kreachers
lot
easier
dont
talk
about
sirius
like
that
harry
yelled
he
was
on
his
feet
again
furious
ready
to
fly
at
Dumbledore
who
had
plainly
not
understood
sirius
at
all
how
brave
he
was
how
much
he
had
suffered
what
about
Snape
harry
spat
youre
not
talking
about
him
are
you
when
I
told
him
voldemort
had
Sirius
he
just
sneered
at
me
as
usual
harry
you
know
Professor
Snape
had
no
choice
but
to
pretend
not
to
take
you
seriously
in
front
of
Dolores
Umbridge
said
Dumbledore
steadily
but
as
I
have
explained
he
informed
the
order
as
soon
as
possible
about
what
you
had
said
it
was
he
who
deduced
where
you
had
gone
when
you
did
not
return
from
the
Forest
it
was
he
too
who
gave
Professor
Umbridge
fake
veritaserum
when
she
was
attempting
to
force
you
to
tell
her
Siriuss
whereabouts
harry
disregarded
this
he
felt
a
savage
pleasure
in
blaming
Snape
it
seemed
to
be
easing
his
own
sense
of
dreadful
guilt
and
he
wanted
to
hear
Dumbledore
agree
with
him
snape
Snape
g
goaded
Sirius
about
staying
in
the
house
he
made
out
Sirius
was
a
coward
sirius
was
much
too
old
and
clever
to
have
allowed
such
feeble
taunts
to
hurt
him
said
dumbledore
snape
stopped
giving
me
Occlumency
lessons
harry
snarled
he
threw
me
out
of
his
office
i
am
aware
of
it
said
Dumbledore
heavily
I
have
already
said
that
it
was
a
mistake
for
me
not
to
teach
you
myself
though
I
was
sure
at
the
time
that
nothing
could
have
been
more
dangerous
than
to
open
your
mind
even
further
to
Voldemort
while
in
my
presence
snape
made
it
worse
my
scar
always
hurt
worse
after
lessons
with
him
Harry
remembered
rons
thoughts
on
the
subject
and
plunged
on
how
do
you
know
he
wasnt
trying
to
soften
me
up
for
Voldemort
make
it
easier
for
him
to
get
inside
my
i
trust
Severus
Snape
said
Dumbledore
simply
But
I
forgot
another
old
mans
mistake
that
some
wounds
run
too
deep
for
the
healing
i
thought
Professor
Snape
could
overcome
his
feelings
about
your
father
I
was
wrong
but
thats
okay
is
it
yelled
Harry
ignoring
the
scandalized
faces
and
disapproving
mutterings
of
the
portraits
on
the
walls
its
okay
for
Snape
to
hate
my
dad
but
its
not
okay
for
Sirius
to
hate
Kreacher
sirius
did
not
hate
Kreacher
said
Dumbledore
he
regarded
him
as
a
servant
unworthy
of
much
interest
or
notice
indifference
and
neglect
often
do
much
more
damage
than
outright
dislike
the
fountain
we
destroyed
tonight
told
a
lie
we
wizards
have
mistreated
and
abused
our
fellows
for
too
long
and
we
are
now
reaping
our
reward
so
sirius
deserved
what
he
got
did
he
harry
yelled
i
did
not
say
that
nor
will
you
ever
hear
me
say
it
Dumbledore
replied
quietly
sirius
was
not
a
cruel
man
he
was
kind
to
house-elves
in
general
he
had
no
love
for
Kreacher
because
kreacher
was
a
living
reminder
of
the
home
Sirius
had
hated
yeah
he
did
hate
it
said
Harry
his
voice
cracking
turning
his
back
on
Dumbledore
and
walking
away
the
sun
was
bright
inside
the
room
now
and
the
eyes
of
all
the
portraits
followed
him
as
he
walked
without
realizing
what
he
was
doing
without
seeing
the
office
at
all
you
made
him
stay
shut
up
in
that
house
and
he
hated
it
thats
why
he
wanted
to
get
out
last
night
i
was
trying
to
keep
Sirius
alive
said
Dumbledore
quietly
people
dont
like
being
locked
up
harry
said
furiously
rounding
on
him
you
did
it
to
me
all
last
summer
dumbledore
closed
his
eyes
and
buried
his
face
in
his
longfingered
hands
harry
watched
him
but
this
uncharacteristic
sign
of
exhaustion
or
sadness
or
whatever
it
was
from
Dumbledore
did
not
soften
him
on
the
contrary
he
felt
even
angrier
that
Dumbledore
was
showing
signs
of
weakness
he
had
no
business
being
weak
when
Harry
wanted
to
rage
and
storm
at
him
dumbledore
lowered
his
hands
and
surveyed
Harry
through
his
half-moon
glasses
it
is
time
he
said
for
me
to
tell
you
what
I
should
have
told
you
five
years
ago
Harry
please
sit
down
i
am
going
to
tell
you
everything
i
ask
only
a
little
patience
you
will
have
your
chance
to
rage
at
me
to
do
whatever
you
like
when
I
have
finished
i
will
not
stop
you
harry
glared
at
him
for
a
moment
then
flung
himself
back
into
the
chair
opposite
Dumbledore
and
waited
dumbledore
stared
for
a
moment
at
the
sunlit
grounds
outside
the
window
then
looked
back
at
harry
and
said
Five
years
ago
you
arrived
at
Hogwarts
Harry
safe
and
whole
as
I
had
planned
and
intended
well
not
quite
whole
you
had
suffered
i
knew
you
would
when
I
left
you
on
your
aunt
and
uncles
doorstep
i
knew
I
was
condemning
you
to
ten
dark
and
difficult
years
he
paused
harry
said
nothing
you
might
ask
and
with
good
reason
why
it
had
to
be
so
why
could
some
wizarding
family
not
have
taken
you
in
many
would
have
done
so
more
than
gladly
would
have
been
honored
and
delighted
to
raise
you
as
a
son
my
answer
is
that
my
priority
was
to
keep
you
alive
you
were
in
more
danger
than
perhaps
anyone
but
I
realized
voldemort
had
been
vanquished
hours
before
but
his
supporters
and
many
of
them
are
almost
as
terrible
as
he
were
still
at
large
angry
desperate
and
violent
and
I
had
to
make
my
decision
too
with
regard
to
the
years
ahead
did
I
believe
that
Voldemort
was
gone
for
ever
no.
I
knew
not
whether
it
would
be
ten
twenty
or
fifty
years
before
he
returned
but
I
was
sure
he
would
do
so
and
I
was
sure
too
knowing
him
as
I
have
done
that
he
would
not
rest
until
he
killed
you
i
knew
that
Voldemorts
knowledge
of
magic
is
perhaps
more
extensive
than
any
wizard
alive
i
knew
that
even
my
most
complex
and
powerful
protective
spells
and
charms
were
unlikely
to
be
invincible
if
he
ever
returned
to
full
power
but
I
knew
too
where
Voldemort
was
weak
and
so
I
made
my
decision
you
would
be
protected
by
an
ancient
magic
of
which
he
knows
which
he
despises
and
which
he
has
always
therefore
underestimated
to
his
cost
i
am
speaking
of
course
of
the
fact
that
your
mother
died
to
save
you
she
gave
you
a
lingering
protection
he
never
expected
a
protection
that
flows
in
your
veins
to
this
day
i
put
my
trust
therefore
in
your
mothers
blood
i
delivered
you
to
her
sister
her
only
remaining
relative
she
doesnt
love
me
said
Harry
at
once
she
doesnt
give
a
damn
but
she
took
you
Dumbledore
cut
across
him
she
may
have
taken
you
grudgingly
furiously
unwillingly
bitterly
yet
still
she
took
you
and
in
doing
so
she
sealed
the
charm
I
placed
upon
you
your
mothers
sacrifice
made
the
bond
of
blood
the
strongest
shield
I
could
give
you
i
still
dont
while
you
can
still
call
home
the
place
where
your
mothers
blood
dwells
there
you
cannot
be
touched
or
harmed
by
Voldemort
he
shed
her
blood
but
it
lives
on
in
you
and
her
sister
her
blood
became
your
refuge
you
need
return
there
only
once
a
year
but
as
long
as
you
can
still
call
it
home
while
you
are
there
he
cannot
hurt
you
your
aunt
knows
this
i
explained
what
I
had
done
in
the
letter
I
left
with
you
on
her
doorstep
she
knows
that
allowing
you
houseroom
may
well
have
kept
you
alive
for
the
past
fifteen
years
wait
said
Harry
wait
a
moment
he
sat
up
straighter
in
his
chair
staring
at
Dumbledore
you
sent
that
Howler
you
told
her
to
remember
it
was
your
voice
i
thought
said
Dumbledore
inclining
his
head
slightly
that
she
might
need
reminding
of
the
pact
she
had
sealed
by
taking
you
i
suspected
the
Dementor
attack
might
have
awoken
her
to
the
dangers
of
having
you
as
a
surrogate
son
it
did
said
Harry
quietly
well
my
uncle
more
than
her
he
wanted
to
chuck
me
out
but
after
the
Howler
came
she
she
said
I
had
to
stay
he
stared
at
the
floor
for
a
moment
then
said
But
whats
this
got
to
do
with
he
could
not
say
Siriuss
name
five
years
ago
then
continued
Dumbledore
as
though
he
had
not
paused
in
his
story
you
arrived
at
Hogwarts
neither
as
happy
nor
as
well-nourished
as
I
would
have
liked
perhaps
yet
alive
and
healthy
you
were
not
a
pampered
little
prince
but
as
normal
a
boy
as
I
could
have
hoped
under
the
circumstances
thus
far
my
plan
was
working
well
and
then
well
you
will
remember
the
events
of
your
first
year
at
Hogwarts
quite
as
clearly
as
I
do
you
rose
magnificently
to
the
challenge
that
faced
you
and
sooner
much
sooner
than
I
had
anticipated
you
found
yourself
face
to
face
with
Voldemort
you
survived
again
you
did
more
you
delayed
his
return
to
full
power
and
strength
you
fought
a
mans
fight
i
was
prouder
of
you
than
I
can
say
yet
there
was
a
flaw
in
this
wonderful
plan
of
mine
said
Dumbledore
an
obvious
flaw
that
I
knew
even
then
might
be
the
undoing
of
it
all
and
yet
knowing
how
important
it
was
that
my
plan
should
succeed
I
told
myself
that
I
would
not
permit
this
flaw
to
ruin
it
i
alone
could
prevent
this
so
I
alone
must
be
strong
and
here
was
my
first
test
as
you
lay
in
the
hospital
wing
weak
from
your
struggle
with
Voldemort
i
dont
understand
what
youre
saying
said
Harry
dont
you
remember
asking
me
as
you
lay
in
the
hospital
wing
why
Voldemort
had
tried
to
kill
you
when
you
were
a
baby
harry
nodded
ought
I
to
have
told
you
then
harry
stared
into
the
blue
eyes
and
said
nothing
but
his
heart
was
racing
again
you
do
not
see
the
flaw
in
the
plan
yet
no
perhaps
not
well
as
you
know
I
decided
not
to
answer
you
eleven
I
told
myself
was
much
too
young
to
know
i
had
never
intended
to
tell
you
when
you
were
eleven
the
knowledge
would
be
too
much
at
such
a
young
age
i
should
have
recognized
the
danger
signs
then
i
should
have
asked
myself
why
I
did
not
feel
more
disturbed
that
you
had
already
asked
me
the
question
to
which
I
knew
one
day
I
must
give
a
terrible
answer
i
should
have
recognized
that
I
was
too
happy
to
think
that
I
did
not
have
to
do
it
on
that
particular
day
you
were
too
young
much
too
young
and
so
we
entered
your
second
year
at
Hogwarts
and
once
again
you
met
challenges
even
grown
wizards
have
never
faced
once
again
you
acquitted
yourself
beyond
my
wildest
dreams
you
did
not
ask
me
again
however
why
Voldemort
had
left
that
mark
on
you
we
discussed
your
scar
oh
yes
we
came
very
very
close
to
the
subject
why
did
I
not
tell
you
everything
well
it
seemed
to
me
that
twelve
was
after
all
hardly
better
than
eleven
to
receive
such
information
i
allowed
you
to
leave
my
presence
bloodstained
exhausted
but
exhilarated
and
if
i
felt
a
twinge
of
unease
that
I
ought
perhaps
to
have
told
you
then
it
was
swiftly
silenced
you
were
still
so
young
you
see
and
I
could
not
find
it
in
myself
to
spoil
that
night
of
triumph
do
you
see
Harry
do
you
see
the
flaw
in
my
brilliant
plan
now
i
had
fallen
into
the
trap
I
had
foreseen
that
I
had
told
myself
I
could
avoid
that
I
must
avoid
i
dont
i
cared
about
you
too
much
said
Dumbledore
simply
i
cared
more
for
your
happiness
than
your
knowing
the
truth
more
for
your
peace
of
mind
than
my
plan
more
for
your
life
than
the
lives
that
might
be
lost
if
the
plan
failed
in
other
words
I
acted
exactly
as
Voldemort
expects
we
fools
who
love
to
act
is
there
a
Defense
i
defy
anyone
who
has
watched
you
as
I
have
and
I
have
watched
you
more
closely
than
you
can
have
imagined
not
to
want
to
save
you
more
pain
than
you
had
already
suffered
what
did
I
care
if
numbers
of
nameless
and
faceless
people
and
creatures
were
slaughtered
in
the
vague
future
if
in
the
here
and
now
you
were
alive
and
well
and
happy
never
dreamed
that
I
would
have
such
a
person
on
my
hands
we
entered
your
third
year
i
watched
from
afar
as
you
struggled
to
repel
Dementors
as
you
found
Sirius
learned
what
he
was
and
rescued
him
was
I
to
tell
you
then
at
the
moment
when
you
had
triumphantly
snatched
your
godfather
from
the
jaws
of
the
Ministry
but
now
at
the
age
of
thirteen
my
excuses
were
running
out
young
you
might
be
but
you
had
proved
you
were
exceptional
my
conscience
was
uneasy
Harry
i
knew
the
time
must
come
soon
but
you
came
out
of
the
maze
last
year
having
watched
Cedric
Diggory
die
having
escaped
death
so
narrowly
yourself
and
I
did
not
tell
you
though
I
knew
now
Voldemort
had
returned
I
must
do
it
soon
and
now
tonight
I
know
you
have
long
been
ready
for
the
knowledge
I
have
kept
from
you
for
so
long
because
you
have
proved
that
I
should
have
placed
the
burden
upon
you
before
this
my
only
Defense
is
this
I
have
watched
you
struggling
under
more
burdens
than
any
student
who
as
ever
passed
through
this
school
and
I
could
not
bring
myself
to
add
another
the
greatest
one
of
all
harry
waited
but
Dumbledore
did
not
speak
i
still
dont
understand
voldemort
tried
to
kill
you
when
you
were
a
child
because
of
a
prophecy
made
shortly
before
your
birth
he
knew
the
prophecy
had
been
made
though
he
did
not
know
its
full
contents
he
set
out
to
kill
you
when
you
were
still
a
baby
believing
he
was
fulfilling
the
terms
of
the
prophecy
he
discovered
to
his
cost
that
he
was
mistaken
when
the
curse
intended
to
kill
you
backfired
and
so
since
his
return
to
his
body
and
particularly
since
your
extraordinary
escape
from
him
last
year
he
has
been
determined
to
hear
that
prophecy
in
its
entirety
this
is
the
weapon
he
has
been
seeking
so
assiduously
since
his
return
the
knowledge
of
how
to
destroy
you
the
sun
had
risen
fully
now
Dumbledores
office
was
bathed
in
it
the
glass
case
in
which
the
sword
of
Godric
Gryffindor
resided
gleamed
white
and
opaque
the
fragments
of
the
instruments
harry
had
thrown
to
the
floor
glistened
like
raindrops
and
behind
him
the
baby
Fawkes
made
soft
chirruping
noises
in
his
nest
of
ashes
the
prophecys
smashed
Harry
said
blankly
i
was
pulling
Neville
up
those
benches
in
the
the
room
where
the
archway
was
and
I
ripped
his
robes
and
it
fell
the
thing
that
smashed
was
merely
the
record
of
the
prophecy
kept
by
the
Department
of
mysteries
but
the
prophecy
was
made
to
somebody
and
that
person
has
the
means
of
recalling
it
perfectly
who
heard
it
asked
Harry
though
he
thought
he
knew
the
answer
already
i
did
said
Dumbledore
on
a
cold
wet
night
sixteen
years
ago
in
a
room
above
the
bar
at
the
hogs
Head
inn
i
had
gone
there
to
see
an
applicant
for
the
post
of
Divination
teacher
though
it
was
against
my
inclination
to
allow
the
subject
of
Divination
to
continue
at
all
the
applicant
however
was
the
great-great-granddaughter
of
a
very
famous
very
gifted
Seer
and
I
thought
it
common
politeness
to
meet
her
i
was
disappointed
it
seemed
to
me
that
she
had
not
a
trace
of
the
gift
herself
i
told
her
courteously
I
hope
that
I
did
not
think
she
would
be
suitable
for
the
post
i
turned
to
leave
dumbledore
got
to
his
feet
and
walked
past
Harry
to
the
black
cabinet
that
stood
beside
fawkess
perch
he
bent
down
slid
back
a
catch
and
took
from
inside
it
the
shallow
stone
basin
carved
with
runes
around
the
edges
in
which
Harry
had
seen
his
father
tormenting
Snape
dumbledore
walked
back
to
the
desk
placed
the
Pensieve
upon
it
and
raised
his
wand
to
his
own
temple
from
it
he
withdrew
silvery
gossamer-fine
strands
of
thought
clinging
to
the
wand
and
deposited
them
into
the
basin
he
sat
back
down
behind
his
desk
and
watched
his
thoughts
swirl
and
drift
inside
the
Pensieve
for
a
moment
then
with
a
sigh
he
raised
his
wand
and
prodded
the
silvery
substance
with
its
tip
a
figure
rose
out
of
it
draped
in
shawls
her
eyes
magnified
to
enormous
size
behind
her
glasses
and
she
revolved
slowly
her
feet
in
the
basin
but
when
Sibyll
Trelawney
spoke
it
was
not
in
her
usual
ethereal
mystic
voice
but
in
the
harsh
hoarse
tones
Harry
had
heard
her
use
once
before
the
one
with
the
power
to
vanquish
the
Dark
Lord
approaches
born
to
those
who
have
thrice
defied
him
born
as
the
seventh
month
dies
and
the
Dark
Lord
will
mark
him
as
his
equal
but
he
will
have
power
the
Dark
Lord
knows
not
and
either
must
die
at
the
hand
of
the
other
for
neither
can
live
while
the
other
survives
the
one
with
the
power
to
vanquish
the
Dark
Lord
will
be
born
as
the
seventh
month
dies
the
slowly
revolving
Professor
Trelawney
sank
back
into
the
silver
mass
below
and
vanished
the
silence
within
the
office
was
absolute
neither
Dumbledore
nor
Harry
nor
any
of
the
portraits
made
a
sound
even
Fawkes
had
fallen
silent
professor
Dumbledore
harry
said
very
quietly
for
Dumbledore
still
staring
at
the
Pensieve
seemed
completely
lost
in
thought
it
did
that
mean
what
did
that
mean
it
meant
said
Dumbledore
that
the
person
who
has
the
only
chance
of
conquering
Lord
voldemort
for
good
was
born
at
the
end
of
July
nearly
sixteen
years
ago
this
boy
would
be
born
to
parents
who
had
already
defied
Voldemort
three
times
harry
felt
as
though
something
was
closing
in
on
him
his
breathing
seemed
difficult
again
it
means
me
dumbledore
surveyed
him
for
a
moment
through
his
glasses
the
odd
thing
Harry
he
said
softly
is
that
it
may
not
have
meant
you
at
all
sibylls
prophecy
could
have
applied
to
two
wizard
boys
both
born
at
the
end
of
July
that
year
both
of
whom
had
parents
in
the
Order
of
the
Phoenix
both
sets
of
parents
having
narrowly
escaped
Voldemort
three
times
one
of
course
was
you
the
other
was
Neville
Longbottom
but
then
but
then
why
was
it
my
name
on
the
prophecy
and
not
Nevilles
the
official
record
was
re-labeled
after
Voldemorts
attack
on
you
as
a
child
said
dumbledore
it
seemed
plain
to
the
keeper
of
the
Hall
of
Prophecy
that
Voldemort
could
only
have
tried
to
kill
you
because
he
knew
you
to
be
the
one
to
whom
Sibyll
was
referring
then
it
might
not
be
me
said
Harry
i
am
afraid
said
Dumbledore
slowly
looking
as
though
every
word
cost
him
a
great
effort
that
there
is
no
doubt
that
it
is
you
but
you
said
Neville
was
born
at
the
end
of
July
too
and
his
mum
and
dad
you
are
forgetting
the
next
part
of
the
prophecy
the
final
identifying
feature
of
the
boy
who
could
vanquish
Voldemort
voldemort
himself
would
mark
him
as
his
equal
and
so
he
did
harry
he
chose
you
not
Neville
he
gave
you
the
scar
that
has
proved
both
blessing
and
curse
but
he
might
have
chosen
wrong
said
Harry
he
might
have
marked
the
wrong
person
he
chose
the
boy
he
thought
most
likely
to
be
a
danger
to
him
said
Dumbledore
and
notice
this
Harry
he
chose
not
the
pureblood
which
according
to
his
creed
is
the
only
kind
of
wizard
worth
being
or
knowing
but
the
half-blood
like
himself
he
saw
himself
in
you
before
he
had
ever
seen
you
and
in
marking
you
with
that
scar
he
did
not
kill
you
as
he
intended
but
gave
you
powers
and
a
future
which
have
fitted
you
to
escape
him
not
once
but
four
times
so
far
something
that
neither
your
parents
nor
Nevilles
parents
ever
achieved
why
did
he
do
it
then
said
Harry
who
felt
numb
and
cold
why
did
he
try
and
kill
me
as
a
baby
he
should
have
waited
to
see
whether
Neville
or
I
looked
more
dangerous
when
we
were
older
and
tried
to
kill
whoever
it
was
then
that
might
indeed
have
been
the
more
practical
course
said
Dumbledore
except
that
voldemorts
information
about
the
prophecy
was
incomplete
the
Hogs
Head
inn
which
Sibyll
chose
for
its
cheapness
has
long
attracted
shall
we
say
a
more
interesting
clientele
than
the
three
Broomsticks
as
you
and
your
friends
found
out
to
your
cost
and
I
to
mine
that
night
it
is
a
place
where
it
is
never
safe
to
assume
you
are
not
being
overheard
of
course
I
had
not
dreamed
when
I
set
out
to
meet
Sibyll
Trelawney
that
I
would
hear
anything
worth
overhearing
my
our
one
stroke
of
good
fortune
was
that
the
eavesdropper
was
detected
only
a
short
way
into
the
prophecy
and
thrown
from
the
building
so
he
only
heard
he
heard
only
the
beginning
the
part
foretelling
the
birth
of
a
boy
in
July
to
parents
who
had
thrice
defied
Voldemort
consequently
he
could
not
warn
his
master
that
to
attack
you
would
be
to
risk
transferring
power
to
you
and
marking
you
as
his
equal
so
Voldemort
never
knew
that
there
might
be
danger
in
attacking
you
that
it
might
be
wise
to
wait
to
learn
more
he
did
not
know
that
you
would
have
power
the
Dark
Lord
knows
not
but
I
dont
said
Harry
in
a
strangled
voice
i
havent
any
powers
he
hasnt
got
I
couldnt
fight
the
way
he
did
tonight
I
cant
possess
people
or
or
kill
them
there
is
a
room
in
the
Department
of
Mysteries
interrupted
Dumbledore
that
is
kept
locked
at
all
times
it
contains
a
force
that
is
at
once
more
wonderful
and
more
terrible
than
death
than
human
intelligence
than
the
forces
of
nature
it
is
also
perhaps
the
most
mysterious
of
the
many
subjects
for
study
that
reside
there
it
is
the
power
held
within
that
room
that
you
possess
in
such
quantities
and
which
Voldemort
has
not
at
all
that
power
took
you
to
save
Sirius
tonight
that
power
also
saved
you
from
possession
by
Voldemort
because
he
could
not
bear
to
reside
in
a
body
so
full
of
the
force
he
detests
in
the
end
it
mattered
not
that
you
could
not
close
your
mind
it
was
your
heart
that
saved
you
harry
closed
his
eyes
if
he
had
not
gone
to
save
Sirius
Sirius
would
not
have
died
more
to
stave
off
the
moment
when
he
would
have
to
think
of
Sirius
again
Harry
asked
without
caring
much
about
the
answer
The
end
of
the
prophecy
it
was
something
about
neither
can
live
while
the
other
survives
said
Dumbledore
so
said
Harry
dredging
up
the
words
from
what
felt
like
a
deep
well
of
despair
inside
him
so
does
that
mean
that
that
one
of
us
has
got
to
kill
the
other
one
in
the
end
yes
said
Dumbledore
for
a
long
time
neither
of
them
spoke
somewhere
far
beyond
the
office
walls
Harry
could
hear
the
sound
of
voices
students
heading
down
to
the
Great
Hall
for
an
early
breakfast
perhaps
it
seemed
impossible
that
there
could
be
people
in
the
world
who
still
desired
food
who
laughed
who
neither
knew
nor
cared
that
Sirius
Black
was
gone
forever
sirius
seemed
a
million
miles
away
already
even
now
a
part
of
Harry
still
believed
that
if
he
had
only
pulled
back
that
veil
he
would
have
found
Sirius
looking
back
at
him
greeting
him
perhaps
with
his
laugh
like
a
bark
i
feel
I
owe
you
another
explanation
Harry
said
Dumbledore
hesitantly
you
may
perhaps
have
wondered
why
I
never
chose
you
as
a
prefect
i
must
confess
that
I
rather
thought
you
had
enough
responsibility
to
be
going
on

up

saw
a

the
Second
War
Begins
he-who-must-not-be-named
returns
in
a
brief
statement
on
Friday
night
Minister
for
Magic
Cornelius
Fudge
confirmed
that
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
has
returned
to
this
country
and
is
active
once
more
it
is
with
great
regret
that
I
must
confirm
that
t
he
wizard
styling
himself
Lord
well
you
know
who
I
mean
is
alive
and
among
us
again
said
Fudge
looking
tired
and
flustered
as
he
addressed
reporters
it
is
with
almost
equal
regret
that
we
report
the
mass
revolt
of
the
dementors
of
Azkaban
who
have
shown
themselves
averse
to
continuing
in
the
Ministrys
employ
we
believe
the
Dementors
are
currently
taking
direction
from
Lord
Thingy
we
urge
the
magical
population
to
remain
vigilant
the
Ministry
is
currently
publishing
guides
to
elementary
home
and
personal
Defense
which
will
be
delivered
free
to
all
wizarding
homes
within
the
coming
month
the
Ministers
statement
was
met
with
dismay
and
alarm
from
the
wizarding
community
which
as
recently
as
last
Wednesday
was
receiving
Ministry
assurances
that
there
was
no
truth
whatsoever
in
these
persistent
rumors
that
You-Know-Who
is
operating
amongst
us
once
more
details
of
the
events
that
led
to
the
Ministry
turnaround
are
still
hazy
though
it
is
believed
that
he-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
and
a
select
band
of
followers
known
as
Death
Eaters
gained
entry
to
the
Ministry
of
Magic
itself
on
Thursday
evening
albus
Dumbledore
newly
reinstated
Headmaster
of
Hogwarts
School
of

of
the
International
Confederation
of
Wizards
and
reinstated
Chief
warlock
of
the
Wizengamot
has
so
far
been
unavailable
for
comment
he
has
insisted
over
the
past
year
that
You-Know-Who
is
not
dead
as
was
widely
hoped
and
believed
but
is
recruiting
followers
once
more

to
seize
power
meanwhile
the
Boy
Who
Lived
there
you
are
Harry
I
knew
theyd
drag
you
into
it
somehow
said
Hermione
looking
over
the
top
of
the
paper
at
him
they
were
in
the
hospital
wing
harry
was
sitting
on
the
end
of
Rons
bed
and
they
were
both
listening
to
Hermione
read
the
front
page
of
the
Sun
day
Prophet
ginny
whose
ankle
had
been
mended
in
a
trice
by
Madam
Pomfrey
was
curled
up
at
the
foot
of
Hermiones
bed
Neville
whose
nose
had
likewise
been
returned
to
its
normal
size
and
shape
was
in
a
chair
between
the
two
beds
and
Luna
who
had
dropped
in
to
visit
clutching
the
latest
edition
of
The
Quibbler
was
reading
the
magazine
upside-down
and
apparently
not
taking
in
a
word
Hermione
was
saying
hes
the
boy
who
lived
again
now
though
isnt
he
said
Ron
darkly
not
such
a
deluded
show-off
any
more
eh
he
helped
himself
to
a
handful
of
Chocolate
Frogs
from
the
immense
pile
on
his
bedside
cabinet
threw
a
few
to
Harry
Ginny
and
Neville
and
ripped
off
the
wrapper
of
his
own
with
his
teeth
there
were
still
deep
welts
on
his
forearms
where
the
brains
tentacles
had
wrapped
around
him
according
to
Madam
Pomfrey
thoughts
could
leave
deeper
scarring
than
almost
anything
else
though
since
she
had
started
applying
copious
amounts
of
dr.
Ubblys
Oblivious
Unction
there
seemed
to
have
been
some
improvement
yes
theyre
very
complimentary
about
you
now
Harry
said
Hermione
scanning
down
the
article
a
lone
voice
of
truth
perceived
as
unbalanced
yet
never
wavered
in
his
story
forced
to
bear
ridicule
and
slander
hmmm
she
said
frowning
I
notice
they
dont
mention
the
fact
that
it
was
them
doing
all
the
ridiculing
and
slandering
in
the
Prophet
she
winced
slightly
and
put
a
hand
to
her
ribs
the
curse
Dolohov
had
used
on
her
though
less
effective
than
it
would
have
been
had
he
been
able
to
say
the
incantation
aloud
had
nevertheless
caused
in
Madam
Pomfreys
words
quite
enough
damage
to
be
going
on
with
hermione
was
having
to
take
ten
different
types
of
potion
every
day
was
improving

well
said
Hermione
folding
up
the
newspaper
and
throwing
it
aside
its
certainly
given
them
lots
to
write
about
and
that
interview
with
Harry
isnt
exclusive
its
the
one
that
was
in
The
Quibbler
months
ago
daddy
sold
it
to
them
said
Luna
vaguely
turning
a
page
of
The
Quibbler
he
got
a
very
good
price
for
it
too
so
were
going
to
go
on
an
expedition
to
Sweden
this
summer
to
see
if
we
can
catch
a
Crumple-Horned
Snorkack
hermione
seemed
to
struggle
with
herself
for
a
moment
then
said
That
sounds
lovely
ginny
caught
Harrys
eye
and
looked
away
quickly
grinning
so
anyway
said
Hermione
sitting
up
a
little
straighter
and
wincing
again
whats
going
on
in
school
well
Flitwicks
got
rid
of
Fred
and
Georges
swamp
said
Ginny
he
did
it
in
about
three
seconds
but
he
left
a
tiny
patch
under
the
window
and
hes
roped
it
off
why
said
Hermione
looking
startled
oh
he
just
says
it
was
a
really
good
bit
of
magic
said
Ginny
shrugging
i
think
he
left
it
as
a
monument
to
Fred
and
George
said
Ron
through
a
mouthful
of
chocolate
they
sent
me
all
these
you
know
he
told
Harry
pointing
at
the
small
mountain
of
Frogs
beside
him
must
be
doing
all
right
out
of
that
joke
shop
eh
hermione
looked
rather
disapproving
and
asked
So
has
all
the
trouble
stopped
now
dumbledores
back
yes
said
Neville
everythings
settled
right
back
to
normal
i
spose
Filch
is
happy
is
he
asked
Ron
propping
a
Chocolate
Frog
Card
featuring
dumbledore
against
his
water
jug
not
at
all
said
Ginny
Hes
really
really
miserable
actually
she
lowered
her
voice
to
a
whisper
he
keeps
saying
Umbridge
was
the
best
thing
that
ever
happened
to
Hogwarts
all
six
of
them
looked
around
professor
Umbridge
was
lying
in
a
bed
opposite
them
gazing
up
at
the
ceiling
dumbledore
had
strode
alone
into
the
Forest
to
rescue
her
from
the
centaurs
how
he
had
done
it
how
he
had
emerged
from
the
trees
supporting
Professor
Umbridge
without
so
much
as
a
scratch
on
him
nobody
knew
and
Umbridge
was
certainly
not
telling
since
she
had
returned
to
the
castle
she
had
not
as
far
as
any
of
them
knew
uttered
a
single
word
nobody
really
knew
what
was
wrong
with
her
either
her
usually
neat
mousy
hair
was
very
untidy
and
there
were
still
bits
of
twigs
and
leaves
in
it
but
otherwise
she
seemed
to
be
quite
unscathed
madam
Pomfrey
says
shes
just
in
shock
whispered
Hermione
sulking
more
like
said
Ginny
yeah
she
shows
signs
of
life
if
you
do
this
said
Ron
and
with
his
tongue
he
made
soft
clipclopping
noises
umbridge
sat
bolt
upright
looking
around
wildly
anything
wrong
Professor
called
Madam
Pomfrey
poking
her
head
around
her
office
door
no
no
said
Umbridge
sinking
back
into
her
pillows
no
I
must
have
been
dreaming
hermione
and
Ginny
muffled
their
laughter
in
the
bedclothes
speaking
of
centaurs
said
Hermione
when
she
had
recovered
a
little
whos
Divination
teacher
now
is
Firenze
staying
hes
got
to
said
Harry
the
other
centaurs
wont
take
him
back
will
they
it
looks
like
he
and
Trelawney
are
both
going
to
teach
said
Ginny
bet
Dumbledore
wishes
he
couldve
got
rid
of
Trelawney
for
good
said
Ron
now
munching
on
his
fourteenth
Frog
mind
you
the
whole
subjects
useless
if
you
ask
me
Firenze
isnt
a
lot
better
how
can
you
say
that
hermione
demanded
after
weve
just
found
out
that
there
are
real
prophecies
harrys
heart
began
to
race
he
had
not
told
Ron
Hermione
or
anyone
else
what
the
prophecy
had
contained
neville
had
told
them
it
had
smashed
while
Harry
was
pulling
him
up
the
steps
in
the
Death
Room
and
Harry
had
not
yet
corrected
this
impression
he
was
not
ready
to
see
their
expressions
when
he
told
them
that
he
must
be
either
murderer
or
victim
there
was
no
other
way
it
is
a
pity
it
broke
said
Hermione
quietly
shaking
her
head
yeah
it
is
said
Ron
still
at
least
You-Know-Who
never
found
out
what
was
in
it
either
where
are
you
going
he
added
looking
both
surprised
and
disappointed
as
Harry
stood
up
er
Hagrids
said
Harry
you
know
he
just
got
back
and
I
promised
Id
go
down
and
see
him
and
tell
him
how
you
two
are
oh
all
right
then
said
Ron
grumpily
looking
out
of
the
dormitory
window
at
the
patch
of
bright
blue
sky
beyond
wish
we
could
come
say
hello
to
him
for
us
called
Hermione
as
Harry
proceeded
down
the
ward
and
ask
him
whats
happening
about
about
his
little
friend
harry
gave
a
wave
of
his
hand
to
show
he
had
heard
and
understood
as
he
left
the
dormitory
the
castle
seemed
very
quiet
even
for
a
Sunday
everybody
was
clearly
out
in
the
sunny
grounds
enjoying
the
end
of
their
exams
and
the
prospect
of
a
last
few
days
of
term
unhampered
by
revision
or
homework
harry
walked
slowly
along
the
deserted
corridor
peering
out
of
windows
as
he
went
he
could
see
people
messing
around
in
the
air
over
the
Quidditch
pitch
and
a
couple
of
students
swimming
in
the
lake
accompanied
by
the
giant
squid
he
was
finding
it
hard
to
decide
whether
he
wanted
to
be
with
people
or
not
whenever
he
was
in
company
he
wanted
to
get
away
and
whenever
he
was
alone
he
wanted
company
he
thought
he
might
really
go
and
visit
Hagrid
though
as
he
had
not
talked
to
him
properly
since
hed
returned
harry
had
just
descended
the
last
marble
step
into
the
Entrance
Hall
when
Malfoy
Crabbe
and
goyle
emerged
from
a
door
on
the
right
that
Harry
knew
led
down
to
the
Slytherin
common
room
harry
stopped
dead
so
did
Malfoy
and
the
others
the
only
sounds
were
the
shouts
laughter
and
splashes
drifting
into
the
Hall
from
the
grounds
through
the
open
front
doors
malfoy
glanced
around
Harry
knew
he
was
checking
for
signs
of
teachers
then
he
looked
back
at
Harry
and
said
in
a
low
voice
Youre
dead
Potter
harry
raised
his
eyebrows
funny
he
said
youd
think
Id
have
stopped
walking
around
malfoy
looked
angrier
than
Harry
had
ever
seen
him
he
felt
a
kind
of
detached
satisfaction
at
the
sight
of
his
pale
pointed
face
contorted
with
rage
youre
going
to
pay
said
Malfoy
in
a
voice
barely
louder
than
a
whisper
im
going
to
make
you
pay
for
what
youve
done
to
my
father
well
Im
terrified
now
said
Harry
sarcastically
i
spose
Lord
Voldemorts
just
a
warm-up
act
compared
to
you
three
whats
the
matter
he
added
for
Malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
had
all
looked
stricken
at
the
sound
of
the
name
hes
your
dads
mate
isnt
he
not
scared
of
him
are
you
you
think
youre
such
a
big
man
Potter
said
Malfoy
advancing
now
Crabbe
and
Goyle
flanking
him
you
wait
ill
have
you
you
cant
land
my
father
in
prison
i
thought
I
just
had
said
Harry
the
Dementors
have
left
Azkaban
said
Malfoy
quietly
dad
and
the
othersll
be
out
in
no
time
yeah
I
expect
they
will
said
Harry
Still
at
least
everyone
knows
what
scumbags
they
are
now
malfoys
hand
flew
towards
his
wand
but
Harry
was
too
quick
for
him
he
had
drawn
his
own
wand
before
Malfoys
fingers
had
even
entered
the
pocket
of
his
robes
potter
the
voice
rang
across
the
Entrance
Hall
snape
had
emerged
from
the
staircase
leading
down
to
his
office
and
at
the
sight
of
him
Harry
felt
a
great
rush
of
hatred
beyond
anything
he
felt
towards
Malfoy
whatever
Dumbledore
said
he
would
never
forgive
Snape
never
what
are
you
doing
Potter
said
Snape
as
coldly
as
ever
as
he
strode
over
to
the
four
of
them
im
trying
to
decide
what
curse
to
use
on
Malfoy
sir
said
Harry
fiercely
snape
stared
at
him
put
that
wand
away
at
once
he
said
curtly
ten
points
from
Gryff
snape
looked
towards
the
giant
hour-glasses
on
the
walls
and
gave
a
sneering
smile
ah.
I
see
there
are
no
longer
any
points
left
in
the
Gryffindor
hour-glass
to
take
away
in
that
case
Potter
we
will
simply
have
to
add
some
more
professor
McGonagall
had
just
stumped
up
the
stone
steps
into
the
castle
she
was
carrying
a
tartan
carpetbag
in
one
hand
and
leaning
heavily
on
a
walking
stick
with
her
other
but
otherwise
looked
quite
well
professor
McGonagall
said
Snape
striding
forwards
out
of
st.
Mungos
I
see
yes
Professor
Snape
said
Professor
McGonagall
shrugging
off
her
traveling
cloak
Im
quite
as
good
as
new
you
two
Crabbe
Goyle
she
beckoned
them
forwards
imperiously
and
they
came
shuffling
their
large
feet
and
looking
awkward
here
said
Professor
McGonagall
thrusting
her
carpetbag
into
Crabbes
chest
and
her
cloak
into
Goyles
take
these
up
to
my
office
for
me
they
turned
and
stumped
away
up
the
marble
staircase
right
then
said
Professor
McGonagall
looking
up
at
the
hourglasses
on
the
wall
well
I
think
Potter
and
his
friends
ought
to
have
fifty
points
apiece
for
alerting
the
world
to
the
return
of
You-Know-Who
what
say
you
Professor
Snape
what
snapped
Snape
though
Harry
knew
he
had
heard
perfectly
well
oh
well
I
suppose
so
thats
fifty
each
for
Potter
the
two
Weasleys
Longbottom
and
Miss
Granger
said
Professor
McGonagall
and
a
shower
of
rubies
fell
down
into
the
bottom
bulb
of
Gryffindors
hour-glass
as
she
spoke
oh
and
fifty
for
Miss
Lovegood
I
suppose
she
added
and
a
number
of
sapphires
fell
into
Ravenclaws
glass
now
you
wanted
to
take
ten
from
mr.
Potter
I
think
Professor
Snape
so
there
we
are
a
few
rubies
retreated
into
the
upper
bulb
leaving
a
respectable
amount
below
nevertheless
well
Potter
Malfoy
I
think
you
ought
to
be
outside
on
a
glorious
day
like
this
Professor
mcGonagall
continued
briskly
harry
did
not
need
telling
twice
he
thrust
his
wand
back
inside
his
robes
and
headed
straight
for
the
front
doors
without
another
glance
at
Snape
and
Malfoy
the
hot
sun
hit
him
with
a
blast
as
he
walked
across
the
lawns
towards
Hagrids
cabin
students
lying
around
on
the
grass
sunbathing
talking
reading
the
Sunday
Prophet
and
eating
sweets
looked
up
at
him
as
he
passed
some
called
out
to
him
or
else
waved
clearly
eager
to
show
that
they
like
the
Prophet
had
decided
he
was
something
of
a
hero
harry
said
nothing
to
any
of
them
he
had
no
idea
how
much
they
knew
of
what
had
happened
three
days
ago
but
he
had
so
far
avoided
being
questioned
and
preferred
to
keep
it
that
way
he
thought
at
first
when
he
knocked
on
Hagrids
cabin
door
that
he
was
out
but
then
Fang
came
charging
around
the
corner
and
almost
bowled
him
over
with
the
enthusiasm
of
his
welcome
hagrid
it
transpired
was
picking
runner
beans
in
his
back
garden
all
righ
Harry
he
said
beaming
when
Harry
approached
the
fence
come
in
come
in
well
have
a
cup
o
dandelion
juice
hows
things
hagrid
asked
him
as
they
settled
d
own
at
his
wooden
table
with
a
glass
apiece
of
iced
juice
yeh
er
feelin
all
righ
are
yeh
harry
knew
from
the
look
of
concern
on
Hagrids
face
that
he
was
not
referring
to
Harrys
physical
well-being
im
fine
Harry
said
quickly
because
he
could
no
t
bear
to
discuss
the
thing
that
he
knew
was
in
Hagrids
mind
so
wherere
you
been
bin
hidin
out
in
the
mountains
said
Hagrid
up
in
a
cave
like
Sirius
did
when
he
hagrid
broke
off
cleared
his
throat
gruffly
looked
at
Harry
and
took
a
long
draught
of
juice
anyway
back
now
he
said
feebly
you
you
look
better
said
Harry
who
was
determined
to
keep
the
conversation
moving
away
from
Sirius
wha
said
Hagrid
raising
a
massive
hand
and
feeling
his
face
oh
oh
yeah
well
Grawpys
loads
better
behaved
now
loads
seemed
right
pleased
ter
see
me
when
I
got
back
ter
tell
yeh
the
truth
hes
a
good
lad
really
ive
bin
thinkin
abou
tryin
ter
find
him
a
lady
friend
actually
harry
would
normally
have
tried
to
persuade
Hagrid
out
of
this
idea
at
once
the
prospect
of
a
second
giant
taking
up
residence
in
the
Forest
possibly
even
wilder
and
more
brutal
than
Grawp
was
positively
alarming
but
somehow
Harry
could
not
muster
the
energy
necessary
to
argue
the
point
he
was
starting
to
wish
he
was
alone
again
and
with
the
idea
of
hastening
his
departure
he
took
several
large
gulps
of
his
dandelion
juice
half-emptying
his
glass
evryone
knows
yehve
bin
tellin
the
truth
now
Harry
said
Hagrid
softly
and
unexpectedly
he
was
watching
Harry
closely
thas
gotta
be
better
hasn
it
harry
shrugged
look
hagrid
leaned
towards
him
across
the
table
I
knew
Sirius
longer
n
yeh
did
he
died
in
battle
an
thas
the
way
hedve
wanted
ter
go
he
didnt
want
to
go
at
all
said
Harry
angrily
hagrid
bowed
his
great
shaggy
head
nah
I
don
reckon
he
did
he
said
quietly
but
s
till
Harry
he
was
never
one
ter
sit
aroun
at
home
an
let
other
people
do
the
fightin
he
couldnve
lived
with
himself
if
he
hadn
gone
ter
help
harry
leapt
up
ive
got
to
go
and
visit
Ron
and
Hermione
in
the
hospital
wing
he
said
mechanically
oh
said
Hagrid
looking
rather
upset
oh
all
righ
then
Harry
take
care
o
yerself
then
an
drop
back
in
if
yehve
got
a
yeah
right
harry
crossed
to
the
door
as
fast
as
he
could
and
pulled
it
open
he
was
out
in
the
sunshine
again
before
Hagrid
had
finished
saying
goodbye
and
walking
away
across
the
lawn
once
again
people
called
out
to
him
as
he
passed
he
closed
his
eyes
for
a
few
moments
wishing
they
would
all
vanish
that
he
could
open
his
eyes
and
find
himself
alone
in
the
grounds
a
few
days
ago
before
his
exams
had
finished
and
he
had
seen
the
vision
Voldemort
had
planted
in
his
mind
he
would
have
given
almost
anything
for
the
wizarding
world
to
know
he
had
been
telling
the
truth
for
them
to
believe
that
Voldemort
was
back
and
to
know
that
he
was
neither
a
liar
nor
mad
now
however
he
walked
a
short
way
around
the
lake
sat
down
on
its
bank
sheltered
from
the
gaze
of
passersby
behind
a
tangle
of
shrubs
and
stared
out
over
the
gleaming
water
thinking
perhaps
the
reason
he
wanted
to
be
alone
was
because
he
had
felt
isolated
from
everybody
since
his
talk
with
Dumbledore
an
invisible
barrier
separated
him
from
the
rest
of
the
world
he
was
he
had
always
been
a
marked
man
it
was
just
that
he
had
never
really
understood
what
that
meant
and
yet
sitting
here
on
the
edge
of
the
lake
with
the
terrible
weight
of
grief
dragging
at
him
with
the
loss
of
Sirius
so
raw
and
fresh
inside
he
could
not
muster
any
great
sense
of
fear
it
was
sunny
and
the
grounds
around
him
were
full
of
laughing
people
and
even
though
he
felt
as
distant
from
them
as
though
he
belonged
to
a
different
race
it
was
still
very
hard
to
believe
as
he
sat
here
that
his
life
must
include
or
end
in
murder
he
sat
there
for
a
long
time
gazing
out
at
the
water
trying
not
to
think
about
his
godfather
or
to
remember
that
it
was
directly
across
from
here
on
the
opposite
bank
that
Sirius
had
once
collapsed
trying
to
fend
off
a
hundred
Dementors
the
sun
had
set
before
he
realized
he
was
cold
he
got
up
and
returned
to
the
castle
wiping
his
face
on
his
sleeve
as
he
went
ron
and
Hermione
left
the
hospital
wing
completely
cured
three
days
before
the
end
of
term
hermione
kept
showing
signs
of
wanting
to
talk
about
Sirius
but
Ron
tended
to
make
hushing
noises
every
time
she
mentioned
his
name
harry
was
still
not
sure
whether
or
not
he
wanted
to
talk
about
his
godfather
yet
his
wishes
varied
with
his
mood
he
knew
one
thing
though
unhappy
as
he
felt
at
the
moment
he
would
greatly
miss
Hogwarts
in
a
few
days
time
when
he
was
back
at
number
four
Privet
Drive
even
though
he
now
understood
exactly
why
he
had
to
return
there
every
summer
he
did
not
feel
any
better
about
it
indeed
he
had
never
dreaded
his
return
more
professor
Umbridge
left
Hogwarts
the
day
before
the
end
of
term
it
seemed
she
had
crept
out
of
the
hospital
wing
during
dinnertime
evidently
hoping
to
depart
undetected
but
unfortunately
for
her
she
met
Peeves
on
the
way
who
seized
his
last
chance
to
do
as
Fred
had
instructed
and
chased
her
gleefully
from
the
premises
whacking
her
alternately
with
a
walking
stick
and
a
sock
full
of
chalk
many
students
ran
out
into
the
Entrance
Hall
to
watch
her
running
away
down
the
path
and
the
Heads
of
Houses
tried
only
half-heartedly
to
restrain
them
indeed
Professor
mcGonagall
sank
back
into
her
chair
at
the
staff
table
after
a
few
feeble
remonstrances
and
was
clearly
heard
to
express
a
regret
that
she
could
not
run
cheering
after
Umbridge
herself
because
peeves
had
borrowed
her
walking
stick
their
last
evening
at
school
arrived
most
people
had
finished
packing
and
were
already
heading
down
to
the
end-of-term
feast
but
Harry
had
not
even
started
just
do
it
tomorrow
said
Ron
who
was
waiting
by
the
door
of
their
dormitory
come
on
Im
starving
i
wont
be
long
look
you
go
ahead
but
when
the
dormitory
door
closed
behind
Ron
Harry
made
no
effort
to
speed
up
his
packing
the
very
last
thing
he
wanted
to
do
was
to
attend
the
Leaving
Feast
he
was
worried
that
dumbledore
would
make
some
reference
to
him
in
his
speech
he
was
sure
to
mention
voldemorts
return
he
had
talked
to
them
about
it
last
year
after
all
harry
pulled
some
crumpled
robes
out
of
the
very
bottom
of
his
trunk
to
make
way
for
folded
ones
and
as
he
did
so
noticed
a
badly
wrapped
package
lying
in
a
corner
of
it
he
could
not
think
what
it
was
doing
there
he
bent
down
pulled
it
out
from
underneath
his
trainers
and
examined
it
he
realized
what
it
was
within
seconds
sirius
had
given
it
to
him
just
inside
the
front
door
of
number
twelve
Grimmauld
Place
use
it
if
you
need
me
all
right
harry
sank
down
on
to
his
bed
and
unwrapped
the
package
out
fell
a
small
square
mirror
it
looked
old
it
was
certainly
dirty
harry
held
it
up
to
his
face
and
saw
his
own
reflection
looking
back
at
him
he
turned
the
mirror
over
there
on
the
reverse
side
was
a
scribbled
note
from
Sirius
this
is
a
two-way
mirror
Ive
got
the
other
if
you
need
to
speak
to
me
just
say
my
name
into
it
youll
appear
in
my
mirror
and
Ill
be
able
to
talk
in
yours
james
and
I
used
to
use
them
when
we
were
in
separate
detentions
harrys
heart
began
to
race
he
remembered
seeing
his
dead
parents
in
the
Mirror
of
Erised
four
years
ago
he
was
going
to
be
able
to
talk
to
Sirius
again
right
now
he
knew
it
he
looked
around
to
make
sure
there
was
nobody
else
there
the
dormitory
was
quite
empty
he
looked
back
at
the
mirror
raised
it
in
front
of
his
face
with
trembling
hands
and
said
loudly
and
clearly
Sirius
his
breath
misted
the
surface
of
the
glass
he
held
the
mirror
even
closer
excitement
flooding
through
him
but
the
eyes
blinking
back
at
him
through
the
fog
were
definitely
his
own
he
wiped
the
mirror
clear
again
and
said
so
that
every
syllable
rang
clearly
through
the
room
sirius
Black
nothing
happened
the
frustrated
face
looking
back
out
of
the
mirror
was
still
definitely
his
own
sirius
didnt
have
his
mirror
on
him
when
he
went
through
the
archway
said
a
small
voice
in
harrys
head
thats
why
its
not
working
harry
remained
quite
still
for
a
moment
then
hurled
the
mirror
back
into
the
trunk
where
it
shattered
he
had
been
convinced
for
a
whole
shining
minute
that
he
was
going
to
see
Sirius
talk
to
him
again
disappointment
was
burning
in
his
throat
he
got
up
and
began
throwing
his
things
pell-mell
into
the
trunk
on
top
of
the
broken
mirror
but
then
an
idea
struck
him
a
better
idea
than
a
mirror
a
much
bigger
more
important
idea
how
had
he
never
thought
of
it
before
why
had
he
never
asked
he
was
sprinting
out
of
the
dormitory
and
down
the
spiral
staircase
hitting
the
walls
as
he
ran
and
barely
noticing
he
hurtled
across
the
empty
common
room
through
the
portrait
hole
and
off
along
the
corridor
ignoring
the
Fat
Lady
who
called
after
him
The
feast
is
about
to
start
you
know
youre
cutting
it
very
fine
but
Harry
had
no
intention
of
going
to
the
feast
how
could
it
be
that
the
place
was
full
of
ghosts
whenever
you
didnt
need
one
yet
now
he
ran
down
staircases
and
along
corridors
and
met
nobody
either
alive
or
dead
they
were
all
clearly
in
the
Great
Hall
outside
his
Charms
classroom
he
came
to
a
halt
panting
and
thinking
disconsolately
that
he
would
have
to
wait
until
later
until
after
the
end
of
the
feast
but
just
as
he
had
given
up
hope
he
saw
it
a
translucent
somebody
drifting
across
the
end
of
the
corridor
hey
hey
Nick
nick
the
ghost
stuck
its
head
back
out
of
the
wall
revealing
the
extravagantly
plumed
hat
and
dangerously
wobbling
head
of
Sir
Nicholas
de
Mimsy-Porpington
good
evening
he
said
withdrawing
the
rest
of
his
body
from
the
solid
stone
and
smiling
at
harry
I
am
not
the
only
one
who
is
late
then
though
he
sighed
in
a
rather
different
sense
of
course
nick
can
I
ask
you
something
a
most
peculiar
expression
stole
over
Nearly
Headless
Nicks
face
as
he
inserted
a
finger
in
the
stiff
ruff
at
his
neck
and
tugged
it
a
little
straighter
apparently
to
give
himself
thinking
time
he
desisted
only
when
his
partially
severed
neck
seemed
about
to
give
way
completely
er
now
Harry
said
Nick
looking
discomfited
cant
it
wait
until
after
the
feast
no
Nick
please
said
Harry
I
really
need
to
talk
to
you
can
we
go
in
here
harry
opened
the
door
of
the
nearest
classroom
and
Nearly
Headless
Nick
sighed
oh
very
well
he
said
looking
resigned
i
cant
pretend
I
havent
been
expecting
it
harry
was
holding
the
door
open
for
him
but
he
drifted
through
the
wall
instead
expecting
what
harry
asked
as
he
closed
the
door
you
to
come
and
find
me
said
Nick
now
gliding
over
to
the
window
and
looking
out
at
the
darkening
grounds
it
happens
sometimes
when
somebody
has
suffered
a
loss
well
said
Harry
refusing
to
be
deflected
you
were
right
Ive
Ive
come
to
find
you
nick
said
nothing
its
said
Harry
who
was
finding
this
more
awkward
than
he
had
anticipated
its
just
youre
dead
but
youre
still
here
arent
you
nick
sighed
and
continued
to
gaze
out
at
the
grounds
thats
right
isnt
it
harry
urged
him
you
died
but
Im
talking
to
you
you
can
walk
around
Hogwarts
and
everything
cant
you
yes
said
Nearly
Headless
Nick
quietly
I
walk
and
talk
yes
so
you
came
back
didnt
you
said
Harry
urgently
people
can
come
back
right
as
ghosts
they
dont
have
to
disappear
completely
well
he
added
impatiently
when
Nick
continued
to
say
nothing
nearly
Headless
Nick
hesitated
then
said
Not
everyone
can
come
back
as
a
ghost
what
dyou
mean
said
Harry
quickly
only
only
wizards
oh
said
Harry
and
he
almost
laughed
with
relief
well
thats
okay
then
the
person
Im
asking
about
is
a
wizard
so
he
can
come
back
right
nick
turned
away
from
the
window
and
looked
mournfully
at
Harry
he
wont
come
back
who
sirius
Black
said
Nick
but
you
did
said
Harry
angrily
you
came
back
youre
dead
and
you
didnt
disappear
wizards
can
leave
an
imprint
of
themselves
upon
the
earth
to
walk
palely
where
their
living
selves
once
trod
said
Nick
miserably
but
very
few
wizards
choose
that
path
why
not
said
Harry
anyway
it
doesnt
matter
Sirius
wont
care
if
its
unusual
hell
come
back
I
know
he
will
and
so
strong
was
his
belief
Harry
actually
turned
his
head
to
check
the
door
sure
for
a
split
second
that
he
was
going
to
see
Sirius
pearly-white
and
transparent
but
beaming
walking
through
it
towards
him
he
will
not
come
back
repeated
Nick
he
will
have
gone
on
what
dyou
mean
gone
on
said
Harry
quickly
Gone
on
where
listen
what
happens
when
you
die
anyway
where
do
you
go
why
doesnt
everyone
come
back
why
isnt
this
place
full
of
ghosts
why
i
cannot
answer
said
Nick
youre
dead
arent
you
said
Harry
exasperatedly
who
can
answer
better
than
you
i
was
afraid
of
death
said
Nick
softly
i
chose
to
remain
behind
i
sometimes
wonder
whether
I
oughtnt
to
have
well
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
in
fact
I
am
neither
here
nor
there
he
gave
a
small
sad
chuckle
i
know
nothing
of
the
secrets
of
death
Harry
for
I
chose
my
feeble
imitation
of
life
instead
i
believe
learned
wizards
study
the
matter
in
the
Department
of
mysteries
dont
talk
to
me
about
that
place
said
Harry
fiercely
i
am
sorry
not
to
have
been
more
help
said
Nick
gently
Well
well
do
excuse
me
the
feast
you
know
and
he
left
the
room
leaving
Harry
there
alone
gazing
blankly
at
the
wall
through
which
Nick
had
disappeared
harry
felt
almost
as
though
he
had
lost
his
godfather
all
over
again
in
losing
the
hope
that
he
might
be
able
to
see
or
speak
to
him
once
more
he
walked
slowly
and
miserably
back
up
through
the
empty
castle
wondering
whether
he
would
ever
feel
cheerful
again
he
had
turned
the
corner
towards
the
Fat
Ladys
corridor
when
he
saw
somebody
up
ahead
fastening
a
note
to
a
board
on
the
wall
a
second
glance
showed
him
it
was
Luna
there
were
no
good
hiding
places
nearby
she
was
bound
to
have
heard
his
footsteps
and
in
any
case
Harry
could
hardly
muster
the
energy
to
avoid
anyone
at
the
moment
hello
said
Luna
vaguely
glancing
around
at
him
as
she
stepped
back
from
the
notice
how
come
youre
not
at
the
feast
harry
asked
well
Ive
lost
most
of
my
possessions
said
Luna
serenely
people
take
them
and
hide
them
you
know
but
as
its
the
last
night
I
really
do
need
them
back
so
Ive
been
putting
up
signs
she
gestured
towards
the
noticeboard
upon
which
sure
enough
she
had
pinned
a
list
of
all
her
missing
books
and
clothes
with
a
plea
for
their
return
an
odd
feeling
rose
in
Harry
an
emotion
quite
different
from
the
anger
and
grief
that
had
filled
him
since
Siriuss
death
it
was
a
few
moments
before
he
realized
that
he
was
feeling
sorry
for
luna
how
come
people
hide
your
stuff
he
asked
her
frowning
oh
well
she
shrugged
i
think
they
think
Im
a
bit
odd
you
know
some
people
call
me
loony
Lovegood
actually
harry
looked
at
her
and
the
new
feeling
of
pity
intensified
rather
painfully
thats
no
reason
for
them
to
take
your
things
he
said
flatly
dyou
want
help
finding
them
oh
no
she
said
smiling
at
him
theyll
come
back
they
always
do
in
the
end
it
was
just
that
I
wanted
to
pack
tonight
anyway
why
arent
you
at
the
feast
harry
shrugged
just
didnt
feel
like
it
no
said
Luna
observing
him
with
those
oddly
misty
protuberant
eyes
i
dont
suppose
you
do
that
man
the
Death
Eaters
killed
was
your
godfather
wasnt
he
ginny
told
me
harry
nodded
curtly
but
found
that
for
some
reason
he
did
not
mind
Luna
talking
about
Sirius
he
had
just
remembered
that
she
too
could
see
Thestrals
have
you
he
began
i
mean
who
has
anyone
you
known
ever
died
yes
said
Luna
simply
my
mother
she
was
a
quite
extraordinary
witch
you
know
but
she
did
like
to
experiment
and
one
of
her
spells
went
rather
badly
wrong
one
day
i
was
nine
im
sorry
Harry
mumbled
yes
it
was
rather
horrible
said
Luna
conversationally
i
still
feel
very
sad
about
it
sometimes
but
Ive
still
got
Dad
and
anyway
its
not
as
though
Ill
never
see
Mum
again
is
it
er
isnt
it
said
Harry
uncertainly
she
shook
her
head
in
disbelief
oh
come
on
you
heard
them
just
behind
the
veil
didnt
you
you
mean
in
that
room
with
the
archway
they
were
just
lurking
out
of
sight
thats
all
you
heard
them
they
looked
at
each
other
luna
was
smiling
slightly
harry
did
not
know
what
to
say
or
to
think
Luna
believed
so
many
extraordinary
things
yet
he
had
been
sure
he
had
heard
voices
behind
the
veil
too
are
you
sure
you
dont
want
me
to
help
you
look
for
your
stuff
he
said
oh
no
said
Luna
no
I
think
Ill
just
go
down
and
have
some
pudding
and
wait
for
it
all
to
turn
up
it
always
does
in
the
end
well
have
a
nice
holiday
Harry
yeah
yeah
you
too
she
walked
away
from
him
and
as
he
watched
her
go
he
found
that
the
terrible
weight
in
his
stomach
seemed
to
have
lessened
slightly
the
journey
home
on
the
Hogwarts
Express
next
day
was
eventful
in
several
ways
firstly
malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
who
had
clearly
been
waiting
all
week
for
the
opportunity
to
strike
without
teacher
witnesses
attempted
to
ambush
Harry
halfway
down
the
train
as
he
made
his
way
back
from
the
toilet
the
attack
might
have
succeeded
had
it
not
been
for
the
fact
that
they
unwittingly
chose
to
stage
the
attack
right
outside
a
compartment
full
of
D
a.
members
who
saw
what
was
happening
through
the
glass
and
rose
as
one
to
rush
to
Harrys
aid
by
the
time
Ernie
macmillan
Hannah
Abbott
Susan
Bones
Justin
Finch-Fletchley
Anthony
Goldstein
and
Terry
boot
had
finished
using
a
wide
variety
of
the
hexes
and
jinxes
Harry
had
taught
them
Malfoy
crabbe
and
Goyle
resembled
nothing
so
much
as
three
gigantic
slugs
squeezed
into
Hogwarts
uniforms
as
Harry
Ernie
and
Justin
hoisted
them
into
the
luggage
rack
and
left
them
there
to
ooze
i
must
say
Im
looking
forward
to
seeing
Malfoys
mothers
face
when
he
gets
off
the
train
said
Ernie
with
some
satisfaction
as
he
watched
Malfoy
squirm
above
him
ernie
had
never
quite
got
over
the
indignity
of
Malfoy
docking
points
from
Hufflepuff
during
his
brief
spell
as
a
member
of
the
Inquisitorial
Squad
goyles
mumll
be
really
pleased
though
said
Ron
who
had
come
to
investigate
the
source
of
the
commotion
hes
loads
better
looking
now
anyway
Harry
the
food
trolleys
just
stopped
if
you
want
anything
harry
thanked
the
others
and
accompanied
Ron
back
to
their
compartment
where
he
bought
a
large
pile
of
cauldron
cakes
and
pumpkin
pasties
hermione
was
reading
the
Daily
Prophet
again
Ginny
was
doing
a
quiz
in
The
Quibbler
and
Neville
was
stroking
his
Mimbulus
mimbletonia
which
had
grown
a
great
deal
over
the
year
and
now
made
odd
crooning
noises
when
touched
harry
and
Ron
whiled
away
most
of
the
journey
playing
wizard
chess
while
Hermione
read
out
snippets
from
the
Prophet
it
was
now
full
of
articles
about
how
to
repel
Dementors
attempts
by
the
Ministry
to
track
down
Death
Eaters
and
hysterical
letters
claiming
that
the
writer
had
seen
lord
Voldemort
walking
past
their
house
that
very
morning
it
hasnt
really
started
yet
sighed
Hermione
gloomily
folding
up
the
newspaper
again
but
it
wont
be
long
now
hey
Harry
said
Ron
softly
nodding
towards
the
glass
window
on
to
the
corridor
harry
looked
around
cho
was
passing
accompanied
by
Marietta
Edgecombe
who
was
wearing
a
balaclava
his
and
Chos
eyes
met
for
a
moment
cho
blushed
and
kept
walking
harry
looked
back
down
at
the
chessboard
just
in
time
to
see
one
of
his
pawns
chased
off
its
square
by
Rons
knight
whats
er
going
on
with
you
and
her
anyway
ron
asked
quietly
nothing
said
Harry
truthfully
i
er
heard
shes
going
out
with
someone
else
now
said
Hermione
tentatively
harry
was
surprised
to
find
that
this
information
did
not
hurt
at
all
wanting
to
impress
Cho
seemed
to
belong
to
a
past
that
was
no
longer
quite
connected
with
him
so
much
of
what
he
had
wanted
before
Sirius
death
felt
that
way
these
days
the
week
that
had
elapsed
since
he
had
last
seen
Sirius
seemed
to
have
lasted
much
much
longer
it
stretched
across
two
universes
the
one
with
Sirius
in
it
and
the
one
without
youre
well
out
of
it
mate
said
Ron
forcefully
i
mean
shes
quite
good-looking
and
all
that
but
you
want
someone
a
bit
more
cheerful
shes
probably
cheerful
enough
with
someone
else
said
Harry
shrugging
whos
she
with
now
anyway
ron
asked
Hermione
but
it
was
Ginny
who
answered
michael
Corner
she
said
michael
but
said
Ron
craning
around
in
hiss
eat
to
stare
at
her
but
you
were
going
out
with
him
not
any
more
said
Ginny
resolutely
he
didnt
like
Gryffindor
beating
Ravenclaw
at
quidditch
and
got
really
sulky
so
I
ditched
him
and
he
ran
off
to
comfort
Cho
instead
she
scratched
her
nose
absently
with
the
end
of
her
quill
turned
The
Quibbler
upside-down
and
began
marking
her
answers
ron
looked
highly
delighted
well
I
always
thought
he
was
a
bit
of
an
idiot
he
said
prodding
his
queen
forwards
towards
harrys
quivering
castle
good
for
you
just
choose
someone
better
next
time
he
cast
Harry
an
oddly
furtive
look
as
he
said
it
well
Ive
chosen
Dean
Thomas
would
you
say
hes
better
asked
Ginny
vaguely
what
shouted
Ron
upending
the
chessboard
Crookshanks
went
plunging
after
the
pieces
and
Hedwig
and
Pigwidgeon
twittered
and
hooted
angrily
from
overhead
as
the
train
slowed
down
in
the
approach
to
Kings
Cross
Harry
thought
he
had
never
wanted
to
leave
it
less
he
even
wondered
fleetingly
what
would
happen
if
he
simply
refused
to
get
off
but
remained
stubbornly
sitting
there
until
the
first
of
September
when
it
would
take
him
back
to
hogwarts
when
it
finally
puffed
to
a
standstill
however
he
lifted
down
Hedwigs
cage
and
prepared
to
drag
his
trunk
from
the
train
as
usual
when
the
ticket
inspector
signaled
to
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
that
it
was
safe
to
walk
through
the
magical
barrier
between
platforms
nine
and
ten
however
he
found
a
surprise
awaiting
him
on
the
other
side
a
group
of
people
standing
there
to
greet
him
who
he
had
not
expected
at
all
there
was
Mad-Eye
Moody
looking
quite
as
sinister
with
his
bowler
hat
pulled
low
over
his
magical
eye
as
he
would
have
done
without
it
his
gnarled
hands
clutching
a
long
staff
his
body
wrapped
in
a
voluminous
traveling
cloak
tonks
stood
just
behind
him
her
bright
bubble-gumpink
hair
gleaming
in
the
sunlight
filtering
through
the
dirty
glass
of
the
station
ceiling
wearing
heavily
patched
jeans
and
a
bright
purple
t-shirt
bearing
the
legend
The
Weird
Sisters
next
to
Tonks
was
Lupin
his
face
pale
his
hair
graying
a
long
and
threadbare
overcoat
covering
a
shabby
jumper
and
trousers
at
the
front
of
the
group
stood
mr.
and
Mrs
weasley
dressed
in
their
Muggle
best
and
Fred
and
George
who
were
both
wearing
brand-new
jackets
in
some
lurid
green
scaly
material
ron
Ginny
called
Mrs
weasley
hurrying
forwards
and
hugging
her
children
tightly
Oh
and
Harry
dear
how
are
you
fine
lied
Harry
as
she
pulled
him
into
a
tight
embrace
over
her
shoulder
he
saw
Ron
goggling
at
the
twins
new
clothes
what
are
they
supposed
to
be
he
asked
pointing
at
the
jackets
finest
dragonskin
little
bro
said
Fred
giving
his
zip
a
little
tweak
business
is
booming
and
we
thought
wed
treat
ourselves
hello
Harry
said
Lupin
as
Mrs
weasley
let
go
of
Harry
and
turned
to
greet
Hermione
hi
said
Harry
I
didnt
expect
what
are
you
all
doing
here
well
said
Lupin
with
a
slight
smile
we
thought
we
might
have
a
little
chat
with
your
aunt
and
uncle
before
letting
them
take
you
home
i
dunno
if
thats
a
good
idea
said
Harry
at
once
oh
I
think
it
is
growled
Moody
who
had
limped
a
little
closer
thatll
be
them
will
it
potter
he
pointed
with
his
thumb
over
his
shoulder
his
magical
eye
was
evidently
peering
through
the
back
of
his
head
and
his
bowler
hat
harry
leaned
an
inch
or
so
to
the
left
to
see
where
Mad-Eye
was
pointing
and
there
sure
enough
were
the
three
Dursleys
who
looked
positively
appalled
to
see
Harrys
reception
committee
ah
Harry
said
mr.
Weasley
turning
from
Hermione
s
parents
who
he
had
just
greeted
enthusiastically
and
who
were
now
taking
it
in
turns
to
hug
Hermione
well
shall
we
do
it
then
yeah
I
reckon
so
Arthur
said
Moody
he
and
mr.
Weasley
took
the
lead
across
the
station
towards
the
Dursleys
who
were
apparently
rooted
to
the
floor
hermione
disengaged
herself
gently
from
her
mother
to
join
the
group
good
afternoon
said
mr.
Weasley
pleasantly
to
Uncle
Vernon
as
he
came
to
a
halt
right
in
front
of
him
you
might
remember
me
my
names
Arthur
Weasley
as
mr.
Weasley
had
single-handedly
demolished
most
o
f
the
Dursleys
living
room
two
years
previously
Harry
would
have
been
very
surprised
if
Uncle
Vernon
had
forgotten
him
sure
enough
Uncle
Vernon
turned
a
deeper
shade
of
puce
and
glared
at
mr.
Weasley
but
chose
not
to
say
anything
partly
perhaps
because
the
Dursleys
were
outnumbered
two
to
one
aunt
Petunia
looked
both
frightened
and
embarrassed
she
kept
glancing
around
as
though
terrified
somebody
she
knew
would
see
her
in
such
company
dudley
meanwhile
seemed
to
be
trying
to
look
small
and
insignificant
a
feat
at
which
he
was
failing
extravagantly
we
thought
wed
just
have
a
few
words
with
you
about
Harry
said
mr.
Weasley
still
smiling
yeah
growled
Moody
about
how
hes
treated
when
hes
at
your
place
uncle
Vernons
moustache
seemed
to
bristle
with
indignation
possibly
because
the
bowler
hat
gave
him
the
entirely
mistaken
impression
that
he
was
dealing
with
a
kindred
spirit
he
addressed
himself
to
Moody
i
am
not
aware
that
it
is
any
of
your
business
what
goes
on
in
my
house
i
expect
what
youre
not
aware
of
would
fill
several
books
Dursley
growled
Moody
anyway
thats
not
the
point
interjected
Tonks
whose
pink
hair
seemed
to
offend
Aunt
Petunia
more
than
all
the
rest
put
together
for
she
closed
her
eyes
rather
than
look
at
her
the
point
is
if
we
find
out
youve
been
horrible
to
Harry
And
make
no
mistake
well
hear
about
it
added
Lupin
pleasantly
yes
said
mr.
Weasley
even
if
you
wont
let
Harry
use
the
fellytone
telephone
whispered
Hermione
Yeah
if
we
get
any
hint
that
Potters
been
mistreated
in
any
way
youll
have
us
to
answer
to
said
Moody
uncle
Vernon
swelled
ominously
his
sense
of
outrage
seemed
to
outweigh
even
his
fear
of
this
bunch
of
oddballs
are
you
threatening
me
sir
he
said
so
loudly
t
hat
passers-by
actually
turned
to
stare
yes
I
am
said
Mad-Eye
who
seemed
rather
pleased
that
Uncle
Vernon
had
grasped
this
fact
so
quickly
and
do
I
look
like
the
kind
of
man
who
can
be
intimidated
barked
Uncle
Vernon
well
said
Moody
pushing
back
his
bowler
hat
to
reveal
his
sinisterly
revolving
magical
eye
uncle
Vernon
leapt
backwards
in
horror
and
collided
painfully
with
a
luggage
trolley
yes
Id
have
to
say
you
do
Dursley
he
turned
away
from
Uncle
Vernon
to
survey
Harry
so
Potter
give
us
a
shout
if
you
need
us
if
we
dont
hear
from
you
for
three
days
in
a
row
well
send
someone
along
aunt
Petunia
whimpered
piteously
it
could
not
have
been
plainer
that
she
was
thinking
of
what
the
neighbors
would
say
if
they
caught
sight
of
these
people
marching
up
the
garden
path
bye
then
Potter
said
Moody
grasping
Harrys
shoulder
for
a
moment
with
a
gnarled
hand
take
care
Harry
said
Lupin
quietly
keep
in
touch
harry
well
have
you
away
from
there
as
soon
as
we
can
Mrs
weasley
whispered
hugging
him
again
well
see
you
soon
mate
said
Ron
anxiously
shaking
Harrys
hand
really
soon
Harry
said
Hermione
earnestly
we
promise
harry
nodded
he
somehow
could
not
find
words
to
tell
them
what
it
meant
to
him
to
see
them
all
ranged
there
on
his
side
instead
he
smiled
raised
a
hand
in
farewell
turned
around
and
led
the
way
out
of
the
station
towards
the
sunlit
street
with
Uncle
Vernon
Aunt
Petunia
and
Dudley
hurrying
along
in
his
wake
