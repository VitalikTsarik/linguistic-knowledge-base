the
worst
birthday
not
for
the
first
time
an
argument
had
broken
out
over
breakfast
at
number
four
Privet
Drive
mr.
Vernon
Dursley
had
been
woken
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
by
a
loud
hooting
noise
from
his
nephew
harry's
room
third
time
this
week
he
roared
across
the
table
if
you
can't
control
that
owl
it'll
have
to
go
harry
tried
yet
again
to
explain
she's
bored
he
said
she's
used
to
flying
around
outside
if
I
could
just
let
her
out
at
night
do
I
look
stupid
snarled
Uncle
Vernon
a
bit
of
fried
egg
dangling
from
his
bushy
mustache
i
know
what'll
happen
if
that
owl's
let
out
he
exchanged
dark
looks
with
his
wife
Petunia
harry
tried
to
argue
back
but
his
words
were
drowned
by
a
long
loud
belch
from
the
Dursleys
son
Dudley
i
want
more
bacon
there's
more
in
the
frying
pan
sweetums
said
Aunt
Petunia
turning
misty
eyes
on
her
massive
son
we
must
build
you
up
while
we've
got
the
chance
i
don't
like
the
sound
of
that
school
food
nonsense
Petunia
I
never
went
hungry
when
I
was
at
Smeltings
said
Uncle
Vernon
heartily
dudley
gets
enough
don't
you
son
dudley
who
was
so
large
his
bottom
drooped
over
either
side
of
the
kitchen
chair
grinned
and
turned
to
Harry
pass
the
frying
pan
you've
forgotten
the
magic
word
said
Harry
irritably
the
effect
of
this
simple
sentence
on
the
rest
of
the
family
was
incredible
Dudley
gasped
and
fell
off
his
chair
with
a
crash
that
shook
the
whole
kitchen
Mrs
dursley
gave
a
small
scream
and
clapped
her
hands
to
her
mouth
mr.
Dursley
jumped
to
his
feet
veins
throbbing
in
his
temples
i
meant
please
said
Harry
quickly
i
didn't
mean
what
have
I
told
you
thundered
his
uncle
spraying
spit
over
the
table
about
saying
the
M
word
in
our
house
but
I
how
dare
you
threaten
dudley
roared
Uncle
vernon
pounding
the
table
with
his
fist
i
just
i
warned
you
i
will
not
tolerate
mention
of
your
abnormality
under
this
roof
harry
stared
from
his
purple-faced
uncle
to
his
pale
aunt
who
was
trying
to
heave
Dudley
to
his
feet
all
right
said
Harry
all
right
uncle
Vernon
sat
back
down
breathing
like
a
winded
rhinoceros
and
watching
Harry
closely
out
of
the
corners
of
his
small
sharp
eyes
ever
since
Harry
had
come
home
for
the
summer
holidays
Uncle
vernon
had
been
treating
him
like
a
bomb
that
might
go
off
at
any
moment
because
Harry
Potter
wasn't
a
normal
boy
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
was
as
not
normal
as
it
is
possible
to
be
harry
Potter
was
a
wizard
a
wizard
fresh
from
his
first
year
at
hogwarts
School
of
Witchcraft
and
Wizardry
and
if
the
Dursleys
were
unhappy
to
have
him
back
for
the
holidays
it
was
nothing
to
how
harry
felt
he
missed
Hogwarts
so
much
it
was
like
having
a
constant
stomachache
he
missed
the
castle
with
its
secret
passageways
and
ghosts
his
classes
though
perhaps
not
Snape
the
Potions
master
the
mail
arriving
by
owl
eating
banquets
in
the
Great
Hall
sleeping
in
his
four-poster
bed
in
the
tower
dormitory
visiting
the
gamekeeper
hagrid
in
his
cabin
next
to
the
Forbidden
Forest
in
the
grounds
and
especially
Quidditch
the
most
popular
sport
in
the
wizarding
world
six
tall
goal
posts
four
flying
balls
and
fourteen
players
on
broomsticks
all
harry's
spellbooks
his
wand
robes
cauldron
and
top-of-the-line
nimbus
Two
Thousand
broomstick
had
been
locked
in
a
cupboard
under
the
stairs
by
Uncle
Vernon
the
instant
Harry
had
come
home
what
did
the
Dursleys
care
if
Harry
lost
his
place
on
the
House
quidditch
team
because
he
hadn't
practiced
all
summer
what
was
it
to
the
Dursleys
if
Harry
went
back
to
school
without
any
of
his
homework
done
the
Dursleys
were
what
wizards
called
Muggles
not
a
drop
of
magical
blood
in
their
veins
and
as
far
as
they
were
concerned
having
a
wizard
in
the
family
was
a
matter
of
deepest
shame
uncle
Vernon
had
even
padlocked
harry's
owl
Hedwig
inside
her
cage
to
stop
her
from
carrying
messages
to
anyone
in
the
wizarding
world
harry
looked
nothing
like
the
rest
of
the
family
uncle
Vernon
was
large
and
neckless
with
an
enormous
black
mustache
Aunt
Petunia
was
horse-faced
and
bony
Dudley
was
blond
pink
and
porky
harry
on
the
other
hand
was
small
and
skinny
with
brilliant
green
eyes
and
jet-black
hair
that
was
always
untidy
he
wore
round
glasses
and
on
his
forehead
was
a
thin
lightning-shaped
scar
it
was
this
scar
that
made
Harry
so
particularly
unusual
even
for
a
wizard
this
scar
was
the
only
hint
of
harry's
very
mysterious
past
of
the
reason
he
had
been
left
on
the
Dursleys
doorstep
eleven
years
before
at
the
age
of
one
year
old
Harry
had
somehow
survived
a
curse
from
the
greatest
Dark
sorcerer
of
all
time
Lord
Voldemort
whose
name
most
witches
and
wizards
still
feared
to
speak
harry's
parents
had
died
in
voldemort's
attack
but
Harry
had
escaped
with
his
lightning
scar
and
somehow
nobody
understood
why
voldemort's
powers
had
been
destroyed
the
instant
he
had
failed
to
kill
Harry
so
Harry
had
been
brought
up
by
his
dead
mother's
sister
and
her
husband
he
had
spent
ten
years
with
the
Dursleys
never
understanding
why
he
kept
making
odd
things
happen
without
meaning
to
believing
the
Dursleys
story
that
he
had
got
his
scar
in
the
car
crash
that
had
killed
his
parents
and
then
exactly
a
year
ago
Hogwarts
had
written
to
Harry
and
the
whole
story
had
come
out
harry
had
taken
up
his
place
at
wizard
school
where
he
and
his
scar
were
famous
but
now
the
school
year
was
over
and
he
was
back
with
the
Dursleys
for
the
summer
back
to
being
treated
like
a
dog
that
had
rolled
in
something
smelly
the
Dursleys
hadn't
even
remembered
that
today
happened
to
be
harry's
twelfth
birthday
of
course
his
hopes
hadn't
been
high
they'd
never
given
him
a
real
present
let
alone
a
cake
but
to
ignore
it
completely
at
that
moment
Uncle
Vernon
cleared
his
throat
importantly
and
said
now
as
we
all
know
today
is
a
very
important
day
harry
looked
up
hardly
daring
to
believe
it
this
could
well
be
the
day
I
make
the
biggest
deal
of
my
career
said
Uncle
Vernon
harry
went
back
to
his
toast
of
course
he
thought
bitterly
Un
cle
Vernon
was
talking
about
the
stupid
dinner
party
he'd
been
talk
ing
of
nothing
else
for
two
weeks
some
rich
builder
and
his
wife
were
coming
to
dinner
and
Uncle
Vernon
was
hoping
to
get
a
huge
order
from
him
Uncle
vernon's
company
made
drills
i
think
we
should
run
through
the
schedule
one
more
time
said
uncle
Vernon
we
should
all
be
in
position
at
eight
o'clock
petunia
you
will
be
in
the
lounge
said
Aunt
Petunia
promptly
waiting
to
welcome
them
graciously
to
our
home
good
good
and
Dudley
i'll
be
waiting
to
open
the
door
dudley
put
on
a
foul
simpering
smile
may
I
take
your
coats
mr.
and
Mrs
mason
they'll
love
him
cried
Aunt
Petunia
rapturously
excellent
Dudley
said
Uncle
Vernon
then
he
rounded
on
Harry
and
you
i'll
be
in
my
bedroom
making
no
noise
and
pretending
i'm
not
there
said
Harry
tonelessly
exactly
said
Uncle
Vernon
nastily
i
will
lead
them
into
the
lounge
introduce
you
Petunia
and
pour
them
drinks
at
eightfifteen
i'll
announce
dinner
said
Aunt
Petunia
and
Dudley
you'll
say
may
I
take
you
through
to
the
dining
room
Mrs
mason
said
dudley
offering
his
fat
arm
to
an
invisible
woman
my
perfect
little
gentleman
sniffed
Aunt
Petunia
and
you
said
Uncle
Vernon
viciously
to
Harry
i'll
be
in
my
room
making
no
noise
and
pretending
i'm
not
there
said
Harry
dully
precisely
now
we
should
aim
to
get
in
a
few
good
compliments
at
dinner
petunia
any
ideas
vernon
tells
me
you're
a
wonderful
golfer
mr.
Mason
do
tell
me
where
you
bought
your
dress
Mrs
mason
perfect
dudley
how
about
We
had
to
write
an
essay
about
our
hero
at
school
mr.
Mason
and
I
wrote
about
you
this
was
too
much
for
both
Aunt
Petunia
and
Harry
aunt
Petunia
burst
into
tears
and
hugged
her
son
while
Harry
ducked
under
the
table
so
they
wouldn't
see
him
laughing
and
you
boy
harry
fought
to
keep
his
face
straight
as
he
emerged
i'll
be
in
my
room
making
no
noise
and
pretending
i'm
not
there
he
said
too
right
you
will
said
Uncle
Vernon
forcefully
the
Ma
sons
don't
know
anything
about
you
and
it's
going
to
stay
that
way
when
dinner's
over
you
take
Mrs
mason
back
to
the
lounge
for
coffee
Petunia
and
i'll
bring
the
subject
around
to
drills
with
any
luck
i'll
have
the
deal
signed
and
sealed
before
the
news
at
ten
be
shopping
for
a
vacation
home
in
Majorca
this
time
to
morrow
harry
couldn't
feel
too
excited
about
this
he
didn't
think
the
dursleys
would
like
him
any
better
in
Majorca
than
they
did
on
privet
Drive
right
i'm
off
into
town
to
pick
up
the
dinner
jackets
for
dudley
and
me
and
you
he
snarled
at
Harry
you
stay
out
of
your
aunt's
way
while
she's
cleaning
harry
left
through
the
back
door
it
was
a
brilliant
sunny
day
he
crossed
the
lawn
slumped
down
on
the
garden
bench
and
sang
under
his
breath
happy
birthday
to
me
happy
birthday
to
me
no
cards
no
presents
and
he
would
be
spending
the
evening
pretending
not
to
exist
he
gazed
miserably
into
the
hedge
he
had
never
felt
so
lonely
more
than
anything
else
at
Hogwarts
more
even
than
playing
Quidditch
Harry
missed
his
best
friends
Ron
weasley
and
Hermione
Granger
they
however
didn't
seem
to
be
missing
him
at
all
neither
of
them
had
written
to
him
all
summer
even
though
Ron
had
said
he
was
going
to
ask
Harry
to
come
and
stay
countless
times
Harry
had
been
on
the
point
of
unlocking
hedwig's
cage
by
magic
and
sending
her
to
Ron
and
Hermione
with
a
letter
but
it
wasn't
worth
the
risk
underage
wizards
weren't
allowed
to
use
magic
outside
of
school
harry
hadn't
told
the
dursleys
this
he
knew
it
was
only
their
terror
that
he
might
turn
them
all
into
dung
beetles
that
stopped
them
from
locking
him
in
the
cupboard
under
the
stairs
with
his
wand
and
broomstick
for
the
first
couple
of
weeks
back
Harry
had
enjoyed
muttering
nonsense
words
under
his
breath
and
watching
Dudley
tearing
out
of
the
room
as
fast
as
his
fat
legs
would
carry
him
but
the
long
silence
from
Ron
and
hermione
had
made
Harry
feel
so
cut
off
from
the
magical
world
that
even
taunting
Dudley
had
lost
its
appeal
and
now
Ron
and
Hermione
had
forgotten
his
birthday
what
wouldn't
he
give
now
for
a
message
from
Hogwarts
from
any
witch
or
wizard
he'd
almost
be
glad
of
a
sight
of
his
archenemy
draco
Malfoy
just
to
be
sure
it
hadn't
all
been
a
dream
not
that
his
whole
year
at
Hogwarts
had
been
fun
at
the
very
end
of
last
term
Harry
had
come
face-to-face
with
none
other
than
Lord
voldemort
himself
voldemort
might
be
a
ruin
of
his
former
self
but
he
was
still
terrifying
still
cunning
still
determined
to
regain
power
harry
had
slipped
through
voldemort's
clutches
for
a
second
time
but
it
had
been
a
narrow
escape
and
even
now
weeks
later
Harry
kept
waking
in
the
night
drenched
in
cold
sweat
wondering
where
voldemort
was
now
remembering
his
livid
face
his
wide
mad
eyes
harry
suddenly
sat
bolt
upright
on
the
garden
bench
he
had
been
staring
absent-mindedly
into
the
hedge
and
the
hedge
was
staring
back
two
enormous
green
eyes
had
appeared
among
the
leaves
harry
jumped
to
his
feet
just
as
a
jeering
voice
floated
across
the
lawn
i
know
what
day
it
is
sang
Dudley
waddling
toward
him
the
huge
eyes
blinked
and
vanished
what
said
Harry
not
taking
his
eyes
off
the
spot
where
they
had
been
i
know
what
day
it
is
Dudley
repeated
coming
right
up
to
him
well
done
said
Harry
so
you've
finally
learned
the
days
of
the
week
today's
your
birthday
sneered
Dudley
how
come
you
haven't
got
any
cards
haven't
you
even
got
friends
at
that
freak
place
better
not
let
your
mum
hear
you
talking
about
my
school
said
harry
coolly
dudley
hitched
up
his
trousers
which
were
slipping
down
his
fat
bottom
why're
you
staring
at
the
hedge
he
said
suspiciously
i
m
trying
to
decide
what
would
be
the
best
spell
to
set
it
on
fire
said
Harry
dudley
stumbled
backward
at
once
a
look
of
panic
on
his
fat
face
you
c-can't
Dad
told
you
you're
not
to
do
m-magic
he
said
he'll
chuck
you
out
of
the
house
and
you
haven't
got
anywhere
else
to
go
you
haven't
got
any
friends
to
take
you
jiggery
pokery
said
Harry
in
a
fierce
voice
hocus
pocus
squiggly
wiggly
muuuuuum
howled
Dudley
tripping
over
his
feet
as
he
dashed
back
toward
the
house
muuuum
he's
doing
you
know
what
harry
paid
dearly
for
his
moment
of
fun
as
neither
Dudley
nor
the
hedge
was
in
any
way
hurt
Aunt
Petunia
knew
he
hadn't
really
done
magic
but
he
still
had
to
duck
as
she
aimed
a
heavy
blow
at
his
head
with
the
soapy
frying
pan
then
she
gave
him
work
to
do
with
the
promise
he
wouldn't
eat
again
until
he'd
finished
while
Dudley
lolled
around
watching
and
eating
ice
cream
Harry
cleaned
the
windows
washed
the
car
mowed
the
lawn
trimmed
the
flowerbeds
pruned
and
watered
the
roses
and
repainted
the
garden
bench
the
sun
blazed
overhead
burning
the
back
of
his
neck
harry
knew
he
shouldn't
have
risen
to
dudley's
bait
but
Dudley
had
said
the
very
thing
Harry
had
been
thinking
himself
maybe
he
didn't
have
any
friends
at
Hogwarts
wish
they
could
see
famous
Harry
Potter
now
he
thought
savagely
as
he
spread
manure
on
the
flower
beds
his
back
aching
sweat
running
down
his
face
it
was
half
past
seven
in
the
evening
when
at
last
exhausted
he
heard
Aunt
Petunia
calling
him
get
in
here
and
walk
on
the
newspaper
harry
moved
gladly
into
the
shade
of
the
gleaming
kitchen
on
top
of
the
fridge
stood
tonight's
pudding
a
huge
mound
of
whipped
cream
and
sugared
violets
a
loin
of
roast
pork
was
sizzling
in
the
oven
eat
quickly
the
Masons
will
be
here
soon
snapped
Aunt
Petunia
pointing
to
two
slices
of
bread
and
a
lump
of
cheese
on
the
kitchen
table
she
was
already
wearing
a
salmon-pink
cocktail
dress
harry
washed
his
hands
and
bolted
down
his
pitiful
supper
the
moment
he
had
finished
Aunt
Petunia
whisked
away
his
plate
upstairs
hurry
as
he
passed
the
door
to
the
living
room
Harry
caught
a
glimpse
of
Uncle
Vernon
and
Dudley
in
bow
ties
and
dinner
jack
ets
he
had
only
just
reached
the
upstairs
landing
when
the
door
bell
rang
and
Uncle
vernon's
furious
face
appeared
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
remember
boy
one
sound
harry
crossed
to
his
bedroom
on
tiptoe
slipped
inside
closed
the
door
and
turned
to
collapse
on
his
bed
the
trouble
was
there
was
already

sitting

it

o
dobby's
warning
arry
managed
not
to
shout
out
but
it
was
a
close
thing
the
little
creature
on
the
bed
had
large
bat-like
ears
and
bulging
green
eyes
the
size
of
tennis
balls
harry
knew
instantly
that
this
was
what
had
been
watching
him
out
of
the
garden
hedge
that
morning
as
they
stared
at
each
other
Harry
heard
dudley's
voice
from
the
hall
may
I
take
your
coats
mr.
and
Mrs
mason
the
creature
slipped
off
the
bed
and
bowed
so
low
that
the
end
of
its
long
thin
nose
touched
the
carpet
harry
noticed
that
it
was
wearing
what
looked
like
an
old
pillowcase
with
rips
for
arm
and
leg-holes
er
hello
said
Harry
nervously
harry
Potter
said
the
creature
in
a
high-pitched
voice
Harry
was
sure
would
carry
down
the
stairs
so
long
has
Dobby
wanted
to
meet
you
sir
such
an
honor
it
is
th-thank
you
said
Harry
edging
along
the
wall
and
sinking
into
his
desk
chair
next
to
Hedwig
who
was
asleep
in
her
large
cage
he
wanted
to
ask
What
are
you
but
thought
it
would
sound
too
rude
so
instead
he
said
Who
are
you
dobby
sir
just
Dobby
dobby
the
house-elf
said
the
creature
oh
really
said
Harry
er
I
don't
want
to
be
rude
or
anything
but
this
isn't
a
great
time
for
me
to
have
a
house-elf
in
my
bedroom
aunt
Petunias
high
false
laugh
sounded
from
the
living
room
the
elf
hung
his
head
not
that
i'm
not
pleased
to
meet
you
said
Harry
quickly
but
er
is
there
any
particular
reason
you're
here
oh
yes
sir
said
Dobby
earnestly
dobby
has
come
to
tell
you
sir
it
is
difficult
sir
dobby
wonders
where
to
begin
sit
down
said
Harry
politely
pointing
at
the
bed
to
his
horror
the
elf
burst
into
tears
very
noisy
tears
s-sit
down
he
wailed
never
never
ever
harry
thought
he
heard
the
voices
downstairs
falter
i'm
sorry
he
whispered
I
didn't
mean
to
offend
you
or
anything
offend
Dobby
choked
the
elf
dobby
has
never
been
asked
to
sit
down
by
a
wizard
like
an
equal
harry
trying
to
say
Shh
and
look
comforting
at
the
same
time
ushered
Dobby
back
onto
the
bed
where
he
sat
hiccoughing
looking
like
a
large
and
very
ugly
doll
at
last
he
managed
to
control
himself
and
sat
with
his
great
eyes
fixed
on
Harry
in
an
expression
of
watery
adoration
you
can't
have
met
many
decent
wizards
said
Harry
trying
to
cheer
him
up
dobby
shook
his
head
then
without
warning
he
leapt
up
and
started
banging
his
head
furiously
on
the
window
shouting
Bad
dobby
bad
Dobby
don't
what
are
you
doing
harry
hissed
springing
up
and
pulling
dobby
back
onto
the
bed
Hedwig
had
woken
up
with
a
particularly
loud
screech
and
was
beating
her
wings
wildly
against
the
bars
of
her
cage
dobby
had
to
punish
himself
sir
said
the
elf
who
had
gone
slightly
cross-eyed
dobby
almost
spoke
ill
of
his
family
sir
your
family
the
wizard
family
Dobby
serves
sir
dobby's
is
a
houseelf
bound
to
serve
one
house
and
one
family
forever
do
they
know
you're
here
asked
Harry
curiously
dobby
shuddered
oh
no
sir
no
dobby
will
have
to
punish
himself
most
grievously
for
coming
to
see
you
sir
dobby
will
have
to
shut
his
ears
in
the
oven
door
for
this
if
they
ever
knew
sir
but
won't
they
notice
if
you
shut
your
ears
in
the
oven
door
dobby
doubts
it
sir
dobby
is
always
having
to
punish
himself
for
something
sir
they
lets
Dobby
get
on
with
it
sir
sometimes
they
reminds
me
to
do
extra
punishments
but
why
don't
you
leave
escape
a
house-elf
must
be
set
free
sir
and
the
family
will
never
set
dobby
free
dobby
will
serve
the
family
until
he
dies
sir
harry
stared
and
I
thought
I
had
it
bad
staying
here
for
another
four
weeks
he
said
this
makes
the
Dursleys
sound
almost
human
can't
anyone
help
you
can't
I
almost
at
once
Harry
wished
he
hadn't
spoken
dobby
dissolved
again
into
wails
of
gratitude
please
Harry
whispered
frantically
please
be
quiet
if
the
Dursleys
hear
anything
if
they
know
you're
here
harry
Potter
asks
if
he
can
help
Dobby
dobby
has
heard
of
your
greatness
sir
but
of
your
goodness
Dobby
never
knew
harry
who
was
feeling
distinctly
hot
in
the
face
said
Whatever
you've
heard
about
my
greatness
is
a
load
of
rubbish
i'm
not
even
top
of
my
year
at
Hogwarts
that's
Hermione
she
but
he
stopped
quickly
because
thinking
about
Hermione
was
painful
i-Tarry
Potter
is
humble
and
modest
said
Dobby
reverently
his
orblike
eyes
aglow
harry
Potter
speaks
not
of
his
triumph
over
He-Who
must-Not-Be-Named
voldemort
said
Harry
dobby
clapped
his
hands
over
his
bat
ears
and
moaned
Ah
speak
not
the
name
sir
speak
not
the
name
sorry
said
Harry
quickly
i
know
lots
of
people
don't
like
it
my
friend
Ron
he
stopped
again
thinking
about
Ron
was
painful
too
dobby
leaned
toward
Harry
his
eyes
wide
as
headlights
dobby
heard
tell
he
said
hoarsely
that
Harry
Potter
met
the
Dark
lord
for
a
second
time
just
weeks
ago
that
Harry
Potter
escaped
yet
again
harry
nodded
and
dobby's
eyes
suddenly
shone
with
tears
Ah
sir
he
gasped
dabbing
his
face
with
a
corner
of
the
grubby
pillowcase
he
was
wearing
harry
Potter
is
valiant
and
bold
he
has
braved
so
many
dangers
already
but
Dobby
has
come
to
protect
harry
Potter
to
warn
him
even
if
he
does
have
to
shut
his
ears
in
the
oven
door
later
harry
Potter
must
notgo
back
to
Hogwarts
there
was
a
silence
broken
only
by
the
chink
of
knives
and
forks
from
downstairs
and
the
distant
rumble
of
Uncle
vernon's
voice
w-what
harry
stammered
but
i've
got
to
go
back
term
starts
on
September
first
it's
all
that's
keeping
me
going
you
don't
know
what
it's
like
here
i
don't
belong
here
i
belong
in
your
world
at
hogwarts
no
no
no
squeaked
Dobby
shaking
his
head
so
hard
his
ears
flapped
harry
Potter
must
stay
where
he
is
safe
he
is
too
great
too
good
to
lose
if
Harry
Potter
goes
back
to
Hogwarts
he
will
be
in
mortal
danger
why
said
Harry
in
surprise
there
is
a
plot
Harry
Potter
a
plot
to
make
most
terrible
things
happen
at
Hogwarts
School
of
Witchcraft
and
Wizardry
this
year
whispered
Dobby
suddenly
trembling
all
over
dobby
has
known
it
for
months
sir
harry
Potter
must
not
put
himself
in
peril
he
is
too
important
sir
what
terrible
things
said
Harry
at
once
who's
plotting
them
dobby
made
a
funny
choking
noise
and
then
banged
his
head
frantically
against
the
wall
all
right
cried
Harry
grabbing
the
elf's
arm
to
stop
him
you
can't
tell
me
i
understand
but
why
are
you
warning
me
a
sudden
unpleasant
thought
struck
him
hang
on
this
hasn't
got
anything
to
do
with
Vol
sorry
with
You-Know-Who
has
it
you
could
just
shake
or
nod
he
added
hastily
as
dobby's
head
tilted
worryingly
close
to
the
wall
again
slowly
Dobby
shook
his
head
not
not
He
Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
sir
but
dobby's
eyes
were
wide
and
he
seemed
to
be
trying
to
give
harry
a
hint
harry
however
was
completely
lost
he
hasn't
got
a
brother
has
he
dobby
shook
his
head
his
eyes
wider
than
ever
well
then
I
can't
think
who
else
would
have
a
chance
of
making
horrible
things
happen
at
Hogwarts
said
Harry
i
mean
there's
dumbledore
for
one
thing
you
know
who
Dumbledore
is
don't
you
dobby
bowed
his
head
albus
Dumbledore
is
the
greatest
headmaster
Hogwarts
has
ever
had
dobby
knows
it
sir
dobby
has
heard
dumbledore's
powers
rival
those
of
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
at
the
height
of
his
strength
but
sir
dobby's
voice
dropped
to
an
urgent
whisper
there
are
powers
Dumbledore
doesn't
powers
no
decent
wizard
and
before
Harry
could
stop
him
Dobby
bounded
off
the
bed
seized
harry's
desk
lamp
and
started
beating
himself
around
the
head
with
earsplitting
yelps
a
sudden
silence
fell
downstairs
two
seconds
later
Harry
heart
thudding
madly
heard
Uncle
Vernon
coming
into
the
hall
calling
dudley
must
have
left
his
television
on
again
the
little
tyke
quick
in
the
closet
hissed
Harry
stuffing
Dobby
in
shutting
the
door
and
flinging
himself
onto
the
bed
just
as
the
door
handle
turned
what
the
devil
are
you
doing
said
Uncle
Vernon
through
gritted
teeth
his
face
horribly
close
to
harry's
you've
just
ruined
the
punch
line
of
my
Japanese
golfer
joke
one
more
sound
and
you'll
wish
you'd
never
been
born
boy
he
stomped
flat-footed
from
the
room
shaking
Harry
let
Dobby
out
of
the
closet
see
what
it's
like
here
he
said
see
why
i've
got
to
go
back
to
hogwarts
it's
the
only
place
i've
got
well
I
think
i've
got
friends
friends
who
don't
even
write
to
Harry
Potter
said
Dobby
slyly
i
expect
they've
just
been
wait
a
minute
said
Harry
frowning
how
do
you
know
my
friends
haven't
been
writing
to
me
dobby
shuffled
his
feet
harry
Potter
mustn't
be
angry
with
Dobby
dobby
did
it
for
the
best
have
you
been
stopping
my
letters
dobby
has
them
here
sir
said
the
elf
stepping
nimbly
out
of
harry's
reach
he
pulled
a
thick
wad
of
envelopes
from
the
inside
of
the
pillowcase
he
was
wearing
harry
could
make
out
hermione's
neat
writing
ron's
untidy
scrawl
and
even
a
scribble
that
looked
as
though
it
was
from
the
Hogwarts
gamekeeper
Hagrid
dobby
blinked
anxiously
up
at
Harry
harry
Potter
mustn't
be
angry
dobby
hoped
if
Harry
Potter
thought
his
friends
had
forgotten
him
harry
Potter
might
not
want
to
go
back
to
school
sir
harry
wasn't
listening
he
made
a
grab
for
the
letters
but
Dobby
jumped
out
of
reach
harry
Potter
will
have
them
sir
if
he
gives
Dobby
his
word
that
he
will
not
return
to
Hogwarts
ah
sir
this
is
a
danger
you
must
not
face
say
you
won't
go
back
sir
no
said
Harry
angrily
give
me
my
friends
letters
then
Harry
Potter
leaves
Dobby
no
choice
said
the
elf
sadly
before
Harry
could
move
Dobby
had
darted
to
the
bedroom
door
pulled
it
open
and
sprinted
down
the
stairs
mouth
dry
stomach
lurching
Harry
sprang
after
him
trying
not
to
make
a
sound
he
jumped
the
last
six
steps
landing
catlike
on
the
hall
carpet
looking
around
for
Dobby
from
the
dining
room
he
heard
Uncle
Vernon
saying
tell
Petunia
that
very
funny
story
about
those
American
plumbers
mr.
Mason
she's
been
dying
to
hear
harry
ran
up
the
hall
into
the
kitchen
and
felt
his
stomach
disappear
aunt
petunia's
masterpiece
of
a
pudding
the
mountain
of
cream
and
sugared
violets
was
floating
up
near
the
ceiling
on
top
of
a
cupboard
in
the
corner
crouched
Dobby
no
croaked
Harry
please
they'll
kill
me
harry
Potter
must
say
he's
not
going
back
to
school
dobby
please
say
it
sir
i
can't
dobby
gave
him
a
tragic
look
then
Dobby
must
do
it
sir
for
Harry
potter's
own
good
the
pudding
fell
to
the
floor
with
a
heart-stopping
crash
cream
splattered
the
windows
and
walls
as
the
dish
shattered
with
a
crack
like
a
whip
Dobby
vanished
there
were
screams
from
the
dining
room
and
Uncle
Vernon
burst
into
the
kitchen
to
find
Harry
rigid
with
shock
covered
from
head
to
foot
in
Aunt
Petunias
pudding
at
first
it
looked
as
though
Uncle
Vernon
would
manage
to
gloss
the
whole
thing
over
Just
our
nephew
very
disturbed
meeting
strangers
upsets
him
so
we
kept
him
upstairs
He
shooed
the
shocked
Masons
back
into
the
dining
room
promised
Harry
he
would
flay
him
to
within
an
inch
of
his
life
when
the
Masons
had
left
and
handed
him
a
mop
aunt
Petunia
dug
some
ice
cream
out
of
the
freezer
and
Harry
still
shaking
started
scrubbing
the
kitchen
clean
uncle
Vernon
might
still
have
been
able
to
make
his
deal
if
it
hadn't
been
for
the
owl
aunt
Petunia
was
just
passing
around
a
box
of
after-dinner
mints
when
a
huge
barn
owl
swooped
through
the
dining
room
window
dropped
a
letter
on
Mrs
mason's
head
and
swooped
out
again
mrs
mason
screamed
like
a
banshee
and
ran
from
the
house
shouting
about
lunatics
mr.
Mason
stayed
just
long
enough
to
tell
the
Dursleys
that
his
wife
was
mortally
afraid
of
birds
of
all
shapes
and
sizes
and
to
ask
whether
this
was
their
idea
of
a
joke
harry
stood
in
the
kitchen
clutching
the
mop
for
support
as
Uncle
vernon
advanced
on
him
a
demonic
glint
in
his
tiny
eyes
read
it
he
hissed
evilly
brandishing
the
letter
the
owl
had
delivered
go
on
read
it
harry
took
it
it
did
not
contain
birthday

harry
looked
up
from
the
letter
and
gulped
you
didn't
tell
us
you
weren't
allowed
to
use
magic
outside
school
said
Uncle
Vernon
a
mad
gleam
dancing
in
his
eyes
for
got
to
mention
it
slipped
your
mind
I
daresay
he
was
bearing
down
on
Harry
like
a
great
bulldog
all
his
teeth
bared
well
i've
got
news
for
you
boy
i'm
locking
you
up
you're
never
going
back
to
that
school
never
and
if
you
try
and
magic
yourself
out
they'll
expel
you
and
laughing
like
a
maniac
he
dragged
Harry
back
upstairs
uncle
Vernon
was
as
bad
as
his
word
the
following
morning
he
paid
a
man
to
fit
bars
on
harry's
window
he
himself
fitted
a
catflap
in
the
bedroom
door
so
that
small
amounts
of
food
could
be
pushed
inside
three
times
a
day
they
let
Harry
out
to
use
the
bathroom
morning
and
evening
otherwise
he
was
locked
in
his
room
around
the
clock
three
days
later
the
Dursleys
were
showing
no
sign
of
relenting
and
harry
couldn't
see
any
way
out
of
his
situation
he
lay
on
his
bed
watching
the
sun
sinking
behind
the
bars
on
the
window
and
wondered
miserably
what
was
going
to
happen
to
him
what
was
the
good
of
magicking
himself
out
of
his
room
if
Hogwarts
would
expel
him
for
doing
it
yet
life
at
Privet
Drive
had
reached
an
all-time
low
now
that
the
Dursleys
knew
they
weren't
going
to
wake
up
as
fruit
bats
he
had
lost
his
only
weapon
dobby
might
have
saved
harry
from
horrible
happenings
at
Hogwarts
but
the
way
things
were
going
he'd
probably
starve
to
death
anyway
the
cat-flap
rattled
and
Aunt
Petunias
hand
appeared
pushing
a
bowl
of
canned
soup
into
the
room
harry
whose
insides
were
aching
with
hunger
jumped
off
his
bed
and
seized
it
the
soup
was
stone-cold
but
he
drank
half
of
it
in
one
gulp
then
he
crossed
the
room
to
hedwig's
cage
and
tipped
the
soggy
vegetables
at
the
bottom
of
the
bowl
into
her
empty
food
tray
she
ruffled
her
feathers
and
gave
him
a
look
of
deep
disgust
it's
no
good
turning
your
beak
up
at
it
that's
all
we've
got
said
harry
grimly
he
put
the
empty
bowl
back
on
the
floor
next
to
the
cat-flap
and
lay
back
down
on
the
bed
somehow
even
hungrier
than
he
had
been
before
the
soup
supposing
he
was
still
alive
in
another
four
weeks
what
would
happen
if
he
didn't
turn
up
at
Hogwarts
would
someone
be
sent
to
see
why
he
hadn't
come
back
would
they
be
able
to
make
the
Dursleys
let
him
go
the
room
was
growing
dark
exhausted
stomach
rumbling
mind
spinning
over
the
same
unanswerable
questions
Harry
fell
into
an
uneasy
sleep
he
dreamed
that
he
was
on
show
in
a
zoo
with
a
card
reading
underage
wizard
attached
to
his
cage
people
goggled
through
the
bars
at
him
as
he
lay
starving
and
weak
on
a
bed
of
straw
he
saw
dobby's
face
in
the
crowd
and
shouted
out
asking
for
help
but
Dobby
called
Harry
Potter
is
safe
there
sir
and
vanished
then
the
dursleys
appeared
and
Dudley
rattled
the
bars
of
the
cage
laughing
at
him
stop
it
Harry
muttered
as
the
rattling
pounded
in
his
sore
head
leave
me
alone
cut
it
out
i'm
trying
to
sleep
he
opened
his
eyes
moonlight
was
shining
through
the
bars
on
the
window
and
someone
was
goggling
through
the
bars
at
him
a
frecklefaced
red-haired
long-nosed
someone
ron
Weasley
was
outside
harry's
window
h-h
A
P
T
E
rr
T
H
rr
E
E
the
burrow
ron
l
breathed
Harry
creeping
to
the
window
and
pushing
it
up
so
they
could
talk
through
the
bars
ron
how
did
you
What
the
harry's
mouth
fell
open
as
the
full
impact
of
what
he
was
seeing
hit
him
ron
was
leaning
out
of
the
back
window
of
an
old
turquoise
car
which
was
parked
in
midair
Grinning
at
Harry
from
the
front
seats
were
Fred
and
George
ron's
elder
twin
brothers
all
right
Harry
asked
George
what's
been
going
on
said
Ron
why
haven't
you
been
answering
my
letters
i've
asked
you
to
stay
about
twelve
times
and
then
Dad
came
home
and
said
you'd
got
an
official
warning
for
using
magic
in
front
of
Muggles
it
wasn't
me
and
how
did
he
know
he
works
for
the
Ministry
said
Ron
you
know
we're
not
supposed
to
do
spells
outside
school
you
should
talk
said
Harry
staring
at
the
floating
car
oh
this
doesn't
count
said
Ron
we're
only
borrowing
this
it's
dad's
we
didn't
enchant
it
but
doing
magic
in
front
of
those
Muggles
you
live
with
i
told
you
I
didn't
but
it'll
take
too
long
to
explain
now
look
can
you
tell
them
at
Hogwarts
that
the
Dursleys
have
locked
me
up
and
won't
let
me
come
back
and
obviously
I
can't
magic
myself
out
because
the
ministry'Il
think
that's
the
second
spell
i've
done
in
three
days
so
stop
gibbering
said
Ron
we've
come
to
take
you
home
with
us
but
you
can't
magic
me
out
either
we
don't
need
to
said
Ron
jerking
his
head
toward
the
front
seat
and
grinning
you
forget
who
i've
got
with
me
tie
that
around
the
bars
said
Fred
throwing
the
end
of
a
rope
to
harry
if
the
Dursleys
wake
up
i'm
dead
said
Harry
as
he
tied
the
rope
tightly
around
a
bar
and
Fred
revved
up
the
car
don't
worry
said
Fred
and
stand
back
harry
moved
back
into
the
shadows
next
to
Hedwig
who
seemed
to
have
realized
how
important
this
was
and
kept
still
and
silent
the
car
revved
louder
and
louder
and
suddenly
with
a
crunching
noise
the
bars
were
pulled
clean
out
of
the
window
as
Fred
drove
straight
up
in
the
air
harry
ran
back
to
the
window
to
see
the
bars
dangling
a
few
feet
above
the
ground
panting
Ron
hoisted
them
up
into
the
car
harry
listened
anxiously
but
there
was
no
sound
from
the
Dursleys
bedroom
when
the
bars
were
safely
in
the
back
seat
with
Ron
Fred
reversed
as
close
as
possible
to
harry's
window
get
in
Ron
said
but
all
my
Hogwarts
stuff
my
wand
my
broomstick
where
is
it
locked
in
the
cupboard
under
the
stairs
and
I
can't
get
out
of
this
room
no
problem
said
George
from
the
front
passenger
seat
out
of
the
way
Harry
fred
and
George
climbed
catlike
through
the
window
into
harry's
room
you
had
to
hand
it
to
them
thought
Harry
as
George
took
an
ordinary
hairpin
from
his
pocket
and
started
to
pick
the
lock
a
lot
of
wizards
think
it's
a
waste
of
time
knowing
this
sort
of
muggle
trick
said
Fred
but
we
feel
they're
skills
worth
learning
even
if
they
are
a
bit
slow
there
was
a
small
click
and
the
door
swung
open
so
we'll
get
your
trunk
you
grab
anything
you
need
from
your
room
and
hand
it
out
to
Ron
whispered
George
watch
out
for
the
bottom
stair
it
creaks
Harry
whispered
back
as
the
twins
disappeared
onto
the
dark
landing
harry
dashed
around
his
room
collecting
his
things
and
passing
them
out
of
the
window
to
Ron
then
he
went
to
help
Fred
and
George
heave
his
trunk
up
the
stairs
harry
heard
Uncle
Vernon
cough
at
last
panting
they
reached
the
landing
then
carried
the
trunk
through
harry's
room
to
the
open
window
fred
climbed
back
into
the
car
to
pull
with
Ron
and
Harry
and
George
pushed
from
the
bedroom
side
inch
by
inch
the
trunk
slid
through
the
window
uncle
Vernon
coughed
again
a
bit
more
panted
Fred
who
was
pulling
from
inside
the
car
one
good
push
harry
and
George
threw
their
shoulders
against
the
trunk
and
it
slid
out
of
the
window
into
the
back
seat
of
the
car
okay
let's
go
George
whispered
but
as
Harry
climbed
onto
the
windowsill
there
came
a
sudden
loud
screech
from
behind
him
followed
immediately
by
the
thunder
of
uncle
vernon's
voice
that
ruddy
owl
i've
forgotten
Hedwig
harry
tore
back
across
the
room
as
the
landing
light
clicked
on
he
snatched
up
hedwig's
cage
dashed
to
the
window
and
passed
it
out
to
Ron
he
was
scrambling
back
onto
the
chest
of
drawers
when
uncle
Vernon
hammered
on
the
unlocked
door
and
it
crashed
open
for
a
split
second
Uncle
Vernon
stood
framed
in
the
doorway
then
he
let
out
a
bellow
like
an
angry
bull
and
dived
at
Harry
grabbing
him
by
the
ankle
ron
Fred
and
George
seized
harry's
arms
and
pulled
as
hard
as
they
could
petunia
roared
Uncle
Vernon
he's
getting
away
he's
getting
away
but
the
Weasleys
gave
a
gigantic
tug
and
harry's
leg
slid
out
of
uncle
vernon's
grasp
Harry
was
in
the
car
he'd
slammed
the
door
shut
put
your
foot
down
Fred
yelled
Ron
and
the
car
shot
suddenly
toward
the
moon
harry
couldn't
believe
it
he
was
free
he
rolled
down
the
window
the
night
air
whipping
his
hair
and
looked
back
at
the
shrinking
rooftops
of
Privet
Drive
uncle
Vernon
Aunt
Petunia
and
dudley
were
all
hanging
dumbstruck
out
of
harry's
window
see
you
next
summer
harry
yelled
the
Weasleys
roared
with
laughter
and
Harry
settled
back
in
his
seat
grinning
from
ear
to
ear
let
Hedwig
out
he
told
Ron
she
can
fly
behind
us
she
hasn't
had
a
chance
to
stretch
her
wings
for
ages
george
handed
the
hairpin
to
Ron
and
a
moment
later
Hedwig
soared
joyfully
out
of
the
window
to
glide
alongside
them
like
a
ghost
so
what's
the
story
Harry
said
Ron
impatiently
what's
been
happening
harry
told
them
all
about
Dobby
the
warning
he'd
given
Harry
and
the
fiasco
of
the
violet
pudding
there
was
a
long
shocked
silence
when
he
had
finished
very
fishy
said
Fred
finally
definitely
dodgy
agreed
George
so
he
wouldn't
even
tell
you
who's
supposed
to
be
plotting
all
this
stuff
i
don't
think
he
could
said
Harry
i
told
you
every
time
he
got
close
to
letting
something
slip
he
started
banging
his
head
against
the
wall
he
saw
Fred
and
George
look
at
each
other
what
you
think
he
was
lying
to
me
said
Harry
well
said
Fred
put
it
this
way
house-elves
have
got
powerful
magic
of
their
own
but
they
can't
usually
use
it
without
their
master's
permission
i
reckon
old
Dobby
was
sent
to
stop
you
com
ing
back
to
Hogwarts
someone's
idea
of
a
joke
can
you
think
of
anyone
at
school
with
a
grudge
against
you
yes
said
Harry
and
Ron
together
instantly
draco
Malfoy
Harry
explained
he
hates
me
draco
Malfoy
said
George
turning
around
not
Lucius
malfoy's
son
must
be
it's
not
a
very
common
name
is
it
said
Harry
i've
heard
Dad
talking
about
him
said
George
he
was
a
big
supporter
of
You-Know-Who
and
when
You-Know-Who
disappeared
said
Fred
craning
around
to
look
at
Harry
Lucius
Malfoy
came
back
saying
he'd
never
meant
any
of
it
load
of
dung
Dad
reckons
he
was
right
in
You
know-who's
inner
circle
harry
had
heard
these
rumors
about
malfoy's
family
before
and
they
didn't
surprise
him
at
all
malfoy
made
Dudley
Dursley
look
like
a
kind
thoughtful
and
sensitive
boy
i
don't
know
whether
the
Malfoys
own
a
house-elf
said
harry
well
whoever
owns
him
will
be
an
old
wizarding
family
and
they'll
be
rich
said
Fred
yeah
mum's
always
wishing
we
had
a
house-elf
to
do
the
ironing
said
George
but
all
we've
got
is
a
lousy
old
ghoul
in
the
attic
and
gnomes
all
over
the
garden
house-elves
come
with
big
old
manors
and
castles
and
places
like
that
you
wouldn't
catch
one
in
our
house
harry
was
silent
judging
by
the
fact
that
Draco
Malfoy
usually
had
the
best
of
everything
his
family
was
rolling
in
wizard
gold
he
could
just
see
Malfoy
strutting
around
a
large
manor
house
sending
the
family
servant
to
stop
Harry
from
going
back
to
Hogwarts
also
sounded
exactly
like
the
sort
of
thing
Malfoy
would
do
had
Harry
been
stupid
to
take
Dobby
seriously
i'm
glad
we
came
to
get
you
anyway
said
Ron
i
was
getting
really
worried
when
you
didn't
answer
any
of
my
letters
i
thought
it
was
errol's
fault
at
first
who's
Errol
our
owl
he's
ancient
it
wouldn't
be
the
first
time
he'd
collapsed
on
a
delivery
so
then
I
tried
to
borrow
Hermes
who
the
owl
Mum
and
Dad
bought
Percy
when
he
was
made
prefect
said
Fred
from
the
front
but
Percy
wouldn't
lend
him
to
me
said
Ron
said
he
needed
him
percy's
been
acting
very
oddly
this
summer
said
George
frowning
and
he
has
been
sending
a
lot
of
letters
and
spending
a
load
of
time
shut
up
in
his
room
i
mean
there's
only
so
many
times
you
can
polish
a
prefect
badge
you're
driving
too
far
west
fred
he
added
pointing
at
a
compass
on
the
dashboard
fred
twiddled
the
steering
wheel
so
does
your
dad
know
you've
got
the
car
said
Harry
guessing
the
answer
er
no
said
Ron
he
had
to
work
tonight
hopefully
we'll
be
able
to
get
it
back
in
the
garage
without
Mum
noticing
we
flew
it
what
does
your
dad
do
at
the
Ministry
of
Magic
anyway
he
works
in
the
most
boring
department
said
Ron
the
Misuse
of
Muggle
Artifacts
Office
the
what
it's
all
to
do
with
bewitching
things
that
are
muggle-made
you
know
in
case
they
end
up
back
in
a
Muggle
shop
or
house
like
last
year
some
old
witch
died
and
her
tea
set
was
sold
to
an
antiques
shop
this
Muggle
woman
bought
it
took
it
home
and
tried
to
serve
her
friends
tea
in
it
it
was
a
nightmare
Dad
was
working
overtime
for
weeks
what
happened
the
teapot
went
berserk
and
squirted
boiling
tea
all
over
the
place
and
one
man
ended
up
in
the
hospital
with
the
sugar
tongs
clamped
to
his
nose
dad
was
going
frantic
it's
only
him
and
an
old
warlock
called
Perkins
in
the
office
and
they
had
to
do
Memory
Charms
and
all
sorts
of
stuff
to
cover
it
up
but
your
dad
this
car
fred
laughed
yeah
dad's
crazy
about
everything
to
do
with
muggles
our
shed's
full
of
Muggle
stuff
he
takes
it
apart
puts
spells
on
it
and
puts
it
back
together
again
if
he
raided
our
house
he'd
have
to
put
himself
under
arrest
it
drives
Mum
mad
that's
the
main
road
said
George
peering
down
through
the
windshield
we'll
be
there
in
ten
minutes
just
as
well
it's
getting
light
a
faint
pinkish
glow
was
visible
along
the
horizon
to
the
east
fred
brought
the
car
lower
and
Harry
saw
a
dark
patchwork
of
fields
and
clumps
of
trees
we're
a
little
way
outside
the
village
said
George
ottery
St
catchpole
lower
and
lower
went
the
flying
car
the
edge
of
a
brilliant
red
sun
was
now
gleaming
through
the
trees
touchdown
said
Fred
as
with
a
slight
bump
they
hit
the
ground
they
had
landed
next
to
a
tumbledown
garage
in
a
small
yard
and
harry
looked
out
for
the
first
time
at
ron's
house
it
looked
as
though
it
had
once
been
a
large
stone
pigpen
but
extra
rooms
had
been
added
here
and
there
until
it
was
several
stories
high
and
so
crooked
it
looked
as
though
it
were
held
up
by
magic
which
harry
reminded
himself
it
probably
was
four
or
five
chimneys
were
perched
on
top
of
the
red
roof
a
lopsided
sign
stuck
in
the
ground
near
the
entrance
read
the
BuRRow
around
the
front
door
lay
a
jumble
of
rubber
boots
and
a
very
rusty
cauldron
several
fat
brown
chickens
were
pecking
their
way
around
the
yard
it's
not
much
said
Ron
it's
wonderful
said
Harry
happily
thinking
of
Privet
Drive
they
got
out
of
the
car
now
we'll
go
upstairs
really
quietly
said
Fred
and
wait
for
Mum
to
call
us
for
breakfast
Then
Ron
you
come
bounding
downstairs
going
Mum
look
who
turned
up
in
the
night
and
she'll
be
all
pleased
to
see
harry
and
no
one
need
ever
know
we
flew
the
car
right
said
Ron
come
on
Harry
I
sleep
at
the
at
the
top
ron
had
gone
a
nasty
greenish
color
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
house
the
other
three
wheeled
around
mrs
weasley
was
marching
across
the
yard
scattering
chickens
and
for
a
short
plump
kind-faced
woman
it
was
remarkable
how
much
she
looked
like
a
saber-toothed
tiger
ah
said
Fred
oh
dear
said
George
mrs
weasley
came
to
a
halt
in
front
of
them
her
hands
on
her
hips
staring
from
one
guilty
face
to
the
next
she
was
wearing
a
flowered
apron
with
a
wand
sticking
out
of
the
pocket
so
she
said
morning
Mum
said
George
in
what
he
clearly
thought
was
a
jaunty
winning
voice
have
you
any
idea
how
worried
i've
been
said
Mrs
weasley
in
a
deadly
whisper
sorry
Mum
but
see
we
had
to
all
three
of
Mrs
weasley's
sons
were
taller
than
she
was
but
they
cowered
as
her
rage
broke
over
them
beds
empty
no
note
cargone
could
have
crashed
out
of
my
mind
with
worry
did
you
care
never
as
long
as
i've
lived
you
wait
until
your
father
gets
home
we
never
had
trouble
like
this
from
Bill
or
Charlie
or

perfect
Percy
muttered
Fred
you
could
do
with
taking
A
leaf
out
of
percy's
book
yelled
Mrs
weasley
prodding
a
finger
in
fred's
chest
you
could
have
died
you
could
have
been
seen
you
could
have
lost
your
father
his
job
it
seemed
to
go
on
for
hours
mrs
weasley
had
shouted
herself
hoarse
before
she
turned
on
Harry
who
backed
away
i'm
very
pleased
to
see
you
Harry
dear
she
said
come
in
and
have
some
breakfast
she
turned
and
walked
back
into
the
house
and
Harry
after
a
nervous
glance
at
Ron
who
nodded
encouragingly
followed
her
the
kitchen
was
small
and
rather
cramped
there
was
a
scrubbed
wooden
table
and
chairs
in
the
middle
and
Harry
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
his
seat
looking
around
he
had
never
been
in
a
wizard
house
before
the
clock
on
the
wall
opposite
him
had
only
one
hand
and
no
numbers
at
all
written
around
the
edge
were
things
like
Time
to
make
tea
Time
to
feed
the
chickens
and
you're
late
books
were
stacked
three
deep
on
the
mantelpiece
books
with
titles
like
Charm
Your
Own
Cheese
enchantment
in
Baking
and
One
Minute
Feasts
it's
Magic
and
unless
harry's
ears
were
deceiving
him
the
old
radio
next
to
the
sink
had
just
announced
that
coming
up
was
Witching
Hour
with
the
popular
singing
sorceress
Celestina
Warbeck
mrs
weasley
was
clattering
around
cooking
breakfast
a
little
haphazardly
throwing
dirty
looks
at
her
sons
as
she
threw
sausages
into
the
frying
pan
every
now
and
then
she
muttered
things
like
don't
know
what
you
were
thinking
of
and
never
would
have
believed
it
i
don't
blame
you
dear
she
assured
Harry
tipping
eight
or
nine
sausages
onto
his
plate
arthur
and
I
have
been
worried
about
you
too
just
last
night
we
were
saying
we'd
come
and
get
you
ourselves
if
you
hadn't
written
back
to
Ron
by
Friday
but
really
she
was
now
adding
three
fried
eggs
to
his
plate
flying
an
illegal
car
halfway
across
the
country
anyone
could
have
seen
you
she
flicked
her
wand
casually
at
the
dishes
in
the
sink
which
began
to
clean
themselves
clinking
gently
in
the
background
it
was
cloudy
Mum
said
Fred
you
keep
your
mouth
closed
while
you're
eating
mrs
weasley
snapped
they
were
starving
him
Mum
said
George
and
you
said
Mrs
weasley
but
it
was
with
a
slightly
softened
expression
that
she
started
cutting
Harry
bread
and
buttering
it
for
him
at
that
moment
there
was
a
diversion
in
the
form
of
a
small
redheaded
figure
in
a
long
nightdress
who
appeared
in
the
kitchen
gave
a
small
squeal
and
ran
out
again
ginny
said
Ron
in
an
undertone
to
Harry
my
sister
she's
been
talking
about
you
all
summer
yeah
she'll
be
wanting
your
autograph
Harry
Fred
said
with
a
grin
but
he
caught
his
mother's
eye
and
bent
his
face
over
his
plate
without
another
word
nothing
more
was
said
until
all
four
plates
were
clean
which
took
a
surprisingly
short
time
blimey
i'm
tired
yawned
Fred
setting
down
his
knife
and
fork
at
last
i
think
i'll
go
to
bed
and
you
will
not
snapped
Mrs
weasley
it's
your
own
fault
you've
been
up
all
night
you're
going
to
de-gnome
the
garden
for
me
they're
getting
completely
out
of
hand
again
oh
Mum
and
you
two
she
said
glaring
at
Ron
and
Fred
you
can
go
up
to
bed
dear
she
added
to
Harry
you
didn't
ask
them
to
fly
that
wretched
car
but
Harry
who
felt
wide
awake
said
quickly
i'll
help
Ron
i've
never
seen
a
de-gnoming
that's
very
sweet
of
you
dear
but
it's
dull
work
said
Mrs
weasley
now
let's
see
what
lockhart's
got
to
say
on
the
subject
and
she
pulled
a
heavy
book
from
the
stack
on
the
mantelpiece
george
groaned
mum
we
know
how
to
de-gnome
a
garden
harry
looked
at
the
cover
of
Mrs
weasley's
book
written
across
it
in
fancy
gold
letters
were
the
words
Gilderoy
lockhart's
Guide
to
household
Pests
there
was
a
big
photograph
on
the
front
of
a
very
good
iOIking
wizard
with
wavy
blond
hair
and
bright
blue
eyes
as
always
in
the
wizarding
world
the
photograph
was
moving
the
wizard
who
harry
supposed
was
Gilderoy
Lockhart
kept
winking
cheekily
up
at
them
all
mrs
weasley
beamed
down
at
him
oh
he
is
marvelous
she
said
he
knows
his
household
pests
all
right
it's
a
wonderful
book
mum
fancies
him
said
Fred
in
a
very
audible
whisper
don't
be
so
ridiculous
Fred
said
Mrs
weasley
her
cheeks
rather
pink
all
right
if
you
think
you
know
better
than
Lockhart
you
can
go
and
get
on
with
it
and
woe
betide
you
if
there's
a
single
gnome
in
that
garden
when
I
come
out
to
inspect
it
yawning
and
grumbling
the
Weasleys
slouched
outside
with
Harry
behind
them
the
garden
was
large
and
in
harry's
eyes
exactly
what
a
garden
should
be
the
Dursleys
wouldn't
have
liked
it
there
were
plenty
of
weeds
and
the
grass
needed
cutting
but
there
were
gnarled
trees
all
around
the
walls
plants
Harry
had
never
seen
spilling
from
every
flower
bed
and
a
big
green
pond
full
of
frogs
muggles
have
garden
gnomes
too
you
know
Harry
told
Ron
they
crossed
the
lawn
yeah
i've
seen
those
things
they
think
are
gnomes
said
Ron
bent
double
with
his
head
in
a
peony
bush
like
fat
little
Santa
Clauses
with
fishing
rods
there
was
a
violent
scuffling
noise
the
peony
bush
shuddered
and
ron
straightened
up
this
is
a
gnome
he
said
grimly
gerroff
me
gerroff
me
squealed
the
gnome
it
was
certainly
nothing
like
Santa
Claus
it
was
small
and
leathery
looking
with
a
large
knobby
bald
head
exactly
like
a
potato
ron
held
it
at
arm's
length
as
it
kicked
out
at
him
with
its
horny
little
feet
he
grasped
it
around
the
ankles
and
turned
it
upside
down
this
is
what
you
have
to
do
he
said
he
raised
the
gnome
above
his
head
Gerroff
me
and
started
to
swing
it
in
great
circles
like
a
lasso
seeing
the
shocked
look
on
harry's
face
Ron
added
It
doesn't
hurt
them
you've
just
got
to
make
them
really
dizzy
so
they
can't
find
their
way
back
to
the
gnomeholes
he
let
go
of
the
gnome's
ankles
It
flew
twenty
feet
into
the
air
and
landed
with
a
thud
in
the
field
over
the
hedge
pitiful
said
Fred
i
bet
I
can
get
mine
beyond
that
stump
harry
learned
quickly
not
to
feel
too
sorry
for
the
gnomes
he
decided
just
to
drop
the
first
one
he
caught
over
the
hedge
but
the
gnome
sensing
weakness
sank
its
razor-sharp
teeth
into
harry's
finger
and
he
had
a
hard
job
shaking
it
off
until
wow
Harry
that
must've
been
fifty
feet
the
air
was
soon
thick
with
flying
gnomes
see
they're
not
too
bright
said
George
seizing
five
or
six
gnomes
at
once
the
moment
they
know
the
de-gnoming's
going
on
they
storm
up
to
have
a
look
you'd
think
they'd
have
learned
by
now
just
to
stay
put
soon
the
crowd
of
gnomes
in
the
field
started
walking
away
in
a
straggling
line
their
little
shoulders
hunched
they'll
be
back
said
Ron
as
they
watched
the
gnomes
disappear
into
the
hedge
on
the
other
side
of
the
field
they
love
it
here
dad's
too
soft
with
them
he
thinks
they're
funny
just
then
the
front
door
slammed
he's
back
said
George
dad's
home
they
hurried
through
the
garden
and
back
into
the
house
mr.
Weasley
was
slumped
in
a
kitchen
chair
with
his
glasses
off
and
his
eyes
closed
he
was
a
thin
man
going
bald
but
the
little
hair
he
had
was
as
red
as
any
of
his
children's
he
was
wearing
long
green
robes
which
were
dusty
and
travel-worn
what
a
night
he
mumbled
groping
for
the
teapot
as
they
all
sat
down
around
him
nine
raids
nine
and
old
Mundungus
Fletcher
tried
to
put
a
hex
on
me
when
I
had
my
back
turned
mr.
Weasley
took
a
long
gulp
of
tea
and
sighed
find
anything
Dad
said
Fred
eagerly
all
I
got
were
a
few
shrinking
door
keys
and
a
biting
kettle
yawned
mr.
Weasley
there
was
some
pretty
nasty
stuff
that
wasn't
my
department
though
mortlake
was
taken
away
for
questioning
about
some
extremely
odd
ferrets
but
that's
the
Committee
on
Experimental
charms
thank
goodness
why
would
anyone
bother
making
door
keys
shrink
said
George
just
muggle-baiting
sighed
mr.
Weasley
sell
them
a
key
that
keeps
shrinking
to
nothing
so
they
can
never
find
it
when
they
need
it
of
course
it's
very
hard
to
convict
anyone
because
no
Muggle
would
admit
their
key
keeps
shrinking
they'll
insist
they
just
keep
losing
it
bless
them
they'll
go
to
any
lengths
to
ignore
magic
even
if
it's
staring
them
in
the
face
but
the
things
our
lot
have
taken
to
enchanting
you
wouldn't
believe
like
cars
for
instance
mrs
weasley
had
appeared
holding
a
long
poker
like
a
sword
mr
weasley's
eyes
jerked
open
he
stared
guiltily
at
his
wife
c-cars
Molly
dear
yes
Arthur
cars
said
Mrs
weasley
her
eyes
flashing
imagine
a
wizard
buying
a
rusty
old
car
and
telling
his
wife
all
he
wanted
to
do
with
it
was
take
it
apart
to
see
how
it
worked
while
really
he
was
enchanting
it
to
make
it
fly
mr.
Weasley
blinked
well
dear
I
think
you'll
find
that
he
would
be
quite
within
the
law
to
do
that
even
if
er
he
maybe
would
have
done
better
to
um
tell
his
wife
the
truth
there's
a
loophole
in
the
law
you'll
find
as
long
as
he
wasn't
intending
to
fly
the
car
the
fact
that
the
car
could
fly
wouldn't
arthur
Weasley
you
made
sure
there
was
a
loophole
when
you
wrote
that
law
shouted
Mrs
weasley
just
so
you
could
carry
on
tinkering
with
all
that
Muggle
rubbish
in
your
shed
and
for
your
information
Harry
arrived
this
morning
in
the
car
you
weren't
intending
to
fly
harry
said
mr.
Weasley
blankly
harry
who
he
looked
around
saw
Harry
and
jumped
good
lord
is
it
Harry
Potter
very
pleased
to
meet
you
ron's
told
us
so
much
about
your
sons
flew
that
car
to
harry's
house
and
back
last
night
shouted
Mrs
weasley
what
have
you
got
to
say
about
that
eh
did
you
really
said
mr.
Weasley
eagerly
did
it
go
all
right
i
I
mean
he
faltered
as
sparks
flew
from
Mrs
weasley's
eyes
that
that
was
very
wrong
boys
very
wrong
indeed
let's
leave
them
to
it
Ron
muttered
to
Harry
as
Mrs
weasley
swelled
like
a
bullfrog
come
on
i'll
show
you
my
bedroom
they
slipped
out
of
the
kitchen
and
down
a
narrow
passageway
to
an
uneven
staircase
which
wound
its
way
zigzagging
up
through
the
house
on
the
third
landing
a
door
stood
ajar
harry
just
caught
sight
of
a
pair
of
bright
brown
eyes
staring
at
him
before
it
closed
with
a
snap
ginny
said
Ron
you
don't
know
how
weird
it
is
for
her
to
be
this
shy
she
never
shuts
up
normally
they
climbed
two
more
flights
until
they
reached
a
door
with
peeling
paint
and
a
small
plaque
on
it
saying
ronald's
room
harry
stepped
in
his
head
almost
touching
the
sloping
ceiling
and
blinked
it
was
like
walking
into
a
furnace
Nearly
everything
in
ron's
room
seemed
to
be
a
violent
shade
of
orange
the
bedspread
the
walls
even
the
ceiling
then
Harry
realized
that
Ron
had
covered
nearly
every
inch
of
the
shabby
wallpaper
with
posters
of
the
same
seven
witches
and
wizards
all
wearing
bright
orange
robes
carrying
broomsticks
and
waving
energetically
your
Quidditch
team
said
Harry
the
Chudley
Cannons
said
Ron
pointing
at
the
orange
bedspread
which
was
emblazoned
with
two
giant
black
c's
and
a
speeding
cannonball
ninth
in
the
league
ron's
school
spellbooks
were
stacked
untidily
in
a
corner
next
to
a
pile
of
comics
that
all
seemed
to
feature
The
Adventures
of
Martin
miggs
the
Mad
Muggle
ron's
magic
wand
was
lying
on
top
of
a
fish
tank
full
of
frog
spawn
on
the
windowsill
next
to
his
fat
gray
rat
scabbers
who
was
snoozing
in
a
patch
of
sun
harry
stepped
over
a
pack
of
Self-Shuffling
playing
cards
on
the
floor
and
looked
out
of
the
tiny
window
in
the
field
far
below
he
could
see
a
gang
of
gnomes
sneaking
one
by
one
back
through
the
Weasleys
hedge
then
he
turned
to
look
at
Ron
who
was
watching
him
almost
nervously
as
though
waiting
for
his
opinion
it's
a
bit
small
said
Ron
quickly
not
like
that
room
you
had
with
the
Muggles
and
i'm
right
underneath
the
ghoul
in
the
attic
he's
always
banging
on
the
pipes
and
groaning
but
Harry
grinning
widely
said
This
is
the
best
house
i've
ever
been
in
ron's
ears
went
pink

and
blotts
ife
at
the
Burrow
was
as
different
as
possible
from
life
on
Privet
drive
the
Dursleys
liked
everything
neat
and
ordered
the
Weasleys
house
burst
with
the
strange
and
unexpected
harry
got
a
shock
the
first
time
he
looked
in
the
mirror
over
the
kitchen
mantelpiece
and
it
shouted
Tuck
your
shirt
in
scruffy
the
ghoul
in
the
attic
howled
and
dropped
pipes
whenever
he
felt
things
were
getting
too
quiet
and
small
explosions
from
Fred
and
george's
bedroom
were
considered
perfectly
normal
what
Harry
found
most
unusual
about
life
at
ron's
however
wasn't
the
talking
mirror
or
the
clanking
ghoul
It
was
the
fact
that
everybody
there
seemed
to
like
him
mrs
weasley
fussed
over
the
state
of
his
socks
and
tried
to
force
him
to
eat
fourth
helpings
at
every
meal
mr.
Weasley
liked
Harry
to
sit
next
to
him
at
the
dinner
table
so
that
he
could
bombard
him
with
questions
about
life
with
Muggles
asking
him
to
explain
how
things
like
plugs
and
the
postal
service
worked
fascinating
he
would
say
as
Harry
talked
him
through
using
a
telephone
ingenious
really
how
many
ways
Muggles
have
found
of
getting
along
without
magic
harry
heard
from
Hogwarts
one
sunny
morning
about
a
week
after
he
had
arrived
at
the
Burrow
he
and
Ron
went
down
to
breakfast
to
find
mr.
and
Mrs
weasley
and
Ginny
already
sitting
at
the
kitchen
table
the
moment
she
saw
Harry
Ginny
accidentally
knocked
her
porridge
bowl
to
the
floor
with
a
loud
clatter
ginny
seemed
very
prone
to
knocking
things
over
whenever
Harry
entered
a
room
she
dived
under
the
table
to
retrieve
the
bowl
and
emerged
with
her
face
glowing
like
the
setting
sun
pretending
he
hadn't
noticed
this
Harry
sat
down
and
took
the
toast
Mrs
weasley
offered
him
letters
from
school
said
mr.
Weasley
passing
Harry
and
Ron
identical
envelopes
of
yellowish
parchment
addressed
in
green
ink
dumbledore
already
knows
you're
here
Harry
doesn't
miss
a
trick
that
man
you
two've
got
them
too
he
added
as
Fred
and
George
ambled
in
still
in
their
pajamas
for
a
few
minutes
there
was
silence
as
they
all
read
their
letters
harry's
told
him
to
catch
the
Hogwarts
Express
as
usual
from
king's
cross
station
on
September
first
there
was
also
a
list
of
the
new
books

need
for
the
coming

second-year

require

fred
who
had
finished
his
own
list
peered
over
at
harry's
you've
been
told
to
get
all
lockhart's
books
too
he
said
the
new
defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
teacher
must
be
a
fan
bet
it's
a
witch
at
this
point
Fred
caught
his
mother's
eye
and
quickly
busied
himself
with
the
marmalade
that
lot
won't
come
cheap
said
George
with
a
quick
look
at
his
parents
lockhart's
books
are
really
expensive
well
we'll
manage
said
Mrs
weasley
but
she
looked
worried
expect
we'll
be
able
to
pick
up
a
lot
of
ginny's
things
secondhand
oh
are
you
starting
at
Hogwarts
this
year
harry
asked
Ginny
she
nodded
blushing
to
the
roots
of
her
flaming
hair
and
put
her
elbow
in
the
butter
dish
fortunately
no
one
saw
this
except
Harry
because
just
then
ron's
elder
brother
Percy
walked
in
he
was
already
dressed
his
Hogwarts
prefect
badge
pinned
to
his
sweater
vest
morning
all
said
Percy
briskly
lovely
day
he
sat
down
in
the
only
remaining
chair
but
leapt
up
again
almost
immediately
pulling
from
underneath
him
a
moulting
gray
feather
duster
at
least
that
was
what
Harry
thought
it
was
until
he
saw
that
it
was
breathing
errol
said
Ron
taking
the
limp
owl
from
Percy
and
extracting
a
letter
from
under
its
wing
finally
he's
got
hermione's
answer
wrote
to
her
saying
we
were
going
to
try
and
rescue
you
from
the
dursleys
he
carried
Errol
to
a
perch
just
inside
the
back
door
and
tried
to
stand
him
on
it
but
Errol
flopped
straight
off
again
so
Ron
lay
him
on
the
draining
board
instead
muttering
Pathetic
then
he
ripped
open
hermione's
letter
and
read
it
out
loud
Dear
Ron
and
Harry
if
you're
there
I
hope
everything
went
all
right
and
that
Harry
is
okay
and
that
you
didn't
do
anything
illegal
to
get
him
out
Ron
because
that
would
get
Harry
into
trouble
too
i've
been
really
worried
and
if
Harry
is
all
right
will
you
please
let
me
know
at
once
but
perhaps
it
would
be
bet
ter
if
you
used
a
different
owl
because
I
think
another
delivery
might
finish
your
one
off
i'm
very
busy
with
schoolwork
of
course
How
can
she
be
said
Ron
in
horror
we're
on
vacation
and
we're
going
to
London
next
wednesday
to
buy
my
new
books
why
don't
we
meet
in
Diago
n
Alley
Let
me
know
what's
happening
as
soon
as
you
can
love
from
Hermione
well
that
fits
in
nicely
we
can
go
and
get
all
your
things
then
too
said
Mrs
weasley
starting
to
clear
the
table
what're
you
all
up
to
today
harry
Ron
Fred
and
George
were
planning
to
go
up
the
hill
to
a
small
paddock
the
Weasleys
owned
it
was
surrounded
by
trees
that
blocked
it
from
view
of
the
village
below
meaning
that
they
could
practice
Quidditch
there
as
long
as
they
didn't
fly
too
high
they
couldn't
use
real
Quidditch
balls
which
would
have
been
hard
to
explain
if
they
had
escaped
and
flown
away
over
the
village
instead
they
threw
apples
for
one
another
to
catch
they
took
turns
riding
harry's
Nimbus
Two
Thousand
which
was
easily
the
best
broom
ron's
old
Shooting
Star
was
often
outstripped
by
passing
butterflies
five
minutes
later
they
were
marching
up
the
hill
broomsticks
over
their
shoulders
they
had
asked
Percy
if
he
wanted
to
join
them
but
he
had
said
he
was
busy
harry
had
only
seen
Percy
at
mealtimes
so
far
he
stayed
shut
in
his
room
the
rest
of
the
time
wish
I
knew
what
he
was
up
to
said
Fred
frowning
he's
not
himself
his
exam
results
came
the
day
before
you
did
twelve
wl
s
and
he
hardly
gloated
at
all
ordinary
Wizarding
Levels
George
explained
seeing
harry's
puzzled
look
bill
got
twelve
too
if
we're
not
careful
we'll
have
another
Head
Boy
in
the
family
i
don't
think
I
could
stand
the
shame
bill
was
the
oldest
Weasley
brother
he
and
the
next
brother
Charlie
had
already
left
Hogwarts
harry
had
never
met
either
of
them
but
knew
that
Charlie
was
in
Romania
studying
dragons
and
Bill
in
Egypt
working
for
the
wizard's
bank
Gringotts
dunno
how
Mum
and
Dad
are
going
to
afford
all
our
school
stuff
this
year
said
George
after
a
while
five
sets
of
Lockhart
books
and
ginny
needs
robes
and
a
wand
and
everything
harry
said
nothing
he
felt
a
bit
awkward
stored
in
an
underground
vault
at
Gringotts
in
London
was
a
small
fortune
that
his
parents
had
left
him
of
course
it
was
only
in
the
wizarding
world
that
he
had
money
you
couldn't
use
Galleons
Sickles
and
Knuts
in
Muggle
shops
he
had
never
mentioned
his
Gringotts
bank
account
to
the
Dursleys
he
didn't
think
their
horror
of
anything
connected
with
magic
would
stretch
to
a
large
pile
of
gold
mrs
weasley
woke
them
all
early
the
following
Wednesday
after
a
quick
half
a
dozen
bacon
sandwiches
each
they
pulled
on
their
coats
and
Mrs
weasley
took
a
flowerpot
off
the
kitchen
mantelpiece
and
peered
inside
we're
running
low
Arthur
she
sighed
we'll
have
to
buy
some
more
today
ah
well
guests
first
after
you
Harry
dear
and
she
offered
him
the
flowerpot
harry
stared
at
them
all
watching
him
w-what
am
I
supposed
to
do
he
stammered
he's
never
traveled
by
Floo
powder
said
Ron
suddenly
sorry
harry
I
forgot
never
said
mr.
Weasley
but
how
did
you
get
to
Diagon
Alley
to
buy
your
school
things
last
year
i
went
on
the
Underground
really
said
mr.
Weasley
eagerly
were
there
escapators
how
exactly
not
now
Arthur
said
Mrs
weasley
floo
powder's
a
lot
quicker
dear
but
goodness
me
if
you've
never
used
it
before
he'll
be
all
right
Mum
said
Fred
harry
watch
us
first
he
took
a
pinch
of
glittering
powder
out
of
the
flowerpot
stepped
up
to
the
fire
and
threw
the
powder
into
the
flames
with
a
roar
the
fire
turned
emerald
green
and
rose
higher
than
Fred
who
stepped
right
into
it
shouted
Diagon
Alley
and
vanished
you
must
speak
clearly
dear
Mrs
weasley
told
Harry
as
George
dipped
his
hand
into
the
flowerpot
and
be
sure
to
get
out
at
the
right
grate
the
right
what
said
Harry
nervously
as
the
fire
roared
and
whipped
george
out
of
sight
too
well
there
are
an
awful
lot
of
wizard
fires
to
choose
from
you
know
but
as
long
as
you've
spoken
clearly
he'll
be
fine
Molly
don't
fuss
said
mr.
Weasley
helping
himself
to
floo
powder
too
but
dear
if
he
got
lost
how
would
we
ever
explain
to
his
aunt
and
uncle
they
wouldn't
mind
Harry
reassured
her
dudley
would
think
it
was
a
brilliant
joke
if
I
got
lost
up
a
chimney
don't
worry
about
that
well
all
right
you
go
after
Arthur
said
Mrs
weasley
now
when
you
get
into
the
fire
say
where
you're
going
and
keep
your
elbows
tucked
in
Ron
advised
and
your
eyes
shut
said
Mrs
weasley
the
soot
don't
fidget
said
Ron
or
you
might
well
fall
out
of
the
wrong
fireplace
but
don't
panic
and
get
out
too
early
wait
until
you
see
Fred
and
george
trying
hard
to
bear
all
this
in
mind
Harry
took
a
pinch
of
Floo
powder
and
walked
to
the
edge
of
the
fire
he
took
a
deep
breath
scattered
the
powder
into
the
flames
and
stepped
forward
the
fire
felt
like
a
warm
breeze
he
opened
his
mouth
and
immediately
swallowed
a
lot
of
hot
ash
d-dia-gon
Alley
he
coughed
it
felt
as
though
he
was
being
sucked
down
a
giant
drain
he
seemed
to
be
spinning
very
fast
the
roaring
in
his
ears
was
deafening
he
tried
to
keep
his
eyes
open
but
the
whirl
of
green
flames
made
him
feel
sick
something
hard
knocked
his
elbow
and
he
tucked
it
in
tightly
still
spinning
and
spinning
now
it
felt
as
though
cold
hands
were
slapping
his
face
squinting
through
his
glasses
he
saw
a
blurred
stream
of
fireplaces
and
snatched
glimpses
of
the
rooms
beyond
his
bacon
sandwiches
were
churning
inside
him
he
closed
his
eyes
again
wishing
it
would
stop
and
then
he
fell
face
forward
onto
cold
stone
and
felt
the
bridge
of
his
glasses
snap
dizzy
and
bruised
covered
in
soot
he
got
gingerly
to
his
feet
holding
his
broken
glasses
up
to
his
eyes
he
was
cite
alone
but
where
he
was
he
had
no
idea
all
he
could
tell
was
that
he
was
standing
in
the
stone
fireplace
of
what
looked
like
a
large
dimly
lit
wizard's
shop
but
nothing
in
here
was
ever
likely
to
be
on
a
Hogwarts
school
list
a
glass
case
nearby
held
a
withered
hand
on
a
cushion
a
bloodstained
pack
of
cards
and
a
staring
glass
eye
evil-looking
masks
stared
down
from
the
walls
an
assortment
of
human
bones
lay
upon
the
counter
and
rusty
spiked
instruments
hung
from
the
ceiling
even
worse
the
dark
narrow
street
Harry
could
see
through
the
dusty
shop
window
was
definitely
not
Diagon
Alley
the
sooner
he
got
out
of
here
the
better
nose
still
stinging
where
it
had
hit
the
hearth
Harry
made
his
way
swiftly
and
silently
toward
the
door
but
before
he'd
got
halfway
toward
it
two
people
appeared
on
the
other
side
of
the
glass
and
one
of
them
was
the
very
last
person
Harry
wanted
to
meet
when
he
was
lost
covered
in
soot
and
wearing
broken
glasses
Draco
Malfoy
harry
looked
quickly
around
and
spotted
a
large
black
cabinet
to
his
left
he
shot
inside
it
and
pulled
the
doors
closed
leaving
a
small
crack
to
peer
through
seconds
later
a
bell
clanged
and
Malfoy
stepped
into
the
shop
the
man
who
followed
could
only
be
draco's
father
he
had
the
same
pale
pointed
face
and
identical
cold
gray
eyes
mr.
Malfoy
crossed
the
shop
looking
lazily
at
the
items
on
display
and
rang
a
bell
on
the
counter
before
turning
to
his
son
and
saying
Touch
nothing
Draco
malfoy
who
had
reached
for
the
glass
eye
said
I
thought
you
were
going
to
buy
me
a
present
i
said
I
would
buy
you
a
racing
broom
said
his
father
drumming
his
fingers
on
the
counter
what's
the
good
of
that
if
i'm
not
on
the
House
team
said
Malfoy
looking
sulky
and
bad-tempered
harry
Potter
got
a
Nimbus
Two
thousand
last
year
special
permission
from
Dumbledore
so
he
could
play
for
Gryffindor
he's
not
even
that
good
it's
just
because
he's
famous
famous
for
having
a
stupid
scar
on
his
forehead
malfoy
bent
down
to
examine
a
shelf
full
of
skulls
everyone
thinks
he's
so
smart
wonderful
Potter
with
his
scar
and
his
broomstick
you
have
told
me
this
at
least
a
dozen
times
already
said
Mr
malfoy
with
a
quelling
look
at
his
son
and
I
would
remind
you
that
it
is
not
prudent
to
appear
less
than
fond
of
Harry
Potter
not
when
most
of
our
kind
regard
him
as
the
hero
who
made
the
Dark
Lord
disappear
ah
mr.
Borgin
a
stooping
man
had
appeared
behind
the
counter
smoothing
his
greasy
hair
back
from
his
face
mr.
Malfoy
what
a
pleasure
to
see
you
again
said
mr.
Borgin
in
a
voice
as
oily
as
his
hair
delighted
and
young
Master
Malfoy
too
charmed
how
may
I
be
of
assistance
i
must
show
you
just
in
today
and
very
reasonably
priced
i'm
not
buying
today
mr.
Borgin
but
selling
said
mr.
Malfoy
selling
the
smile
faded
slightly
from
mr.
borgin's
face
you
have
heard
of
course
that
the
Ministry
is
conducting
more
raids
said
mr.
Malfoy
taking
a
roll
of
parchment
from
his
inside
pocket
and
unraveling
it
for
mr.
Borgin
to
read
i
have
a
few
ah
items
at
home
that
might
embarrass
me
if
the
Ministry
were
to
call
mr.
Borgin
fixed
a
pair
of
pince-nez
to
his
nose
and
looked
down
the
list
the
Ministry
wouldn't
presume
to
trouble
you
sir
surely
mr.
malfoy's
lip
curled
i
have
not
been
visited
yet
the
name
Malfoy
still
commands
a
certain
respect
yet
the
Ministry
grows
ever
more
meddlesome
there
are
rumors
about
a
new
Muggle
Protection
Act
no
doubt
that
fleabitten
muggle-loving
fool
Arthur
Weasley
is
behind
it
harry
felt
a
hot
surge
of
anger
and
as
you
see
certain
of
these
poisons
might
make
it
appear
i
understand
sir
of
course
said
mr.
Borgin
let
me
see
can
I
have
that
interrupted
Draco
pointing
at
the
withered
hand
on
its
cushion
ah
the
Hand
of
Glory
said
mr.
Borgin
abandoning
mr.
malfoy's
list
and
scurrying
over
to
Draco
insert
a
candle
and
it
gives
light
only
to
the
holder
best
friend
of
thieves
and
plunderers
your
son
has
fine
taste
sir
i
hope
my
son
will
amount
to
more
than
a
thief
or
a
plunderer
borgin
said
mr.
Malfoy
coldly
and
mr.
Borgin
said
quickly
No
offense
sir
no
offense
meant
though
if
his
grades
don't
pick
up
said
mr.
Malfoy
more
coldly
still
that
may
indeed
be
all
he
is
fit
for
it's
not
my
fault
retorted
Draco
the
teachers
all
have
favorites
that
Hermione
Granger
i
would
have
thought
you'd
be
ashamed
that
a
girl
of
no
wizard
family
beat
you
in
every
exam
snapped
mr.
Malfoy
ha
said
Harry
under
his
breath
pleased
to
see
Draco
looking
both
abashed
and
angry
it's
the
same
all
over
said
mr.
Borgin
in
his
oily
voice
wizard
blood
is
counting
for
less
everywhere
not
with
me
said
mr.
Malfoy
his
long
nostrils
flaring
no
sir
nor
with
me
sir
said
mr.
Borgin
with
a
deep
bow
in
that
case
perhaps
we
can
return
to
my
list
said
mr.
Malfoy
shortly
i
am
in
something
of
a
hurry
Borgin
I
have
important
business
elsewhere
today
they
started
to
haggle
harry
watched
nervously
as
Draco
drew
nearer
and
nearer
to
his
hiding
place
examining
the
objects
for
sale
draco
paused
to
examine
a
long
coil
of
hangman's
rope
and
to
read
smirking
the
card
propped
on
a
magnificent
necklace
of
opals
caution
Do
Not
Touch
cursed
Has
Claimed
the
Lives
of
Nineteen
Muggle
owners
to
Date
draco
turned
away
and
saw
the
cabinet
right
in
front
of
him
he
walked
forward
he
stretched
out
his
hand
for
the
handle
done
said
mr.
Malfoy
at
the
counter
come
Draco
harry
wiped
his
forehead
on
his
sleeve
as
Draco
turned
away
good
day
to
you
mr.
Borgin
i'll
expect
you
at
the
manor
tomorrow
to
pick
up
the
goods
the
moment
the
door
had
closed
mr.
Borgin
dropped
his
oily
manner
good
day
yourself
Mister
Malfoy
and
if
the
stories
are
true
you
haven't
sold
me
half
of
what's
hidden
in
your
manor
muttering
darkly
mr.
Borgin
disappeared
into
a
back
room
harry
waited
for
a
minute
in
case
he
came
back
then
quietly
as
he
could
slipped
out
of
the
cabinet
past
the
glass
cases
and
out
of
the
shop
door
clutching
his
broken
glasses
to
his
face
Harry
stared
around
he
had
emerged
into
a
dingy
alleyway
that
seemed
to
be
made
up
entirely
of
shops
devoted
to
the
Dark
Arts
the
one
he'd
just
left
Borgin
and
burkes
looked
like
the
largest
but
opposite
was
a
nasty
window
display
of
shrunken
heads
and
two
doors
down
a
large
cage
was
alive
with
gigantic
black
spiders
two
shabby-looking
wizards
were
watching
him
from
the
shadow
of
a
doorway
muttering
to
each
other
feeling
jumpy
Harry
set
off
trying
to
hold
his
glasses
on
straight
and
hoping
against
hope
he'd
be
able
to
find
a
way
out
of
here
an
old
wooden
street
sign
hanging
over
a
shop
selling
poisonous
candles
told
him
he
was
in
Knockturn
Alley
this
didn't
help
as
Harry
had
never
heard
of
such
a
place
he
supposed
he
hadn't
spoken
clearly
enough
through
his
mouthful
of
ashes
back
in
the
Weasleys
fire
trying
to
stay
calm
he
wondered
what
to
do
not
lost
are
you
my
dear
said
a
voice
in
his
ear
making
him
jump
an
aged
witch
stood
in
front
of
him
holding
a
tray
of
what
looked
horribly
like
whole
human
fingernails
she
leered
at
him
showing
mossy
teeth
harry
backed
away
i'm
fine
thanks
he
said
i'm
just
harry
what
d'yeh
think
yer
doin
down
there
harry's
heart
leapt
so
did
the
witch
a
load
of
fingernails
cascaded
down
over
her
feet
and
she
cursed
as
the
massive
form
of
Hagrid
the
hogwarts
gamekeeper
came
striding
toward
them
beetle-black
eyes
flashing
over
his
great
bristling
beard
hagrid
harry
croaked
in
relief
i
was
lost
Floo
powder
hagrid
seized
Harry
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
and
pulled
him
away
from
the
witch
knocking
the
tray
right
out
of
her
hands
her
shrieks
followed
them
all
the
way
along
the
twisting
alleyway
out
into
bright
sunlight
harry
saw
a
familiar
snow-white
marble
building
in
the
distance
Gringotts
Bank
hagrid
had
steered
him
right
into
Diagon
alley
yer
a
mess
said
Hagrid
gruffly
brushing
soot
off
Harry
so
forcefully
he
nearly
knocked
him
into
a
barrel
of
dragon
dung
outside
an
apothecary
skulkin
around
Knockturn
Alley
I
dunno
dodgy
place
harry
don
want
no

said
Harry
ducking
as
Hagrid
made
to
brush
him
off
again

Harry

they
set
off
together
down
the
street
how
come
yeh

wrote

me
said
Hagrid
as
Harry
jogged
alongside
him
he
had
to
take
three
steps
to
every
stride
of
hagrid's
enormous
boots
harry
explained
all
about
Dobby
and
the
dursleys
lousy
Muggles
growled
Hagrid
if
i'd've
known
harry
harry
over
here
harry
looked
up
and
saw
Hermione
Granger
standing
at
the
top
of
the
white
flight
of
steps
to
Gringotts
she
ran
down
to
meet
them
her
bushy
brown
hair
flying
behind
her
what
happened
to
your
glasses
hello
Hagrid
Oh
it's
wonderful
to
see
you
two
again
Are

into
Gringotts
Harry
as
soon
as
i've
found
the
Weasleys
said
Harry
yeh
won't
have
long
ter
wait
Hagrid
said
with
a
grin
harry
and
Hermione
looked
around
Sprinting
up
the
crowded
street
were
Ron
Fred
George
Percy
and
mr.
Weasley
harry
mr.
Weasley
panted
we
hoped
you'd
only
gone
one
grate
too
far
he
mopped
his
glistening
bald
patch
molly's
frantic
she's
coming
now
where
did
you
come
out
ron
asked
knockturn
Alley
said
Hagrid
grimly
excellent
said
Fred
and
George
together
we've
never
been
allowed
in
said
Ron
enviously
i
should
ruddy
well
think
not
growled
Hagrid
mrs
weasley
now
came
galloping
into
view
her
handbag
swing
ing
wildly
in
one
hand
Ginny
just
clinging
onto
the
other
oh
Harry
oh
my
dear
you
could
have
been
any
where
gasping
for
breath
she
pulled
a
large
clothes
brush
out
of
her
bag
and
began
sweeping
off
the
soot
Hagrid
hadn't
managed
to
beat
away
mr.
Weasley
took
harry's
glasses
gave
them
a
tap
of
his
wand
and
returned
them
good
as
new
well
gotta
be
off
said
Hagrid
who
was
having
his
hand
wrung
by
Mrs
weasley
Knockturn
Alley
if
you
hadn't
found
him
Hagrid
see
yer
at
Hogwarts
and
he
strode
away
head
and
shoulders
taller
than
anyone
else
in
the
packed
street
guess
who
I
saw
in
Borgin
and
Burkes
harry
asked
Ron
and
hermione
as
they
climbed
the
Gringotts
steps
malfoy
and
his
fa
ther
did
Lucius
Malfoy
buy
anything
said
mr.
Weasley
sharply
behind
them
no
he
was
selling
so
he's
worried
said
mr.
Weasley
with
grim
satisfaction
oh
i'd
love
to
get
Lucius
Malfoy
for
something
you
be
careful
Arthur
said
Mrs
weasley
sharply
as
they
were
bowed
into
the
bank
by
a
goblin
at
the
door
that
family's
trou
ble
don't
go
biting
off
more
than
you
can
chew
so
you
don't
think
i'm
a
match
for
Lucius
Malfoy
said
Mr
weasley
indignantly
but
he
was
distracted
almost
at
once
by
the
sight
of
hermione's
parents
who
were
standing
nervously
at
the
counter
that
ran
all
along
the
great
marble
hall
waiting
for
hermione
to
introduce
them
s
but
you're
Muggles
said
mr.
Weasley
delightedly
we
must
have
a
drink
what's
that
you've
got
there
oh
you're
changing
Muggle
money
molly
look
he
pointed
excitedly
at
the
tenpound
notes
in
mr.
granger's
hand
meet
you
back
here
Ron
said
to
Hermione
as
the
Weasleys
and
Harry
were
led
off
to
their
underground
vaults
by
another
Gringotts
goblin
the
vaults
were
reached
by
means
of
small
goblin-driven
carts
that
sped
along
miniature
train
tracks
through
the
bank's
underground
tunnels
harry
enjoyed
the
breakneck
journey
down
to
the
Weasleys
vault
but
felt
dreadful
far
worse
than
he
had
in
Knockturn
Alley
when
it
was
opened
there
was
a
very
small
pile
of
silver
Sickles
inside
and
just
one
gold
Galleon
mrs
weasley
felt
right
into
the
corners
before
sweeping
the
whole
lot
into
her
bag
harry
felt
even
worse
when
they
reached
his
vault
he
tried
to
block
the
contents
from
view
as
he
hastily
shoved
handfuls
of
coins
into
a
leather
bag
back
outside
on
the
marble
steps
they
all
separated
percy
muttered
vaguely
about
needing
a
new
quill
fred
and
George
had
spotted
their
friend
from
Hogwarts
Lee
Jordan
mrs
weasley
and
Ginny
were
going
to
a
secondhand
robe
shop
mr.
Weasley
was
insisting
on
taking
the
Grangers
off
to
the
Leaky
Cauldron
for
a
drink
we'll
all
meet
at
Flourish
and
Blotts
in
an
hour
to
buy
your
schoolbooks
said
Mrs
weasley
setting
off
with
Ginny
and
not
one
step
down
knockturn
Alley
she
shouted
at
the
twins
retreating
backs
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
strolled
off
along
the
winding
cobbled
street
the
bag
of
gold
silver
and
bronze
jangling
cheerfully
in
harry's
pocket
was
clamoring
to
be
spent
so
he
bought
three
large
strawberry-and-peanut-butter
ice
creams
which
they
slurped
happily
as
they
wandered
up
the
alley
examining
the
fascinating
shop
windows
ron
gazed
longingly
at
a
full
set
of
Chudley
Can
non
robes
in
the
windows
of
Quality
Quidditch
Supplies
until
hermione
dragged
them
off
to
buy
ink
and
parchment
next
door
in
Gambol
and
Japes
Wizarding
Joke
Shop
they
met
Fred
George
and
Lee
Jordan
who
were
stocking
up
on
dr.
filibuster's
Fabulous
wet-Start
No-Heat
Fireworks
and
in
a
tiny
junk
shop
full
of
bro
ken
wands
lopsided
brass
scales
and
old
cloaks
covered
in
potion
stains
they
found
Percy
deeply
immersed
in
a
small
and
deeply
boring
book
called
Prefects
Who
Gained
Power
A
study
of
Hogwarts
prefects
and
their
later
careers
Ron
read
aloud
off
the
back
cover
that
sounds
fascinating
go
away
Percy
snapped
course
he's
very
ambitious
Percy
he's
got
it
all
planned
out
he
wants
to
be
Minister
of
Magic
ron
told
Harry
and
Hermione
in
an
undertone
as
they
left
Percy
to
it
an
hour
later
they
headed
for
Flourish
and
Blotts
they
were
by
no
means
the
only
ones
making
their
way
to
the
bookshop
as
they
approached
it
they
saw
to
their
surprise
a
large
crowd
jostling
out
side
the
doors
trying
to
get
in
the
reason
for
this
was
proclaimed
by
a
large
banner
stretched
across
the
upper
windows
gilderoy
lockhart
will
be
signing
copies
of
his
autobiography
magical
me
today
P
m.
to
P
we
can
actually
meet
him
hermione
squealed
i
mean
he's
written
almost
the
whole
booklist
the
crowd
seemed
to
be
made
up
mostly
of
witches
around
Mrs
weasley's
age
a
harrassed-looking
wizard
stood
at
the
door
saying
calmly
please
ladies
don't
push
there
mind
the
books
now
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
squeezed
inside
a
long
line
wound
right
to
the
back
of
the
shop
where
Gilderoy
Lockhart
was
signing
his
books
they
each
grabbed
a
copy
of
The
Standard
Book
of
Spells
grade
and
sneaked
up
the
line
to
where
the
rest
of
the
Weasleys
were
standing
with
mr.
and
Mrs
granger
oh
there
you
are
good
said
Mrs
weasley
she
sounded
breathless
and
kept
patting
her
hair
we'll
be
able
to
see
him
in
a
minute
gilderoy
Lockhart
came
slowly
into
view
seated
at
a
table
surrounded
by
large
pictures
of
his
own
face
all
winking
and
flashing
dazzlingly
white
teeth
at
the
crowd
the
real
Lockhart
was
wearing
robes
of
forget-me-not
blue
that
exactly
matched
his
eyes
his
pointed
wizard's
hat
was
set
at
a
jaunty
angle
on
his
wavy
hair
a
short
irritable-looking
man
was
dancing
around
taking
photographs
with
a
large
black
camera
that
emitted
puffs
of
purple
smoke
with
every
blinding
flash
out
of
the
way
there
he
snarled
at
Ron
moving
back
to
get
a
better
shot
this
is
for
the
Daily
Prophet
big
deal
said
Ron
rubbing
his
foot
where
the
photographer
had
stepped
on
it
gilderoy
Lockhart
heard
him
he
looked
up
he
saw
Ron
and
then
he
saw
Harry
he
stared
then
he
leapt
to
his
feet
and
positively
shouted
It
can't
be
Harry
Potter
the
crowd
parted
whispering
excitedly
Lockhart
dived
forward
seized
harry's
arm
and
pulled
him
to
the
front
the
crowd
burst
into
applause
harry's
face
burned
as
Lockhart
shook
his
hand
for
the
photographer
who
was
clicking
away
madly
wafting
thick
smoke
over
the
Weasleys
nice
big
smile
Harry
said
Lockhart
through
his
own
gleaming
teeth
together
you
and
I
are
worth
the
front
page
when
he
finally
let
go
of
harry's
hand
Harry
could
hardly
feel
his
fingers
he
tried
to
sidle
back
over
to
the
Weasleys
but
Lockhart
threw
an
arm
around
his
shoulders
and
clamped
him
tightly
to
his
side
ladies
and
gentlemen
he
said
loudly
waving
for
quiet
what
an
extraordinary
moment
this
is
the
perfect
moment
for
me
to
make
a
little
announcement
i've
been
sitting
on
for
some
time
when
young
Harry
here
stepped
into
Flourish
and
Blotts
today
he
only
wanted
to
buy
my
autobiography
which
I
shall
be
happy
to
present
him
now
free
of
charge
The
crowd
applauded
again
he
had
no
idea
lockhart
continued
giving
Harry
a
little
shake
that
made
his
glasses
slip
to
the
end
of
his
nose
that
he
would
shortly
be
getting
much
much
more
than
my
book
Magical
me.
He
and
his
schoolmates
will
in
fact
be
getting
the
real
magical
me
yes
ladies
and
gentlemen
I
have
great
pleasure
and
pride
in
announcing
that
this
September
I
will
be
taking
up
the
post
of
defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
teacher
at
Hogwarts
School
of
Witchcraft
and
Wizardry
the
crowd
cheered
and
clapped
and
Harry
found
himself
being
presented
with
the
entire
works
of
Gilderoy
Lockhart
staggering
slightly
under
their
weight
he
managed
to
make
his
way
out
of
the
limelight
to
the
edge
of
the
room
where
Ginny
was
standing
next
to
her
new
cauldron
you
have
these
Harry
mumbled
to
her
tipping
the
books
into
the
cauldron
i'll
buy
my
own
bet
you
loved
that
didn't
you
Potter
said
a
voice
Harry
had
no
trouble
recognizing
he
straightened
up
and
found
himself
face-to-face
with
Draco
Malfoy
who
was
wearing
his
usual
sneer
famous
Harry
Potter
said
Malfoy
can't
even
go
into
a
bookshop
without
making
the
front
page
leave
him
alone
he
didn't
want
all
that
said
Ginny
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
spoken
in
front
of
Harry
she
was
glaring
at
Malfoy
potter
you've
got
yourself
a
girlfriend
drawled
Malfoy
ginny
went
scarlet
as
Ron
and
Hermione
fought
their
way
over
both
clutching
stacks
of
lockhart's
books
oh
it's
you
said
Ron
looking
at
Malfoy
as
if
he
were
something
unpleasant
on
the
sole
of
his
shoe
bet
you're
surprised
to
see
Harry
here
eh
not
as
surprised
as
I
am
to
see
you
in
a
shop
Weasley
retorted
malfoy
i
suppose
your
parents
will
go
hungry
for
a
month
to
pay
for
all
those
ron
went
as
red
as
Ginny
he
dropped
his
books
into
the
cauldron
too
and
started
toward
Malfoy
but
Harry
and
Hermione
grabbed
the
back
of
his
jacket
ron
said
mr.
Weasley
struggling
over
with
Fred
and
George
what
are
you
doing
it's
too
crowded
in
here
let's
go
outside
well
well
well
Arthur
Weasley
it
was
mr.
Malfoy
he
stood
with
his
hand
on
draco's
shoulder
sneering
in
just
the
same
way
lucius
said
mr.
Weasley
nodding
coldly
busy
time
at
the
Ministry
I
hear
said
mr.
Malfoy
all
those
raids
i
hope
they're
paying
you
overtime
he
reached
into
ginny's
cauldron
and
extracted
from
amid
the
glossy
lockhart
books
a
very
old
very
battered
copy
of
A
beginner's
Guide
to
Transfiguration
obviously
not
mr.
Malfoy
said
dear
me
what's
the
use
of
being
a
disgrace
to
the
name
of
wizard
if
they
don't
even
pay
you
well
for
it
mr.
Weasley
flushed
darker
than
either
Ron
or
Ginny
we
have
a
very
different
idea
of
what
disgraces
the
name
of
wizard
malfoy
he
said
clearly
said
mr.
Malfoy
his
pale
eyes
straying
to
mr.
and
Mrs
granger
who
were
watching
apprehensively
the
company
you
keep
Weasley
and
I
thought
your
family
could
sink
no
lower
there
was
a
thud
of
metal
as
ginny's
cauldron
went
flying
Mr
weasley
had
thrown
himself
at
mr.
Malfoy
knocking
him
backward
into
a
bookshelf
dozens
of
heavy
spellbooks
came
thundering
down
on
all
their
heads
there
was
a
yell
of
Get
him
Dad
from
Fred
or
george
Mrs
weasley
was
shrieking
No
Arthur
no
the
crowd
stampeded
backward
knocking
more
shelves
over
Gentlemen
please
please
cried
the
assistant
and
then
louder
than
all
break
it
up
there
gents
break
it
up
hagrid
was
wading
toward
them
through
the
sea
of
books
in
an
instant
he
had
pulled
mr.
Weasley
and
mr.
Malfoy
apart
mr.
Weasley
had
a
cut
lip
and
Mr
malfoy
had
been
hit
in
the
eye
by
an
Encyclopedia
of
Toadstools
he
was
still
holding
ginny's
old
Transfiguration
book
he
thrust
it
at
her
his
eyes
glittering
with
malice
here
girl
take
your
book
it's
the
best
your
father
can
give
you
Pulling
himself
out
of
hagrid's
grip
he
beckoned
to
Draco
and
swept
from
the
shop
yeh
should've
ignored
him
Arthur
said
Hagrid
almost
lifting
mr.
Weasley
off
his
feet
as
he
straightened
his
robes
rotten
ter
the
core
the
whole
family
everyone
knows
that
no
malfoy's
worth
listenin
ter
bad
blood
that's
what
it
is
come
on
now
let's
get
outta
here
the
assistant
looked
as
though
he
wanted
to
stop
them
leaving
but
he
barely
came
up
to
hagrid's
waist
and
seemed
to
think
better
of
it
they
hurried
up
the
street
the
Grangers
shaking
with
fright
and
Mrs
weasley
beside
herself
with
fury
a
fine
example
to
set
for
your
children
brawling
in
public
what
gilderoy
Lockhart
must've
thought
he
was
pleased
said
Fred
didn't
you
hear
him
as
we
were
leaving
he
was
asking
that
bloke
from
the
Daily
Prophet
if
he'd
be
able
to
work
the
fight
into
his
report
said
it
was
all
publicity
but
it
was
a
subdued
group
that
headed
back
to
the
fireside
in
the
Leaky
cauldron
where
Harry
the
Weasleys
and
all
their
shopping
would
be
traveling
back
to
the
Burrow
using
Floo
powder
they
said
good-bye
to
the
grangers
who
were
leaving
the
pub
for
the
Muggle
street
on
the
other
side
mr.
Weasley
started
to
ask
them
how
bus
stops
worked
but
stopped
quickly
at
the
look
on
Mrs
weasley's
face
harry
took
off
his
glasses
and
put
them
safely
in
his
pocket
before
helping
himself
to
Floo
powder
it
definitely
wasn't
his
favorite
way
to
travel

the
whomping
willow
he
end
of
the
summer
vacation
came
too
quickly
for
harry's
liking
he
was
looking
forward
to
getting
back
to
Hogwarts
but
his
month
at
the
Burrow
had
been
the
happiest
of
his
life
it
was
difficult
not
to
feel
jealous
of
Ron
when
he
thought
of
the
Dursleys
and
the
sort
of
welcome
he
could
expect
next
time
he
turned
up
on
Privet
Drive
on
their
last
evening
Mrs
weasley
conjured
up
a
sumptuous
dinner
that
included
all
of
harry's
favorite
things
ending
with
a
mouthwatering
treacle
pudding
fred
and
George
rounded
off
the
evening
with
a
display
of
Filibuster
fireworks
they
fiIled
the
kitchen
with
red
and
blue
stars
that
bounced
from
ceiling
to
wall
for
at
least
half
an
hour
then
it
was
time
for
a
last
mug
of
hot
chocolate
and
bed
it
took
a
long
while
to
get
started
next
morning
they
were
up
at
dawn
but
somehow
they
still
seemed
to
have
a
great
deal
to
do
mrs
weasley
dashed
about
in
a
bad
mood
looking
for
spare
socks
and
quills
people
kept
colliding
on
the
stairs
half-dressed
with
bits
of
toast
in
their
hands
and
mr.
Weasley
nearly
broke
his
neck
tripping
over
a
stray
chicken
as
he
crossed
the
yard
carrying
ginny's
trunk
to
the
car
harry
couldn't
see
how
eight
people
six
large
trunks
two
owls
and
a
rat
were
going
to
fit
into
one
small
Ford
Anglia
he
had
reckoned
of
course
without
the
special
features
that
mr.
Weasley
had
added
not
a
word
to
Molly
he
whispered
to
Harry
as
he
opened
the
trunk
and
showed
him
how
it
had
been
magically
expanded
so
that
the
luggage
fitted
easily
when
at
last
they
were
all
in
the
car
Mrs
weasley
glanced
into
the
back
seat
where
Harry
Ron
Fred
George
and
Percy
were
all
sitting
comfortably
side
by
side
and
said
Muggles
do
know
more
than
we
give
them
credit
for
don't
they
she
and
Ginny
got
into
the
front
seat
which
had
been
stretched
so
that
it
resembled
a
park
bench
i
mean
you'd
never
know
it
was
this
roomy
from
the
outside
would
you
mr.
Weasley
started
up
the
engine
and
they
trundled
out
of
the
yard
harry
turning
back
for
a
last
look
at
the
house
he
barely
had
time
to
wonder
when
he'd
see
it
again
when
they
were
back
George
had
forgotten
his
box
of
Filibuster
fireworks
five
minutes
after
that
they
skidded
to
a
halt
in
the
yard
so
that
Fred
could
run
in
for
his
broomstick
they
had
almost
reached
the
highway
when
Ginny
shrieked
that
she'd
left
her
diary
by
the
time
she
had
clambered
back
into
the
car
they
were
running
very
late
and
tempers
were
running
high
mr.
Weasley
glanced
at
his
watch
and
then
at
his
wife
molly
dear
no
Arthur
no
one
would
see
this
little
button
here
is
an
Invisibility
Booster
I
installed
that'd
get
us
up
in
the
air
then
we
fly
above
the
clouds
we'd
be
there
in
ten
minutes
and
no
one
would
be
any
the
wiser
i
said
no
Arthur
not
in
broad
daylight
they
reached
king's
Cross
at
a
quarter
to
eleven
mr.
Weasley
dashed
across
the
road
to
get
trolleys
for
their
trunks
and
they
all
hurried
into
the
station
harry
had
caught
the
Hogwarts
Express
the
previous
year
the
tricky
part
was
getting
onto
platform
nine
and
three-quarters
which
wasn't
visible
to
the
Muggle
eye
what
you
had
to
do
was
walk
through
the
solid
barrier
dividing
platforms
nine
and
ten
it
didn't
hurt
but
it
had
to
be
done
carefully
so
that
none
of
the
Muggles
noticed
you
vanishing
percy
first
said
Mrs
weasley
looking
nervously
at
the
clock
overhead
which
showed
they
had
only
five
minutes
to
disappear
casually
through
the
barrier
percy
strode
briskly
forward
and
vanished
mr.
Weasley
went
next
fred
and
George
followed
i'll
take
Ginny
and
you
two
come
right
after
us
Mrs
weasley
told
harry
and
Ron
grabbing
ginny's
hand
and
setting
off
in
the
blink
of
an
eye
they
were
gone
let's
go
together
we've
only
got
a
minute
Ron
said
to
Harry
harry
made
sure
that
hedwig's
cage
was
safely
wedged
on
top
of
his
trunk
and
wheeled
his
trolley
around
to
face
the
barrier
he
felt
perfectly
confident
this
wasn't
nearly
as
uncomfortable
as
using
Floo
powder
both
of
them
bent
low
over
the
handles
of
their
trolleys
and
walked
purposefully
toward
the
barrier
gathering
speed
a
few
feet
away
from
it
they
broke
into
a
run
and
crash
both
trolleys
hit
the
barrier
and
bounced
backward
ron's
trunk
fell
off
with
a
loud
thump
Harry
was
knocked
off
his
feet
and
hedwig's
cage
bounced
onto
the
shiny
floor
and
she
rolled
away
shrieking
indignantly
people
all
around
them
stared
and
a
guard
nearby
yelled
what
in
blazes
d'you
think
you're
doing
lost
control
of
the
trolley
Harry
gasped
clutching
his
ribs
as
he
got
up
ron
ran
to
pick
up
Hedwig
who
was
causing
such
a
scene
that
there
was
a
lot
of
muttering
about
cruelty
to
animals
from
the
surrounding
crowd
why
can't
we
get
through
harry
hissed
to
Ron
i
dunno
ron
looked
wildly
around
a
dozen
curious
people
were
still
watching
them
we're
going
to
miss
the
train
Ron
whispered
i
don't
understand
why
the
gateway's
sealed
itself
harry
looked
up
at
the
giant
clock
with
a
sickening
feeling
in
the
pit
of
his
stomach
ten
seconds
nine
seconds
he
wheeled
his
trolley
forward
cautiously
until
it
was
right
against
the
barrier
and
pushed
with
all
his
might
the
metal
remained
solid
three
seconds
two
seconds
one
second
it's
gone
said
Ron
sounding
stunned
the
train's
left
what
if
mum
and
Dad
can't
get
back
through
to
us
have
you
got
any
muggle
money
and
they
marched
off
through
the
crowd
of
curious
Muggles
out
of
the
station
and
back
onto
the
side
road
where
the
old
Ford
Anglia
was
parked
ron
unlocked
the
cavernous
trunk
with
a
series
of
taps
from
his
wand
they
heaved
their
luggage
back
in
put
Hedwig
on
the
back
seat
and
got
into
the
front
check
that
no
one's
watching
said
Ron
starting
the
ignition
with
another
tap
of
his
wand
harry
stuck
his
head
out
of
the
window
traffic
was
rumbling
along
the
main
road
ahead
but
their
street
was
empty
okay
he
said
ron
pressed
a
tiny
silver
button
on
the
dashboard
the
car
around
them
vanished
and
so
did
they
harry
could
feel
the
seat
vibrating
beneath
him
hear
the
engine
feel
his
hands
on
his
knees
and
his
glasses
on
his
nose
but
for
all
he
could
see
he
had
become
a
pair
of
eyeballs
floating
a
few
feet
above
the
ground
in
a
dingy
street
full
of
parked
cars
let's
go
said
ron's
voice
from
his
right
and
the
ground
and
the
dirty
buildings
on
either
side
fell
away
dropping
out
of
sight
as
the
car
rose
in
seconds
the
whole
of
London
lay
smoky
and
glittering
below
them
then
there
was
a
popping
noise
and
the
car
Harry
and
Ron
reappeared
uh-oh
said
Ron
jabbing
at
the
Invisibility
Booster
it's
faulty
both
of
them
pummeled
it
the
car
vanished
then
it
flickered
back
again
hold
on
ron
yelled
and
he
slammed
his
foot
on
the
acceler
ator
they
shot
straight
into
the
low
woolly
clouds
and
everything
turned
dull
and
foggy
now
what
said
Harry
blinking
at
the
solid
mass
of
cloud
pressing
in
on
them
from
all
sides
we
need
to
see
the
train
to
know
what
direction
to
go
in
said
Ron
dip
back
down
again
quickly
they
dropped
back
beneath
the
clouds
and
twisted
around
in
their
seats
squinting
at
the
ground
i
can
see
it
harry
yelled
right
ahead
there
the
Hogwarts
Express
was
streaking
along
below
them
like
a
scarlet
snake
due
north
said
Ron
checking
the
compass
on
the
dashboard
okay
we'll
just
have
to
check
on
it
every
half
hour
or
so
hold
on
and
they
shot
up
through
the
clouds
a
minute
later
they
burst
out
into
a
blaze
of
sunlight
it
was
a
different
world
the
wheels
of
the
car
skimmed
the
sea
of
fluffy
cloud
the
sky
a
bright
endless
blue
under
the
blinding
white
sun
all
we've
got
to
worry
about
now
are
airplanes
said
Ron
they
looked
at
each
other
and
started
to
laugh
for
a
long
time
they
couldn't
stop
it
was
as
though
they
had
been
plunged
into
a
fabulous
dream
this
thought
Harry
was
surely
the
only
way
to
travel
past
swirls
and
turrets
of
snowy
cloud
in
a
car
full
of
hot
bright
sunlight
with
a
fat
pack
of
toffees
in
the
glove
compartment
and
the
prospect
of
seeing
fred's
and
george's
jealous
faces
when
they
landed
smoothly
and
spectacularly
on
the
sweeping
lawn
in
front
of
hogwarts
castle
they
made
regular
checks
on
the
train
as
they
flew
farther
and
farther
north
each
dip
beneath
the
clouds
showing
them
a
different
view
london
was
soon
far
behind
them
replaced
by
neat
green
fields
that
gave
way
in
turn
to
wide
purplish
moors
a
great
city
alive
with
cars
like
multicolored
ants
villages
with
tiny
toy
churches
several
uneventful
hours
later
however
Harry
had
to
admit
that
some
of
the
fun
was
wearing
off
the
toffees
had
made
them
extremely
thirsty
and
they
had
nothing
to
drink
he
and
Ron
had
pulled
off
their
sweaters
but
harry's
t-shirt
was
sticking
to
the
back
of
his
seat
and
his
glasses
kept
sliding
down
to
the
end
of
his
sweaty
nose
he
had
stopped
noticing
the
fantastic
cloud
shapes
now
and
was
thinking
longingly
of
the
train
miles
below
where
you
could
buy
ice-cold
pumpkin
juice
from
a
trolley
pushed
by
a
plump
witch
why
hadn't
they
been
able
to
get
onto
platform
nine
and
three-quarters
can't
be
much
further
can
it
croaked
Ron
hours
later
still
as
the
sun
started
to
sink
into
their
floor
of
cloud
staining
it
a
deep
pink
ready
for
another
check
on
the
train
it
was
still
right
below
them
winding
its
way
past
a
snowcapped
mountain
it
was
much
darker
beneath
the
canopy
of
clouds
ron
put
his
foot
on
the
accelerator
and
drove
them
upward
again
but
as
he
did
so
the
engine
began
to
whine
harry
and
Ron
exchanged
nervous
glances
it's
probably
just
tired
said
Ron
it's
never
been
this
far
before
and
they
both
pretended
not
to
notice
the
whining
growing
louder
and
louder
as
the
sky
became
steadily
darker
stars
were
blossoming
in
the
blackness
harry
pulled
his
sweater
back
on
try
ing
to
ignore
the
way
the
windshield
wipers
were
now
waving
fee
bly
as
though
in
protest
not
far
said
Ron
more
to
the
car
than
to
Harry
not
far
now
and
he
patted
the
dashboard
nervously
when
they
flew
back
beneath
the
clouds
a
little
while
later
they
had
to
squint
through
the
darkness
for
a
landmark
they
knew
there
harry
shouted
making
Ron
and
Hedwig
jump
straight
ahead
silhouetted
on
the
dark
horizon
high
on
the
cliff
over
the
lake
stood
the
many
turrets
and
towers
of
Hogwarts
castle
but
the
car
had
begun
to
shudder
and
was
losing
speed
come
on
Ron
said
cajolingly
giving
the
steering
wheel
a
lit
tle
shake
nearly
there
come
on
the
engine
groaned
narrow
jets
of
steam
were
issuing
from
un
der
the
hood
harry
found
himself
gripping
the
edges
of
his
seat
very
hard
as
they
flew
toward
the
lake
the
car
gave
a
nasty
wobble
glancing
out
of
his
window
Harry
saw
the
smooth
black
glassy
surface
of
the
water
a
mile
below
ron's
knuckles
were
white
on
the
steering
wheel
the
car
wobbled
again
come
on
Ron
muttered
they
were
over
the
lake
the
castle
was
right
ahead
Ron
put
his
foot
down
there
was
a
loud
clunk
a
splutter
and
the
engine
died
com
pletely
uh-oh
said
Ron
into
the
silence
the
nose
of
the
car
dropped
they
were
falling
gathering
speed
heading
straight
for
the
solid
castle
wall
noooooo
ron
yelled
swinging
the
steering
wheel
around
they
missed
the
dark
stone
wall
by
inches
as
the
car
turned
in
a
great
arc
soaring
over
the
dark
greenhouses
then
the
vegetable
patch
and
then
out
over
the
black
lawns
losing
altitude
all
the
time
ron
let
go
of
the
steering
wheel
completely
and
pulled
his
wand
out
of
his
back
pocket
stop
stop
he
yelled
whacking
the
dashboard
and
the
windshield
but
they
were
still
plummeting
the
ground
flying
up
toward
them
watch
out
for
that
tree
harry
bellowed
lunging
for
the
steering
wheel
but
too
late
crunch
with
an
earsplitting
bang
of
metal
on
wood
they
hit
the
thick
tree
trunk
and
dropped
to
the
ground
with
a
heavy
jolt
steam
was
billowing
from
under
the
crumpled
hood
Hedwig
was
shrieking
in
terror
a
golfball-size
lump
was
throbbing
on
harry's
head
where
he
had
hit
the
windshield
and
to
his
right
Ron
let
out
a
low
despairing
groan
are
you
okay
harry
said
urgently
my
wand
said
Ron
in
a
shaky
voice
look
at
my
wand
it
had
snapped
almost
in
two
the
tip
was
dangling
limply
held
on
by
a
few
splinters
harry
opened
his
mouth
to
say
he
was
sure
they'd
be
able
to
mend
it
up
at
the
school
but
he
never
even
got
started
at
that
very
moment
something
hit
his
side
of
the
car
with
the
force
of
a
Y
charging
bull
sending
him
lurching
sideways
into
Ron
just
as
an
equally
heavy
blow
hit
the
roof
what's
happen
ron
gasped
staring
through
the
windshield
and
Harry
looked
around
just
in
time
to
see
a
branch
as
thick
as
a
python
smash
into
it
the
tree
they
had
hit
was
attacking
them
its
trunk
was
bent
almost
double
and
its
gnarled
boughs
were
pummeling
every
inch
of
the
car
it
could
reach
aaargh
said
Ron
as
another
twisted
limb
punched
a
large
dent
into
his
door
the
windshield
was
now
trembling
under
a
hail
of
blows
from
knuckle-like
twigs
and
a
branch
as
thick
as
a
battering
ram
was
pounding
furiously
on
the
roof
which
seemed
to
be
caving
run
for
it
ron
shouted
throwing
his
full
weight
against
his
door
but
next
second
he
had
been
knocked
backward
into
harry's
lap
by
a
vicious
uppercut
from
another
branch
we're
done
for
he
moaned
as
the
ceiling
sagged
but
suddenly
the
floor
of
the
car
was
vibrating
the
engine
had
restarted
reverse
harry
yelled
and
the
car
shot
backward
the
tree
was
still
trying
to
hit
them
they
could
hear
its
roots
creaking
as
it
almost
ripped
itself
up
lashing
out
at
them
as
they
sped
out
of
reach
that
panted
Ron
was
close
well
done
car
the
car
however
had
reached
the
end
of
its
tether
with
two
sharp
clunks
the
doors
flew
open
and
Harry
felt
his
seat
tip
sideways
Next
thing
he
knew
he
was
sprawled
on
the
damp
ground
loud
thuds
told
him
that
the
car
was
ejecting
their
luggage
from
the
trunk
hedwig's
cage
flew
through
the
air
and
burst
open
she
rose
out
of
it
with
an
angry
screech
and
sped
off
toward
the
castle
y
without
a
backward
look
then
dented
scratched
and
steaming
the
car
rumbled
off
into
the
darkness
its
rear
lights
blazing
angrily
come
back
ron
yelled
after
it
brandishing
his
broken
wand
dad'll
kill
me
but
the
car
disappeared
from
view
with
one
last
snort
from
its
exhaust
can
you
believe
our
luck
said
Ron
miserably
bending
down
to
pick
up
Scabbers
of
all
the
trees
we
could've
hit
we
had
to
get
one
that
hits
back
he
glanced
over
his
shoulder
at
the
ancient
tree
which
was
still
flailing
its
branches
threateningly
come
on
said
Harry
wearily
we'd
better
get
up
to
the
school
it
wasn't
at
all
the
triumphant
arrival
they
had
pictured
stiff
cold
and
bruised
they
seized
the
ends
of
their
trunks
and
began
dragging
them
up
the
grassy
slope
toward
the
great
oak
front
doors
i
think
the
feast's
already
started
said
Ron
dropping
his
trunk
at
the
foot
of
the
front
steps
and
crossing
quietly
to
look
through
a
brightly
lit
window
hey
Harry
come
and
look
it's
the
Sorting
harry
hurried
over
and
together
he
and
Ron
peered
in
at
the
Great
hall
innumerable
candles
were
hovering
in
midair
over
four
long
crowded
tables
making
the
golden
plates
and
goblets
sparkle
overhead
the
bewitched
ceiling
which
always
mirrored
the
sky
outside
sparkled
with
stars
through
the
forest
of
pointed
black
Hogwarts
hats
Harry
saw
a
long
line
of
scared-looking
first
years
fiIing
into
the
Hall
ginny
was
among
them
easily
visible
because
of
her
vivid
Weasley
ha-ir
meanwhile
Professor
McGonagall
a
bespectacled
witch
with
her
hair
in
a
tight
bun
was
placing
the
famous
Hogwarts
Sorting
Hat
on
a
stool
before
the
newcomers
every
year
this
aged
old
hat
patched
frayed
and
dirty
sorted
new
students
into
the
four
Hogwarts
houses
Gryffindor
Hufflepuff
ravenclaw
and
Slytherin
harry
well
remembered
putting
it
on
exactly
one
year
ago
and
waiting
petrified
for
its
decision
as
it
muttered
aloud
in
his
ear
for
a
few
horrible
seconds
he
had
feared
that
the
hat
was
going
to
put
him
in
Slytherin
the
house
that
had
turned
out
more
Dark
witches
and
wizards
than
any
other
but
he
had
ended
up
in
Gryffindor
along
with
Ron
Hermione
and
the
rest
of
the
weasleys
last
term
Harry
and
Ron
had
helped
Gryffindor
win
the
house
Championship
beating
Slytherin
for
the
first
time
in
seven
years
a
very
small
mousy-haired
boy
had
been
called
forward
to
place
the
hat
on
his
head
harry's
eyes
wandered
past
him
to
where
Professor
dumbledore
the
headmaster
sat
watching
the
Sorting
from
the
staff
table
his
long
silver
beard
and
half-moon
glasses
shining
brightly
in
the
candlelight
several
seats
along
Harry
saw
Gilderoy
Lockhart
dressed
in
robes
of
aquamarine
and
there
at
the
end
was
Hagrid
huge
and
hairy
drinking
deeply
from
his
goblet
hang
on
harry
muttered
to
Ron
there's
an
empty
chair
at
the
staff
table
where's
Snape
professor
Severus
Snape
was
harry's
least
favorite
teacher
harry
also
happened
to
be
snape's
least
favorite
student
cruel
sarcastic
and
disliked
by
everybody
except
the
students
from
his
own
house
Slytherin
Snape
taught
Potions
maybe
he's
ill
said
Ron
hopefully
maybe
he's
left
said
ha-rry
because
he
missed
out
on
the
Defense
against
Dark
Arts
job
again
or
he
might
have
been
sacked
said
Ron
enthusiastically
i
mean
everyone
hates
him
or
maybe
said
a
very
cold
voice
right
behind
them
he's
waiting
to
hear
why
you
two
didn't
arrive
on
the
school
train
harry
spun
around
there
his
black
robes
rippling
in
a
cold
breeze
stood
Severus
Snape
he
was
a
thin
man
with
sallow
skin
a
hooked
nose
and
greasy
shoulder-length
black
hair
and
at
this
moment
he
was
smiling
in
a
way
that
told
Harry
he
and
Ron
were
in
very
deep
trouble
follow
me
said
Snape
not
daring
even
to
look
at
each
other
Harry
and
Ron
followed
Snape
up
the
steps
into
the
vast
echoing
entrance
hall
which
was
lit
with
flaming
torches
a
delicious
smell
of
food
was
wafting
from
the
Great
hall
but
Snape
led
them
away
from
the
warmth
and
light
down
a
narrow
stone
staircase
that
led
into
the
dungeons
in
he
said
opening
a
door
halfway
down
the
cold
passageway
and
pointing
they
entered
snape's
office
shivering
the
shadowy
walls
were
lined
with
shelves
of
large
glass
ars
in
which
floated
all
manner
of
revolting
things
Harry
didn't
really
want
to
know
the
name
of
at
the
moment
the
fireplace
was
dark
and
empty
snape
closed
the
door
and
turned
to
look
at
them
so
he
said
softly
the
train
isn't
good
enough
for
the
famous
Harry
potter
and
his
faithful
sidekick
Weasley
wanted
to
arrive
with
a
bang
did
we
boys
no
sir
it
was
the
barrier
at
king's
Cross
it
silence
said
Snape
coldly
what
have
you
done
with
the
car
ron
gulped
this
wasn't
the
first
time
Snape
had
given
Harry
the
impression
of
being
able
to
read
minds
but
a
moment
later
he
un
derstood
as
Snape
unrolled
today's
issue
of
the
Evening
Prophet
you
were
seen
he
hissed
showing
them
the
headline
fly
ing
ford
anglia
mystifies
muggles
he
began
to
read
aloud
Two
Muggles
in
London
convinced
they
saw
an
old
car
flying
over
the
Post
Office
tower
at
noon
in
Norfolk
Mrs
hetty
Bayliss
while
hanging
out
her
washing
mr.
Angus
Fleet
of
Peebles
reported
to
police
six
or
seven
Muggles
in
all
i
be
lieve
your
father
works
in
the
Misuse
of
Muggle
Artifacts
Office
he
said
looking
up
at
Ron
and
smiling
still
more
nastily
dear
dear
his
own
son
harry
felt
as
though
he'd
just
been
walloped
in
the
stomach
by
one
of
the
mad
tree's
larger
branches
if
anyone
found
out
Mr
weasley
had
bewitched
the
car
he
hadn't
thought
of
that
i
noticed
in
my
search
of
the
park
that
considerable
damage
seems
to
have
been
done
to
a
very
valuable
Whomping
Willow
snape
went
on
that
tree
did
more
damage
to
us
than
we
Ron
blurted
out
silence
snapped
Snape
again
most
unfortunately
you
are
not
in
my
House
and
the
decision
to
expel
you
does
not
rest
with
me
i
shall
go
and
fetch
the
people
who
do
have
that
happy
power
you
will
wait
here
harry
and
Ron
stared
at
each
other
white-faced
harry
didn't
feel
hungry
any
more
he
now
felt
extremely
sick
he
tried
not
to
look
at
a
large
slimy
something
suspended
in
green
liquid
on
a
shelf
behind
snape's
desk
if
Snape
had
gone
to
fetch
Professor
mcGonagall
head
of
Gryffindor
House
they
were
hardly
any
better
off
she
might
be
fairer
than
Snape
but
she
was
still
extremely
strict
ten
minutes
later
Snape
returned
and
sure
enough
it
was
Professor
mcGonagall
who
accompanied
him
harry
had
seen
Professor
mcGonagall
angry
on
several
occasions
but
either
he
had
forgotten
just
how
thin
her
mouth
could
go
or
he
had
never
seen
her
this
angry
before
she
raised
her
wand
the
moment
she
entered
Harry
and
Ron
both
flinched
but
she
merely
pointed
it
at
the
empty
fireplace
where
flames
suddenly
erupted
sit
she
said
and
they
both
backed
into
chairs
by
the
fire
explain
she
said
her
glasses
glinting
ominously
ron
launched
into
the
story
starting
with
the
barrier
at
the
station
refusing
to
let
them
through
so
we
had
no
choice
Professor
we
couldn't
get
on
the
train
why
didn't
you
send
us
a
letter
by
owl
i
believe
you
have
an
owl
professor
McGonagall
said
coldly
to
Harry
harry
gaped
at
her
now
she
said
it
that
seemed
the
obvious
thing
to
have
done
i
I
didn't
think
that
said
Professor
McGonagall
is
obvious
there
was
a
knock
on
the
office
door
and
Snape
now
looking
happier
than
ever
opened
it
there
stood
the
headmaster
Professor
dumbledore
harry's
whole
body
went
numb
dumbledore
was
looking
unusually
grave
he
stared
down
his
very
crooked
nose
at
them
and
harry
suddenly
found
himself
wishing
he
and
Ron
were
still
being
beaten
up
by
the
Whomping
Willow
there
was
a
long
silence
then
Dumbledore
said
Please
explain
why
you
did
this
it
would
have
been
better
if
he
had
shouted
harry
hated
the
disappointment
in
his
voice
for
some
reason
he
was
unable
to
look
dumbledore
in
the
eyes
and
spoke
instead
to
his
knees
he
told
dumbledore
everything
except
that
mr.
Weasley
owned
the
bewitched
car
making
it
sound
as
though
he
and
Ron
had
happened
to
find
a
flying
car
parked
outside
the
station
he
knew
Dumbledore
would
see
through
this
at
once
but
Dumbledore
asked
no
questions
about
the
car
when
Harry
had
finished
he
merely
continued
to
peer
at
them
through
his
spectacles
we'll
go
and
get
our
stuff
said
Ron
in
a
hopeless
sort
of
voice
what
are
you
talking
about
Weasley
barked
Professor
mcGonagall
well
you're
expelling
us
aren't
you
said
Ron
harry
looked
quickly
at
Dumbledore
not
today
mr.
Weasley
said
Dumbledore
but
I
must
impress
upon
both
of
you
the
seriousness
of
what
you
have
done
i
will
be
writing
to
both
your
families
tonight
i
must
also
warn
you
that
if
you
do
anything
like
this
again
I
will
have
no
choice
but
to
expel
you
snape
looked
as
though
Christmas
had
been
canceled
he
cleared
his
throat
and
said
Professor
Dumbledore
these
boys
have
flouted
the
decree
for
the
Restriction
of
Underage
Wizardry
caused
serious
damage
to
an
old
and
valuable
tree
surely
acts
of
this
nature
i
it
will
be
for
Professor
McGonagall
to
decide
on
these
boys
punishments
Severus
said
Dumbledore
calmly
they
are
in
her
house
and
are
therefore
her
responsibility
he
turned
to
Professor
mcGonagall
i
must
go
back
to
the
feast
Minerva
i've
got
to
give
out
a
few
notices
come
Severus
there's
a
delicious-looking
cus
tard
tart
I
want
to
sample
snape
shot
a
look
of
pure
venom
at
Harry
and
Ron
as
he
allowed
himself
to
be
swept
out
of
his
office
leaving
them
alone
with
Pro
fessor
McGonagall
who
was
still
eyeing
them
like
a
wrathful
eagle
you'd
better
get
along
to
the
hospital
wing
Weasley
you're
bleeding
not
much
said
Ron
hastily
wiping
the
cut
over
his
eye
with
his
sleeve
professor
I
wanted
to
watch
my
sister
being
Sorted
the
Sorting
Ceremony
is
over
said
Professor
McGonagall
your
sister
is
also
in
Gryffindor
oh
good
said
Ron
and
speaking
of
Gryffindor
Professor
McGonagall
said
sharply
but
Harry
cut
in
Professor
when
we
took
the
car
term
hadn't
started
so
so
Gryffindor
shouldn't
really
have
points
taken
from
it
should
it
he
finished
watching
her
anxiously
professor
McGonagall
gave
him
a
piercing
look
but
he
was
sure
she
had
almost
smiled
her
mouth
looked
less
thin
anyway
i
will
not
take
any
points
from
Gryffindor
she
said
and
harry's
heart
lightened
considerably
but
you
will
both
get
a
de
tention
it
was
better
than
Harry
had
expected
as
for
dumbledore's
writing
to
the
Dursleys
that
was
nothing
harry
knew
perfectly
well
they'd
just
be
disappointed
that
the
Whomping
Willow
hadn't
squashed
him
flat
professor
McGonagall
raised
her
wand
again
and
pointed
it
at
snape's
desk
a
large
plate
of
sandwiches
two
silver
goblets
and
a
jug
of-iced
pumpkin
juice
appeared
with
a
pop
you
will
eat
in
here
and
then
go
straight
up
to
your
dormitory
she
said
i
must
also
return
to
the
feast
when
the
door
had
closed
behind
her
Ron
let
out
a
long
low
whistle
i
thought
we'd
had
it
he
said
grabbing
a
sandwich
so
did
I
said
Harry
taking
one
too
can
you
believe
our
luck
though
said
Ron
thickly
through
a
mouthful
of
chicken
and
ham
fred
and
George
must've
flown
that
car
five
or
six
times
and
no
Muggle
ever
saw
them
he
swallowed
and
took
another
huge
bite
why
couldn't
we
get
through
the
barrier
harry
shrugged
we'll
have
to
watch
our
step
from
now
on
though
he
said
taking
a
grateful
swig
of
pumpkin
juice
wish
we
could've
gone
up
to
the
feast
she
didn't
want
us
showing
off
said
Ron
sagely
doesn't
want
people
to
think
it's
clever
arriving
by
flying
car
when
they
had
eaten
as
many
sandwiches
as
they
could
the
plate
kept
refilling
itself
they
rose
and
left
the
office
treading
the
familiar
path
to
Gryffindor
Tower
the
castle
was
quiet
it
seemed
that
the
feast
was
over
they
walked
past
muttering
portraits
and
creaking
suits
of
armor
and
climbed
narrow
flights
of
stone
stairs
until
at
last
they
reached
the
passage
where
the
secret
entrance
to
Gryffindor
tower
was
hidden
behind
an
oil
painting
of
a
very
fat
woman
in
a
pink
silk
dress
password
she
said
as
they
approached
er
said
Harry
they
didn't
know
the
new
year's
password
not
having
met
a
gryffindor
prefect
yet
but
help
came
almost
immediately
they
heard
hurrying
feet
behind
them
and
turned
to
see
Hermione
dashing
toward
them
there
you
are
where
have
you
been
the
most
ridiculous
rumors
someone
said
you'd
been
expelled
for
crashing
a
flying
car
well
we
haven't
been
expelled
Harry
assured
her
you're
not
telling
me
you
did
fly
here
said
Hermione
sounding
almost
as
severe
as
Professor
McGonagall
skip
the
lecture
said
Ron
impatiently
and
tell
us
the
new
password
it's
wattlebird
said
Hermione
impatiently
but
that's
not
the
point
her
words
were
cut
short
however
as
the
portrait
of
the
fat
lady
swung
open
and
there
was
a
sudden
storm
of
clapping
it
looked
as
though
the
whole
of
Gryffindor
House
was
still
awake
packed
into
the
circular
common
room
standing
on
the
lopsided
tables
and
squashy
armchairs
waiting
for
them
to
arrive
arms
reached
through
the
portrait
hole
to
pull
Harry
and
Ron
inside
leaving
Hermione
to
scramble
in
after
then-t
brilliant
yelled
Lee
Jordan
inspired
what
an
entrance
flying
a
car
right
into
the
Whomping
Willow
people'll
be
talking
about
that
one
for
years
good
for
you
said
a
fifth
year
Harry
had
never
spoken
to
someone
was
patting
him
on
the
back
as
though
he'd
just
won
a
marathon
fred
and
George
pushed
their
way
to
the
front
of
the
crowd
and
said
together
Why
couldn't
we've
come
in
the
car
eh
ron
was
scarlet
in
the
face
grinning
embarrassedly
but
Harry
could
see
one
person
who
didn't
look
happy
at
all
percy
was
visible
over
the
heads
of
some
excited
first
years
and
he
seemed
to
be
trying
to
get
near
enough
to
start
telling
them
off
harry
nudged
Ron
in
the
ribs
and
nodded
in
percy's
direction
ron
got
the
point
at
once
got
to
get
upstairs
bit
tired
he
said
and
the
two
of
them
started
pushing
their
way
toward
the
door
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
which
led
to
a
spiral
staircase
and
the
dormitories
night
Harry
called
back
to
Hermione
who
was
wearing
a
scowl
just
like
percy's
they
managed
to
get
to
the
other
side
of
the
common
room
still
having
their
backs
slapped
and
gained
the
peace
of
the
staircase
they
hurried
up
it
right
to
the
top
and
at
last
reached
the
door
of
their
old
dormitory
which
now
had
a
sign
on
it
saying
second
years
they
entered
the
familiar
circular
room
with
its
five
four-posters
hung
with
red
velvet
and
its
high
narrow
windows
their
trunks
had
been
brought
up
for
them
and
stood
at
the
ends
of
their
beds
ron
grinned
guiltily
at
Harry
i
know
I
shouldn't've
enjoyed
that
or
anything
but
the
dormitory
door
flew
open
and
in
came
the
other
second
year
gryffindor

Seamus

Neville

next
day
however
Harry
barely
grinned
once
things
started
to
go
downhill
from
breakfast
in
the
Great
Hall
the
four
long
house
tables
were
laden
with
tureens
of
porridge
plates
of
kippers
mountains
of
toast
and
dishes
of
eggs
and
bacon
beneath
the
enchanted
ceiling
today
a
dull
cloudy
gray
harry
and
Ron
sat
down
at
the
Gryffindor
table
next
to
Hermione
who
had
her
copy
of
Voyages
with
Vampires
propped
open
against
a
milk
jug
there
was
a
slight
stiffness
in
the
way
she
said
Morning
which
told
Harry
that
she
was
still
disapproving
of
the
way
they
had
arrived
neville
Longbottom
on
the
other
hand
greeted
them
cheerfully
neville
was
a
round-faced
and
accident-prone
boy
with
the
worst
memory
of
anyone
Harry
had
ever
met
mail's
due
any
minute
I
think
gran's
sending
a
few
things
I
forgot
harry
had
only
just
started
his
porridge
when
sure
enough
there
was
a
rushing
sound
overhead
and
a
hundred
or
so
owls
streamed
in
circling
the
hall
and
dropping
letters
and
packages
into
the
chattering
crowd
a
big
lumpy
package
bounced
off
neville's
head
and
a
second
later
something
large
and
gray
fell
into
hermione's
jug
spraying
them
all
with
milk
and
feathers
enrol
said
Ron
pulling
the
bedraggled
owl
out
by
the
feet
errol
slumped
unconscious
onto
the
table
his
legs
in
the
air
and
a
damp
red
envelope
in
his
beak
oh
no
Ron
gasped
it's
all
right
he's
still
alive
said
Hermione
prodding
Errol
gently
with
the
tip
of
her
finger
it's
not
that
it's
that
ron
was
pointing
at
the
red
envelope
it
looked
quite
ordinary
to
harry
but
Ron
and
Neville
were
both
looking
at
it
as
though
they
expected
it
to
explode
what's
the
matter
said
Harry
she's
she's
sent
me
a
Howler
said
Ron
faintly
you'd
better
open
it
Ron
said
Neville
in
a
timid
whisper
it'll
be
worse
if
you
don't
My
gran
sent
me
one
once
and
I
ignored
it
and
he
gulped
it
was
horrible
harry
looked
from
their
petrified
faces
to
the
red
envelope
what's
a
Howler
he
said
but
ron's
whole
attention
was
fixed
on
the
letter
which
had
begun
to
smoke
at
the
corners
open
it
Neville
urged
it'll
all
be
over
in
a
few
minutes
ron
stretched
out
a
shaking
hand
eased
the
envelope
from
errol's
beak
and
slit
it
open
neville
stuffed
his
fingers
in
his
ears
a
split
second
later
Harry
knew
why
he
thought
for
a
moment
it
had
exploded
a
roar
of
sound
fiIled
the
huge
hall
shaking
dust
from
the
ceiling
E
car
I
wo
uldn't
have
been
S
urstealing
the
prised
if
they'd
expelled
you
you
wait
till
I
get
hold
of
you
I
don't
suppose
you
stopped
to
think
what
your
fatherand
I
went
through
when
we
saw
it
was
gone
mrs
weasleys
yells
a
hundred
times
louder
than
usual
made
the
plates
and
spoons
rattle
on
the
table
and
echoed
deafeningly
off
the
stone
walls
people
throughout
the
hall
were
swiveling
around
to
see
who
had
received
the
Howler
and
Ron
sank
so
low
in
his
chair
that
only
his
crimson
forehead
could
be
seen
letter
from
dumbledore
last
night
I
thought
your
father
would
die
of
shame
we
didn't
bring
you
up
to
behave
like
this
you
and
harry
could
both
have
died
harry
had
been
wondering
when
his
name
was
going
to
crop
up
he
tried
very
hard
to
look
as
though
he
couldn't
hear
the
voice
that
was
making
his
eardrums
throb
absolutelydisgusted
your
father's
facing
an
inquiry
at
work
it's
entirely
your
fault
and
if
you
put
another
toe
out
of
line
we'll
bring
you
straight
back
home
a
ringing
silence
fell
the
red
envelope
