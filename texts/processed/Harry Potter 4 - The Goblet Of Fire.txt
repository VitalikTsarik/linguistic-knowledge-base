harry
potter
and
the
goblet
of
fire
chapter
one
the
riddle
house
the
villagers
of
Little
Hangleron
still
called
it
the
Riddle
House
even
though
it
had
been
many
years
since
the
Riddle
family
had
lived
there
it
stood
on
a
hill
overlooking
the
village
some
of
its
windows
boarded
tiles
missing
from
its
roof
and
ivy
spreading
unchecked
over
its
face
once
a
finelooking
manor
and
easily
the
largest
and
grandest
building
for
miles
around
the
Riddle
House
was
now
damp
derelict
and
unoccupied
the
Little
Hagletons
all
agreed
that
the
old
house
was
creepy
half
a
century
ago
something
strange
and
horrible
had
happened
there
something
that
the
older
inhabitants
of
the
village
still
liked
to
discuss
when
topics
for
gossip
were
scarce
the
story
had
been
picked
over
so
many
times
and
had
been
embroidered
in
so
many
places
that
nobody
was
quite
sure
what
the
truth
was
anymore
every
version
of
the
tale
however
started
in
the
same
place
Fifty
years
before
at
daybreak
on
a
fine
summer's
morning
when
the
Riddle
House
had
still
been
well
kept
and
impressive
a
maid
had
entered
the
drawing
room
to
find
all
three
Riddles
dead
the
maid
had
run
screaming
down
the
hill
into
the
village
and
roused
as
many
people
as
she
could
lying
there
with
their
eyes
wide
open
cold
as
ice
still
in
their
dinner
things
the
police
were
summoned
and
the
whole
of
Little
Hangleton
had
seethed
with
shocked
curiosity
and
illdisguised
excitement
nobody
wasted
their
breath
pretending
to
feel
very
sad
about
the
Riddles
for
they
had
been
most
unpopular
elderly
mr.
and
Mrs
riddle
had
been
rich
snobbish
and
rude
and
their
grownup
son
Tom
had
been
if
anything
worse
all
the
villagers
cared
about
was
the
identity
of
their
murderer
for
plainly
three
apparently
healthy
people
did
not
all
drop
dead
of
natural
causes
on
the
same
night
the
Hanged
Man
the
village
pub
did
a
roaring
trade
that
night
the
whole
village
seemed
to
have
turned
out
to
discuss
the
murders
they
were
rewarded
for
leaving
their
firesides
when
the
Riddles
cook
arrived
dramatically
in
their
midst
and
announced
to
the
suddenly
silent
pub
that
a
man
called
Frank
Bryce
had
just
been
arrested
frank
cried
several
people
never
frank
Bryce
was
the
Riddles
gardener
he
lived
alone
in
a
rundown
cottage
on
the
grounds
of
the
Riddle
House
frank
had
come
back
from
the
war
with
a
very
stiff
leg
and
a
great
dislike
of
crowds
and
loud
noises
and
had
been
working
for
the
Riddles
ever
since
there
was
a
rush
to
buy
the
cook
drinks
and
hear
more
details
always
thought
he
was
odd
she
told
the
eagerly
listening
villagers
after
her
fourth
sherry
unfriendly
like
i'm
sure
if
i've
offered
him
a
cuppa
once
i've
offered
it
a
hundred
times
never
wanted
to
mix
he
didn't
ah
now
said
a
woman
at
the
bar
he
had
a
hard
war
Frank
he
likes
the
quiet
life
that's
no
reason
to
who
else
had
a
key
to
the
back
door
then
barked
the
cook
there's
been
a
spare
key
hanging
in
the
gardener's
cottage
far
back
as
I
can
remember
nobody
forced
the
door
last
night
no
broken
windows
all
Frank
had
to
do
was
creep
up
to
the
big
house
while
we
was
all
sleeping
the
villagers
exchanged
dark
looks
i
always
thought
that
he
had
a
nasty
look
about
him
right
enough
grunted
a
man
at
the
bar
war
turned
him
funny
if
you
ask
me
said
the
landlord
told
you
I
wouldn't
like
to
get
on
the
wrong
side
of
Frank
didn't
I
Dot
said
an
excited
woman
in
the
corner
horrible
temper
said
Dot
nodding
fervently
i
remember
when
he
was
a
kid
by
the
following
morning
hardly
anyone
in
Little
Hangleton
doubted
that
Frank
Bryce
had
killed
the
Riddles
but
over
in
the
neighboring
town
of
Great
Hangleton
in
the
dark
and
dingy
police
station
Frank
was
stubbornly
repeating
again
and
again
that
he
was
innocent
and
that
the
only
person
he
had
seen
near
the
house
on
the
day
of
the
Riddles
deaths
had
been
a
teenage
boy
a
stranger
darkhaired
and
pale
nobody
else
in
the
village
had
seen
any
such
boy
and
the
police
were
quite
sure
Frank
had
invented
him
then
just
when
things
were
looking
very
serious
for
Frank
the
report
on
the
Riddles
bodies
came
back
and
changed
everything
the
police
had
never
read
an
odder
report
a
team
of
doctors
had
examined
the
bodies
and
had
concluded
that
none
of
the
Riddles
had
been
poisoned
stabbed
shot
strangles
suffocated
or
as
far
as
they
could
tell
harmed
at
all
in
fact
the
report
continued
in
a
tone
of
unmistakable
bewilderment
the
Riddles
all
appeared
to
be
in
perfet
health
apart
from
the
fact
that
they
were
all
dead
the
doctors
did
note
as
though
determined
to
find
something
wrong
with
the
bodies
that
each
of
the
Riddles
had
a
look
of
terror
upon
his
or
her
face
but
as
the
frustrated
police
said
whoever
heard
of
three
people
being
frightened
to
death
as
there
was
no
proof
that
the
Riddles
had
been
murdered
at
all
the
police
were
forced
to
let
Frank
go
the
Riddles
were
buried
in
the
Little
Hangleton
churchyard
and
their
graves
remained
objects
of
curiosity
for
a
while
to
everyone's
surprise
and
amid
a
cloud
of
suspicion
Frank
Bryce
returned
to
his
cottage
on
the
grounds
of
the
Riddle
House
s
far
as
i'm
concerned
he
killed
them
and
I
don't
care
what
the
police
say
said
Dot
in
the
Hanged
Man
and
if
he
had
any
decency
he'd
leave
here
knowing
as
how
we
knows
he
did
it
but
Frank
did
not
leave
he
stayed
to
tend
the
garden
for
the
next
family
who
lived
in
the
Riddle
House
and
then
the
next
for
neither
family
stayed
long
perhaps
it
was
partly
because
of
Frank
that
the
new
owners
said
there
was
a
nasty
feeling
about
the
place
which
in
the
absence
of
inhabitants
started
to
fall
into
disrepair
the
wealthy
man
who
owned
the
Riddle
House
these
days
neither
lived
there
nor
put
it
to
any
use
they
said
in
the
village
that
he
kept
it
for
tax
reasons
though
nobody
was
very
clear
what
these
might
be
the
wealthy
owner
continued
to
pay
Frank
to
do
the
gardening
however
frank
was
nearing
his
seventyseventh
birthday
now
very
deaf
his
bad
leg
stiffer
than
ever
but
could
be
seen
pottering
around
the
flower
beds
in
fine
weather
even
though
the
weeds
were
starting
to
creep
up
on
him
try
as
he
might
to
suppress
them
weeds
were
not
the
only
things
Frank
had
to
contend
with
either
boys
from
the
village
made
a
habit
of
throwing
stones
through
the
windows
of
the
Riddle
House
they
rode
their
bicycles
over
the
lawns
Frank
worked
so
hard
to
keep
smooth
once
or
twice
they
broke
into
the
old
house
for
a
dare
they
knew
that
old
frank's
devotion
to
the
house
and
the
grounds
amounted
almost
to
an
obsession
and
it
amused
them
to
see
him
limping
across
the
garden
brandishing
his
stick
and
yelling
croakily
at
them
frank
for
his
part
believed
the
boys
tormented
him
because
they
like
their
parents
and
grandparents
though
him
a
murderer
so
when
Frank
awoke
one
night
in
August
and
saw
something
very
odd
up
at
the
old
house
he
merely
assumed
that
the
boys
had
gone
one
step
further
in
their
attempts
to
punish
him
it
was
frank's
bad
leg
that
woke
him
it
was
paining
him
worse
than
ever
in
his
old
age
he
got
up
and
limped
downstairs
into
the
kitchen
with
the
idea
of
refilling
his
hotwater
bottle
to
ease
the
stiffness
in
his
knee
standing
at
the
sink
filling
the
kettle
he
looked
up
at
the
Riddle
House
and
saw
lights
glimmering
in
its
upper
windows
frank
knew
at
once
what
was
going
on
the
boys
had
broken
into
the
house
again
and
judging
by
the
flickering
quality
of
the
light
they
had
started
a
fire
frank
had
no
telephone
in
any
case
he
had
deeply
mistrusted
the
police
ever
since
they
had
taken
him
in
for
questioning
about
the
Riddles
deaths
he
put
down
the
kettle
at
once
hurried
back
upstairs
as
fast
as
his
bad
leg
would
allow
and
was
soon
back
in
his
kitchen
fully
dressed
and
removing
a
rusty
old
key
from
its
hook
by
the
door
he
picked
up
his
walking
stick
which
was
propped
against
the
wall
and
set
off
into
the
night
the
front
door
of
the
Riddle
House
bore
no
sign
of
being
forced
nor
did
any
of
the
windows
frank
limped
around
to
the
back
of
the
house
until
he
reached
a
door
almost
completely
hidden
by
ivy
took
out
the
old
key
put
it
into
the
lock
and
opened
the
door
noiselessly
he
let
himself
into
the
cavernous
kitchen
frank
had
not
entered
it
for
many
years
nevertheless
although
it
was
very
dark
he
remembered
where
the
door
into
the
hall
was
and
he
groped
his
way
towards
it
his
nostrils
full
of
the
smell
of
decay
ears
pricked
for
any
sound
of
footsteps
or
voices
from
overhead
he
reached
the
hall
which
was
a
little
lighter
owing
to
the
large
mullioned
windows
on
either
side
of
the
front
door
and
started
to
climb
the
stairs
blessing
the
dust
that
lay
thick
upon
the
stone
because
it
muffled
the
sound
of
his
feet
and
stick
on
the
landing
Frank
turned
right
and
saw
at
once
where
the
intruders
were
At
the
every
end
of
the
passage
a
door
stood
ajar
and
a
flickering
light
shone
through
the
gap
casting
a
long
sliver
of
gold
across
the
black
floor
frank
edged
closer
and
closer
he
was
able
to
see
a
narrow
slice
of
the
room
beyond
the
fire
he
now
saw
had
been
lit
in
the
grate
this
surprised
him
then
he
stopped
moving
and
listened
intently
for
a
man's
voice
spoke
within
the
room
it
sounded
timid
and
fearful
there
is
a
little
more
in
the
bottle
My
Lord
if
you
are
still
hungry
later
said
a
second
voice
this
too
belonged
to
a
man
but
it
was
strangely
highpitched
and
cold
as
a
sudden
blast
of
icy
wind
something
about
that
voice
made
the
sparse
hairs
on
the
back
of
frank's
neck
stand
up
move
me
closer
to
the
fire
Wormtail
frank
turned
his
right
ear
toward
the
door
the
better
to
hear
there
came
the
clink
of
a
bottle
being
put
down
upon
some
hard
surface
and
then
the
dull
scraping
noise
of
a
heavy
chair
being
dragged
across
the
floor
frank
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
small
man
his
back
to
the
door
pushing
the
chair
into
place
he
was
wearing
a
long
black
cloak
and
there
was
a
bald
patch
at
the
back
of
his
head
then
he
went
out
of
sight
again
where
is
Nagini
said
the
cold
voice
i
I
don't
know
My
Lord
said
the
first
voice
nervously
she
set
out
to
explore
the
house
I
think
you
will
milk
her
before
we
retire
Wormtail
said
the
second
voice
i
will
need
feeding
in
the
night
the
journey
has
tired
me
greatly
brow
furrowed
Frank
inclined
his
good
ear
still
closer
to
the
door
listening
very
hard
there
was
a
pause
and
then
the
man
called
Wormtail
spoke
again
my
Lord
may
I
ask
how
long
we
are
going
to
stay
here
a
week
said
the
cold
voice
perhapse
longer
the
place
is
moderately
comfortable
and
the
plan
cannot
proceed
yet
it
would
be
foolish
to
act
before
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
is
over
frank
inserted
a
gnarled
finger
into
his
ear
and
rotated
it
owing
no
doubt
to
a
buildup
of
earwax
he
had
heard
the
word
Quidditch
which
was
not
a
word
at
all
the
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
My
Lord
said
Wormtail
Frank
dug
his
finger
still
more
vigorously
into
his
ear
Forgive
me
but
I
do
not
understand
why
should
we
wait
until
the
World
Cup
is
over
because
fool
at
this
very
moment
wizards
are
pouring
into
the
country
from
all
over
the
world
and
every
meddler
from
the
Ministry
of
Magic
will
be
on
duty
on
the
watch
for
signs
of
ususual
activity
checking
and
doublechecking
identities
they
will
be
obsessed
with
security
lest
the
Muggles
notice
anything
so
we
wait
frank
stopped
trying
to
clear
out
his
ear
he
had
distinctly
heard
the
words
Ministry
of
Magic
wizards
and
Muggles
plainly
each
of
these
expressions
meant
something
secret
and
Frank
could
think
of
only
two
sorts
of
people
who
would
speak
in
code
spies
and
criminals
frank
tightened
his
hold
on
his
walking
stick
once
more
and
listened
more
closely
still
your
Lordship
is
still
determined
then
wormtail
said
quietly
certainly
I
am
determined
Wormtail
there
was
a
note
of
menace
in
the
cold
voice
now
a
slight
pause
followed
and
the
Wormtail
spoke
the
words
tumbling
from
him
in
a
rush
as
though
he
was
forcing
himself
to
say
this
before
he
lost
his
nerve
it
could
be
done
without
Harry
Potter
My
Lord
another
pause
more
protracted
and
then
Without
Harry
Potter
breathed
the
second
voice
softly
i
see
my
Lord
I
do
not
say
this
out
of
concern
for
the
boy
said
Wormtail
his
voice
rising
squeakily
the
boy
is
nothing
to
me
nothing
at
all
it
is
merely
that
if
we
were
to
use
another
witch
or
wizard
any
wizard
the
thing
could
be
done
so
much
more
quickly
if
you
allowed
me
to
leave
you
for
a
short
while
you
know
that
I
can
disguise
myself
most
effectively
I
could
be
back
here
in
as
little
as
two
days
with
a
suitable
person
i
could
use
another
wizard
said
the
cold
voice
softly
that
is
true
my
Lord
it
makes
sense
said
Wormtail
sounding
thoroughly
relieved
now
laying
hands
on
Harry
Potter
would
be
so
difficult
he
is
so
well
protected
and
so
you
volunteer
to
go
and
fetch
me
a
substitute
i
wonder
perhaps
the
task
of
nursing
me
has
become
wearisome
for
you
Wormtail
could
this
suggestion
of
abandoning
the
plan
be
nothing
more
than
an
attempt
to
desert
me
my
Lord
i
I
have
no
wish
to
leave
you
none
at
all
do
not
lie
to
me
hissed
the
second
voice
i
can
always
tell
Wormtail
you
are
regretting
that
you
ever
returned
to
me
i
revolt
you
i
see
you
flinch
when
you
look
at
me
feel
you
shudder
when
you
touch
me
no
my
devotion
to
Your
Lordship
your
devotion
is
nothing
more
than
cowardice
you
would
not
be
here
if
you
had
anywhere
else
to
go
how
am
I
to
survive
without
you
when
I
need
feeding
every
few
hours
who
is
to
milk
Nagini
but
you
seem
so
much
stronger
My
Lord
liar
breathed
the
second
voice
i
am
no
stronger
and
a
few
days
alone
would
be
enough
to
rob
me
of
the
little
health
I
have
regained
under
your
clumsy
care
silence
wormtail
who
had
been
sputtering
incoherently
fell
silent
at
once
for
a
few
seconds
Frank
could
hear
nothing
but
the
fire
crackling
the
the
second
man
spoke
once
more
in
a
whisper
that
was
almost
a
hiss
i
have
my
reasons
for
using
the
boy
as
I
have
already
explained
to
you
and
I
will
use
no
other
i
have
waited
thirteen
years
a
few
more
months
will
make
no
difference
as
for
the
protection
surrounding
the
boy
I
believe
my
plan
will
be
effective
all
that
is
needed
is
a
little
courage
from
you
Wormtail
courage
you
will
find
unless
you
wish
to
feel
the
full
extent
of
Lord
voldermort's
wrath
my
Lord
I
must
speak
said
Wormtail
panic
in
his
voice
now
all
through
our
journey
I
have
gone
over
the
plan
in
my
head
My
Lord
Bertha
jorkin's
disappearance
will
not
go
unnoticed
for
long
and
if
we
proceed
if
I
murder
if
whispered
the
second
voice
if
if
you
follow
the
plan
Wormtail
the
Ministry
need
never
know
that
anyone
else
has
died
you
will
do
it
quietly
and
without
fuss
I
only
wish
that
i
could
do
it
myself
but
in
my
present
condition
come
Wormtail
one
more
death
and
our
path
to
Harry
Potter
is
clear
i
am
not
asking
you
to
do
it
alone
by
that
time
my
faithful
serant
will
have
rejoined
us
i
am
a
faithful
servant
said
Wormtail
the
merest
trace
of
sullenness
in
his
voice
wormtail
I
need
somebody
with
brains
somebody
whose
loyalty
has
never
wavered
and
you
unfortunately
fulfill
neither
requirement
i
found
you
said
Wormtail
and
there
was
definitely
a
sulky
edge
to
his
voice
now
i
was
the
one
who
found
you
i
brought
you
Bertha
Jorkins
that
is
true
said
the
second
man
sounding
amused
a
stroke
of
brilliance
I
would
not
have
thought
possible
from
you
Wormtail
though
if
truth
be
told
you
were
not
aware
how
useful
she
would
be
when
you
caught
her
were
you
i
I
thought
she
might
be
useful
My
Lord
liar
said
the
second
voice
again
the
cruel
amusement
more
pronounced
than
ever
however
I
do
not
deny
that
her
information
was
invaluable
without
it
I
could
never
have
formed
our
plan
and
for
that
you
will
have
your
reward
Wormtail
i
will
allow
you
to
perform
an
essential
task
for
me
one
that
many
of
my
followers
would
give
their
right
hands
to
perform
rreally
My
Lord
what
wormtail
sounded
terrified
again
ah
Wormtail
you
don't
want
me
to
spoil
the
surprise
your
part
will
come
at
the
very
end
but
I
promise
you
you
will
have
the
honor
of
being
just
as
useful
as
Bertha
Jorkins
you
you
wormtail's
voice
suddenly
sounded
hoarse
as
though
his
mouth
had
gone
very
dry
you
are
going
to
kill
me
too
wormtail
Wormtail
said
the
cold
voice
silkily
why
would
I
kill
you
i
killed
Bertha
because
I
had
to
she
was
fit
for
nothing
after
my
questioning
quite
useless
in
any
case
awkward
questions
would
have
been
asked
if
she
had
gone
back
to
the
Ministry
with
the
news
that
she
had
met
you
on
her
holidays
wizards
who
are
supposed
to
be
dead
would
do
well
not
to
run
into
Ministry
of
Magic
witches
at
wayside
inns
wormtail
muttered
something
so
quietly
that
Frank
could
not
hear
it
but
it
made
the
second
man
laugh
an
entirely
mirthless
laugh
cold
as
his
speech
we
could
have
modified
her
memory
but
Memory
Charms
can
be
broken
by
a
powerful
wizard
as
I
proved
when
I
questioned
her
it
would
be
an
insult
to
her
memory
not
to
use
the
information
I
extracted
from
her
Wormtail
out
in
the
corridor
Frank
suddenly
became
aware
that
the
hand
gripping
his
walking
stick
was
slippery
with
sweat
the
man
with
the
cold
voice
had
killed
a
woman
he
was
talking
about
it
without
any
kind
of
remorse
with
amusement
he
was
dangerous
a
madman
and
he
was
planning
more
murders
this
boy
Harry
Potter
whoever
he
was
was
in
danger
Frank
knew
what
he
must
do
now
if
ever
was
the
time
to
go
to
the
police
he
would
creep
out
of
the
house
and
head
straight
for
the
telephone
box
in
the
village
but
the
cold
voice
was
speaking
again
and
Frank
remained
where
he
was
frozen
to
the
spot
listening
with
all
his
might
one
more
murder
my
faithful
servant
at
Hogwarts
harry
Potter
is
as
good
as
mine
Wormtail
it
is
decided
there
will
be
no
more
argument
but
quiet
i
think
I
hear
Nagini
and
the
second
man's
voice
changed
he
started
making
noises
such
as
Frank
had
never
heard
before
he
was
hissing
and
spitting
without
drawing
breath
frank
thought
he
must
be
having
some
sort
of
fit
or
seizure
and
then
Frank
heard
movement
behind
him
in
the
dark
passageway
he
turned
to
look
and
found
himself
paralyzed
with
fright
something
was
slithering
toward
him
along
the
dark
corridor
floor
and
as
it
drew
nearer
to
the
sliver
of
firelight
he
realized
with
a
thrill
of
terror
that
it
was
a
gigantic
snake
at
least
twelve
feet
long
horrified
transfixed
Frank
stared
as
its
undulating
body
cut
a
wide
curving
track
through
the
thick
dust
on
the
floor
coming
closer
and
closer
What
was
he
to
do
the
only
means
of
escape
was
into
the
room
where
the
two
men
sat
plotting
murder
yet
if
he
stayed
where
he
was
the
snake
would
surely
kill
him
But
before
he
had
made
his
decision
the
snake
was
level
with
him
and
then
incredibly
miraculously
it
was
passing
it
was
following
the
spitting
hissing
noises
made
by
the
cold
voice
beyond
the
door
and
in
seconds
the
tip
of
its
diamondpatterned
tail
had
vanished
through
the
gap
there
was
sweat
on
frank's
forehead
now
and
the
hand
on
the
walking
stick
was
trembling
inside
the
room
the
cold
voice
was
continuing
to
hiss
and
Frank
was
visited
by
a
strange
idea
an
impossible
idea
this
man
could
talk
to
snakes
frank
didn't
understand
what
was
going
on
he
wanted
more
than
anything
to
be
back
in
his
bed
with
his
hotwater
bottle
the
problem
was
that
his
legs
didn't
seem
to
want
to
move
as
he
stood
there
shaking
and
trying
to
master
himself
the
cold
voice
switched
abruptly
to
English
again
nagini
has
interesting
news
Wormtail
it
said
inindeed
My
Lord
said
Wormtail
indeed
yes
said
the
voice
According
to
Nagini
there
is
an
old
Muggle
standing
right
outside
this
room
listening
to
every
word
we
say
frank
didn't
have
a
chance
to
hide
himself
there
were
footsteps
and
then
the
door
of
the
room
was
flung
wide
open
a
short
balding
man
with
graying
hair
a
pointed
nose
and
small
watery
eyes
stood
before
Frank
a
mixture
of
fear
and
alarm
in
his
face
invite
him
inside
Wormtail
where
are
your
manners
the
cold
voice
was
coming
from
the
ancient
armchair
before
the
fire
but
Frank
couldn't
see
the
speaker
the
snake
on
the
other
hand
was
curled
up
on
the
rotting
hearth
rug
like
some
horrible
travesty
of
a
pet
dog
wormtail
beckoned
Frank
into
the
room
though
still
deeply
shaken
Frank
took
a
firmer
grip
on
his
walking
stick
and
limped
over
the
threshold
the
fire
was
the
only
source
of
light
in
the
room
it
cast
long
spidery
shadows
upon
the
walls
frank
stared
at
the
back
of
the
armchair
the
man
inside
it
seemed
to
be
even
smaller
than
his
servant
for
Frank
couldn't
even
see
the
back
of
his
head
you
heard
everything
Muggle
said
the
cold
voice
what's
that
you're
calling
me
said
Frank
defiantly
for
now
that
he
was
inside
the
room
now
that
the
time
had
come
for
some
sort
of
action
he
felt
braver
it
had
always
been
so
in
the
war
i
am
calling
you
a
Muggle
said
the
voice
coolly
it
means
that
you
are
not
a
wizard
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
by
wizard
said
Frank
his
voice
growing
steadier
all
I
know
is
i've
heard
enough
to
interest
the
police
tonight
I
have
you've
done
murder
and
you're
planning
more
and
i'll
tell
youthis
too
he
added
on
a
sudden
inspiration
my
wife
knows
i'm
up
here
and
if
I
don't
come
back
you
have
no
wife
said
te
cold
voice
very
quietly
nobody
knows
you
are
here
you
told
nobody
that
you
were
coming
do
not
lie
to
Lord
Voldemort
Muggle
for
he
knows
he
always
knows
is
that
right
said
Frank
roughly
lord
is
it
well
I
don't
think
much
of
your
manners
My
Lord
turn
round
and
face
me
like
a
man
why
don't
you
but
I
am
not
a
man
Muggle
said
the
cold
voice
barely
audible
now
over
the
crackling
of
the
flames
i
am
much
much
more
than
a
man
however
why
not
i
will
face
you
wormtail
come
turn
my
chair
around
the
servant
gave
a
whimper
you
heard
me
Wormtail
slowly
with
his
face
screwed
up
as
though
he
would
rather
have
done
anything
than
approach
his
master
and
the
hearth
rug
where
the
snake
lay
the
small
man
walked
forward
and
began
to
turn
the
chair
the
snake
lifted
its
ugly
triangular
head
and
hissed
slightly
as
the
legs
of
the
chair
snagged
on
its
rug
and
then
the
chair
was
facing
Frank
and
he
saw
what
was
sitting
in
it
his
walking
stick
fell
to
the
floor
with
a
clatter
he
opened
his
mouth
and
let
out
a
scream
he
was
screaming
so
loudly
that
he
never
heard
the
words
the
thing
in
the
chair
spoke
as
it
raised
a
wand
there
was
a
flash
of
green
light
a
rushing
sound
and
Frank
Bryce
crumpled
he
was
dead
before
he
hit
the
floor
two
hundred
miles
away
the
boy
called
Harry
Potter
woke
with
a
start
chapter
two
the
scar
harry
lay
flat
on
his
back
breathing
hard
as
though
he
had
been
running
he
had
awoken
from
a
vivid
dream
with
his
hands
pressed
over
his
face
the
old
scar
on
his
forehead
which
was
shaped
like
a
bolt
of
lightning
was
burning
beneath
his
fingers
as
though
someone
had
just
pressed
a
whitehot
wire
to
his
skin
he
sat
up
one
hand
still
on
his
scar
the
other
hand
reaching
out
in
the
darkness
for
his
glasses
which
were
on
the
bedside
table
he
put
them
on
and
his
bedroom
came
into
clearer
focus
lit
by
a
faint
misty
orange
light
that
was
filtering
through
the
curtains
from
the
street
lamp
outside
the
window
harry
ran
his
fingers
over
the
scar
again
it
was
still
painful
he
turned
on
the
lamp
beside
him
scrambled
out
of
bed
crossed
the
room
opened
his
wardrobe
and
peered
into
the
mirror
on
the
inside
of
the
door
a
skinny
boy
of
fourteen
looked
back
at
him
his
bright
green
eyes
puzzled
under
his
untidy
black
hair
he
examined
the
lightningbolt
scar
of
his
reflection
more
closely
it
looked
normal
but
it
was
still
stinging
harry
tried
to
recall
what
he
had
been
dreaming
about
before
he
had
awoken
it
had
seemed
so
real
there
had
been
two
people
he
knew
and
one
he
didn't
he
concentrated
hard
frowning
trying
to
remember
the
dim
picture
of
a
darkened
room
came
to
him
there
had
been
a
snake
on
a
hearth
rug
a
small
man
called
Peter
nicknamed
Wormtail
and
a
cold
high
voice
the
voice
of
Lord
Voldemort
harry
felt
as
though
an
ice
cube
had
slipped
down
into
his
stomach
at
the
very
thought
he
closed
his
eyes
tightly
and
tried
to
remember
what
Voldemort
had
looked
like
but
it
was
impossible
all
Harry
knew
was
that
at
the
moment
when
voldemort's
chair
had
swung
around
and
he
Harry
had
seen
what
was
sitting
in
it
he
had
felt
a
spasm
of
horror
which
had
awoken
him
or
had
that
been
the
pain
in
his
scar
and
who
had
the
old
man
been
for
there
had
definitely
been
an
old
man
Harry
had
watched
him
fall
to
the
ground
it
was
all
becoming
confused
harry
put
his
face
into
his
hands
blocking
out
his
bedroom
trying
to
hold
on
to
the
picture
of
that
dimly
lit
room
but
it
was
like
trying
to
keep
water
in
his
cupped
hands
the
details
were
now
trickling
away
as
fast
as
he
tried
to
hold
on
to
them
voldemort
and
Wormtail
had
been
talking
about
someone
they
had
killed
though
Harry
could
not
remember
the
name
and
they
had
been
plotting
to
kill
someone
else
him
harry
took
his
face
out
of
his
hands
opened
his
eyes
and
stared
around
his
bedroom
as
though
expecting
to
see
something
unusual
there
as
it
happened
there
was
an
extraordinary
number
of
unusual
things
in
this
room
a
large
wooden
trunk
stood
open
at
the
foot
of
his
bed
revealing
a
cauldron
broomstick
black
robes
and
assorted
spellbooks
rolls
of
parchment
littered
that
part
of
his
desk
that
was
not
taken
up
by
the
large
empty
cage
in
which
his
snowy
owl
Hedwig
usually
perched
on
the
floor
beside
his
bed
a
book
lay
open
Harry
had
been
reading
it
before
he
fell
asleep
last
night
the
pictures
in
this
book
were
all
moving
men
in
bright
orange
robes
were
zooming
in
and
out
of
sight
on
broomsticks
throwing
a
red
ball
to
one
another
harry
walked
over
to
the
book
picked
it
up
and
watched
on
of
the
wizards
score
a
spectacular
goal
by
putting
the
ball
through
a
fiftyfoothigh
hoop
then
he
snapped
the
book
shut
even
Quidditch
in
harry's
opinion
the
best
sport
in
the
world
couldn't
distract
him
at
the
moment
he
placed
Flying
with
the
Cannons
on
his
bedside
table
crossed
to
the
window
and
drew
back
the
curtains
to
survey
the
street
below
privet
Drive
looked
exactly
as
a
respectable
suburban
street
would
be
expected
to
look
inthe
early
hours
of
Saturday
morning
all
the
curtains
were
closed
as
far
as
Harry
could
see
through
the
darkness
there
wasn't
a
living
creature
in
sight
not
even
a
cat
and
yet
and
yet
harry
went
restlessly
back
to
the
bed
and
sat
down
on
it
running
a
finger
over
his
scar
again
it
wasn't
the
pain
that
bothered
him
Harry
was
no
stranger
to
pain
and
injury
he
had
lost
all
the
bones
from
his
right
arm
once
and
had
them
painfully
regrown
in
a
night
the
same
arm
had
been
pierced
by
a
venemous
footlong
fang
not
long
afterward
only
last
year
Harry
had
fallen
fifty
feet
from
an
airborn
broomstick
he
was
used
to
bizarre
accidents
and
injuries
they
were
unavoidable
if
you
attended
Hogwarts
School
of
Witchcraft
and
Wizardry
and
had
a
knack
for
attracting
a
lot
of
trouble
no
the
thing
that
was
bothering
Harry
was
the
last
time
his
scar
had
hurt
him
it
had
been
because
Voldemort
had
been
close
by
but
Voldemort
couldn't
be
here
now
the
idea
of
Voldemort
lurking
in
Privet
Drive
was
absurd
impossible
harry
listened
closely
to
the
silence
around
him
was
he
half
expecting
to
hear
the
creak
of
a
stair
or
the
swish
of
a
cloak
and
then
he
jumped
slightly
as
he
heard
his
cousin
Dudley
give
a
tremendous
grunting
snore
from
the
next
room
harry
shook
himself
mentally
he
was
being
stupid
there
was
no
one
in
the
house
with
him
except
Uncle
Vernon
Aunt
Petunia
and
Dudley
and
they
were
plainly
still
asleep
their
dreams
untroubled
and
painless
asleep
was
the
way
Harry
liked
the
Dursleys
best
it
wasn't
as
though
they
were
ever
any
help
to
him
awake
uncle
Vernon
Aunt
Petunia
and
Dudley
were
harry's
only
living
relatives
they
were
Muggles
who
hated
and
despised
magic
in
any
form
which
meant
that
Harry
was
about
as
welcome
in
their
house
as
dry
rot
they
had
explained
away
harry's
long
absences
at
Hogwarts
over
the
last
three
years
by
telling
everyone
that
he
went
to
st.
brutus's
Secure
Center
for
Incurably
Criminal
Boys
they
knew
perfectly
well
that
as
an
underage
wizard
Harry
wasn't
allowed
to
use
magic
outside
Hogwarts
but
they
were
still
apt
to
blame
him
for
anything
that
went
wrong
about
the
house
harry
had
never
been
able
to
confide
in
them
or
tell
them
anything
about
his
life
in
the
wizarding
world
the
very
idea
of
going
to
them
when
they
awoke
and
telling
them
about
his
scar
hurting
him
and
about
his
worries
about
Voldemort
was
laughable
and
yet
it
was
because
of
Voldemort
that
Harry
had
come
to
live
with
the
Dursleys
in
the
first
place
if
it
hadn't
been
for
Voldemort
Harry
would
not
have
had
the
lightning
scar
on
his
forehead
if
it
hadn't
been
for
Voldemort
Harry
would
still
have
had
parents
harry
had
been
a
year
old
the
night
that
Voldemort
the
most
powerful
Dark
wizard
for
a
century
a
wizard
who
had
been
gaining
power
steadily
for
eleven
years
arrived
at
his
house
and
killed
his
father
and
mother
voldemort
had
then
turned
his
wand
on
Harry
he
had
performed
the
curse
that
had
disposed
of
many
fullgrown
witches
and
wizards
in
his
steady
rise
to
power
and
incredibly
it
had
not
worked
instead
of
killing
the
small
boy
the
curse
had
rebounded
upon
Voldemort
harry
had
survived
with
nothing
but
a
lightningshaped
cut
on
his
forehead
and
Voldemort
had
been
reduced
to
something
barely
alive
his
powers
gone
his
life
almost
extinguished
Voldemort
had
fled
the
terror
in
which
the
secret
community
of
witches
and
wizards
had
lived
for
so
long
had
lifted
voldemort's
followers
had
disbanded
and
Harry
Potter
had
become
famous
it
had
been
enough
of
a
shock
for
Harry
to
discover
on
his
eleventh
birthday
that
he
was
a
wizard
it
had
been
even
more
disconcerting
to
find
out
that
everyone
in
the
hidden
wizarding
world
knew
his
name
harry
had
arrived
at
Hogwarts
to
find
that
heads
turned
and
whispers
followed
him
wherever
he
went
but
he
was
used
to
it
now
At
the
end
of
this
summer
he
would
be
starting
his
fourth
year
at
Hogwarts
and
Harry
was
already
counting
the
days
until
he
would
be
back
at
the
castle
again
but
there
was
still
a
fortnight
to
go
before
he
went
back
to
school
he
looked
hopelessly
around
his
room
again
and
his
eye
paused
on
the
birthday
cards
his
two
best
friends
had
sent
him
at
the
end
of
July
what
would
they
say
if
Harry
wrote
to
them
and
told
them
about
his
scar
hurting
at
once
Hermione
granger's
voice
seemed
to
fill
his
head
shrill
and
panicky
your
scar
hurt
harry
that's
really
serious
write
to
Professor
Dumbledore
and
i'll
go
and
check
Common
Magical
Ailments
and
Afflictions
maybe
there's
something
in
there
about
curse
scars
yes
that
would
be
hermione's
advice
Go
straight
to
the
headmaster
of
Hogwarts
and
in
the
meantime
consult
a
book
harry
stared
out
of
the
window
at
the
inky
blueblack
sky
he
doubted
very
much
whether
a
book
could
help
him
now
as
far
as
he
knew
he
was
the
only
living
person
to
have
survived
a
curse
like
voldemort's
it
was
highly
unlikely
therefore
that
he
would
find
his
symptoms
listed
in
Common
Magical
Ailments
and
Afflictions
as
for
informing
the
headmaster
Harry
had
no
idea
where
Dumbledore
went
during
the
summer
holidays
he
amused
himself
for
a
moment
picturing
Dumbledore
with
his
long
silver
beard
full
length
wizard's
robes
and
pointed
hat
stretched
out
on
a
beach
somewhere
rubbing
suntan
lotion
onto
his
long
crooked
nose
wherever
Dumbledore
was
though
Harry
was
sure
that
Hedwig
would
be
able
to
find
him
harry's
owl
had
never
yet
failed
to
deliver
a
letter
to
anyone
even
without
an
address
but
what
would
he
write
dear
Professor
Dumbledore
Sorry
to
bother
you
but
my
scar
hurt
this
morning
yours
sincerely
Harry
Potter
even
inside
his
head
the
words
sounded
stupid
and
so
he
tried
to
imagine
his
other
best
friend
Ron
weasley's
reaction
and
in
a
moment
ron's
red
hair
and
longnosed
freckled
face
seemed
to
swim
before
Harry
wearing
a
bemused
expression
your
scar
hurt
but
but
YouKnowWho
can't
be
near
you
now
can
he
i
mean
you'd
know
wouldn't
you
he'd
be
trying
to
do
you
in
again
wouldn't
be
i
dunno
Harry
maybe
curse
scars
always
twinge
a
bit
i'll
ask
Dad
mr.
Weasley
was
a
fully
qualified
wizard
who
worked
in
the
Misuse
of
Muggle
Artifacts
Office
at
the
Ministry
of
Magic
but
he
didn't
have
any
particular
expertise
in
the
matter
of
curses
as
far
as
Harry
knew
in
any
case
Harry
didn't
like
the
idea
of
the
whole
Weasley
family
knowing
that
he
Harry
was
getting
jumpy
about
a
few
moments
pain
mrs
weasley
would
fuss
worse
than
Hermione
and
Fred
and
George
ron's
sixteen
yearold
twin
brothers
might
think
Harry
was
losing
his
nerve
the
Weasleys
were
harry's
favorite
family
in
the
world
he
was
hoping
that
they
might
invite
him
to
stay
any
time
now
Ron
had
mentioned
something
about
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
and
he
somehow
didn't
want
his
visit
punctuated
with
anxious
inquiries
about
his
scar
harry
kneaded
his
forehead
with
his
knuckles
what
he
really
wanted
and
it
felt
almost
shameful
to
admit
it
to
himself
was
someone
like
someone
like
a
parent
an
adult
wizard
whose
advice
he
could
ask
without
feeling
stupid
someone
who
cared
about
him
who
had
had
experience
with
Dark
Magic
and
then
the
solution
came
to
him
it
was
so
simple
and
so
obvious
that
he
couldn't
believe
it
had
taken
so
long
Sirius
harry
leapt
up
from
the
bed
hurried
across
the
room
and
sat
down
at
his
desk
he
pulled
a
piece
of
parchment
toward
him
loaded
his
eaglefeather
quill
with
ink
wrote
Dear
Sirius
then
paused
wondering
how
best
to
phrase
his
problem
still
marveling
at
the
fact
that
he
hadn't
thought
of
Sirius
straight
away
but
then
perhaps
it
wasn't
so
surprising
after
all
he
had
only
found
out
that
Sirius
was
his
godfather
two
months
ago
there
was
a
simple
reason
for
sirius's
complete
absence
from
harry's
life
until
then
Sirius
had
been
in
Azkaban
the
terrifying
wizard
jail
guarded
by
creatures
called
dementors
sightless
soulsucking
fiends
who
had
come
to
search
for
Sirius
at
Hogwarts
when
he
had
escaped
yet
Sirius
had
been
innocent
the
murders
for
which
he
had
been
convicted
had
been
committed
by
Wormtail
voldemort's
supporter
whom
nearly
everybody
now
believed
dead
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
knew
otherwise
however
they
had
come
facetoface
with
Wormtail
only
the
previous
year
though
only
Professor
Dumbledore
had
believed
their
story
for
one
glorious
hour
Harry
had
believed
that
he
was
leaving
the
Dursleys
at
last
because
Sirius
had
offered
him
a
home
once
his
name
had
been
cleared
but
the
chance
had
been
snatched
away
from
him
Wormtail
had
escaped
before
they
could
take
him
to
the
Ministry
of
Magic
and
Sirius
had
had
to
flee
for
his
life
harry
had
helped
him
escape
on
the
back
of
a
hippogriff
called
Buckbeak
and
since
then
Sirius
had
been
on
the
run
the
home
Harry
might
have
had
if
Wormtail
had
not
escaped
had
been
haunting
him
all
summer
it
had
been
doubly
hard
to
return
to
the
Dursleys
knowing
that
he
had
so
nearly
escaped
them
forever
nevertheless
Sirius
had
been
of
some
help
to
Harry
even
if
he
couldn't
be
with
him
it
was
due
to
Sirius
that
Harry
now
had
all
his
school
things
in
his
bedroom
with
him
the
Dursleys
had
never
allowed
this
before
their
general
wish
of
keeping
Harry
as
miserable
as
possible
coupled
with
their
fear
of
his
powers
had
led
them
to
lock
his
school
trunk
in
the
cupboard
under
the
stairs
every
summer
prior
to
this
but
their
attitude
had
changed
since
they
had
found
out
that
Harry
had
a
dangerous
murderer
for
a
godfather
for
Harry
had
conveniently
forgotten
to
tell
them
that
Sirius
was
innocent
harry
had
received
two
letters
from
Sirius
since
he
had
been
back
at
Privet
Drive
both
had
been
delivered
not
by
owls
as
was
usual
with
wizards
but
by
large
brightly
colored
tropical
birds
hedwig
had
not
approved
of
these
flashy
intruders
she
had
been
most
reluctant
to
allow
them
to
drink
from
her
water
tray
before
flying
off
again
harry
on
the
other
hand
had
liked
them
they
put
him
in
mind
of
palm
trees
and
white
sand
and
he
hoped
that
wherever
Sirius
was
Sirius
never
said
in
case
the
letters
were
intercepted
he
was
enjoying
himself
somehow
Harry
found
it
hard
to
imaging
dementors
surviving
for
long
in
bright
sunlight
perhapse
that
was
why
Sirius
had
gone
South
sirius's
letters
which
were
now
hidden
beneath
the
highly
useful
loose
floorboards
under
harry's
bed
sounded
chearful
and
in
both
of
them
he
had
reminded
Harry
to
call
on
him
if
ever
Harry
needed
to
well
he
needed
to
right
now
all
right
harry's
lamp
seemed
to
grow
dimmer
as
the
cold
gray
light
that
precedes
sunrise
slowly
crept
into
the
room
finally
when
the
sun
had
risen
when
his
bedroom
walls
had
turned
gold
and
when
sounds
of
movement
could
be
heard
from
Uncle
Vernon
and
Aunt
petunia's
room
Harry
cleared
his
desk
of
crumpled
pieces
of
parchment
and
reread
his
finished
letter
dear
Sirius
Thanks
for
your
last
letter
that
bird
was
enormous
it
could
hardly
get
through
my
window
things
are
the
same
as
usual
here
dudley's
diet
isn't
going
too
well
my
aunt
found
him
smuggling
doughnuts
into
his
room
yesterday
they
told
him
they'd
have
to
cut
his
pocket
money
if
he
keeps
doing
it
so
he
got
really
angry
and
chucked
his
PlayStation
out
of
the
window
that's
a
sort
of
computer
thing
you
can
play
games
on
bit
stupid
really
now
he
hasn't
even
got
MegaMutilation
Part
Three
to
take
his
mind
off
things
i'm
okay
mainly
because
the
Dursleys
are
terrified
you
might
turn
up
and
turn
them
all
into
bats
if
I
ask
you
to
a
weird
thing
happened
this
morning
though
my
scar
hurt
again
last
time
that
happened
it
was
because
Voldemort
was
at
Hogwarts
but
I
don't
reckon
he
can
be
anywhere
near
me
now
can
he
do
you
know
if
curse
scars
sometimes
hurt
years
afterward
i'll
send
this
with
Hedwig
when
she
gets
back
she's
off
hunting
at
the
moment
say
hello
to
Buckbeak
for
me
harry
Yes
thought
Harry
that
looked
all
right
there
was
no
point
putting
in
the
dream
he
didn't
want
it
to
look
as
though
he
was
too
worried
he
folded
up
the
parchment
and
laid
it
aside
on
his
desk
ready
for
when
Hedwig
returned
then
he
got
to
his
feet
stretched
and
opened
his
wardrobe
once
more
without
glancing
at
his
reflection
he
started
to
get
dressed
before
going
down
to
breakfast
chapter
three
the
invitation
by
the
time
Harry
arrived
in
the
kitchen
the
three
Dursleys
were
already
seated
around
the
table
none
of
them
looked
up
as
he
entered
or
sat
down
uncle
vernon's
large
red
face
was
hidden
behind
the
morning's
Daily
Mail
and
Aunt
Petunia
was
cutting
a
grapefruit
into
quarters
her
lips
pursed
over
her
horselike
teeth
dudley
looked
furious
and
sulky
and
somehow
seemed
to
be
taking
up
even
more
space
than
usual
this
was
saying
something
as
he
always
took
up
an
entire
side
of
the
square
table
by
himself
when
Aunt
Petunia
put
a
quarter
of
unsweetened
grapefruit
onto
dudley's
plate
with
a
tremulous
There
you
are
Diddy
darling
dudley
glowered
at
her
his
life
had
taken
a
most
unpleasant
turn
since
he
had
come
home
for
the
summer
with
his
endofyear
report
uncle
Vernon
and
Aunt
Petunia
had
managed
to
find
excuses
for
his
bad
marks
as
usual
Aunt
Petunia
always
insisted
that
Dudley
was
a
very
gifted
boy
whose
teachers
didn't
understand
him
while
Uncle
Vernon
maintained
that
he
didn't
want
some
swotty
little
nancy
boy
for
a
son
anyway
they
also
skated
over
the
accusations
of
bullying
in
the
report
he's
a
boisterous
little
boy
but
he
wouldn't
hurt
a
fly
aunt
Petunia
had
said
tearfully
however
at
the
bottom
of
the
report
there
were
a
few
wellchosen
comments
from
the
school
nurse
that
not
even
Uncle
Vernon
and
Aunt
Petunia
could
explain
away
no
matter
how
much
Aunt
Petunia
wailed
that
Dudley
was
bigboned
and
that
his
poundage
was
really
puppy
fat
and
that
he
was
a
growing
boy
who
needed
plenty
of
food
the
fact
remained
that
the
school
outfitters
didn't
stock
knickerbockers
big
enough
for
him
anymore
the
school
nurse
had
seen
what
Aunt
petunia's
eyes
so
sharp
when
it
came
to
spotting
fingerprints
on
her
gleaming
walls
and
in
observing
the
comings
and
goings
of
the
neighbors
simply
refused
to
see
that
far
from
needing
extra
nourishment
Dudley
had
reached
roughly
the
size
and
weight
of
a
young
killer
whale
so
after
many
tantrums
after
arguments
that
shook
harry's
bedroom
floor
and
many
tears
from
Aunt
Petunia
the
new
regime
had
begun
the
diet
sheet
that
had
been
sent
by
the
Smeltings
school
nurse
had
been
taped
to
the
fridge
which
had
been
emptied
of
all
dudley's
favorite
things
fizzy
drinks
and
cakes
chocolate
bars
and
burgers
and
filled
instead
with
fruit
and
vegetables
and
the
sorts
of
things
that
Uncle
Vernon
called
rabbit
food
to
make
Dudley
feel
better
about
it
all
Aunt
Petunia
had
insisted
that
the
whole
family
follow
the
diet
too
she
now
passed
a
grapefruit
quarter
to
Harry
he
noticed
that
it
was
a
lot
smaller
than
dudley's
aunt
Petunia
seemed
to
feet
that
the
best
way
to
keep
up
dudley's
morale
was
to
make
sure
that
he
did
at
least
get
more
to
eat
than
Harry
but
Aunt
Petunia
didn't
know
what
was
hidden
under
the
loose
floorboard
upstairs
she
had
no
idea
that
Harry
was
not
following
the
diet
at
all
the
moment
he
had
got
wind
of
the
fact
that
he
was
expected
to
survive
the
summer
on
carrot
sticks
Harry
had
sent
Hedwig
to
his
friends
with
pleas
for
help
and
they
had
risen
to
the
occasion
magnificently
hedwig
had
returned
from
hermione's
house
with
a
large
box
stuffed
full
of
sugarfree
snacks
hermione's
parents
were
dentists
Hagrid
the
Hogwarts
gamekeeper
had
obliged
with
a
sack
full
of
his
own
homemade
rock
cakes
Harry
hadn't
touched
these
he
had
had
too
much
experience
of
hagrid's
cooking
Mrs
weasley
however
had
sent
the
family
owl
Errol
with
an
enormous
fruitcake
and
assorted
meat
pies
poor
Errol
who
was
elderly
and
feeble
had
needed
a
full
five
days
to
recover
from
the
journey
and
then
on
harry's
birthday
which
the
Dursleys
had
completely
ignored
he
had
received
four
superb
birthday
cakes
one
each
from
Ron
Hermione
Hagrid
and
Sirius
harry
still
had
two
of
them
left
and
so
looking
forward
to
a
real
breakfast
when
he
got
back
upstairs
he
ate
his
grapefruit
without
complaint
uncle
Vernon
laid
aside
his
paper
with
a
deep
sniff
of
disapproval
and
looked
down
at
his
own
grapefruit
quarter
is
this
it
he
said
grumpily
to
Aunt
Petunia
aunt
Petunia
gave
him
a
severe
look
and
then
nodded
pointedly
at
Dudley
who
had
already
finished
his
own
grapefruit
quarter
and
was
eyeing
harry's
with
a
very
sour
look
in
his
piggy
little
eyes
uncle
Vernon
gave
a
great
sigh
which
ruffled
his
large
bushy
mustache
and
picked
up
his
spoon
the
doorbell
rang
uncle
Vernon
heaved
himself
out
of
his
chair
and
set
off
down
the
hall
quick
as
a
flash
while
his
mother
was
occupied
with
the
kettle
Dudley
stole
the
rest
of
Uncle
vernon's
grapefruit
harry
heard
talking
at
the
door
and
someone
laughing
and
Uncle
Vernon
answering
curtly
then
the
front
door
closed
and
the
sound
of
ripping
paper
came
from
the
hall
aunt
Petunia
set
the
teapot
down
on
the
table
and
looked
curiously
around
to
see
where
Uncle
Vernon
had
got
to
she
didn't
have
to
wait
long
to
find
out
after
about
a
minute
he
was
back
he
looked
livid
you
he
barked
at
Harry
in
the
living
room
now
bewildered
wondering
what
on
earth
he
was
supposed
to
have
done
this
time
Harry
got
up
and
followed
Uncle
Vernon
out
of
the
kitchen
and
into
the
next
room
uncle
Vernon
closed
the
door
sharply
behind
both
of
them
so
he
said
marching
over
to
the
fireplace
and
turning
to
face
Harry
as
though
he
were
about
to
pronounce
him
under
arrest
so
harry
would
have
dearly
loved
to
have
said
So
what
but
he
didn't
feel
that
Uncle
vernon's
temper
should
be
tested
this
early
in
the
morning
especially
when
it
was
already
under
severe
strain
from
lack
of
food
he
therefore
settled
for
looking
politely
puzzled
this
just
arrived
said
Uncle
Vernon
he
brandished
a
piece
of
purple
writing
paper
at
Harry
a
letter
about
you
harry's
confusion
increased
who
would
be
writing
to
Uncle
Vernon
about
him
who
did
he
know
who
sent
letters
by
the
postman
uncle
Vernon
glared
at
Harry
then
looked
down
at
the
letter
and
began
to
read
aloud
Dear
mr.
and
Mrs
dursley
We
have
never
been
introduced
but
I
am
sure
you
have
heard
a
great
deal
from
Harry
about
my
son
Ron
as
Harry
might
have
told
you
the
final
of
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
takes
place
this
Monday
night
and
my
husband
Arthur
has
just
managed
to
get
prime
tickets
through
his
connections
at
the
Department
of
Magical
Games
and
Sports
i
do
hope
you
will
allow
us
to
take
Harry
to
the
match
as
this
really
is
a
onceina
lifetime
opportunity
Britain
hasn't
hosted
the
cup
for
thirty
years
and
tickets
are
extremely
hard
to
come
by
we
would
of
course
be
glad
to
have
Harry
stay
for
the
remainder
of
the
summer
holidays
and
to
see
him
safely
onto
the
train
back
to
school
it
would
be
best
for
Harry
to
send
us
your
answer
as
quickly
as
possible
in
the
normal
way
because
the
Muggle
postman
has
never
delivered
to
our
house
and
I
am
not
sure
he
even
knows
where
it
is
hoping
to
see
Harry
soon
Yours
sincerely
Molly
Weasley
P
s.
I
do
hope
we've
put
enough
stamps
on
uncle
Vernon
finished
reading
put
his
hand
back
into
his
breast
pocket
and
drew
out
something
else
look
at
this
he
growled
he
held
up
the
envelope
in
which
Mrs
weasley's
letter
had
come
and
Harry
had
to
fight
down
a
laugh
every
bit
of
it
was
covered
in
stamps
except
for
a
square
inch
on
the
front
into
which
Mrs
weasley
had
squeezed
the
Dursleys
address
in
minute
writing
she
did
put
enough
stamps
on
then
said
Harry
trying
to
sound
as
though
Mrs
weasley's
was
a
mistake
anyone
could
make
his
uncle's
eyes
flashed
the
postman
noticed
he
said
through
gritted
teeth
very
interested
to
know
where
this
letter
came
from
he
was
that's
why
he
rang
the
doorbell
seemed
to
think
it
was
funny
harry
didn't
say
anything
other
people
might
not
understand
why
Uncle
Vernon
was
making
a
fuss
about
too
many
stamps
but
Harry
had
lived
with
the
Dursleys
too
long
not
to
know
how
touchy
they
were
about
anything
even
slightly
out
of
the
ordinary
their
worst
fear
was
that
someone
would
find
out
that
they
were
connected
however
distantly
with
people
like
Mrs
weasley
uncle
Vernon
was
still
glaring
at
Harry
who
tried
to
keep
his
expression
neutral
if
he
didn't
do
or
say
anything
stupid
he
might
just
be
in
for
the
treat
of
a
lifetime
he
waited
for
Uncle
Vernon
to
say
something
but
he
merely
continued
to
glare
harry
decided
to
break
the
silence
so
can
I
go
then
he
asked
a
slight
spasm
crossed
Uncle
vernon's
large
purple
face
the
mustache
bristled
harry
thought
he
knew
what
was
going
on
behind
the
mustache
a
furious
battle
as
two
of
Uncle
vernon's
most
fundamental
instincts
came
into
conflict
allowing
Harry
to
go
would
make
Harry
happy
something
Uncle
Vernon
had
struggled
against
for
thirteen
years
on
the
other
hand
allowing
Harry
to
disappear
to
the
Weasleys
for
the
rest
of
the
summer
would
get
rid
of
him
two
weeks
earlier
than
anyone
could
have
hoped
and
Uncle
Vernon
hated
having
Harry
in
the
house
to
give
himself
thinking
time
it
seemed
he
looked
down
at
Mrs
weasley's
letter
again
who
is
this
woman
he
said
staring
at
the
signature
with
distaste
you've
seen
her
said
Harry
she's
my
friend
ron's
mother
she
was
meeting
him
off
the
Hog
off
the
school
train
at
the
end
of
last
term
he
had
almost
said
Hogwarts
Express
and
that
was
a
sure
way
to
get
his
uncle's
temper
up
nobody
ever
mentioned
the
name
of
harry's
school
aloud
in
the
Dursley
household
uncle
Vernon
screwed
up
his
enormous
face
as
though
trying
to
remember
something
very
unpleasant
dumpy
sort
of
woman
he
growled
finally
load
of
children
with
red
hair
harry
frowned
he
thought
it
was
a
bit
rich
of
Uncle
Vernon
to
call
anyone
dumpy
when
his
own
son
Dudley
had
finally
achieved
what
he'd
been
threatening
to
do
since
the
age
of
three
and
become
wider
than
he
was
tall
uncle
Vernon
was
perusing
the
letter
again
quidditch
he
muttered
under
his
breath
quidditch
what
is
this
rubbish
harry
felt
a
second
stab
of
annoyance
it's
a
sport
he
said
shortly
played
on
broom
all
right
all
right
said
Uncle
Vernon
loudly
harry
saw
with
some
satisfaction
that
his
uncle
looked
vaguely
panicky
apparently
his
nerves
couldn't
stand
the
sound
of
the
word
broomsticks
in
his
living
room
he
took
refuge
in
perusing
the
letter
again
harry
saw
his
lips
form
the
words
send
us
your
answer
in
the
normal
way
he
scowled
what
does
she
mean
the
normal
way
he
spat
normal
for
us
said
Harry
and
before
his
uncle
could
stop
him
he
added
you
know
owl
post
that's
what's
normal
for
wizards
uncle
Vernon
looked
as
outraged
as
if
Harry
had
just
uttered
a
disgusting
swearword
shaking
with
anger
he
shot
a
nervous
look
through
the
window
as
though
expecting
to
see
some
of
the
neighbors
with
their
ears
pressed
against
the
glass
how
many
times
do
I
have
to
tell
you
not
to
mention
that
unnaturalness
under
my
roof
he
hissed
his
face
now
a
rich
plum
color
you
stand
there
in
the
clothes
Petunia
and
I
have
put
on
your
ungrateful
back
only
after
Dudley
finished
with
them
said
Harry
coldly
and
indeed
he
was
dressed
in
a
sweatshirt
so
large
for
him
that
he
had
had
to
roll
back
the
sleeves
five
times
so
as
to
be
able
to
use
his
hands
and
which
fell
past
the
knees
of
his
extremely
baggy
jeans
i
will
not
be
spoken
to
like
that
said
Uncle
Vernon
trembling
with
rage
but
Harry
wasn't
going
to
stand
for
this
gone
were
the
days
when
he
had
been
forced
to
take
every
single
one
of
the
Dursleys
stupid
rules
he
wasn't
following
dudley's
diet
and
he
wasn't
going
to
let
Uncle
Vernon
stop
him
from
going
to
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
not
if
he
could
help
it
harry
took
a
deep
steadying
breath
and
then
said
Okay
I
can't
see
the
World
Cup
can
I
go
now
then
only
i've
got
a
letter
to
Sirius
I
want
to
finish
you
know
my
godfather
he
had
done
it
he
had
said
the
magic
words
now
he
watched
the
purple
recede
blotchily
from
Uncle
vernon's
face
making
it
look
like
badly
mixed
black
currant
ice
cream
you're
you're
writing
to
him
are
you
said
Uncle
Vernon
in
a
wouldbe
calm
voice
but
Harry
had
seen
the
pupils
of
his
tiny
eyes
contract
with
sudden
fear
well
yeah
said
Harry
casually
it's
been
a
while
since
he
heard
from
me
and
you
know
if
he
doesn't
he
might
start
thinking
something's
wrong
he
stopped
there
to
enjoy
the
effect
of
these
words
he
could
almost
see
the
cogs
working
under
Uncle
vernon's
thick
dark
neatly
parted
hair
if
he
tried
to
stop
Harry
writing
to
Sirius
Sirius
would
think
Harry
was
being
mistreated
if
he
told
Harry
he
couldn't
go
to
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
Harry
would
write
and
tell
sirius
who
would
know
Harry
was
being
mistreated
there
was
only
one
thing
for
Uncle
Vernon
to
do
harry
could
see
the
conclusion
forming
in
his
uncle's
mind
as
though
the
great
mustached
face
were
transparent
harry
tried
not
to
smile
to
keep
his
own
face
as
blank
as
possible
and
then
Well
all
right
then
you
can
go
to
this
ruddy
this
stupid
this
World
Cup
thing
you
write
and
tell
these
these
Weasleys
they're
to
pick
you
up
mind
i
haven't
got
time
to
go
dropping
you
off
all
over
the
country
and
you
can
spend
the
rest
of
the
summer
there
and
you
can
tell
your
your
godfather
tell
him
tell
him
you're
going
okay
then
said
Harry
brightly
he
turned
and
walked
toward
the
living
room
door
fighting
the
urge
to
jump
into
the
air
and
whoop
he
was
going
he
was
going
to
the
Weasleys
he
was
going
to
watch
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
outside
in
the
hall
he
nearly
ran
into
Dudley
who
had
been
lurking
behind
the
door
clearly
hoping
to
overhear
Harry
being
told
off
he
looked
shocked
to
see
the
broad
grin
on
harry's
face
that
was
an
excellent
breakfast
wasn't
it
said
Harry
i
feel
really
full
don't
you
laughing
at
the
astonished
look
on
dudley's
face
Harry
took
the
stairs
three
at
a
time
and
hurled
himself
back
into
his
bedroom
the
first
thing
he
saw
was
that
Hedwig
was
back
she
was
sitting
in
her
cage
staring
at
Harry
with
her
enormous
amber
eyes
and
clicking
her
beak
in
the
way
that
meant
she
was
annoyed
about
something
exactly
what
was
annoying
her
became
apparent
almost
at
once
ouch
said
Harry
as
what
appeared
to
be
a
small
gray
feathery
tennis
ball
collided
with
the
side
of
his
head
harry
massaged
the
spot
furiously
looking
up
to
see
what
had
hit
him
and
saw
a
minute
owl
small
enough
to
fit
into
the
palm
of
his
hand
whizzing
excitedly
around
the
room
like
a
loose
firework
harry
then
realized
that
the
owl
had
dropped
a
letter
at
his
feet
harry
bent
down
recognized
ron's
handwriting
then
tore
open
the
envelope
inside
was
a
hastily
scribbled
note
harry
dad
got
the
tickets
Ireland
versus
Bulgaria
Monday
night
mum's
writing
to
the
Muggles
to
ask
you
to
stay
they
might
already
have
the
letter
I
don't
know
how
fast
Muggle
post
is
thought
i'd
send
this
with
Pig
anyway
harry
stared
at
the
word
Pig
then
looked
up
at
the
tiny
owl
now
zooming
around
the
light
fixture
on
the
ceiling
he
had
never
seen
anything
that
looked
less
like
a
pig
maybe
he
couldn't
read
ron's
writing
he
went
back
to
the
letter
we're
coming
for
you
whether
the
Muggles
like
it
or
not
you
can't
miss
the
World
Cup
only
Mum
and
Dad
reckon
it's
better
if
we
pretend
to
ask
their
permission
first
if
they
say
yes
send
Pig
back
with
your
answer
pronto
and
we'll
come
and
get
you
at
five
o'clock
on
Sunday
if
they
say
no
send
Pig
back
pronto
and
we'll
come
and
get
you
at
five
o'clock
on
Sunday
anyway
hermione's
arriving
this
afternoon
percy's
started
work
the
Department
of
International
Magical
Cooperation
don't
mention
anything
about
Abroad
while
you're
here
unless
you
want
the
pants
bored
off
you
see
you
soon
Ron
Calm
down
harry
said
as
the
small
owl
flew
low
over
his
head
twittering
madly
with
what
Harry
could
only
assume
was
pride
at
having
delivered
the
letter
to
the
right
person
come
here
I
need
you
to
take
my
answer
back
the
owl
fluttered
down
on
top
of
hedwig's
cage
hedwig
looked
coldly
up
at
it
as
though
daring
it
to
try
and
come
any
closer
harry
seized
his
eaglefeather
quill
once
more
grabbed
a
fresh
piece
of
parchment
and
wrote
Ron
it's
all
okay
the
Muggles
say
I
can
come
see
you
five
o'clock
tomorrow
can't
wait
harry
He
folded
this
note
up
very
small
and
with
immense
difficulty
tied
it
to
the
tiny
owl's
leg
as
it
hopped
on
the
spot
with
excitement
the
moment
the
note
was
secure
the
owl
was
off
again
it
zoomed
out
of
the
window
and
out
of
sight
harry
turned
to
Hedwig
feeling
up
to
a
long
journey
he
asked
her
hedwig
hooted
in
a
dignified
sort
of
a
way
can
you
take
this
to
Sirius
for
me
he
said
picking
up
his
letter
hang
on
i
just
want
to
finish
it
he
unfolded
the
parchment
and
hastily
added
a
postscript
if
you
want
to
contact
me
i'll
be
at
my
friend
Ron
weasley's
for
the
rest
of
the
summer
his
dad's
got
us
tickets
for
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
the
letter
finished
he
tied
it
to
hedwig's
leg
she
kept
unusually
still
as
though
determined
to
show
him
how
a
real
post
owl
should
behave
i'll
be
at
ron's
when
you
get
back
all
right
harry
told
her
she
nipped
his
finger
affectionately
then
with
a
soft
swooshing
noise
spread
her
enormous
wings
and
soared
out
of
the
open
window
harry
watched
her
out
of
sight
then
crawled
under
his
bed
wrenched
up
the
loose
floorboard
and
pulled
out
a
large
chunk
of
birthday
cake
he
sat
there
on
the
floor
eating
it
savoring
the
happiness
that
was
flooding
through
him
he
had
cake
and
Dudley
had
nothing
but
grapefruit
it
was
a
bright
summer's
day
he
would
be
leaving
Privet
Drive
tomorrow
his
scar
felt
perfectly
normal
again
and
he
was
going
to
watch
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
it
was
hard
just
now
to
feel
worried
about
anything
even
Lord
Voldemort
chapter
four
back
to
the
burrow
by
twelve
o'clock
the
next
day
harry's
school
trunk
was
packed
with
his
school
things
and
all
his
most
prized
possessions
the
Invisibility
Cloak
he
had
inherited
from
his
father
the
broomstick
he
had
gotten
from
Sirius
the
enchanted
map
of
Hogwarts
he
had
been
given
by
Fred
and
George
Weasley
last
year
he
had
emptied
his
hiding
place
under
the
loose
floorboard
of
all
food
doublechecked
every
nook
and
cranny
of
his
bedroom
for
forgotten
spellbooks
or
quills
and
taken
down
the
chart
on
the
wall
counting
down
the
days
to
September
the
first
on
which
he
liked
to
cross
off
the
days
remaining
until
his
return
to
Hogwarts
the
atmosphere
inside
number
four
Privet
Drive
was
extremely
tense
the
imminent
arrival
at
their
house
of
an
assortment
of
wizards
was
making
the
Dursleys
uptight
and
irritable
uncle
Vernon
had
looked
downright
alarmed
when
Harry
informed
him
that
the
Weasleys
would
be
arriving
at
five
o'clock
the
very
next
day
i
hope
you
told
them
to
dress
properly
these
people
he
snarled
at
once
i've
seen
the
sort
of
stuff
your
lot
wear
they'd
better
have
the
decency
to
put
on
normal
clothes
that's
all
harry
felt
a
slight
sense
of
foreboding
he
had
rarely
seen
mr.
or
Mrs
weasley
wearing
anything
that
the
Dursleys
would
call
normal
their
children
might
don
Muggle
clothing
during
the
holidays
but
mr.
and
Mrs
weasley
usually
wore
long
robes
in
varying
states
of
shabbiness
harry
wasn't
bothered
about
what
the
neighbors
would
think
but
he
was
anxious
about
how
rude
the
Dursleys
might
be
to
the
Weasleys
if
they
turned
up
looking
like
their
worst
idea
of
wizards
uncle
Vernon
had
put
on
his
best
suit
to
some
people
this
might
have
looked
like
a
gesture
of
welcome
but
Harry
knew
it
was
because
Uncle
Vernon
wanted
to
look
impressive
and
intimidating
dudley
on
the
other
hand
looked
somehow
diminished
this
was
not
because
the
diet
was
at
last
taking
effect
but
due
to
fright
dudley
had
emerged
from
his
last
encounter
with
a
fully
grown
wizard
with
a
curly
pig's
tail
poking
out
of
the
seat
of
his
trousers
and
Aunt
Petunia
and
Uncle
Vernon
had
had
to
pay
for
its
removal
at
a
private
hospital
in
London
it
wasn't
altogether
surprising
therefore
that
Dudley
kept
running
his
hand
nervously
over
his
backside
and
walking
sideways
from
room
to
room
so
as
not
to
present
the
same
target
to
the
enemy
lunch
was
an
almost
silent
meal
dudley
didn't
even
protest
at
the
food
cottage
cheese
and
grated
celery
aunt
Petunia
wasn't
eating
anything
at
all
her
arms
were
folded
her
lips
were
pursed
and
she
seemed
to
be
chewing
her
tongue
as
though
biting
back
the
furious
diatribe
she
longed
to
throw
at
Harry
they'll
be
driving
of
course
uncle
Vernon
barked
across
the
table
er
said
Harry
he
hadn't
thought
of
that
how
were
the
Weasleys
going
to
pick
him
up
they
didn't
have
a
car
anymore
the
old
Ford
Anglia
they
had
once
owned
was
currently
running
wild
in
the
Forbidden
Forest
at
Hogwarts
but
mr.
Weasley
had
borrowed
a
Ministry
of
Magic
car
last
year
possibly
he
would
do
the
same
today
i
think
so
said
Harry
uncle
Vernon
snorted
into
his
mustache
normally
Uncle
Vernon
would
have
asked
what
car
mr.
Weasley
drove
he
tended
to
judge
other
men
by
how
big
and
expensive
their
cars
were
but
Harry
doubted
whether
Uncle
Vernon
would
have
taken
to
mr.
Weasley
even
if
he
drove
a
Ferrari
harry
spent
most
of
the
afternoon
in
his
bedroom
he
couldn't
stand
watching
Aunt
Petunia
peer
out
through
the
net
curtains
every
few
seconds
as
though
there
had
been
a
warning
about
an
escaped
rhinoceros
finally
at
a
quarter
to
five
Harry
went
back
downstairs
and
into
the
living
room
aunt
Petunia
was
compulsively
straightening
cushions
uncle
Vernon
was
pretending
to
read
the
paper
but
his
tiny
eyes
were
not
moving
and
Harry
was
sure
he
was
really
listening
with
all
his
might
for
the
sound
of
an
approaching
car
dudley
was
crammed
into
an
armchair
his
porky
hands
beneath
him
clamped
firmly
around
his
bottom
harry
couldn't
take
the
tension
he
left
the
room
and
went
and
sat
on
the
stairs
in
the
hall
his
eyes
on
his
watch
and
his
heart
pumping
fast
from
excitement
and
nerves
but
five
o'clock
came
and
then
went
uncle
Vernon
perspiring
slightly
in
his
suit
opened
the
front
door
peered
up
and
down
the
street
then
withdrew
his
head
quickly
they're
late
he
snarled
at
Harry
i
know
said
Harry
maybe
er
the
traffic's
bad
or
something
ten
past
five
then
a
quarter
past
five
harry
was
starting
to
feel
anxious
himself
now
at
half
past
he
heard
Uncle
Vernon
and
Aunt
Petunia
conversing
in
terse
mutters
in
the
living
room
no
consideration
at
all
we
might've
had
an
engagement
maybe
they
think
they'll
get
invited
to
dinner
if
they're
late
well
they
most
certainly
won't
be
said
Uncle
Vernon
and
Harry
heard
him
stand
up
and
start
pacing
the
living
room
they'll
take
the
boy
and
go
there'll
be
no
hanging
around
that's
if
they're
coming
at
all
probably
mistaken
the
day
i
daresay
their
kind
don't
set
much
store
by
punctuality
either
that
or
they
drive
some
tinpot
car
that's
broken
d
aaaaaaaarrrrrgh
harry
jumped
up
from
the
other
side
of
the
living
room
door
came
the
sounds
of
the
three
Dursleys
scrambling
panicstricken
across
the
room
next
moment
Dudley
came
flying
into
the
hall
looking
terrified
what
happened
said
Harry
what's
the
matter
but
Dudley
didn't
seem
able
to
speak
hands
still
clamped
over
his
buttocks
he
waddled
as
fast
as
he
could
into
the
kitchen
harry
hurried
into
the
living
room
loud
bangings
and
scrapings
were
coming
from
behind
the
Dursleys
boardedup
fireplace
which
had
a
fake
coal
fire
plugged
in
front
of
it
what
is
it
gasped
Aunt
Petunia
who
had
backed
into
the
wall
and
was
staring
terrified
toward
the
fire
what
is
it
Vernon
but
they
were
left
in
doubt
barely
a
second
longer
voices
could
be
heard
from
inside
the
blocked
fireplace
ouch
fred
no
go
back
go
back
there's
been
some
kind
of
mistake
tell
George
not
to
ouch
george
no
there's
no
room
go
back
quickly
and
tell
Ron
maybe
Harry
can
hear
us
Dad
maybe
he'll
be
able
to
let
us
out
there
was
a
loud
hammering
of
fists
on
the
boards
behind
the
electric
fire
harry
harry
can
you
hear
us
the
Dursleys
rounded
on
Harry
like
a
pair
of
angry
wolverines
what
is
this
growled
Uncle
Vernon
what's
going
on
they
they've
tried
to
get
here
by
Floo
powder
said
Harry
fighting
a
mad
desire
to
laugh
they
can
travel
by
fire
only
you've
blocked
the
fireplace
hang
on
he
approached
the
fireplace
and
called
through
the
boards
mr.
Weasley
can
you
hear
me
the
hammering
stopped
somebody
inside
the
chimney
piece
said
Shh
mr.
Weasley
it's
Harry
the
fireplace
has
been
blocked
up
you
won't
be
able
to
get
through
there
damn
said
mr.
weasley's
voice
what
on
earth
did
they
want
to
block
up
the
fireplace
for
they've
got
an
electric
fire
Harry
explained
really
said
mr.
weasley's
voice
excitedly
eclectic
you
say
with
a
plug
gracious
I
must
see
that
let's
think
ouch
Ron
ron's
voice
now
joined
the
others
what
are
we
doing
here
has
something
gone
wrong
oh
no
Ron
came
fred's
voice
very
sarcastically
no
this
is
exactly
where
we
wanted
to
end
up
yeah
we're
having
the
time
of
our
lives
here
said
George
whose
voice
sounded
muffled
as
though
he
was
squashed
against
the
wall
boys
boys
said
mr.
Weasley
vaguely
i'm
trying
to
think
what
to
do
yes
only
way
stand
back
Harry
harry
retreated
to
the
sofa
uncle
Vernon
however
moved
forward
wait
a
moment
he
bellowed
at
the
fire
what
exactly
are
you
going
to
bang
the
electric
fire
shot
across
the
room
as
the
boardedup
fireplace
burst
outward
expelling
mr.
Weasley
Fred
George
and
Ron
in
a
cloud
of
rubble
and
loose
chippings
aunt
Petunia
shrieked
and
fell
backward
over
the
coffee
table
Uncle
Vernon
caught
her
before
she
hit
the
floor
and
gaped
speechless
at
the
Weasleys
all
of
whom
had
bright
red
hair
including
Fred
and
George
who
were
identical
to
the
last
freckle
that's
better
panted
mr.
Weasley
brushing
dust
from
his
long
green
robes
and
straightening
his
glasses
ah
you
must
be
harry's
aunt
and
uncle
tall
thin
and
balding
he
moved
toward
Uncle
Vernon
his
hand
outstretched
but
Uncle
Vernon
backed
away
several
paces
dragging
Aunt
Petunia
words
utterly
failed
Uncle
Vernon
his
best
suit
was
covered
in
white
dust
which
had
settled
in
his
hair
and
mustache
and
made
him
look
as
though
he
had
just
aged
thirty
years
er
yes
sorry
about
that
said
mr.
Weasley
lowering
his
hand
and
looking
over
his
shoulder
at
the
blasted
fireplace
it's
all
my
fault
it
just
didn't
occur
to
me
that
we
wouldn't
be
able
to
get
out
at
the
other
end
i
had
your
fireplace
connected
to
the
Floo
Network
you
see
just
for
an
afternoon
you
know
so
we
could
get
Harry
muggle
fireplaces
aren't
supposed
to
be
connected
strictly
speaking
but
i've
got
a
useful
contact
at
the
Floo
Regulation
Panel
and
he
fixed
it
for
me
i
can
put
it
right
in
a
jiffy
though
don't
worry
i'll
light
a
fire
to
send
the
boys
back
and
then
I
can
repair
your
fireplace
before
I
Disapparate
harry
was
ready
to
bet
that
the
Dursleys
hadn't
understood
a
single
word
of
this
they
were
still
gaping
at
mr.
Weasley
thunderstruck
aunt
Petunia
staggered
upright
again
and
hid
behind
Uncle
Vernon
hello
Harry
said
mr.
Weasley
brightly
got
your
trunk
ready
it's
upstairs
said
Harry
grinning
back
we'll
get
it
said
Fred
at
once
winking
at
Harry
he
and
George
left
the
room
they
knew
where
harry's
bedroom
was
having
once
rescued
him
from
it
in
the
dead
of
night
harry
suspected
that
Fred
and
George
were
hoping
for
a
glimpse
of
Dudley
they
had
heard
a
lot
about
him
from
Harry
well
said
mr.
Weasley
swinging
his
arms
slightly
while
he
tried
to
find
words
to
break
the
very
nasty
silence
very
erm
very
nice
place
you've
got
here
as
the
usually
spotless
living
room
was
now
covered
in
dust
and
bits
of
brick
this
remark
didn't
go
down
too
well
with
the
Dursleys
uncle
vernon's
face
purpled
once
more
and
Aunt
Petunia
started
chewing
her
tongue
again
however
they
seemed
too
scared
to
actually
say
anything
mr.
Weasley
was
looking
around
he
loved
everything
to
do
with
Muggles
harry
could
see
him
itching
to
go
and
examine
the
television
and
the
video
recorder
they
run
off
eckeltricity
do
they
he
said
knowledgeably
ah
yes
I
can
see
the
plugs
i
collect
plugs
he
added
to
Uncle
Vernon
and
batteries
got
a
very
large
collection
of
batteries
my
wife
thinks
i'm
mad
but
there
you
are
uncle
Vernon
clearly
thought
mr.
Weasley
was
mad
too
he
moved
ever
so
slightly
to
the
right
screening
Aunt
Petunia
from
view
as
though
he
thought
Mr
weasley
might
suddenly
run
at
them
and
attack
dudley
suddenly
reappeared
in
the
room
harry
could
hear
the
clunk
of
his
trunk
on
the
stairs
and
knew
that
the
sounds
had
scared
Dudley
out
of
the
kitchen
dudley
edged
along
the
wall
gazing
at
mr.
Weasley
with
terrified
eyes
and
attempted
to
conceal
himself
behind
his
mother
and
father
unfortunately
Uncle
vernon's
bulk
while
sufficient
to
hide
bony
Aunt
Petunia
was
nowhere
near
enough
to
conceal
Dudley
ah
this
is
your
cousin
is
it
Harry
said
mr.
Weasley
taking
another
brave
stab
at
making
conversation
yep
said
Harry
that's
Dudley
he
and
Ron
exchanged
glances
and
then
quickly
looked
away
from
each
other
the
temptation
to
burst
out
laughing
was
almost
overwhelming
dudley
was
still
clutching
his
bottom
as
though
afraid
it
might
fall
off
mr.
Weasley
however
seemed
genuinely
concerned
at
dudley's
peculiar
behavior
indeed
from
the
tone
of
his
voice
when
he
next
spoke
Harry
was
quite
sure
that
mr.
Weasley
thought
Dudley
was
quite
as
mad
as
the
Dursleys
thought
he
was
except
that
mr.
Weasley
felt
sympathy
rather
than
fear
having
a
good
holiday
Dudley
he
said
kindly
dudley
whimpered
harry
saw
his
hands
tighten
still
harder
over
his
massive
backside
fred
and
George
came
back
into
the
room
carrying
harry's
school
trunk
they
glanced
around
as
they
entered
and
spotted
Dudley
their
faces
cracked
into
identical
evil
grins
ah
right
said
mr.
Weasley
better
get
cracking
then
he
pushed
up
the
sleeves
of
his
robes
and
took
out
his
wand
harry
saw
the
Dursleys
draw
back
against
the
wall
as
one
incendio
said
mr.
Weasley
pointing
his
wand
at
the
hole
in
the
wall
behind
him
flames
rose
at
once
in
the
fireplace
crackling
merrily
as
though
they
had
been
burning
for
hours
mr.
Weasley
took
a
small
drawstring
bag
from
his
pocket
untied
it
took
a
pinch
of
the
powder
inside
and
threw
it
onto
the
flames
which
turned
emerald
green
and
roared
higher
than
ever
off
you
go
then
Fred
said
mr.
Weasley
coming
said
Fred
oh
no
hang
on
a
bag
of
sweets
had
spilled
out
of
fred's
pocket
and
the
contents
were
now
rolling
in
every
direction
big
fat
toffees
in
brightly
colored
wrappers
fred
scrambled
around
cramming
them
back
into
his
pocket
then
gave
the
Dursleys
a
cheery
wave
stepped
forward
and
walked
right
into
the
fire
saying
the
Burrow
aunt
Petunia
gave
a
little
shuddering
gasp
there
was
a
whooshing
sound
and
Fred
vanished
right
then
George
said
mr.
Weasley
you
and
the
trunk
harry
helped
George
carry
the
trunk
forward
into
the
flames
and
turn
it
onto
its
end
so
that
he
could
hold
it
better
then
with
a
second
whoosh
George
had
cried
the
Burrow
and
vanished
too
ron
you
next
said
mr.
Weasley
see
you
said
Ron
brightly
to
the
Dursleys
he
grinned
broadly
at
Harry
then
stepped
into
the
fire
shouted
the
Burrow
and
disappeared
now
Harry
and
mr.
Weasley
alone
remained
well
bye
then
Harry
said
to
the
Dursleys
they
didn't
say
anything
at
all
harry
moved
toward
the
fire
but
just
as
he
reached
the
edge
of
the
hearth
mr.
Weasley
put
out
a
hand
and
held
him
back
he
was
looking
at
the
Dursleys
in
amazement
harry
said
goodbye
to
you
he
said
didn't
you
hear
him
it
doesn't
matter
Harry
muttered
to
mr.
Weasley
honestly
I
don't
care
mr.
Weasley
did
not
remove
his
hand
from
harry's
shoulder
you
aren't
going
to
see
your
nephew
till
next
summer
he
said
to
Uncle
Vernon
in
mild
indignation
surely
you're
going
to
say
goodbye
uncle
vernon's
face
worked
furiously
the
idea
of
being
taught
consideration
by
a
man
who
had
just
blasted
away
half
his
living
room
wall
seemed
to
be
causing
him
intense
suffering
but
mr.
weasley's
wand
was
still
in
his
hand
and
Uncle
vernon's
tiny
eyes
darted
to
it
once
before
he
said
very
resentfully
Goodbye
then
see
you
said
Harry
putting
one
foot
forward
into
the
green
flames
which
felt
pleasantly
like
warm
breath
at
that
moment
however
a
horrible
gagging
sound
erupted
behind
him
and
Aunt
Petunia
started
to
scream
harry
wheeled
around
dudley
was
no
longer
standing
behind
his
parents
he
was
kneeling
beside
the
coffee
table
and
he
was
gagging
and
sputtering
on
a
footlong
purple
slimy
thing
that
was
protruding
from
his
mouth
one
bewildered
second
later
Harry
realized
that
the
footlong
thing
was
dudley's
tongue
and
that
a
brightly
colored
toffee
wrapper
lay
on
the
floor
before
him
aunt
Petunia
hurled
herself
onto
the
ground
beside
Dudley
seized
the
end
of
his
swollen
tongue
and
attempted
to
wrench
it
out
of
his
mouth
unsurprisingly
Dudley
yelled
and
sputtered
worse
than
ever
trying
to
fight
her
off
uncle
Vernon
was
bellowing
and
waving
his
arms
around
and
mr.
Weasley
had
to
shout
to
make
himself
heard
not
to
worry
I
can
sort
him
out
he
yelled
advancing
on
Dudley
with
his
wand
outstretched
but
Aunt
Petunia
screamed
worse
than
ever
and
threw
herself
on
top
of
Dudley
shielding
him
from
mr.
Weasley
no
really
said
mr.
Weasley
desperately
it's
a
simple
process
it
was
the
toffee
my
son
Fred
real
practical
joker
but
it's
only
an
Engorgement
Charm
at
least
I
think
it
is
please
I
can
correct
it
but
far
from
being
reassured
the
Dursleys
became
more
panic
stricken
Aunt
Petunia
was
sobbing
hysterically
tugging
dudley's
tongue
as
though
determined
to
rip
it
out
Dudley
appeared
to
be
suffocating
under
the
combined
pressure
of
his
mother
and
his
tongue
and
Uncle
Vernon
who
had
lost
control
completely
seized
a
china
figure
from
on
top
of
the
sideboard
and
threw
it
very
hard
at
mr.
Weasley
who
ducked
causing
the
ornament
to
shatter
in
the
blasted
fireplace
now
really
said
mr.
Weasley
angrily
brandishing
his
wand
i'm
trying
to
help
bellowing
like
a
wounded
hippo
Uncle
Vernon
snatched
up
another
ornament
harry
go
just
go
mr.
Weasley
shouted
his
wand
on
Uncle
Vernon
i'll
sort
this
out
harry
didn't
want
to
miss
the
fun
but
Uncle
vernon's
second
ornament
narrowly
missed
his
left
ear
and
on
balance
he
thought
it
best
to
leave
the
situation
to
Mr
weasley
he
stepped
into
the
fire
looking
over
his
shoulder
as
he
said
the
Burrow
his
last
fleeting
glimpse
of
the
living
room
was
of
mr.
Weasley
blasting
a
third
ornament
out
of
Uncle
vernon's
hand
with
his
wand
Aunt
Petunia
screaming
and
lying
on
top
of
Dudley
and
dudley's
tongue
lolling
around
like
a
great
slimy
python
but
next
moment
Harry
had
begun
to
spin
very
fast
and
the
Dursleys
living
room
was
whipped
out
of
sight
in
a
rush
of
emeraldgreen
flames
chapter
five
weasleys
wizard
wheezes
harry
spun
faster
and
faster
elbows
tucked
tightly
to
his
sides
blurred
fireplaces
flashing
past
him
until
he
started
to
feel
sick
and
closed
his
eyes
then
when
at
last
he
felt
himself
slowing
down
he
threw
out
his
hands
and
came
to
a
halt
in
time
to
prevent
himself
from
falling
face
forward
out
of
the
Weasleys
kitchen
fire
did
he
eat
it
said
Fred
excitedly
holding
out
a
hand
to
pull
Harry
to
his
fee
Yeah
said
Harry
straightening
up
what
was
it
tonTongue
Toffee
said
Fred
brightly
george
and
I
invented
them
and
we've
been
looking
for
someone
to
test
them
on
all
summer
the
tiny
kitchen
exploded
with
laughter
Harry
looked
around
and
saw
that
Ron
and
George
were
sitting
at
the
scrubbed
wooden
table
with
two
redhaired
people
Harry
had
never
seen
before
though
he
knew
immediately
who
they
must
be
Bill
and
Charlie
the
two
eldest
Weasley
brothers
how're
you
doing
Harry
said
the
nearer
of
the
two
grinning
at
him
and
holding
out
a
large
hand
which
Harry
shook
feeling
calluses
and
blisters
under
his
fingers
this
had
to
be
Charlie
who
worked
with
dragons
in
Romania
charlie
was
built
like
the
twins
shorter
and
stockier
than
Percy
and
Ron
who
were
both
long
and
lanky
he
had
a
broad
goodnatured
face
which
was
weatherbeaten
and
so
freckly
that
he
looked
almost
tanned
his
arms
were
muscular
and
one
of
them
had
a
large
shiny
burn
on
it
bill
got
to
his
feet
smiling
and
also
shook
harry's
hand
bill
came
as
something
of
a
surprise
harry
knew
that
he
worked
for
the
wizarding
bank
Gringotts
and
that
Bill
had
been
Head
Boy
at
Hogwarts
Harry
had
always
imagined
Bill
to
be
an
older
version
of
Percy
fussy
about
rulebreaking
and
fond
of
bossing
everyone
around
however
Bill
was
there
was
no
other
word
for
it
cool
he
was
tall
with
long
hair
that
he
had
tied
back
in
a
ponytail
he
was
wearing
an
earring
with
what
looked
like
a
fang
dangling
from
it
bill's
clothes
would
not
have
looked
out
of
place
at
a
rock
concert
except
that
Harry
recognized
his
boots
to
be
made
not
of
leather
but
of
dragon
hide
before
any
of
them
could
say
anything
else
there
was
a
faint
popping
noise
and
mr.
Weasley
appeared
out
of
thin
air
at
george's
shoulder
he
was
looking
angrier
than
Harry
had
ever
seen
him
that
wasn't
funny
Fred
he
shouted
what
on
earth
did
you
give
that
Muggle
boy
i
didn't
give
him
anything
said
Fred
with
another
evil
grin
i
just
dropped
it
it
was
his
fault
he
went
and
ate
it
I
never
told
him
to
you
dropped
it
on
purpose
roared
mr.
Weasley
you
knew
he'd
eat
it
you
knew
he
was
on
a
diet
how
big
did
his
tongue
get
george
asked
eagerly
it
was
four
feet
long
before
his
parents
would
let
me
shrink
it
harry
and
the
Weasleys
roared
with
laughter
again
it
isn't
funny
mr.
Weasley
shouted
that
sort
of
behavior
seriously
undermines
wizardMuggle
relations
i
spend
half
my
life
campaigning
against
the
mistreatment
of
Muggles
and
my
own
sons
We
didn't
give
it
to
him
because
he's
a
Muggle
said
Fred
indignantly
no
we
gave
it
to
him
because
he's
a
great
bullying
git
said
George
isn't
he
Harry
yeah
he
is
mr.
Weasley
said
Harry
earnestly
that's
not
the
point
raged
mr.
Weasley
you
wait
until
I
tell
your
mother
tell
me
what
said
a
voice
behind
them
mrs
weasley
had
just
entered
the
kitchen
she
was
a
short
plump
woman
with
a
very
kind
face
though
her
eyes
were
presently
narrowed
with
suspicion
oh
hello
Harry
dear
she
said
spotting
him
and
smiling
then
her
eyes
snapped
back
to
her
husband
tell
me
what
Arthur
mr.
Weasley
hesitated
harry
could
tell
that
however
angry
he
was
with
Fred
and
George
he
hadn't
really
intended
to
tell
Mrs
weasley
what
had
happened
there
was
a
silence
while
mr.
Weasley
eyed
his
wife
nervously
then
two
girls
appeared
in
the
kitchen
doorway
behind
Mrs
weasley
one
with
very
bushy
brown
hair
and
rather
large
front
teeth
was
harry's
and
ron's
friend
Hermione
Granger
the
other
who
was
small
and
redhaired
was
ron's
younger
sister
Ginny
both
of
them
smiled
at
Harry
who
grinned
back
which
made
Ginny
go
scarlet
she
had
been
very
taken
with
Harry
ever
since
his
first
visit
to
the
Burrow
tell
me
what
Arthur
mrs
weasley
repeated
in
a
dangerous
sort
of
voice
it's
nothing
Molly
mumbled
mr.
Weasley
Fred
and
George
just
but
i've
had
words
with
them
what
have
they
done
this
time
said
Mrs
weasley
if
it's
got
anything
to
do
with
Weasleys
Wizard
Wheezes
why
don't
you
show
Harry
where
he's
sleeping
Ron
said
Hermione
from
the
doorway
he
knows
where
he's
sleeping
said
Ron
in
my
room
he
slept
there
last
we
can
all
go
said
Hermione
pointedly
oh
said
Ron
cottoning
on
right
yeah
we'll
come
too
said
George
you
stay
where
you
are
snarled
Mrs
weasley
harry
and
Ron
edged
out
of
the
kitchen
and
they
Hermione
and
Ginny
set
off
along
the
narrow
hallway
and
up
the
rickety
staircase
that
zigzagged
through
the
house
to
the
upper
stories
what
are
Weasleys
Wizard
Wheezes
harry
asked
as
they
climbed
ron
and
Ginny
both
laughed
although
Hermione
didn't
mum
found
this
stack
of
order
forms
when
she
was
cleaning
Fred
and
george's
room
said
Ron
quietly
great
long
price
lists
for
stuff
they've
invented
joke
stuff
you
know
fake
wands
and
trick
sweets
loads
of
stuff
it
was
brilliant
I
never
knew
they'd
been
inventing
all
that
we've
been
hearing
explosions
out
of
their
room
for
ages
but
we
never
thought
they
were
actually
making
things
said
Ginny
we
thought
they
just
liked
the
noise
only
most
of
the
stuff
well
all
of
it
really
was
a
bit
dangerous
said
Ron
and
you
know
they
were
planning
to
sell
it
at
Hogwarts
to
make
some
money
and
Mum
went
mad
at
them
told
them
they
weren't
allowed
to
make
any
more
of
it
and
burned
all
the
order
forms
she's
furious
at
them
anyway
they
didn't
get
as
many
O
w.l.s
as
she
expected
w.l.s
were
Ordinary
Wizarding
Levels
the
examinations
Hogwarts
students
took
at
the
age
of
fifteen
and
then
there
was
this
big
row
Ginny
said
because
Mum
wants
them
to
go
into
the
Ministry
of
Magic
like
Dad
and
they
told
her
all
they
want
to
do
is
open
a
joke
shop
just
then
a
door
on
the
second
landing
opened
and
a
face
poked
out
wearing
horn
rimmed
glasses
and
a
very
annoyed
expression
hi
Percy
said
Harry
oh
hello
Harry
said
Percy
i
was
wondering
who
was
making
all
the
noise
i'm
trying
to
work
in
here
you
know
i've
got
a
report
to
finish
for
the
office
and
it's
rather
difficult
to
concentrate
when
people
keep
thundering
up
and
down
the
stairs
we're
not
thundering
said
Ron
irritably
we're
walking
sorry
if
we've
disturbed
the
topsecret
workings
of
the
Ministry
of
Magic
what
are
you
working
on
said
Harry
a
report
for
the
Department
of
International
Magical
Cooperation
said
Percy
smugly
we're
trying
to
standardize
cauldron
thickness
some
of
these
foreign
imports
are
just
a
shade
too
thin
leakages
have
been
increasing
at
a
rate
of
almost
three
percent
a
year
that'll
change
the
world
that
report
will
said
Ron
front
page
of
the
Daily
Prophet
I
expect
cauldron
leaks
percy
went
slightly
pink
you
might
sneer
Ron
he
said
heatedly
but
unless
some
sort
of
international
law
is
imposed
we
might
well
find
the
market
flooded
with
flimsy
shallow
bottomed
products
that
seriously
endanger
yeah
yeah
all
right
said
Ron
and
he
started
off
upstairs
again
percy
slammed
his
bedroom
door
shut
as
Harry
Hermione
and
Ginny
followed
Ron
up
three
more
flights
of
stairs
shouts
from
the
kitchen
below
echoed
up
to
them
it
sounded
as
though
mr.
Weasley
had
told
Mrs
weasley
about
the
toffees
the
room
at
the
top
of
the
house
where
Ron
slept
looked
much
as
it
had
the
last
time
that
Harry
had
come
to
stay
the
same
posters
of
ron's
favorite
Quidditch
team
the
Chudley
Cannons
were
whirling
and
waving
on
the
walls
and
sloping
ceiling
and
the
fish
tank
on
the
windowsill
which
had
previously
held
frog
spawn
now
contained
one
extremely
large
frog
ron's
old
rat
Scabbers
was
here
no
more
but
instead
there
was
the
tiny
gray
owl
that
had
delivered
ron's
letter
to
Harry
in
Privet
Drive
it
was
hopping
up
and
down
in
a
small
cage
and
twittering
madly
shut
up
Pig
said
Ron
edging
his
way
between
two
of
the
four
beds
that
had
been
squeezed
into
the
room
fred
and
George
are
in
here
with
us
because
Bill
and
Charlie
are
in
their
room
he
told
Harry
percy
gets
to
keep
his
room
all
to
himself
because
he's
got
to
work
er
why
are
you
calling
that
owl
Pig
harry
asked
Ron
because
he's
being
stupid
said
Ginny
Its
proper
name
is
Pigwidgeon
yeah
and
that's
not
a
stupid
name
at
all
said
Ron
sarcastically
ginny
named
him
he
explained
to
Harry
she
reckons
it's
sweet
and
I
tried
to
change
it
but
it
was
too
late
he
won't
answer
to
anything
else
so
now
he's
Pig
i've
got
to
keep
him
up
here
because
he
annoys
Errol
and
Hermes
he
annoys
me
too
come
to
that
pigwidgeon
zoomed
happily
around
his
cage
hooting
shrilly
harry
knew
Ron
too
well
to
take
him
seriously
he
had
moaned
continually
about
his
old
rat
Scabbers
but
had
been
most
upset
when
hermione's
cat
Crookshanks
appeared
to
have
eaten
him
where's
Crookshanks
harry
asked
Hermione
now
out
in
the
garden
I
expect
she
said
he
likes
chasing
gnomes
he's
never
seen
any
before
percy's
enjoying
work
then
said
Harry
sitting
down
on
one
of
the
beds
and
watching
the
Chudley
Cannons
zooming
in
and
out
of
the
posters
on
the
ceiling
enjoying
it
said
Ron
darkly
i
don't
reckon
he'd
come
home
if
Dad
didn't
make
him
he's
obsessed
just
don't
get
him
onto
the
subject
of
his
boss
according
to
mr.
Crouch
as
I
was
saying
to
mr.
Crouch
mr.
Crouch
is
of
the
opinion
mr.
Crouch
was
telling
me
they'll
be
announcing
their
engagement
any
day
now
have
you
had
a
good
summer
Harry
said
Hermione
did
you
get
our
food
parcels
and
everything
yeah
thanks
a
lot
said
Harry
they
saved
my
life
those
cakes
and
have
you
heard
from
ron
began
but
at
a
look
from
Hermione
he
fell
silent
harry
knew
Ron
had
been
about
to
ask
about
Sirius
ron
and
Hermione
had
been
so
deeply
involved
in
helping
Sirius
escape
from
the
Ministry
of
Magic
that
they
were
almost
as
concerned
about
harry's
godfather
as
he
was
however
discussing
him
in
front
of
Ginny
was
a
bad
idea
nobody
but
themselves
and
Professor
Dumbledore
knew
about
how
Sirius
had
escaped
or
believed
in
his
innocence
i
think
they've
stopped
arguing
said
Hermione
to
cover
the
awkward
moment
because
Ginny
was
looking
curiously
from
Ron
to
Harry
shall
we
go
down
and
help
your
mum
with
dinner
yeah
all
right
said
Ron
the
four
of
them
left
ron's
room
and
went
back
downstairs
to
find
Mrs
weasley
alone
in
the
kitchen
looking
extremely
bad
tempered
we're
eating
out
in
the
garden
she
said
when
they
came
in
there's
just
not
room
for
eleven
people
in
here
could
you
take
the
plates
outside
girls
bill
and
Charlie
are
setting
up
the
tables
knives
and
forks
please
you
two
she
said
to
Ron
and
Harry
pointing
her
wand
a
little
more
vigorously
than
she
had
intended
at
a
pile
of
potatoes
in
the
sink
which
shot
out
of
their
skins
so
fast
that
they
ricocheted
off
the
walls
and
ceiling
oh
for
heaven's
sake
she
snapped
now
directing
her
wand
at
a
dustpan
which
hopped
off
the
sideboard
and
started
skating
across
the
floor
scooping
up
the
potatoes
those
two
she
burst
out
savagely
now
pulling
pots
and
pans
out
of
a
cupboard
and
Harry
knew
she
meant
Fred
and
George
i
don't
know
what's
going
to
happen
to
them
I
really
don't
no
ambition
unless
you
count
making
as
much
trouble
as
they
possibly
can
mrs
weasley
slammed
a
large
copper
saucepan
down
on
the
kitchen
table
and
began
to
wave
her
wand
around
inside
it
a
creamy
sauce
poured
from
the
wand
tip
as
she
stirred
it's
not
as
though
they
haven't
got
brains
she
continued
irritably
taking
the
saucepan
over
to
the
stove
and
lighting
it
with
a
further
poke
of
her
wand
but
they're
wasting
them
and
unless
they
pull
themselves
together
soon
they'll
be
in
real
trouble
i've
had
more
owls
from
Hogwarts
about
them
than
the
rest
put
together
if
they
carry
on
the
way
they're
going
they'll
end
up
in
front
of
the
Improper
Use
of
Magic
Office
mrs
weasley
jabbed
her
wand
at
the
cutlery
drawer
which
shot
open
harry
and
Ron
both
jumped
out
of
the
way
as
several
knives
soared
out
of
it
flew
across
the
kitchen
and
began
chopping
the
potatoes
which
had
just
been
tipped
back
into
the
sink
by
the
dustpan
i
don't
know
where
we
went
wrong
with
them
said
Mrs
weasley
putting
down
her
wand
and
starting
to
pull
out
still
more
saucepans
it's
been
the
same
for
years
one
thing
after
another
and
they
won't
listen
to
oh
not
again
she
had
picked
up
her
wand
from
the
table
and
it
had
emitted
a
loud
squeak
and
turned
into
a
giant
rubber
mouse
one
of
their
fake
wands
again
she
shouted
how
many
times
have
I
told
them
not
to
leave
them
lying
around
she
grabbed
her
real
wand
and
turned
around
to
find
that
the
sauce
on
the
stove
was
smoking
c'mon
Ron
said
hurriedly
to
Harry
seizing
a
handful
of
cutlery
from
the
open
drawer
let's
go
and
help
Bill
and
Charlie
they
left
Mrs
weasley
and
headed
out
the
back
door
into
the
yard
they
had
only
gone
a
few
paces
when
hermione's
bandylegged
ginger
cat
Crookshanks
came
pelting
out
of
the
garden
bottlebrush
tail
held
high
in
the
air
chasing
what
looked
like
a
muddy
potato
on
legs
harry
recognized
it
instantly
as
a
gnome
barely
ten
inches
high
its
horny
little
feet
pattered
very
fast
as
it
sprinted
across
the
yard
and
dived
headlong
into
one
of
the
Wellington
boots
that
lay
scattered
around
the
door
harry
could
hear
the
gnome
giggling
madly
as
Crookshanks
inserted
a
paw
into
the
boot
trying
to
reach
it
meanwhile
a
very
loud
crashing
noise
was
coming
from
the
other
side
of
the
house
the
source
of
the
commotion
was
revealed
as
they
entered
the
garden
and
saw
that
Bill
and
Charlie
both
had
their
wands
out
and
were
making
two
battered
old
tables
fly
high
above
the
lawn
smashing
into
each
other
each
attempting
to
knock
the
other's
out
of
the
air
fred
and
George
were
cheering
Ginny
was
laughing
and
Hermione
was
hovering
near
the
hedge
apparently
torn
between
amusement
and
anxiety
bill's
table
caught
charlie's
with
a
huge
bang
and
knocked
one
of
its
legs
off
there
was
a
clatter
from
overhead
and
they
all
looked
up
to
see
percy's
head
poking
out
of
a
window
on
the
second
floor
will
you
keep
it
down
he
bellowed
sorry
Perce
said
Bill
grinning
how're
the
cauldron
bottoms
coming
on
very
badly
said
Percy
peevishly
and
he
slammed
the
window
shut
chuckling
Bill
and
Charlie
directed
the
tables
safely
onto
the
grass
end
to
end
and
then
with
a
flick
of
his
wand
Bill
reattached
the
table
leg
and
conjured
tablecloths
from
nowhere
by
seven
o'clock
the
two
tables
were
groaning
under
dishes
and
dishes
of
Mrs
weasley's
excellent
cooking
and
the
nine
Weasleys
Harry
and
Hermione
were
settling
themselves
down
to
eat
beneath
a
clear
deepblue
sky
to
somebody
who
had
been
living
on
meals
of
increasingly
stale
cake
all
summer
this
was
paradise
and
at
first
Harry
listened
rather
than
talked
as
he
helped
himself
to
chicken
and
ham
pie
boiled
potatoes
and
salad
at
the
far
end
of
the
table
Percy
was
telling
his
father
all
about
his
report
on
cauldron
bottoms
i've
told
mr.
Crouch
that
i'll
have
it
ready
by
Tuesday
Percy
was
saying
pompously
that's
a
bit
sooner
than
he
expected
it
but
I
like
to
keep
on
top
of
things
i
think
he'll
be
grateful
i've
done
it
in
good
time
I
mean
its
extremely
busy
in
our
department
just
now
what
with
all
the
arrangements
for
the
World
Cup
we're
just
not
getting
the
support
we
need
from
the
Department
of
Magical
Games
and
Sports
ludo
Bagman
i
like
Ludo
said
mr.
Weasley
mildly
he
was
the
one
who
got
us
such
good
tickets
for
the
Cup
i
did
him
a
bit
of
a
favor
His
brother
Otto
got
into
a
spot
of
trouble
a
lawnmower
with
unnatural
powers
I
smoothed
the
whole
thing
over
oh
bagman's
likable
enough
of
course
said
Percy
dismissively
but
how
he
ever
got
to
be
Head
of
Department
when
I
compare
him
to
mr.
Crouch
i
can't
see
mr.
Crouch
losing
a
member
of
our
department
and
not
trying
to
find
out
what's
happened
to
them
you
realize
Bertha
Jorkins
has
been
missing
for
over
a
month
now
went
on
holiday
to
Albania
and
never
came
back
yes
I
was
asking
Ludo
about
that
said
mr.
Weasley
frowning
he
says
bertha's
gotten
lost
plenty
of
times
before
now
though
must
say
if
it
was
someone
in
my
department
i'd
be
worried
oh
bertha's
hopeless
all
right
said
Percy
i
hear
she's
been
shunted
from
department
to
department
for
years
much
more
trouble
than
she's
worth
but
all
the
same
Bagman
ought
to
be
trying
to
find
her
mr.
Crouch
has
been
taking
a
personal
interest
she
worked
in
our
department
at
one
time
you
know
and
I
think
mr.
Crouch
was
quite
fond
of
her
but
Bagman
just
keeps
laughing
and
saying
she
probably
misread
the
map
and
ended
up
in
Australia
instead
of
Albania
however
percy
heaved
an
impressive
sigh
and
took
a
deep
swig
of
elderflower
wine
we've
got
quite
enough
on
our
plates
at
the
Department
of
International
Magical
Cooperation
without
trying
to
find
members
of
other
departments
too
as
you
know
we've
got
another
big
event
to
organize
right
after
the
World
Cup
percy
cleared
his
throat
significantly
and
looked
down
toward
the
end
of
the
table
where
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
were
sitting
you
know
the
one
i'm
talking
about
Father
he
raised
his
voice
slightly
the
topsecret
one
ron
rolled
his
eyes
and
muttered
to
Harry
and
Hermione
he's
been
trying
to
get
us
to
ask
what
that
event
is
ever
since
he
started
work
probably
an
exhibition
of
thickbottomed
cauldrons
in
the
middle
of
the
table
Mrs
weasley
was
arguing
with
Bill
about
his
earring
which
seemed
to
be
a
recent
acquisition
with
a
horrible
great
fang
on
it
really
Bill
what
do
they
say
at
the
bank
mum
no
one
at
the
bank
gives
a
damn
how
I
dress
as
long
as
I
bring
home
plenty
of
treasure
said
Bill
patiently
and
your
hair's
getting
silly
dear
said
Mrs
weasley
fingering
her
wand
lovingly
i
wish
you'd
let
me
give
it
a
trim
i
like
it
said
Ginny
who
was
sitting
beside
Bill
you're
so
oldfashioned
Mum
anyway
it's
nowhere
near
as
long
as
Professor
dumbledore's
next
to
Mrs
weasley
Fred
George
and
Charlie
were
all
talking
spiritedly
about
the
World
Cup
it's
got
to
be
Ireland
said
Charlie
thickly
through
a
mouthful
of
potato
they
flattened
Peru
in
the
semifinals
bulgaria
has
got
Viktor
Krum
though
said
Fred
krum's
one
decent
player
Ireland
has
got
seven
said
Charlie
shortly
i
wish
England
had
got
through
that
was
embarrassing
that
was
what
happened
said
Harry
eagerly
regretting
more
than
ever
his
isolation
from
the
wizarding
world
when
he
was
stuck
on
Privet
Drive
went
down
to
Transylvania
three
hundred
and
ninety
to
ten
said
Charlie
gloomily
shocking
performance
and
Wales
lost
to
Uganda
and
Scotland
was
slaughtered
by
Luxembourg
harry
had
been
on
the
Gryffindor
House
Quidditch
team
ever
since
his
first
year
at
Hogwarts
and
owned
one
of
the
best
racing
brooms
in
the
world
a
Firebolt
flying
came
more
naturally
to
Harry
than
anything
else
in
the
magical
world
and
he
played
in
the
position
of
Seeker
on
the
Gryffindor
House
team
mr.
Weasley
conjured
up
candles
to
light
the
darkening
garden
before
they
had
their
homemade
strawberry
ice
cream
and
by
the
time
they
had
finished
moths
were
fluttering
low
over
the
table
and
the
warm
air
was
perfumed
with
the
smells
of
grass
and
honeysuckle
harry
was
feeling
extremely
well
fed
and
at
peace
with
the
world
as
he
watched
several
gnomes
sprinting
through
the
rosebushes
laughing
madly
and
closely
pursued
by
Crookshanks
ron
looked
carefully
up
the
table
to
check
that
the
rest
of
the
family
were
all
busy
talking
then
he
said
very
quietly
to
Harry
So
have
you
heard
from
Sirius
lately
hermione
looked
around
listening
closely
yeah
said
Harry
softly
twice
he
sounds
okay
i
wrote
to
him
yesterday
he
might
write
back
while
i'm
here
he
suddenly
remembered
the
reason
he
had
written
to
Sirius
and
for
a
moment
was
on
the
verge
of
telling
Ron
and
Hermione
about
his
scar
hurting
again
and
about
the
dream
that
had
awoken
him
but
he
really
didn't
want
to
worry
them
just
now
not
when
he
himself
was
feeling
so
happy
and
peaceful
look
at
the
time
Mrs
weasley
said
suddenly
checking
her
wristwatch
you
really
should
be
in
bed
the
whole
lot
of
you
you'll
be
up
at
the
crack
of
dawn
to
get
to
the
Cup
harry
if
you
leave
your
school
list
out
i'll
get
your
things
for
you
tomorrow
in
Diagon
Alley
i'm
getting
everyone
else's
there
might
not
be
time
after
the
World
Cup
the
match
went
on
for
five
days
last
time
wow
hope
it
does
this
time
said
Harry
enthusiastically
well
I
certainly
don't
said
Percy
sanctimoniously
i
shudder
to
think
what
the
state
of
my
intray
would
be
if
I
was
away
from
work
for
five
days
yeah
someone
might
slip
dragon
dung
in
it
again
eh
Perce
said
Fred
that
was
a
sample
of
fertilizer
from
Norway
said
Percy
going
very
red
in
the
face
it
was
nothing
personal
it
was
Fred
whispered
to
Harry
as
they
got
up
from
the
table
we
sent
it
chapter
six
the
portkey
harry
felt
as
though
he
had
barely
lain
down
to
steep
in
ron's
room
when
he
was
being
shaken
awake
by
Mrs
weasley
time
to
go
Harry
dear
she
whispered
moving
away
to
wake
Ron
harry
felt
around
for
his
glasses
put
them
on
and
sat
up
it
was
still
dark
outside
ron
muttered
indistinctly
as
his
mother
roused
him
at
the
foot
of
harry's
mattress
he
saw
two
large
disheveled
shapes
emerging
from
tangles
of
blankets
s
time
already
said
Fred
groggily
they
dressed
in
silence
too
sleepy
to
talk
then
yawning
and
stretching
the
four
of
them
headed
downstairs
into
the
kitchen
mrs
weasley
was
stirring
the
contents
of
a
large
pot
on
the
stove
while
Mr
weasley
was
sitting
at
the
table
checking
a
sheaf
of
large
parchment
tickets
he
looked
up
as
the
boys
entered
and
spread
his
arms
so
that
they
could
see
his
clothes
more
clearly
he
was
wearing
what
appeared
to
be
a
golfing
sweater
and
a
very
old
pair
of
jeans
slightly
too
big
for
him
and
held
up
with
a
thick
leather
belt
what
d'you
think
he
asked
anxiously
we're
supposed
to
go
incognito
do
I
look
like
a
Muggle
Harry
yeah
said
Harry
smiling
very
good
where're
Bill
and
Charlie
and
PerPerPercy
said
George
failing
to
stifle
a
huge
yawn
well
they're
Apparating
aren't
they
said
Mrs
weasley
heaving
the
large
pot
over
to
the
table
and
starting
to
ladle
porridge
into
bowls
so
they
can
have
a
bit
of
a
liein
harry
knew
that
Apparating
meant
disappearing
from
one
place
and
reappearing
almost
instantly
in
another
but
had
never
known
any
Hogwarts
student
to
do
it
and
understood
that
it
was
very
difficult
so
they're
still
in
bed
said
Fred
grumpily
pulling
his
bowl
of
porridge
toward
him
why
can't
we
Apparate
too
because
you're
not
of
age
and
you
haven't
passed
your
test
snapped
Mrs
weasley
and
where
have
those
girls
got
to
she
bustled
out
of
the
kitchen
and
they
heard
her
climbing
the
stairs
you
have
to
pass
a
test
to
Apparate
harry
asked
oh
yes
said
mr.
Weasley
tucking
the
tickets
safely
into
the
back
pocket
of
his
jeans
the
Department
of
Magical
Transportation
had
to
fine
a
couple
of
people
the
other
day
for
Apparating
without
a
license
it's
not
easy
Apparition
and
when
it's
not
done
property
it
can
lead
to
nasty
complications
this
pair
i'm
talking
about
went
and
splinched
themselves
everyone
around
the
table
except
Harry
winced
er
splinched
said
Harry
they
left
half
of
themselves
behind
said
mr.
Weasley
now
spooning
large
amounts
of
treacle
onto
his
porridge
so
of
course
they
were
stuck
couldn't
move
either
way
had
to
wait
for
the
Accidental
Magic
Reversal
Squad
to
sort
them
out
meant
a
fair
old
bit
of
paperwork
I
can
tell
you
what
with
the
Muggles
who
spotted
the
body
parts
they'd
left
behind
harry
had
a
sudden
vision
of
a
pair
of
legs
and
an
eyeball
lying
abandoned
on
the
pavement
of
Privet
Drive
were
they
okay
he
asked
startled
oh
yes
said
mr.
Weasley
matteroffactly
but
they
got
a
heavy
fine
and
I
don't
think
they'll
be
trying
it
again
in
a
hurry
you
don't
mess
around
with
Apparition
there
are
plenty
of
adult
wizards
who
don't
bother
with
it
prefer
brooms
slower
but
safer
but
Bill
and
Charlie
and
Percy
can
all
do
it
charlie
had
to
take
the
test
twice
said
Fred
grinning
he
failed
the
first
time
apparated
five
miles
south
of
where
he
meant
to
right
on
top
of
some
poor
old
dear
doing
her
shopping
remember
yes
well
he
passed
the
second
time
said
Mrs
weasley
marching
back
into
the
kitchen
amid
hearty
sniggers
percy
only
passed
two
weeks
ago
said
George
he's
been
Apparating
downstairs
every
morning
since
just
to
prove
he
can
there
were
footsteps
down
the
passageway
and
Hermione
and
Ginny
came
into
the
kitchen
both
looking
pale
and
drowsy
why
do
we
have
to
be
up
so
early
ginny
said
rubbing
her
eyes
and
sitting
down
at
the
table
we've
got
a
bit
of
a
walk
said
mr.
Weasley
walk
said
Harry
what
are
we
walking
to
the
World
Cup
no
no
that's
miles
away
said
mr.
Weasley
smiling
we
only
need
to
walk
a
short
way
it's
just
that
it's
very
difficult
for
a
large
number
of
wizards
to
congregate
without
attracting
Muggle
attention
we
have
to
be
very
careful
about
how
we
travel
at
the
best
of
times
and
on
a
huge
occasion
like
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
george
said
Mrs
weasley
sharply
and
they
all
jumped
what
said
George
in
an
innocent
tone
that
deceived
nobody
what
is
that
in
your
pocket
nothing
don't
you
lie
to
me
mrs
weasley
pointed
her
wand
at
george's
pocket
and
said
Accio
several
small
brightly
colored
objects
zoomed
out
of
george's
pocket
he
made
a
grab
for
them
but
missed
and
they
sped
right
into
Mrs
weasley's
outstretched
hand
we
told
you
to
destroy
them
said
Mrs
weasley
furiously
holding
up
what
were
unmistakably
more
TonTongue
Toffees
we
told
you
to
get
rid
of
the
lot
empty
your
pockets
go
on
both
of
you
it
was
an
unpleasant
scene
the
twins
had
evidently
been
trying
to
smuggle
as
many
toffees
out
of
the
house
as
possible
and
it
was
only
by
using
her
Summoning
Charm
that
Mrs
weasley
managed
to
find
them
all
accio
accio
accio
she
shouted
and
toffees
zoomed
from
all
sorts
of
unlikely
places
including
the
lining
of
george's
jacket
and
the
turnups
of
fred's
jeans
we
spent
six
months
developing
those
fred
shouted
at
his
mother
as
she
threw
the
toffees
away
oh
a
fine
way
to
spend
six
months
she
shrieked
no
wonder
you
didn't
get
more
O
w.l.s
all
in
all
the
atmosphere
was
not
very
friendly
as
they
took
their
departure
mrs
weasley
was
still
glowering
as
she
kissed
mr.
Weasley
on
the
cheek
though
not
nearly
as
much
as
the
twins
who
had
each
hoisted
their
rucksacks
onto
their
backs
and
walked
out
without
a
word
to
her
well
have
a
lovely
time
said
Mrs
weasley
and
behave
yourselves
she
called
after
the
twins
retreating
backs
but
they
did
not
look
back
or
answer
i'll
send
Bill
Charlie
and
Percy
along
around
midday
Mrs
weasley
said
to
Mr
weasley
as
he
Harry
Ron
Hermione
and
Ginny
set
off
across
the
dark
yard
after
Fred
and
George
it
was
chilly
and
the
moon
was
still
out
only
a
dull
greenish
tinge
along
the
horizon
to
their
right
showed
that
daybreak
was
drawing
closer
harry
having
been
thinking
about
thousands
of
wizards
speeding
toward
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
sped
up
to
walk
with
mr.
Weasley
so
how
does
everyone
get
there
without
all
the
Muggles
noticing
he
asked
it's
been
a
massive
organizational
problem
sighed
mr.
Weasley
the
trouble
is
about
a
hundred
thousand
wizards
turn
up
at
the
World
Cup
and
of
course
we
just
haven't
got
a
magical
site
big
enough
to
accommodate
them
all
there
are
places
Muggles
can't
penetrate
but
imagine
trying
to
pack
a
hundred
thousand
wizards
into
Diagon
Alley
or
platform
nine
and
threequarters
so
we
had
to
find
a
nice
deserted
moor
and
set
up
as
many
antiMuggle
precautions
as
possible
the
whole
ministry's
been
working
on
it
for
months
first
of
course
we
have
to
stagger
the
arrivals
people
with
cheaper
tickets
have
to
arrive
two
weeks
beforehand
a
limited
number
use
Muggle
transport
but
we
can't
have
too
many
clogging
up
their
buses
and
trains
remember
wizards
are
coming
from
all
over
the
world
some
Apparate
of
course
but
we
have
to
set
up
safe
points
for
them
to
appear
well
away
from
Muggles
i
believe
there's
a
handy
wood
they're
using
as
the
Apparition
point
for
those
who
don't
want
to
Apparate
or
can't
we
use
Portkeys
they're
objects
that
are
used
to
transport
wizards
from
one
spot
to
another
at
a
prearranged
time
you
can
do
large
groups
at
a
time
if
you
need
to
there
have
been
two
hundred
Portkeys
placed
at
strategic
points
around
Britain
and
the
nearest
one
to
us
is
up
at
the
top
of
Stoatshead
Hill
so
that's
where
we're
headed
mr.
Weasley
pointed
ahead
of
them
where
a
large
black
mass
rose
beyond
the
village
of
Ottery
st.
Catchpole
what
sort
of
objects
are
Portkeys
said
Harry
curiously
well
they
can
be
anything
said
mr.
Weasley
unobtrusive
things
obviously
so
Muggles
don't
go
picking
them
up
and
playing
with
them
stuff
they'll
just
think
is
litter
they
trudged
down
the
dark
dank
lane
toward
the
village
the
silence
broken
only
by
their
footsteps
the
sky
lightened
very
slowly
as
they
made
their
way
through
the
village
its
inky
blackness
diluting
to
deepest
blue
harry's
hands
and
feet
were
freezing
mr.
Weasley
kept
checking
his
watch
they
didn't
have
breath
to
spare
for
talking
as
they
began
to
climb
Stoatshead
Hill
stumbling
occasionally
in
hidden
rabbit
holes
slipping
on
thick
black
tuffets
of
grass
each
breath
Harry
took
was
sharp
in
his
chest
and
his
legs
were
starting
to
seize
up
when
at
last
his
feet
found
level
ground
whew
panted
mr.
Weasley
taking
off
his
glasses
and
wiping
them
on
his
sweater
well
we've
made
good
time
we've
got
ten
minutes
hermione
came
over
the
crest
of
the
hill
last
clutching
a
stitch
in
her
side
now
we
just
need
the
Portkey
said
mr.
Weasley
replacing
his
glasses
and
squinting
around
at
the
ground
it
won't
be
big
come
on
they
spread
out
searching
they
had
only
been
at
it
for
a
couple
of
minutes
however
when
a
shout
rent
the
still
air
over
here
Arthur
over
here
son
we've
got
it
two
tall
figures
were
silhouetted
against
the
starry
sky
on
the
other
side
of
the
hilltop
amos
said
mr.
Weasley
smiling
as
he
strode
over
to
the
man
who
had
shouted
the
rest
of
them
followed
mr.
Weasley
was
shaking
hands
with
a
ruddyfaced
wizard
with
a
scrubby
brown
beard
who
was
holding
a
moldylooking
old
boot
in
his
other
hand
this
is
Amos
Diggory
everyone
said
mr.
Weasley
he
works
for
the
Department
for
the
Regulation
and
Control
of
Magical
Creatures
and
I
think
you
know
his
son
Cedric
cedric
Diggory
was
an
extremely
handsome
boy
of
around
seventeen
he
was
Captain
and
Seeker
of
the
Hufflepuff
House
Quidditch
team
at
Hogwarts
hi
said
Cedric
looking
around
at
them
all
everybody
said
hi
back
except
Fred
and
George
who
merely
nodded
they
had
never
quite
forgiven
Cedric
for
beating
their
team
Gryffindor
in
the
first
Quidditch
match
of
the
previous
year
long
walk
Arthur
cedric's
father
asked
not
too
bad
said
mr.
Weasley
we
live
just
on
the
other
side
of
the
village
there
you
had
to
get
up
at
two
didn't
we
Ced
i
tell
you
i'll
be
glad
when
he's
got
his
Apparition
test
still
not
complaining
quidditch
World
Cup
wouldn't
miss
it
for
a
sackful
of
Galleons
and
the
tickets
cost
about
that
mind
you
looks
like
I
got
off
easy
amos
Diggory
peered
goodnaturedly
around
at
the
three
Weasley
boys
Harry
Hermione
and
Ginny
all
these
yours
Arthur
oh
no
only
the
redheads
said
mr.
Weasley
pointing
out
his
children
this
is
Hermione
friend
of
ron's
and
Harry
another
friend
merlin's
beard
said
Amos
Diggory
his
eyes
widening
harry
harry
Potter
er
yeah
said
Harry
harry
was
used
to
people
looking
curiously
at
him
when
they
met
him
used
to
the
way
their
eyes
moved
at
once
to
the
lightning
scar
on
his
forehead
but
it
always
made
him
feel
uncomfortable
ced's
talked
about
you
of
course
said
Amos
Diggory
told
us
all
about
playing
against
you
last
year
i
said
to
him
I
said
Ced
that'll
be
something
to
tell
your
grandchildren
that
will
you
beat
Harry
Potter
harry
couldn't
think
of
any
reply
to
this
so
he
remained
silent
fred
and
George
were
both
scowling
again
cedric
looked
slightly
embarrassed
harry
fell
off
his
broom
Dad
he
muttered
i
told
you
it
was
an
accident
yes
but
you
didn't
fall
off
did
you
roared
Amos
genially
slapping
his
son
on
his
back
always
modest
our
Ced
always
the
gentleman
but
the
best
man
won
i'm
sure
harry'd
say
the
same
wouldn't
you
eh
one
falls
off
his
broom
one
stays
on
you
don't
need
to
be
a
genius
to
tell
which
one's
the
better
flier
must
be
nearly
time
said
mr.
Weasley
quickly
pulling
out
his
watch
again
do
you
know
whether
we're
waiting
for
any
more
Amos
no
the
Lovegoods
have
been
there
for
a
week
already
and
the
Fawcetts
couldn't
get
tickets
said
mr.
Diggory
there
aren't
any
more
of
us
in
this
area
are
there
not
that
I
know
of
said
mr.
Weasley
yes
it's
a
minute
off
we'd
better
get
ready
he
looked
around
at
Harry
and
Hermione
you
just
need
to
touch
the
Portkey
that's
all
a
finger
will
do
with
difficulty
owing
to
their
bulky
backpacks
the
nine
of
them
crowded
around
the
old
boot
held
out
by
Amos
Diggory
they
all
stood
there
in
a
tight
circle
as
a
chill
breeze
swept
over
the
hilltop
nobody
spoke
it
suddenly
occurred
to
Harry
how
odd
this
would
look
if
a
Muggle
were
to
walk
up
here
now
nine
people
two
of
them
grown
men
clutching
this
manky
old
boot
in
the
semidarkness
waiting
three
muttered
mr.
Weasley
one
eye
still
on
his
watch
two
one
it
happened
immediately
Harry
felt
as
though
a
hook
just
behind
his
navel
had
been
suddenly
jerked
irresistibly
forward
his
feet
left
the
ground
he
could
feel
Ron
and
Hermione
on
either
side
of
him
their
shoulders
banging
into
his
they
were
all
speeding
forward
in
a
howl
of
wind
and
swirling
color
his
forefinger
was
stuck
to
the
boot
as
though
it
was
pulling
him
magnetically
onward
and
then
His
feet
slammed
into
the
ground
Ron
staggered
into
him
and
he
fell
over
the
Portkey
hit
the
ground
near
his
head
with
a
heavy
thud
harry
looked
up
mr.
Weasley
mr.
Diggory
and
Cedric
were
still
standing
though
looking
very
windswept
everybody
else
was
on
the
ground
seven
past
five
from
Stoatshead
Hill
said
a
voice
chapter
seven
bagman
and
crouch
harry
disentangled
himself
from
Ron
and
got
to
his
feet
they
had
arrived
on
what
appeared
to
be
a
deserted
stretch
of
misty
moor
in
front
of
them
was
a
pair
of
tired
and
grumpylooking
wizards
one
of
whom
was
holding
a
large
gold
watch
the
other
a
thick
roll
of
parchment
and
a
quill
both
were
dressed
as
Muggles
though
very
inexpertly
The
man
with
the
watch
wore
a
tweed
suit
with
thigh
length
galoshes
his
colleague
a
kilt
and
a
poncho
morning
Basil
said
mr.
Weasley
picking
up
the
boot
and
handing
it
to
the
kilted
wizard
who
threw
it
into
a
large
box
of
used
Portkeys
beside
him
Harry
could
see
an
old
newspaper
an
empty
drinks
can
and
a
punctured
football
hello
there
Arthur
said
Basil
wearily
not
on
duty
eh
it's
all
right
for
some
we've
been
here
all
night
you'd
better
get
out
of
the
way
we've
got
a
big
party
coming
in
from
the
Black
Forest
at
five
fifteen
hang
on
i'll
find
your
campsite
weasley
weasley
he
consulted
his
parchment
list
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile's
walk
over
there
first
field
you
come
to
site
manager's
called
mr.
Roberts
diggory
second
field
ask
for
mr.
Payne
thanks
Basil
said
mr.
Weasley
and
he
beckoned
everyone
to
follow
him
they
set
off
across
the
deserted
moor
unable
to
make
out
much
through
the
mist
after
about
twenty
minutes
a
small
stone
cottage
next
to
a
gate
swam
into
view
beyond
it
Harry
could
just
make
out
the
ghostly
shapes
of
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
tents
rising
up
the
gentle
slope
of
a
large
field
toward
a
dark
wood
on
the
horizon
they
said
goodbye
to
the
Diggorys
and
approached
the
cottage
door
a
man
was
standing
in
the
doorway
looking
out
at
the
tents
harry
knew
at
a
glance
that
this
was
the
only
real
Muggle
for
several
acres
when
he
heard
their
footsteps
he
turned
his
head
to
look
at
them
morning
said
mr.
Weasley
brightly
morning
said
the
Muggle
would
you
be
mr.
Roberts
aye
I
would
said
mr.
Roberts
and
who're
you
weasley
two
tents
booked
a
couple
of
days
ago
aye
said
mr.
Roberts
consulting
a
list
tacked
to
the
door
you've
got
a
space
up
by
the
wood
there
just
the
one
night
that's
it
said
mr.
Weasley
you'll
be
paying
now
then
said
mr.
Roberts
ah
right
certainly
said
mr.
Weasley
he
retreated
a
short
distance
from
the
cottage
and
beckoned
Harry
toward
him
help
me
Harry
he
muttered
pulling
a
roll
of
Muggle
money
from
his
pocket
and
starting
to
peel
the
notes
apart
this
one's
a
a
a
ten
ah
yes
I
see
the
little
number
on
it
now
so
this
is
a
five
a
twenty
Harry
corrected
him
in
an
undertone
uncomfortably
aware
of
Mr
roberts
trying
to
catch
every
word
ah
yes
so
it
is
i
don't
know
these
little
bits
of
paper
you
foreign
said
mr.
Roberts
as
mr.
Weasley
returned
with
the
correct
notes
foreign
repeated
mr.
Weasley
puzzled
you're
not
the
first
one
who's
had
trouble
with
money
said
mr.
Roberts
scrutinizing
mr.
Weasley
closely
i
had
two
try
and
pay
me
with
great
gold
coins
the
size
of
hubcaps
ten
minutes
ago
did
you
really
said
mr.
Weasley
nervously
mr.
Roberts
rummaged
around
in
a
tin
for
some
change
never
been
this
crowded
he
said
suddenly
looking
out
over
the
misty
field
again
hundreds
of
prebookings
people
usually
just
turn
up
is
that
right
said
mr.
Weasley
his
hand
held
out
for
his
change
but
Mr
roberts
didn't
give
it
to
him
aye
he
said
thoughtfully
people
from
all
over
loads
of
foreigners
and
not
just
foreigners
weirdos
you
know
there's
a
bloke
walking
round
in
a
kilt
and
a
poncho
shouldn't
he
said
mr.
Weasley
anxiously
it's
like
some
sort
of
i
dunno
like
some
sort
of
rally
said
mr.
Roberts
they
all
seem
to
know
each
other
like
a
big
party
at
that
moment
a
wizard
in
plusfours
appeared
out
of
thin
air
next
to
Mr
roberts's
front
door
obliviate
he
said
sharply
pointing
his
wand
at
mr.
Roberts
instantly
mr.
roberts's
eyes
slid
out
of
focus
his
brows
unknitted
and
a
took
of
dreamy
unconcern
fell
over
his
face
harry
recognized
the
symptoms
of
one
who
had
just
had
his
memory
modified
a
map
of
the
campsite
for
you
mr.
Roberts
said
placidly
to
mr.
Weasley
and
your
change
thanks
very
much
said
mr.
Weasley
the
wizard
in
plusfours
accompanied
them
toward
the
gate
to
the
campsite
he
looked
exhausted
His
chin
was
blue
with
stubble
and
there
were
deep
purple
shadows
under
his
eyes
once
out
of
earshot
of
mr.
Roberts
he
muttered
to
Mr
weasley
Been
having
a
lot
of
trouble
with
him
needs
a
Memory
Charm
ten
times
a
day
to
keep
him
happy
and
Ludo
bagman's
not
helping
trotting
around
talking
about
Bludgers
and
Quaffles
at
the
top
of
his
voice
not
a
worry
about
anti
Muggle
security
Blimey
i'll
be
glad
when
this
is
over
see
you
later
Arthur
he
Disapparated
i
thought
mr.
Bagman
was
Head
of
Magical
Games
and
Sports
said
Ginny
looking
surprised
he
should
know
better
than
to
talk
about
Bludgers
near
Muggles
shouldn't
he
he
should
said
mr.
Weasley
smiling
and
leading
them
through
the
gates
into
the
campsite
but
ludo's
always
been
a
bit
well
lax
about
security
you
couldn't
wish
for
a
more
enthusiastic
head
of
the
sports
department
though
he
played
Quidditch
for
England
himself
you
know
and
he
was
the
best
Beater
the
Wimbourne
Wasps
ever
had
they
trudged
up
the
misty
field
between
long
rows
of
tents
most
looked
almost
ordinary
their
owners
had
clearly
tried
to
make
them
as
Mugglelike
as
possible
but
had
slipped
up
by
adding
chimneys
or
bellpulls
or
weather
vanes
however
here
and
there
was
a
tent
so
obviously
magical
that
Harry
could
hardly
be
surprised
that
mr.
Roberts
was
getting
suspicious
halfway
up
the
field
stood
an
extravagant
confection
of
striped
silk
like
a
miniature
palace
with
several
live
peacocks
tethered
at
the
entrance
a
little
farther
on
they
passed
a
tent
that
had
three
floors
and
several
turrets
and
a
short
way
beyond
that
was
a
tent
that
had
a
front
garden
attached
complete
with
birdbath
sundial
and
fountain
always
the
same
said
mr.
Weasley
smiling
we
can't
resist
showing
off
when
we
get
together
ah
here
we
are
look
this
is
us
they
had
reached
the
very
edge
of
the
wood
at
the
top
of
the
field
and
here
was
an
empty
space
with
a
small
sign
hammered
into
the
ground
that
read
weezly
couldn't
have
a
better
spot
said
mr.
Weasley
happily
the
field
is
just
on
the
other
side
of
the
wood
there
we're
as
close
as
we
could
be
he
hoisted
his
backpack
from
his
shoulders
right
he
said
excitedly
no
magic
allowed
strictly
speaking
not
when
we're
out
in
these
numbers
on
Muggle
land
we'll
be
putting
these
tents
up
by
hand
shouldn't
be
too
difficult
muggles
do
it
all
the
time
here
Harry
where
do
you
reckon
we
should
start
harry
had
never
been
camping
in
his
life
the
Dursleys
had
never
taken
him
on
any
kind
of
holiday
preferring
to
leave
him
with
Mrs
figg
an
old
neighbor
however
he
and
Hermione
worked
out
where
most
of
the
poles
and
pegs
should
go
and
though
mr.
Weasley
was
more
of
a
hindrance
than
a
help
because
he
got
thoroughly
overexcited
when
it
came
to
using
the
mallet
they
finally
managed
to
erect
a
pair
of
shabby
twoman
tents
all
of
them
stood
back
to
admire
their
handiwork
nobody
looking
at
these
tents
would
guess
they
belonged
to
wizards
Harry
thought
but
the
trouble
was
that
once
Bill
Charlie
and
Percy
arrived
they
would
be
a
party
of
ten
hermione
seemed
to
have
spotted
this
problem
too
she
gave
Harry
a
quizzical
look
as
Mr
weasley
dropped
to
his
hands
and
knees
and
entered
the
first
tent
we'll
be
a
bit
cramped
he
called
but
I
think
we'll
all
squeeze
in
come
and
have
a
look
harry
bent
down
ducked
under
the
tent
flap
and
felt
his
jaw
drop
he
had
walked
into
what
looked
like
an
oldfashioned
three
room
flat
complete
with
bathroom
and
kitchen
oddly
enough
it
was
furnished
in
exactly
the
same
sort
of
style
as
Mrs
figg's
house
There
were
crocheted
covers
on
the
mismatched
chairs
and
a
strong
smell
of
cats
well
it's
not
for
long
said
mr.
Weasley
mopping
his
bald
patch
with
a
handkerchief
and
peering
in
at
the
four
bunk
beds
that
stood
in
the
bedroom
i
borrowed
this
from
Perkins
at
the
office
doesn't
camp
much
anymore
poor
fellow
he's
got
lumbago
he
picked
up
the
dusty
kettle
and
peered
inside
it
we'll
need
water
there's
a
tap
marked
on
this
map
the
Muggle
gave
us
said
Ron
who
had
followed
Harry
inside
the
tent
and
seemed
completely
unimpressed
by
its
extraordinary
inner
proportions
it's
on
the
other
side
of
the
field
well
why
don't
you
Harry
and
Hermione
go
and
get
us
some
water
then
Mr
weasley
handed
over
the
kettle
and
a
couple
of
saucepans
and
the
rest
of
us
will
get
some
wood
for
a
fire
but
we've
got
an
oven
said
Ron
why
can't
we
just
ron
antiMuggle
security
said
mr.
Weasley
his
face
shining
with
anticipation
when
real
Muggles
camp
they
cook
on
fires
outdoors
i've
seen
them
at
it
after
a
quick
tour
of
the
girls
tent
which
was
slightly
smaller
than
the
boys
though
without
the
smell
of
cats
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
set
off
across
the
campsite
with
the
kettle
and
saucepans
now
with
the
sun
newly
risen
and
the
mist
lifting
they
could
see
the
city
of
tents
that
stretched
in
every
direction
they
made
their
way
slowly
through
the
rows
staring
eagerly
around
it
was
only
just
dawning
on
Harry
how
many
witches
and
wizards
there
must
be
in
the
world
he
had
never
really
thought
much
about
those
in
other
countries
their
fellow
campers
were
starting
to
wake
up
first
to
stir
were
the
families
with
small
children
Harry
had
never
seen
witches
and
wizards
this
young
before
a
tiny
boy
no
older
than
two
was
crouched
outside
a
large
pyramidshaped
tent
holding
a
wand
and
poking
happily
at
a
slug
in
the
grass
which
was
swelling
slowly
to
the
size
of
a
salami
as
they
drew
level
with
him
his
mother
came
hurrying
out
of
the
tent
how
many
times
Kevin
you
don't
touch
daddy's
wand
yecchh
she
had
trodden
on
the
giant
slug
which
burst
her
scolding
carried
after
them
on
the
still
air
mingling
with
the
little
boy's
yells
You
bust
slug
you
bust
slug
a
short
way
farther
on
they
saw
two
little
witches
barely
older
than
Kevin
who
were
riding
toy
broomsticks
that
rose
only
high
enough
for
the
girls
toes
to
skim
the
dewy
grass
a
Ministry
wizard
had
already
spotted
them
as
he
hurried
past
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
he
muttered
distractedly
In
broad
daylight
parents
having
a
liein
I
suppose
here
and
there
adult
wizards
and
witches
were
emerging
from
their
tents
and
starting
to
cook
breakfast
some
with
furtive
looks
around
them
conjured
fires
with
their
wands
others
were
striking
matches
with
dubious
looks
on
their
faces
as
though
sure
this
couldn't
work
three
African
wizards
sat
in
serious
conversation
all
of
them
wearing
long
white
robes
and
roasting
what
looked
like
a
rabbit
on
a
bright
purple
fire
while
a
group
of
middleaged
American
witches
sat
gossiping
happily
beneath
a
spangled
banner
stretched
between
their
tents
that
read
the
salem
witches
institute
harry
caught
snatches
of
conversation
in
strange
languages
from
the
inside
of
tents
they
passed
and
though
he
couldn't
understand
a
word
the
tone
of
every
single
voice
was
excited
er
is
it
my
eyes
or
has
everything
gone
green
said
Ron
it
wasn't
just
ron's
eyes
they
had
walked
into
a
patch
of
tents
that
were
all
covered
with
a
thick
growth
of
shamrocks
so
that
it
looked
as
though
small
oddly
shaped
hillocks
had
sprouted
out
of
the
earth
grinning
faces
could
be
seen
under
those
that
had
their
flaps
open
then
from
behind
them
they
heard
their
names
harry
ron
hermione
it
was
Seamus
Finnigan
their
fellow
Gryffindor
fourth
year
he
was
sitting
in
front
of
his
own
shamrockcovered
tent
with
a
sandyhaired
woman
who
had
to
be
his
mother
and
his
best
friend
Dean
Thomas
also
of
Gryffindor
like
the
decorations
said
Seamus
grinning
the
ministry's
not
too
happy
ah
why
shouldn't
we
show
our
colors
said
Mrs
finnigan
you
should
see
what
the
Bulgarians
have
got
dangling
all
over
their
tents
you'll
be
supporting
Ireland
of
course
she
added
eyeing
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
beadily
when
they
had
assured
her
that
they
were
indeed
supporting
Ireland
they
set
off
again
though
as
Ron
said
Like
we'd
say
anything
else
surrounded
by
that
lot
i
wonder
what
the
Bulgarians
have
got
dangling
all
over
their
tents
said
Hermione
let's
go
and
have
a
look
said
Harry
pointing
to
a
large
patch
of
tents
upfield
where
the
Bulgarian
flag
white
green
and
red
was
fluttering
in
the
breeze
the
tents
here
had
not
been
bedecked
with
plant
life
but
each
and
every
one
of
them
had
the
same
poster
attached
to
it
a
poster
of
a
very
surly
face
with
heavy
black
eyebrows
the
picture
was
of
course
moving
but
all
it
did
was
blink
and
scowl
krum
said
Ron
quietly
what
said
Hermione
krum
said
Ron
viktor
Krum
the
Bulgarian
Seeker
he
looks
really
grumpy
said
Hermione
looking
around
at
the
many
Krums
blinking
and
scowling
at
them
really
grumpy
ron
raised
his
eyes
to
the
heavens
who
cares
what
he
looks
like
he's
unbelievable
he's
really
young
too
only
just
eighteen
or
something
he's
a
genius
you
wait
until
tonight
you'll
see
there
was
already
a
small
queue
for
the
tap
in
the
corner
of
the
field
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
joined
it
right
behind
a
pair
of
men
who
were
having
a
heated
argument
one
of
them
was
a
very
old
wizard
who
was
wearing
a
long
flowery
nightgown
the
other
was
clearly
a
Ministry
wizard
he
was
holding
out
a
pair
of
pinstriped
trousers
and
almost
crying
with
exasperation
just
put
them
on
Archie
there's
a
good
chap
you
can't
walk
around
like
that
the
Muggle
at
the
gate's
already
getting
suspicious
I
bought
this
in
a
Muggle
shop
said
the
old
wizard
stubbornly
muggles
wear
them
muggle
women
wear
them
Archie
not
the
men
they
wear
these
said
the
Ministry
wizard
and
he
brandished
the
pinstriped
trousers
i'm
not
putting
them
on
said
old
Archie
in
indignation
i
like
a
healthy
breeze
round
my
privates
thanks
hermione
was
overcome
with
such
a
strong
fit
of
the
giggles
at
this
point
that
she
had
to
duck
out
of
the
queue
and
only
returned
when
Archie
had
collected
his
water
and
moved
away
walking
more
slowly
now
because
of
the
weight
of
the
water
they
made
their
way
back
through
the
campsite
here
and
there
they
saw
more
familiar
faces
other
Hogwarts
students
with
their
families
oliver
Wood
the
old
captain
of
harry's
House
Quidditch
team
who
had
just
left
Hogwarts
dragged
Harry
over
to
his
parents
tent
to
introduce
him
and
told
him
excitedly
that
he
had
just
been
signed
to
the
Puddlemere
United
reserve
team
next
they
were
hailed
by
Ernie
Macmillan
a
Hufflepuff
fourth
year
and
a
little
farther
on
they
saw
Cho
Chang
a
very
pretty
girl
who
played
Seeker
on
the
Ravenclaw
team
she
waved
and
smiled
at
Harry
who
slopped
quite
a
lot
of
water
down
his
front
as
he
waved
back
more
to
stop
Ron
from
smirking
than
anything
Harry
hurriedly
pointed
out
a
large
group
of
teenagers
whom
he
had
never
seen
before
who
d'you
reckon
they
are
he
said
they
don't
go
to
Hogwarts
do
they
spect
they
go
to
some
foreign
school
said
Ron
i
know
there
are
others
never
met
anyone
who
went
to
one
though
bill
had
a
penfriend
at
a
school
in
Brazil
this
was
years
and
years
ago
and
he
wanted
to
go
on
an
exchange
trip
but
Mum
and
Dad
couldn't
afford
it
his
penfriend
got
all
offended
when
he
said
he
wasn't
going
and
sent
him
a
cursed
hat
it
made
his
ears
shrivel
up
harry
laughed
but
didn't
voice
the
amazement
he
felt
at
hearing
about
other
wizarding
schools
he
supposed
now
that
he
saw
representatives
of
so
many
nationalities
in
the
campsite
that
he
had
been
stupid
never
to
realize
that
Hogwarts
couldn't
be
the
only
one
he
glanced
at
Hermione
who
looked
utterly
unsurprised
by
the
information
no
doubt
she
had
run
across
the
news
about
other
wizarding
schools
in
some
book
or
other
you've
been
ages
said
George
when
they
finally
got
back
to
the
Weasleys
tents
met
a
few
people
said
Ron
setting
the
water
down
you've
not
got
that
fire
started
yet
dad's
having
fun
with
the
matches
said
Fred
mr.
Weasley
was
having
no
success
at
all
in
lighting
the
fire
but
it
wasn't
for
lack
of
trying
splintered
matches
littered
the
ground
around
him
but
he
looked
as
though
he
was
having
the
time
of
his
life
oops
he
said
as
he
managed
to
light
a
match
and
promptly
dropped
it
in
surprise
come
here
mr.
Weasley
said
Hermione
kindly
taking
the
box
from
him
and
showing
him
how
to
do
it
properly
at
last
they
got
the
fire
lit
though
it
was
at
least
another
hour
before
it
was
hot
enough
to
cook
anything
there
was
plenty
to
watch
while
they
waited
however
their
tent
seemed
to
be
pitched
right
alongside
a
kind
of
thoroughfare
to
the
field
and
Ministry
members
kept
hurrying
up
and
down
it
greeting
mr.
Weasley
cordially
as
they
passed
mr.
Weasley
kept
up
a
running
commentary
mainly
for
harry's
and
hermione's
benefit
his
own
children
knew
too
much
about
the
Ministry
to
be
greatly
interested
that
was
Cuthbert
Mockridge
Head
of
the
Goblin
Liaison
Office
here
comes
Gilbert
Wimple
he's
with
the
Committee
on
Experimental
Charms
he's
had
those
horns
for
a
while
now
hello
Arnie
arnold
Peasegood
he's
an
Obliviator
member
of
the
Accidental
Magic
Reversal
Squad
you
know
and
that's
Bode
and
Croaker
they're
Unspeakables
they're
what
from
the
Department
of
Mysteries
top
secret
no
idea
what
they
get
up
to
at
last
the
fire
was
ready
and
they
had
just
started
cooking
eggs
and
sausages
when
Bill
Charlie
and
Percy
came
strolling
out
of
the
woods
toward
them
just
Apparated
Dad
said
Percy
loudly
ah
excellent
lunch
they
were
halfway
through
their
plates
of
eggs
and
sausages
when
mr.
Weasley
jumped
to
his
feet
waving
and
grinning
at
a
man
who
was
striding
toward
them
aha
he
said
the
man
of
the
moment
ludo
ludo
Bagman
was
easily
the
most
noticeable
person
Harry
had
seen
so
far
even
including
old
Archie
in
his
flowered
nightdress
he
was
wearing
long
Quidditch
robes
in
thick
horizontal
stripes
of
bright
yellow
and
black
an
enormous
picture
of
a
wasp
was
splashed
across
his
chest
he
had
the
look
of
a
powerfully
built
man
gone
slightly
to
seed
the
robes
were
stretched
tightly
across
a
large
belly
he
surely
had
not
had
in
the
days
when
he
had
played
Quidditch
for
England
his
nose
was
squashed
probably
broken
by
a
stray
Bludger
Harry
thought
but
his
round
blue
eyes
short
blond
hair
and
rosy
complexion
made
him
look
like
a
very
overgrown
schoolboy
ahoy
there
bagman
called
happily
he
was
walking
as
though
he
had
springs
attached
to
the
balls
of
his
feet
and
was
plainly
in
a
state
of
wild
excitement
arthur
old
man
he
puffed
as
he
reached
the
campfire
what
a
day
eh
what
a
day
could
we
have
asked
for
more
perfect
weather
a
cloudless
night
coming
and
hardly
a
hiccough
in
the
arrangements
not
much
for
me
to
do
behind
him
a
group
of
haggardlooking
Ministry
wizards
rushed
past
pointing
at
the
distant
evidence
of
some
sort
of
a
magical
fire
that
was
sending
violet
sparks
twenty
feet
into
the
air
percy
hurried
forward
with
his
hand
outstretched
apparently
his
disapproval
of
the
way
Ludo
Bagman
ran
his
department
did
not
prevent
him
from
wanting
to
make
a
good
impression
ah
yes
said
mr.
Weasley
grinning
this
is
my
son
Percy
he's
just
started
at
the
Ministry
and
this
is
Fred
no
George
sorry
that's
Fred
Bill
Charlie
Ron
my
daughter
Ginny
and
ron's
friends
Hermione
Granger
and
Harry
Potter
bagman
did
the
smallest
of
double
takes
when
he
heard
harry's
name
and
his
eyes
performed
the
familiar
flick
upward
to
the
scar
on
harry's
forehead
everyone
mr.
Weasley
continued
this
is
Ludo
Bagman
you
know
who
he
is
it's
thanks
to
him
we've
got
such
good
tickets
bagman
beamed
and
waved
his
hand
as
if
to
say
it
had
been
nothing
fancy
a
flutter
on
the
match
Arthur
he
said
eagerly
jingling
what
seemed
to
be
a
large
amount
of
gold
in
the
pockets
of
his
yellowandblack
robes
i've
already
got
Roddy
Pontner
betting
me
Bulgaria
will
score
first
I
offered
him
nice
odds
considering
ireland's
front
three
are
the
strongest
i've
seen
in
years
and
little
Agatha
Timms
has
put
up
half
shares
in
her
eel
farm
on
a
weeklong
match
oh
go
on
then
said
mr.
Weasley
let's
see
a
Galleon
on
Ireland
to
win
a
Galleon
ludo
Bagman
looked
slightly
disappointed
but
recovered
himself
very
well
very
well
any
other
takers
they're
a
bit
young
to
be
gambling
said
mr.
Weasley
molly
wouldn't
like
we'll
bet
thirtyseven
Galleons
fifteen
Sickles
three
Knuts
said
Fred
as
he
and
George
quickly
pooled
all
their
money
that
Ireland
wins
but
Viktor
Krum
gets
the
Snitch
oh
and
we'll
throw
in
a
fake
wand
you
don't
want
to
go
showing
mr.
Bagman
rubbish
like
that
Percy
hissed
but
Bagman
didn't
seem
to
think
the
wand
was
rubbish
at
all
on
the
contrary
his
boyish
face
shone
with
excitement
as
he
took
it
from
Fred
and
when
the
wand
gave
a
loud
squawk
and
turned
into
a
rubber
chicken
Bagman
roared
with
laughter
excellent
i
haven't
seen
one
that
convincing
in
years
i'd
pay
five
Galleons
for
that
percy
froze
in
an
attitude
of
stunned
disapproval
boys
said
mr.
Weasley
under
his
breath
I
don't
want
you
betting
that's
all
your
savings
your
mother
don't
be
a
spoilsport
Arthur
boomed
Ludo
Bagman
rattling
his
pockets
excitedly
they're
old
enough
to
know
what
they
want
you
reckon
Ireland
will
win
but
krum'll
get
the
Snitch
not
a
chance
boys
not
a
chance
i'll
give
you
excellent
odds
on
that
one
we'll
add
five
Galleons
for
the
funny
wand
then
shall
we
mr.
Weasley
looked
on
helplessly
as
Ludo
Bagman
whipped
out
a
notebook
and
quill
and
began
jotting
down
the
twins
names
cheers
said
George
taking
the
slip
of
parchment
Bagman
handed
him
and
tucking
it
away
into
the
front
of
his
robes
bagman
turned
most
cheerfully
back
to
mr.
Weasley
couldn't
do
me
a
brew
I
suppose
i'm
keeping
an
eye
out
for
Barty
Crouch
my
Bulgarian
opposite
number's
making
difficulties
and
I
can't
understand
a
word
he's
saying
barty'll
be
able
to
sort
it
out
he
speaks
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
languages
mr.
Crouch
said
Percy
suddenly
abandoning
his
look
of
pokerstiff
disapproval
and
positively
writhing
with
excitement
he
speaks
over
two
hundred
mermish
and
Gobbledegook
and
Troll
anyone
can
speak
Troll
said
Fred
dismissively
all
you
have
to
do
is
point
and
grunt
percy
threw
Fred
an
extremely
nasty
look
and
stoked
the
fire
vigorously
to
bring
the
kettle
back
to
the
boil
any
news
of
Bertha
Jorkins
yet
Ludo
mr.
Weasley
asked
as
Bagman
settled
himself
down
on
the
grass
beside
them
all
not
a
dicky
bird
said
Bagman
comfortably
but
she'll
turn
up
poor
old
Bertha
memory
like
a
leaky
cauldron
and
no
sense
of
direction
lost
you
take
my
word
for
it
she'll
wander
back
into
the
office
sometime
in
October
thinking
it's
still
July
you
don't
think
it
might
be
time
to
send
someone
to
look
for
her
mr.
Weasley
suggested
tentatively
as
Percy
handed
Bagman
his
tea
barty
Crouch
keeps
saying
that
said
Bagman
his
round
eyes
widening
innocently
but
we
really
can't
spare
anyone
at
the
moment
oh
talk
of
the
devil
barty
a
wizard
had
just
Apparated
at
their
fireside
and
he
could
not
have
made
more
of
a
contrast
with
Ludo
Bagman
sprawled
on
the
grass
in
his
old
Wasp
robes
barty
Crouch
was
a
stiff
upright
elderly
man
dressed
in
an
impeccably
crisp
suit
and
tie
the
parting
in
his
short
gray
hair
was
almost
unnaturally
straight
and
his
narrow
toothbrush
mustache
looked
as
though
he
trimmed
it
using
a
slide
rule
his
shoes
were
very
highly
polished
harry
could
see
at
once
why
Percy
idolized
him
percy
was
a
great
believer
in
rigidly
following
rules
and
mr.
Crouch
had
complied
with
the
rule
about
Muggle
dressing
so
thoroughly
that
he
could
have
passed
for
a
bank
manager
Harry
doubted
even
Uncle
Vernon
would
have
spotted
him
for
what
he
really
was
pull
up
a
bit
of
grass
Barry
said
Ludo
brightly
patting
the
ground
beside
him
no
thank
you
Ludo
said
Crouch
and
there
was
a
bite
of
impatience
in
his
voice
i've
been
looking
for
you
everywhere
the
Bulgarians
are
insisting
we
add
another
twelve
seats
to
the
Top
Box
oh
is
that
what
they're
after
said
Bagman
i
thought
the
chap
was
asking
to
borrow
a
pair
of
tweezers
bit
of
a
strong
accent
mr.
Crouch
said
Percy
breathlessly
sunk
into
a
kind
of
halfbow
that
made
him
look
like
a
hunchback
would
you
like
a
cup
of
tea
oh
said
mr.
Crouch
looking
over
at
Percy
in
mild
surprise
yes
thank
you
Weatherby
fred
and
George
choked
into
their
own
cups
percy
very
pink
around
the
ears
busied
himself
with
the
kettle
oh
and
i've
been
wanting
a
word
with
you
too
Arthur
said
mr.
Crouch
his
sharp
eyes
falling
upon
mr.
Weasley
ali
bashir's
on
the
warpath
he
wants
a
word
with
you
about
your
embargo
on
flying
carpets
mr.
Weasley
heaved
a
deep
sigh
i
sent
him
an
owl
about
that
just
last
week
if
i've
told
him
once
i've
told
him
a
hundred
times
Carpets
are
defined
as
a
Muggle
Artifact
by
the
Registry
of
Proscribed
Charmable
Objects
but
will
he
listen
i
doubt
it
said
mr.
Crouch
accepting
a
cup
from
Percy
he's
desperate
to
export
here
well
they'll
never
replace
brooms
in
Britain
will
they
said
Bagman
ali
thinks
there's
a
niche
in
the
market
for
a
family
vehicle
said
mr.
Crouch
i
remember
my
grandfather
had
an
Axminster
that
could
seat
twelve
but
that
was
before
carpets
were
banned
of
course
he
spoke
as
though
he
wanted
to
leave
nobody
in
any
doubt
that
all
his
ancestors
had
abided
strictly
by
the
law
so
been
keeping
busy
Barty
said
Bagman
breezily
fairly
said
mr.
Crouch
dryly
organizing
Portkeys
across
five
continents
is
no
mean
feat
Ludo
i
expect
you'll
both
be
glad
when
this
is
over
said
mr.
Weasley
ludo
Bagman
looked
shocked
glad
don't
know
when
i've
had
more
fun
still
it's
not
as
though
we
haven't
got
anything
to
took
forward
to
eh
Barty
eh
plenty
left
to
organize
eh
mr.
Crouch
raised
his
eyebrows
at
Bagman
we
agreed
not
to
make
the
announcement
until
all
the
details
oh
details
said
Bagman
waving
the
word
away
like
a
cloud
of
midges
they've
signed
haven't
they
they've
agreed
haven't
they
i
bet
you
anything
these
kids'll
know
soon
enough
anyway
i
mean
it's
happening
at
Hogwarts
ludo
we
need
to
meet
the
Bulgarians
you
know
said
mr.
Crouch
sharply
cutting
bagman's
remarks
short
thank
you
for
the
tea
Weatherby
he
pushed
his
undrunk
tea
back
at
Percy
and
waited
for
Ludo
to
rise
Bagman
struggled
to
his
feet
swigging
down
the
last
of
his
tea
the
gold
in
his
pockets
chinking
merrily
see
you
all
later
he
said
you'll
be
up
in
the
Top
Box
with
me
i'm
commentating
he
waved
Barty
Crouch
nodded
curtly
and
both
of
them
Disapparated
what's
happening
at
Hogwarts
Dad
said
Fred
at
once
what
were
they
talking
about
you'll
find
out
soon
enough
said
Mr.Weasley
smiling
it's
classified
information
until
such
time
as
the
Ministry
decides
to
release
it
said
Percy
stiffly
mr.
Crouch
was
quite
right
not
to
disclose
it
oh
shut
up
Weatherby
said
Fred
a
sense
of
excitement
rose
like
a
palpable
cloud
over
the
campsite
as
the
afternoon
wore
on
by
dusk
the
still
summer
air
itself
seemed
to
be
quivering
with
anticipation
and
as
darkness
spread
like
a
curtain
over
the
thousands
of
waiting
wizards
the
last
vestiges
of
pretence
disappeared
the
Ministry
seemed
to
have
bowed
to
the
inevitable
and
stopped
fighting
the
signs
of
blatant
magic
now
breaking
out
everywhere
salesmen
were
Apparating
every
few
feet
carrying
trays
and
pushing
carts
full
of
extraordinary
merchandise
there
were
luminous
rosettes
green
for
Ireland
red
for
Bulgaria
which
were
squealing
the
names
of
the
players
pointed
green
hats
bedecked
with
dancing
shamrocks
Bulgarian
scarves
adorned
with
lions
that
really
roared
flags
from
both
countries
that
played
their
national
anthems
as
they
were
waved
there
were
tiny
models
of
Firebolts
that
really
flew
and
collectible
figures
of
famous
players
which
strolled
across
the
palm
of
your
hand
preening
themselves
been
saving
my
pocket
money
all
summer
for
this
Ron
told
Harry
as
they
and
Hermione
strolled
through
the
salesmen
buying
souvenirs
though
Ron
purchased
a
dancing
shamrock
hat
and
a
large
green
rosette
he
also
bought
a
small
figure
of
Viktor
Krum
the
Bulgarian
Seeker
the
miniature
Krum
walked
backward
and
forward
over
ron's
hand
scowling
up
at
the
green
rosette
above
him
wow
look
at
these
said
Harry
hurrying
over
to
a
cart
piled
high
with
what
looked
like
brass
binoculars
except
that
they
were
covered
with
all
sorts
of
weird
knobs
and
dials
omnioculars
said
the
saleswizard
eagerly
you
can
replay
action
slow
everything
down
and
they
flash
up
a
playby
play
breakdown
if
you
need
it
bargain
ten
Galleons
each
wish
I
hadn't
bought
this
now
said
Ron
gesturing
at
his
dancing
shamrock
hat
and
gazing
longingly
at
the
Omnioculars
three
pairs
said
Harry
firmly
to
the
wizard
no
don't
bother
said
Ron
going
red
he
was
always
touchy
about
the
fact
that
harry
who
had
inherited
a
small
fortune
from
his
parents
had
much
more
money
than
he
did
you
won't
be
getting
anything
for
Christmas
Harry
told
him
thrusting
Omnioculars
into
his
and
hermione's
hands
for
about
ten
years
mind
fair
enough
said
Ron
grinning
oooh
thanks
Harry
said
Hermione
and
i'll
get
us
some
programs
look
their
money
bags
considerably
lighter
they
went
back
to
the
tents
bill
Charlie
and
Ginny
were
all
sporting
green
rosettes
too
and
mr.
Weasley
was
carrying
an
Irish
flag
fred
and
George
had
no
souvenirs
as
they
had
given
Bagman
all
their
gold
and
then
a
deep
booming
gong
sounded
somewhere
beyond
the
woods
and
at
once
green
and
red
lanterns
blazed
into
life
in
the
trees
lighting
a
path
to
the
field
it's
time
said
mr.
Weasley
looking
as
excited
as
any
of
them
come
on
let's
go
chapter
eight
the
quidditch
world
cup
clutching
their
purchases
mr.
Weasley
in
the
lead
they
all
hurried
into
the
wood
following
the
lanternlit
trail
they
could
hear
the
sounds
of
thousands
of
people
moving
around
them
shouts
and
laughter
snatches
of
singing
the
atmosphere
of
feverish
excitement
was
highly
infectious
Harry
couldn't
stop
grinning
they
walked
through
the
wood
for
twenty
minutes
talking
and
joking
loudly
until
at
last
they
emerged
on
the
other
side
and
found
themselves
in
the
shadow
of
a
gigantic
stadium
though
Harry
could
see
only
a
fraction
of
the
immense
gold
walls
surrounding
the
field
he
could
tell
that
ten
cathedrals
would
fit
comfortably
inside
it
seats
a
hundred
thousand
said
mr.
Weasley
spotting
the
awestruck
look
on
harry's
face
ministry

force
of
five

of

every
time
Muggles
have
got
anywhere
near
here
all
year
they've
suddenly
remembered
urgent
appointments
and
had
to
dash
away
again
bless
them
he
added
fondly
leading
the
way
toward
the
nearest
entrance
which
was
already
surrounded
by
a
swarm
of
shouting
witches
and
wizards
prime
seats
said
the
Ministry
witch
at
the
entrance
when
she
checked
their
tickets
top
Box
straight
upstairs
Arthur
and
as
high
as
you
can
go
the
stairs
into
the
stadium
were
carpeted
in
rich
purple
they
clambered
upward
with
the
rest
of
the
crowd
which
slowly
filtered
away
through
doors
into
the
stands
to
their
left
and
right
mr.
weasley's
party
kept
climbing
and
at
last
they
reached
the
top
of
the
staircase
and
found
themselves
in
a
small
box
set
at
the
highest
point
of
the
stadium
and
situated
exactly
halfway
between
the
golden
goal
posts
about
twenty
purpleandgilt
chairs
stood
in
two
rows
here
and
Harry
filing
into
the
front
seats
with
the
Weasleys
looked
down
upon
a
scene
the
likes
of
which
he
could
never
have
imagined
a
hundred
thousand
witches
and
wizards
were
taking
their
places
in
the
seats
which
rose
in
levels
around
the
long
oval
field
everything
was
suffused
with
a
mysterious
golden
light
which
seemed
to
come
from
the
stadium
itself
the
field
looked
smooth
as
velvet
from
their
lofty
position
at
either
end
of
the
field
stood
three
goal
hoops
fifty
feet
high
right
opposite
them
almost
at
harry's
eye
level
was
a
gigantic
blackboard
gold
writing
kept
dashing
across
it
as
though
an
invisible
giant's
hand
were
scrawling
upon
the
blackboard
and
then
wiping
it
off
again
watching
it
Harry
saw
that
it
was
flashing
advertisements
across
the
field

harry
tore
his
eyes
away
from
the
sign
and
looked
over
his
shoulder
to
see
who
else
was
sharing
the
box
with
them
so
far
it
was
empty
except
for
a
tiny
creature
sitting
in
the
second
from
last
seat
at
the
end
of
the
row
behind
them
the
creature
whose
legs
were
so
short
they
stuck
out
in
front
of
it
on
the
chair
was
wearing
a
tea
towel
draped
like
a
toga
and
it
had
its
face
hidden
in
its
hands
yet
those
long
batlike
ears
were
oddly
familiar
dobby
said
Harry
incredulously
the
tiny
creature
looked
up
and
stretched
its
fingers
revealing
enormous
brown
eyes
and
a
nose
the
exact
size
and
shape
of
a
large
tomato
it
wasn't
Dobby
it
was
however
unmistakably
a
houseelf
as
harry's
friend
Dobby
had
been
harry
had
set
Dobby
free
from
his
old
owners
the
Malfoy
family
did
sir
just
call
me
Dobby
squeaked
the
elf
curiously
from
between
its
fingers
its
voice
was
higher
even
than
dobby's
had
been
a
teeny
quivering
squeak
of
a
voice
and
Harry
suspected
though
it
was
very
hard
to
tell
with
a
houseelf
that
this
one
might
just
be
female
ron
and
Hermione
spun
around
in
their
seats
to
look
though
they
had
heard
a
lot
about
Dobby
from
Harry
they
had
never
actually
met
him
even
mr.
Weasley
looked
around
in
interest
sorry
Harry
told
the
elf
I
just
thought
you
were
someone
I
knew
but
I
knows
Dobby
too
sir
squeaked
the
elf
she
was
shielding
her
face
as
though
blinded
by
light
though
the
Top
Box
was
not
brightly
lit
my
name
is
Winky
sir
and
you
sir
Her
dark
brown
eyes
widened
to
the
size
of
side
plates
as
they
rested
upon
harry's
scar
you
is
surely
Harry
Potter
yeah
I
am
said
Harry
but
Dobby
talks
of
you
all
the
time
sir
s
he
said
lowering
her
hands
very
slightly
and
looking
awestruck
how
is
he
said
Harry
how's
freedom
suiting
him
ah
sir
said
Winky
shaking
her
head
ah
sir
meaning
no
disrespect
sir
but
I
is
not
sure
you
did
Dobby
a
favor
sir
when
you
is
setting
him
free
why
said
Harry
taken
aback
what's
wrong
with
him
freedom
is
going
to
dobby's
head
sir
said
Winky
sadly
ideas
above
his
station
sir
can't
get
another
position
sir
why
not
said
Harry
winky
lowered
her
voice
by
a
halfoctave
and
whispered
He
is
wanting
paying
for
his
work
sir
paying
said
Harry
blankly
well
why
shouldn't
he
be
paid
winky
looked
quite
horrified
at
the
idea
and
closed
her
fingers
slightly
so
that
her
face
was
halfhidden
again
houseelves
is
not
paid
sir
she
said
in
a
muffled
squeak
no
no
no
i
says
to
Dobby
I
says
go
find
yourself
a
nice
family
and
settle
down
Dobby
he
is
getting
up
to
all
sorts
of
high
jinks
sir
what
is
unbecoming
to
a
houseelf
you
goes
racketing
around
like
this
Dobby
I
says
and
next
thing
I
hear
you's
up
in
front
of
the
Department
for
the
Regulation
and
Control
of
Magical
Creatures
like
some
common
goblin
well
it's
about
time
he
had
a
bit
of
fun
said
Harry
houseelves
is
not
supposed
to
have
fun
Harry
Potter
said
Winky
firmly
from
behind
her
hands
houseelves
does
what
they
is
told
i
is
not
liking
heights
at
all
Harry
Potter
she
glanced
toward
the
edge
of
the
box
and
gulped
but
my
master
sends
me
to
the
Top
Box
and
I
comes
sir
why's
he
sent
you
up
here
if
he
knows
you
don't
like
heights
said
Harry
frowning
master
master
wants
me
to
save
him
a
seat
Harry
Potter
he
is
very
busy
said
Winky
tilting
her
head
toward
the
empty
space
beside
her
winky
is
wishing
she
is
back
in
master's
tent
Harry
Potter
but
Winky
does
what
she
is
told
winky
is
a
good
houseelf
she
gave
the
edge
of
the
box
another
frightened
look
and
hid
her
eyes
completely
again
harry
turned
back
to
the
others
so
that's
a
houseelf
ron
muttered
weird
things
aren't
they
dobby
was
weirder
said
Harry
fervently
ron
pulled
out
his
Omnioculars
and
started
testing
them
staring
down
into
the
crowd
on
the
other
side
of
the
stadium
wild
he
said
twiddling
the
replay
knob
on
the
side
i
can
make
that
old
bloke
down
there
pick
his
nose
again
and
again
and
again
hermione
meanwhile
was
skimming
eagerly
through
her
velvetcovered
tasseled
program
a
display
from
the
team
mascots
will
precede
the
match
she
read
aloud
oh
that's
always
worth
watching
said
mr.
Weasley
national
teams
bring
creatures
from
their
native
land
you
know
to
put
on
a
bit
of
a
show
the
box
filled
gradually
around
them
over
the
next
half
hour
mr.
Weasley
kept
shaking
hands
with
people
who
were
obviously
very
important
wizards
percy
jumped
to
his
feet
so
often
that
he
looked
as
though
he
were
trying
to
sit
on
a
hedgehog
when
Cornelius
Fudge
the
Minister
of
Magic
himself
arrived
Percy
bowed
so
low
that
his
glasses
fell
off
and
shattered
highly
embarrassed
he
repaired
them
with
his
wand
and
thereafter
remained
in
his
seat
throwing
jealous
looks
at
Harry
whom
Cornelius
Fudge
had
greeted
like
an
old
friend
they
had
met
before
and
Fudge
shook
harry's
hand
in
a
fatherly
fashion
asked
how
he
was
and
introduced
him
to
the
wizards
on
either
side
of
him
harry
Potter
you
know
he
told
the
Bulgarian
minister
loudly
who
was
wearing
splendid
robes
of
black
velvet
trimmed
with
gold
and
didn't
seem
to
understand
a
word
of
English
harry
Potter
oh
come
on
now
you
know
who
he
is
the
boy
who
survived
YouKnowWho
you
do
know
who
he
is
the
Bulgarian
wizard
suddenly
spotted
harry's
scar
and
started
gabbling
loudly
and
excitedly
pointing
at
it
knew
we'd
get
there
in
the
end
said
Fudge
wearily
to
Harry
i'm
no
great
shakes
at
languages
I
need
Barty
Crouch
for
this
sort
of
thing
ah
I
see
his
house
elf's
saving
him
a
seat
good
job
too
these
Bulgarian
blighters
have
been
trying
to
cadge
all
the
best
places
ah
and
here's
Lucius
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
turned
quickly
edging
along
the
second
row
to
three
stillempty
seats
right
behind
mr.
Weasley
were
none
other
than
Dobby
the
house
elf's
former
owners
Lucius
Malfoy
his
son
Draco
and
a
woman
Harry
supposed
must
be
draco's
mother
harry
and
Draco
Malfoy
had
been
enemies
ever
since
their
very
first
journey
to
Hogwarts
a
pale
boy
with
a
pointed
face
and
whiteblond
hair
Draco
greatly
resembled
his
father
his
mother
was
blonde
too
tall
and
slim
she
would
have
been
nicelooking
if
she
hadn't
been
wearing
a
look
that
suggested
there
was
a
nasty
smell
under
her
nose
ah
Fudge
said
mr.
Malfoy
holding
out
his
hand
as
he
reached
the
Minister
of
Magic
how
are
you
i
don't
think
you've
met
my
wife
Narcissa
or
our
son
Draco
how
do
you
do
how
do
you
do
said
Fudge
smiling
and
bowing
to
Mrs
malfoy
and
allow
me
to
introduce
you
to
mr.
Oblansk
Obalonsk
mr.
well
he's
the
Bulgarian
Minister
of
Magic
and
he
can't
understand
a
word
i'm
saying
anyway
so
never
mind
and
let's
see
who
else
you
know
Arthur
Weasley
I
daresay
it
was
a
tense
moment
mr.
Weasley
and
mr.
Malfoy
looked
at
each
other
and
Harry
vividly
recalled
the
last
time
they
had
come
facetoface
It
had
been
in
Flourish
and
Blotts
bookshop
and
they
had
had
a
fight
mr.
malfoy's
cold
gray
eyes
swept
over
mr.
Weasley
and
then
up
and
down
the
row
good
lord
Arthur
he
said
softly
what
did
you
have
to
sell
to
get
seats
in
the
Top
Box
surely
your
house
wouldn't
have
fetched
this
much
fudge
who
wasn't
listening
said
Lucius
has
just
given
a
very
generous
contribution
to
st.
mungo's
Hospital
for
Magical
Maladies
and
Injuries
Arthur
he's
here
as
my
guest
how
how
nice
said
mr.
Weasley
with
a
very
strained
smile
mr.
malfoy's
eyes
had
returned
to
Hermione
who
went
slightly
pink
but
stared
determinedly
back
at
him
harry
knew
exactly
what
was
making
mr.
malfoy's
lip
curl
like
that
the
Malfoys
prided
themselves
on
being
purebloods
in
other
words
they
considered
anyone
of
Muggle
descent
like
Hermione
secondclass
however
under
the
gaze
of
the
Minister
of
Magic
mr.
Malfoy
didn't
dare
say
anything
he
nodded
sneeringly
to
mr.
Weasley
and
continued
down
the
line
to
his
seats
draco
shot
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
one
contemptuous
look
then
settled
himself
between
his
mother
and
father
slimy
gits
Ron
muttered
as
he
Harry
and
Hermione
turned
to
face
the
field
again
next
moment
Ludo
Bagman
charged
into
the
box
everyone
ready
he
said
his
round
face
gleaming
like
a
great
excited
Edam
minister
ready
to
go
ready
when
you
are
Ludo
said
Fudge
comfortably
ludo
whipped
out
his
wand
directed
it
at
his
own
throat
and
said
Sonorus
and
then
spoke
over
the
roar
of
sound
that
was
now
filling
the
packed
stadium
his
voice
echoed
over
them
booming
into
every
corner
of
the
stands
ladies
and
gentlemen
welcome
welcome
to
the
final
of
the
four
hundred
and
twentysecond
Quidditch
World
Cup
the
spectators
screamed
and
clapped
thousands
of
flags
waved
adding
their
discordant
national
anthems
to
the
racket
the
huge
blackboard
opposite
them
was
wiped
clear
of
its
last
message
Bertie
bott's
Every
Flavor
Beans
A
Risk
With
Every
Mouthful
and
now
showed
bulgaria
ireland
and
now
without
further
ado
allow
me
to
introduce
the
Bulgarian
National
Team
Mascots
the
righthand
side
of
the
stands
which
was
a
solid
block
of
scarlet
roared
its
approval
i
wonder
what
they've
brought
said
mr.
Weasley
leaning
forward
in
his
seat
aaah
he
suddenly
whipped
off
his
glasses
and
polished
them
hurriedly
on
his
robes
veela
what
are
veel
but
a
hundred
veela
were
now
gliding
out
onto
the
field
and
harry's
question
was
answered
for
him
veela
were
women
the
most
beautiful
women
Harry
had
ever
seen
except
that
they
weren't
they
couldn't
be
human
this
puzzled
Harry
for
a
moment
while
he
tried
to
guess
what
exactly
they
could
be
what
could
make
their
skin
shine
moonbright
like
that
or
their
whitegold
hair
fan
out
behind
them
without
wind
but
then
the
music
started
and
Harry
stopped
worrying
about
them
not
being
human
in
fact
he
stopped
worrying
about
anything
at
all
the
veela
had
started
to
dance
and
harry's
mind
had
gone
completely
and
blissfully
blank
all
that
mattered
in
the
world
was
that
he
kept
watching
the
veela
because
if
they
stopped
dancing
terrible
things
would
happen
and
as
the
veela
danced
faster
and
faster
wild
halfformed
thoughts
started
chasing
through
harry's
dazed
mind
he
wanted
to
do
something
very
impressive
right
now
jumping
from
the
box
into
the
stadium
seemed
a
good
idea
but
would
it
be
good
enough
harry
what
are
you
doing
said
hermione's
voice
from
a
long
way
off
the
music
stopped
harry
blinked
he
was
standing
up
and
one
of
his
legs
was
resting
on
the
wall
of
the
box
next
to
him
Ron
was
frozen
in
an
attitude
that
looked
as
though
he
were
about
to
dive
from
a
springboard
angry
yells
were
filling
the
stadium
the
crowd
didn't
want
the
veela
to
go
harry
was
with
them
he
would
of
course
be
supporting
Bulgaria
and
he
wondered
vaguely
why
he
had
a
large
green
shamrock
pinned
to
his
chest
ron
meanwhile
was
absentmindedly
shredding
the
shamrocks
on
his
hat
mr.
Weasley
smiling
slightly
leaned
over
to
Ron
and
tugged
the
hat
out
of
his
hands
you'll
be
wanting
that
he
said
once
Ireland
have
had
their
say
huh
said
Ron
staring
openmouthed
at
the
veela
who
had
now
lined
up
along
one
side
of
the
field
hermione
made
a
loud
tutting
noise
she
reached
up
and
pulled
Harry
back
into
his
seat
honestly
she
said
and
now
roared
Ludo
bagman's
voice
kindly
put
your
wands
in
the
air
for
the
Irish
National
Team
Mascots
next
moment
what
seemed
to
be
a
great
greenandgold
comet
came
zooming
into
the
stadium
it
did
one
circuit
of
the
stadium
then
split
into
two
smaller
comets
each
hurtling
toward
the
goal
posts
a
rainbow
arced
suddenly
across
the
field
connecting
the
two
balls
of
light
the
crowd
oooohed
and
aaaaahed
as
though
at
a
fireworks
display
now
the
rainbow
faded
and
the
balls
of
light
reunited
and
merged
they
had
formed
a
great
shimmering
shamrock
which
rose
up
into
the
sky
and
began
to
soar
over
the
stands
something
like
golden
rain
seemed
to
be
falling
from
it
Excellent
yelled
Ron
as
the
shamrock
soared
over
them
and
heavy
gold
coins
rained
from
it
bouncing
off
their
heads
and
seats
squinting
up
at
the
shamrock
Harry
realized
that
it
was
actually
comprised
of
thousands
of
tiny
little
bearded
men
with
red
vests
each
carrying
a
minute
lamp
of
gold
or
green
leprechauns
said
mr.
Weasley
over
the
tumultuous
applause
of
the
crowd
many
of
whom
were
still
fighting
and
rummaging
around
under
their
chairs
to
retrieve
the
gold
there
you
go
Ron
yelled
happily
stuffing
a
fistful
of
gold
coins
into
harry's
hand
for
the
Omnioculars
now
you've
got
to
buy
me
a
Christmas
present
ha
the
great
shamrock
dissolved
the
leprechauns
drifted
down
onto
the
field
on
the
opposite
side
from
the
veela
and
settled
themselves
crosslegged
to
watch
the
match
and
now
ladies
and
gentlemen
kindly
welcome
the
Bulgarian
National
Quidditch
Team
i
give
you
Dimitrov
a
scarletclad
figure
on
a
broomstick
moving
so
fast
it
was
blurred
shot
out
onto
the
field
from
an
entrance
far
below
to
wild
applause
from
the
Bulgarian
supporters

Ron
following
Krum
with
his
Omnioculars
harry
quickly
focused
his
own
viktor
Krum
was
thin
dark
and
sallowskinned
with
a
large
curved
nose
and
thick
black
eyebrows
he
looked
like
an
overgrown
bird
of
prey
it
was
hard
to
believe
he
was
only
eighteen
and
now
please

the
Irish
National

Team
yelled
Bagman

Lynch
seven
green
blurs
swept
onto
the
field
Harry
spun
a
small
dial
on
the
side
of
his
Omnioculars
and
slowed
the
players
down
enough
to
read
the
word
Firebolt
on
each
of
their
brooms
and
see
their
names
embroidered
in
silver
upon
their
backs
and
here
all
the
way
from
Egypt
our
referee
acclaimed
Chairwizard
of
the
International
Association
of
Quidditch
Hassan
Mostafa
a
small
and
skinny
wizard
completely
bald
but
with
a
mustache
to
rival
Uncle
vernon's
wearing
robes
of
pure
gold
to
match
the
stadium
strode
out
onto
the
field
a
silver
whistle
was
protruding
from
under
the
mustache
and
he
was
carrying
a
large
wooden
crate
under
one
arm
his
broomstick
under
the
other
harry
spun
the
speed
dial
on
his
Omnioculars
back
to
normal
watching
closely
as
Mostafa
mounted
his
broomstick
and
kicked
the
crate
open
four
balls
burst
into
the
air
the
scarlet
Quaffle
the
two
black
Bludgers
and
Harry
saw
it
for
the
briefest
moment
before
it
sped
out
of
sight
the
minuscule
winged
Golden
Snitch
with
a
sharp
blast
on
his
whistle
Mostafa
shot
into
the
air
after
the
balls
theeeeeeeey're
off
screamed
Bagman
and
it's
Mullet
troy

dimitrov
back
to
Mullet
troy
levski
moran
it
was
Quidditch
as
Harry
had
never
seen
it
played
before
he
was
pressing
his
Omnioculars
so
hard
to
his
glasses
that
they
were
cutting
into
the
bridge
of
his
nose
the
speed
of
the
players
was
incredible
the
Chasers
were
throwing
the
Quaffle
to
one
another
so
fast
that
Bagman
only
had
time
to
say
their
names
harry
spun
the
slow
dial
on
the
right
of
his
Omnioculars
again
pressed
the
play
byplay
button
on
the
top
and
he
was
immediately
watching
in
slow
motion
while
glittering
purple
lettering
flashed
across
the
lenses
and
the
noise
of
the
crowd
pounded
against
his
eardrums
hawkshead
attacking
formation
he
read
as
he
watched
the
three
Irish
Chasers
zoom
closely
together
Troy
in
the
center
slightly
ahead
of
Mullet
and
Moran
bearing
down
upon
the
Bulgarians
porskoff
ploy
flashed
up
next
as
Troy
made
as
though
to
dart
upward
with
the
Quaffle
drawing
away
the
Bulgarian
Chaser
Ivanova
and
dropping
the
Quaffle
to
Moran
one
of
the
Bulgarian
Beaters
Volkov
swung
hard
at
a
passing
Bludger
with
his
small
club
knocking
it
into
moran's
path
Moran
ducked
to
avoid
the
Bludger
and
dropped
the
Quaffle
and
Levski
soaring
beneath
caught
it
troy
scores
roared
Bagman
and
the
stadium
shuddered
with
a
roar
of
applause
and
cheers
ten
zero
to
Ireland
what
harry
yelled
looking
wildly
around
through
his
Omnioculars
but
levski's
got
the
Quaffle
harry
if
you're
not
going
to
watch
at
normal
speed
you're
going
to
miss
things
shouted
Hermione
who
was
dancing
up
and
down
waving
her
arms
in
the
air
while
Troy
did
a
lap
of
honor
around
the
field
harry
looked
quickly
over
the
top
of
his
Omnioculars
and
saw
that
the
leprechauns
watching
from
the
sidelines
had
all
risen
into
the
air
again
and
formed
the
great
glittering
shamrock
across
the
field
the
veela
were
watching
them
sulkily
furious
with
himself
Harry
spun
his
speed
dial
back
to
normal
as
play
resumed
harry
knew
enough
about
Quidditch
to
see
that
the
Irish
Chasers
were
superb
they
worked
as
a
seamless
team
their
movements
so
well
coordinated
that
they
appeared
to
be
reading
one
another's
minds
as
they
positioned
themselves
and
the
rosette
on
harry's
chest
kept
squeaking
their
names
Troy
Mullet
Mo
ran
and
within
ten
minutes
Ireland
had
scored
twice
more
bringing
their
lead
to
thirtyzero
and
causing
a
thunderous
tide
of
roars
and
applause
from
the
green
clad
supporters
the
match
became
still
faster
but
more
brutal
volkov
and
Vulchanov
the
Bulgarian
Beaters
were
whacking
the
Bludgers
as
fiercely
as
possible
at
the
Irish
Chasers
and
were
starting
to
prevent
them
from
using
some
of
their
best
moves
twice
they
were
forced
to
scatter
and
then
finally
Ivanova
managed
to
break
through
their
ranks
dodge
the
Keeper
Ryan
and
score
bulgaria's
first
goal
fingers
in
your
ears
bellowed
mr.
Weasley
as
the
veela
started
to
dance
in
celebration
harry
screwed
up
his
eyes
too
he
wanted
to
keep
his
mind
on
the
game
after
a
few
seconds
he
chanced
a
glance
at
the
field
the
veela
had
stopped
dancing
and
Bulgaria
was
again
in
possession
of
the
Quaffle
dimitrov
levski
dimitrov
ivanova
oh
I
say
roared
Bagman
one
hundred
thousand
wizards
gasped
as
the
two
Seekers
Krum
and
Lynch
plummeted
through
the
center
of
the
Chasers
so
fast
that
it
looked
as
though
they
had
just
jumped
from
airplanes
without
parachutes
harry
followed
their
descent
through
his
Omnioculars
squinting
to
see
where
the
Snitch
was
they're
going
to
crash
screamed
Hermione
next
to
Harry
she
was
half
right
at
the
very
last
second
Viktor
Krum
pulled
out
of
the
dive
and
spiraled
off
lynch
however
hit
the
ground
with
a
dull
thud
that
could
be
heard
throughout
the
stadium
a
huge
groan
rose
from
the
Irish
seats
fool
moaned
mr.
Weasley
krum
was
feinting
it's
timeout
yelled
bagman's
voice
as
trained
mediwizards
hurry
onto
the
field
to
examine
Aidan
Lynch
he'll
be
okay
he
only
got
ploughed
charlie
said
reassuringly
to
Ginny
who
was
hanging
over
the
side
of
the
box
looking
horrorstruck
which
is
what
Krum
was
after
of
course
harry
hastily
pressed
the
replay
and
playbyplay
buttons
on
his
Omnioculars
twiddled
the
speed
dial
and
put
them
back
up
to
his
eyes
he
watched
as
Krum
and
Lynch
dived
again
in
slow
motion
wronski
defensive
feint
dangerous
seeker
diversion
read
the
shining
purple
lettering
across
his
lenses
he
saw
krum's
face
contorted
with
concentration
as
he
pulled
out
of
the
dive
just
in
time
while
Lynch
was
flattened
and
he
understood
Krum
hadn't
seen
the
Snitch
at
all
he
was
just
making
Lynch
copy
him
harry
had
never
seen
anyone
fly
like
that
Krum
hardly
looked
as
though
he
was
using
a
broomstick
at
all
he
moved
so
easily
through
the
air
that
he
looked
unsupported
and
weightless
harry
turned
his
Omnioculars
back
to
normal
and
focused
them
on
Krum
he
was
now
circling
high
above
Lynch
who
was
being
revived
by
mediwizards
with
cups
of
potion
harry
focusing
still
more
closely
upon
krum's
face
saw
his
dark
eyes
darting
all
over
the
ground
a
hundred
feet
below
he
was
using
the
time
while
Lynch
was
revived
to
look
for
the
Snitch
without
interference
lynch
got
to
his
feet
at
last
to
loud
cheers
from
the
greenclad
supporters
mounted
his
Firebolt
and
kicked
back
off
into
the
air
his
revival
seemed
to
give
Ireland
new
heart
when
Mostafa
blew
his
whistle
again
the
Chasers
moved
into
action
with
a
skill
unrivaled
by
anything
Harry
had
seen
so
far
after
fifteen
more
fast
and
furious
minutes
Ireland
had
pulled
ahead
by
ten
more
goals
they
were
now
leading
by
one
hundred
and
thirty
points
to
ten
and
the
game
was
starting
to
get
dirtier
as
Mullet
shot
toward
the
goal
posts
yet
again
clutching
the
Quaffle
tightly
under
her
arm
the
Bulgarian
Keeper
Zograf
flew
out
to
meet
her
whatever
happened
was
over
so
quickly
Harry
didn't
catch
it
but
a
scream
of
rage
from
the
Irish
crowd
and
mostafa's
long
shrill
whistle
blast
told
him
it
had
been
a
foul
and
Mostafa
takes
the
Bulgarian
Keeper
to
task
for
cobbing
excessive
use
of
elbows
bagman
informed
the
roaring
spectators
and
yes
it's
a
penalty
to
Ireland
the
leprechauns
who
had
risen
angrily
into
the
air
like
a
swarm
of
glittering
hornets
when
Mullet
had
been
fouled
now
darted
together
to
form
the
words
ha
ha
ha
the
veela
on
the
other
side
of
the
field
leapt
to
their
feet
tossed
their
hair
angrily
and
started
to
dance
again
as
one
the
Weasley
boys
and
Harry
stuffed
their
fingers
into
their
ears
but
Hermione
who
hadn't
bothered
was
soon
tugging
on
harry's
arm
he
turned
to
look
at
her
and
she
pulled
his
fingers
impatiently
out
of
his
ears
look
at
the
referee
she
said
giggling
harry
looked
down
at
the
field
hassan
Mostafa
had
landed
right
in
front
of
the
dancing
veela
and
was
acting
very
oddly
indeed
he
was
flexing
his
muscles
and
smoothing
his
mustache
excitedly
now
we
can't
have
that
said
Ludo
Bagman
though
he
sounded
highly
amused
somebody
slap
the
referee
a
mediwizard
came
tearing
across
the
field
his
fingers
stuffed
into
his
own
ears
and
kicked
Mostafa
hard
in
the
shins
mostafa
seemed
to
come
to
himself
Harry
watching
through
the
Omnioculars
again
saw
that
he
looked
exceptionally
embarrassed
and
had
started
shouting
at
the
veela
who
had
stopped
dancing
and
were
looking
mutinous
and
unless
i'm
much
mistaken
Mostafa
is
actually
attempting
to
send
off
the
Bulgarian
team
mascots
said
bagman's
voice
now
there's
something
we
haven't
seen
before
oh
this
could
turn
nasty
it
did
The
Bulgarian
Beaters
Volkov
and
Vulchanov
landed
on
either
side
of
Mostafa
and
began
arguing
furiously
with
him
gesticulating
toward
the
leprechauns
who
had
now
gleefully
formed
the
words
hee
hee
hee
mostafa
was
not
impressed
by
the
Bulgarians
arguments
however
he
was
jabbing
his
finger
into
the
air
clearly
telling
them
to
get
flying
again
and
when
they
refused
he
gave
two
short
blasts
on
his
whistle
two
penalties
for
Ireland
shouted
Bagman
and
the
Bulgarian
crowd
howled
with
anger
and
Volkov
and
Vulchanov
had
better
get
back
on
those
brooms
yes
there
they
go
and
Troy
takes
the
Quaffle
play
now
reached
a
level
of
ferocity
beyond
anything
they
had
yet
seen
the
Beaters
on
both
sides
were
acting
without
mercy
Volkov
and
Vulchanov
in
particular
seemed
not
to
care
whether
their
clubs
made
contact
with
Bludger
or
human
as
they
swung
them
violently
through
the
air
dimitrov
shot
straight
at
Moran
who
had
the
Quaffle
nearly
knocking
her
off
her
broom
foul
roared
the
Irish
supporters
as
one
all
standing
up
in
a
great
wave
of
green
foul
echoed
Ludo
bagman's
magically
magnified
voice
dimitrov
skins
Moran
deliberately
flying
to
collide
there
and
it's
got
to
be
another
penalty
yes
there's
the
whistle
the
leprechauns
had
risen
into
the
air
again
and
this
time
they
formed
a
giant
hand
which
was
making
a
very
rude
sign
indeed
at
the
veela
across
the
field
at
this
the
veela
lost
control
instead
of
dancing
they
launched
themselves
across
the
field
and
began
throwing
what
seemed
to
be
handfuls
of
fire
at
the
leprechauns
watching
through
his
Omnioculars
Harry
saw
that
they
didn't
look
remotely
beautiful
now
on
the
contrary
their
faces
were
elongating
into
sharp
cruel
beaked
bird
heads
and
long
scaly
wings
were
bursting
from
their
shoulders
And
that
boys
yelled
mr.
Weasley
over
the
tumult
of
the
crowd
below
is
why
you
should
never
go
for
looks
alone
ministry
wizards
were
flooding
onto
the
field
to
separate
the
veela
and
the
leprechauns
but
with
little
success
meanwhile
the
pitched
battle
below
was
nothing
to
the
one
taking
place
above
harry
turned
this
way
and
that
staring
through
his
Omnioculars
as
the
Quaffie
changed
hands
with
the
speed
of
a
bullet
levski
Dimitrov
Moran
Troy
Mullet
Ivanova
Moran
again
Moran
moran
scores
but
the
cheers
of
the
Irish
supporters
were
barely
heard
over
the
shrieks
of
the
veela
the
blasts
now
issuing
from
the
Ministry
members
wands
and
the
furious
roars
of
the
Bulgarians
the
game
recommenced
immediately
now
Levski
had
the
Quaffle
now
Dimitrov
The
Irish
Beater
Quigley
swung
heavily
at
a
passing
Bludger
and
hit
it
as
hard
as
possible
toward
Krum
who
did
not
duck
quickly
enough
it
hit
him
full
in
the
face
there
was
a
deafening
groan
from
the
crowd
krum's
nose
looked
broken
there
was
blood
everywhere
but
Hassan
Mostafa
didn't
blow
his
whistle
he
had
become
distracted
and
Harry
couldn't
blame
him
one
of
the
veela
had
thrown
a
handful
of
fire
and
set
his
broom
tail
alight
harry
wanted
someone
to
realize
that
Krum
was
injured
even
though
he
was
supporting
Ireland
Krum
was
the
most
exciting
player
on
the
field
ron
obviously
felt
the
same
timeout
ah
come
on
he
can't
play
like
that
look
at
him
look
at
Lynch
harry
yelled
for
the
Irish
Seeker
had
suddenly
gone
into
a
dive
and
Harry
was
quite
sure
that
this
was
no
Wronski
Feint
this
was
the
real
thing
he's
seen
the
Snitch
harry
shouted
he's
seen
it
look
at
him
go
half
the
crowd
seemed
to
have
realized
what
was
happening
the
Irish
supporters
rose
in
another
great
wave
of
green
screaming
their
Seeker
on
but
Krum
was
on
his
tail
how
he
could
see
where
he
was
going
Harry
had
no
idea
there
were
flecks
of
blood
flying
through
the
air
behind
him
but
he
was
drawing
level
with
Lynch
now
as
the
pair
of
them
hurtled
toward
the
ground
again
they're
going
to
crash
shrieked
Hermione
they're
not
roared
Ron
lynch
is
yelled
Harry
and
he
was
right
for
the
second
time
Lynch
hit
the
ground
with
tremendous
force
and
was
immediately
stampeded
by
a
horde
of
angry
veela
the
Snitch
where's
the
Snitch
bellowed
Charlie
along
the
row
he's
got
it
krum's
got
it
it's
all
over
shouted
Harry
krum
his
red
robes
shining
with
blood
from
his
nose
was
rising
gently
into
the
air
his
fist
held
high
a
glint
of
gold
in
his
hand
the
scoreboard
was
flashing
bulgaria
ireland
across
the
crowd
who
didn't
seem
to
have
realized
what
had
happened
then
slowly
as
though
a
great
jumbo
jet
were
revving
up
the
rumbling
from
the
Ireland
supporters
grew
louder
and
louder
and
erupted
into
screams
of
delight
ireland
wins
bagman
shouted
who
like
the
Irish
seemed
to
be
taken
aback
by
the
sudden
end
of
the
match
krum
gets
the
snitch
but
ireland
wins
good
lord
I
don't
think
any
of
us
were
expecting
that
what
did
he
catch
the
Snitch
for
ron
bellowed
even
as
he
jumped
up
and
down
applauding
with
his
hands
over
his
head
he
ended
it
when
Ireland
were
a
hundred
and
sixty
points
ahead
the
idiot
he
knew
they
were
never
going
to
catch
up
harry
shouted
back
over
all
the
noise
also
applauding
loudly
the
Irish
Chasers
were
too
good
he
wanted
to
end
it
on
his
terms
that's
all
he
was
very
brave
wasn't
he
hermione
said
leaning
forward
to
watch
Krum
land
as
a
swarm
of
mediwizards
blasted
a
path
through
the
battling
leprechauns
and
veela
to
get
to
him
he
looks
a
terrible
mess
harry
put
his
Omnioculars
to
his
eyes
again
it
was
hard
to
see
what
was
happening
below
because
leprechauns
were
zooming
delightedly
all
over
the
field
but
he
could
just
make
out
Krum
surrounded
by
mediwizards
he
looked
surlier
than
ever
and
refused
to
let
them
mop
him
up
his
team
members
were
around
him
shaking
their
heads
and
looking
dejected
a
short
way
away
the
Irish
players
were
dancing
gleefully
in
a
shower
of
gold
descending
from
their
mascots
flags
were
waving
all
over
the
stadium
the
Irish
national
anthem
blared
from
all
sides
the
veela
were
shrinking
back
into
their
usual
beautiful
selves
now
though
looking
dispirited
and
forlorn
vell
ve
fought
bravely
said
a
gloomy
voice
behind
Harry
he
looked
around
it
was
the
Bulgarian
Minister
of
Magic
you
can
speak
English
said
Fudge
sounding
outraged
and
you've
been
letting
me
mime
everything
all
day
veil
it
vos
very
funny
said
the
Bulgarian
minister
shrugging
and
as
the
Irish
team
performs
a
lap
of
honor
flanked
by
their
mascots
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
itself
is
brought
into
the
Top
Box
roared
Bagman
harry's
eyes
were
suddenly
dazzled
by
a
blinding
white
light
as
the
Top
Box
was
magically
illuminated
so
that
everyone
in
the
stands
could
see
the
inside
squinting
toward
the
entrance
he
saw
two
panting
wizards
carrying
a
vast
golden
cup
into
the
box
which
they
handed
to
Cornelius
Fudge
who
was
still
looking
very
disgruntled
that
he'd
been
using
sign
language
all
day
for
nothing
let's
have
a
really
loud
hand
for
the
gallant
losers
Bulgaria
bagman
shouted
and
up
the
stairs
into
the
box
came
the
seven
defeated
Bulgarian
players
the
crowd
below
was
applauding
appreciatively
Harry
could
see
thousands
and
thousands
of
Omniocular
lenses
flashing
and
winking
in
their
direction
one
by
one
the
Bulgarians
filed
between
the
rows
of
seats
in
the
box
and
Bagman
called
out
the
name
of
each
as
they
shook
hands
with
their
own
minister
and
then
with
Fudge
krum
who
was
last
in
line
looked
a
real
mess
two
black
eyes
were
blooming
spectacularly
on
his
bloody
face
he
was
still
holding
the
Snitch
harry
noticed
that
he
seemed
much
less
coordinated
on
the
ground
he
was
slightly
duckfooted
and
distinctly
roundshouldered
but
when
krum's
name
was
announced
the
whole
stadium
gave
him
a
resounding
earsplitting
roar
and
then
came
the
Irish
team
aidan
Lynch
was
being
supported
by
Moran
and
Connolly
the
second
crash
seemed
to
have
dazed
him
and
his
eyes
looked
strangely
unfocused
but
he
grinned
happily
as
Troy
and
Quigley
lifted
the
Cup
into
the
air
and
the
crowd
below
thundered
its
approval
harry's
hands
were
numb
with
clapping
at
last
when
the
Irish
team
had
left
the
box
to
perform
another
lap
of
honor
on
their
brooms
Aidan
Lynch
on
the
back
of
confolly's
clutching
hard
around
his
waist
and
still
grinning
in
a
bemused
sort
of
way
Bagman
pointed
his
wand
at
his
throat
and
muttered
Quietus
they'll
be
talking
about
this
one
for
years
he
said
hoarsely
a
really
unexpected
twist
that
shame
it
couldn't
have
lasted
longer
ah
yes
yes
I
owe
you
how
much
for
Fred
and
George
had
just
scrambled
over
the
backs
of
their
seats
and
were
standing
in
front
of
Ludo
Bagman
with
broad
grins
on
their
faces
their
hands
outstretched
chapter
nine
the
dark
mark
don't
tell
your
mother
you've
been
gambling
mr.
Weasley
implored
Fred
and
George
as
they
all
made
their
way
slowly
down
the
purplecarpeted
stairs
don't
worry
Dad
said
Fred
gleefully
we've
got
big
plans
for
this
money
we
don't
want
it
confiscated
mr.
Weasley
looked
for
a
moment
as
though
he
was
going
to
ask
what
these
big
plans
were
but
seemed
to
decide
upon
reflection
that
he
didn't
want
to
know
they
were
soon
caught
up
in
the
crowds
now
flooding
out
of
the
stadium
and
back
to
their
campsites
raucous
singing
was
borne
toward
them
on
the
night
air
as
they
retraced
their
steps
along
the
lanternlit
path
and
leprechauns
kept
shooting
over
their
heads
cackling
and
waving
their
lanterns
when
they
finally
reached
the
tents
nobody
felt
like
sleeping
at
all
and
given
the
level
of
noise
around
them
mr.
Weasley
agreed
that
they
could
all
have
one
last
cup
of
cocoa
together
before
turning
in
they
were
soon
arguing
enjoyably
about
the
match
mr.
Weasley
got
drawn
into
a
disagreement
about
cobbing
with
Charlie
and
it
was
only
when
Ginny
fell
asleep
right
at
the
tiny
table
and
spilled
hot
chocolate
all
over
the
floor
that
mr.
Weasley
called
a
halt
to
the
verbal
replays
and
insisted
that
everyone
go
to
bed
hermione
and
Ginny
went
into
the
next
tent
and
Harry
and
the
rest
of
the
Weasleys
changed
into
pajamas
and
clambered
into
their
bunks
from
the
other
side
of
the
campsite
they
could
still
hear
much
singing
and
the
odd
echoing
bang
oh
I
am
glad
i'm
not
on
duty
muttered
mr.
Weasley
sleepily
i
wouldn't
fancy
having
to
go
and
tell
the
Irish
they've
got
to
stop
celebrating
harry
who
was
on
a
top
bunk
above
Ron
lay
staring
up
at
the
canvas
ceiling
of
the
tent
watching
the
glow
of
an
occasional
leprechaun
lantern
flying
overhead
and
picturing
again
some
of
krum's
more
spectacular
moves
he
was
itching
to
get
back
on
his
own
Firebolt
and
try
out
the
Wronski
Feint
somehow
Oliver
Wood
had
never
managed
to
convey
with
all
his
wriggling
diagrams
what
that
move
was
supposed
to
look
like
harry
saw
himself
in
robes
that
had
his
name
on
the
back
and
imagined
the
sensation
of
hearing
a
hundredthousandstrong
crowd
roar
as
Ludo
bagman's
voice
echoed
throughout
the
stadium
I
give
you
potter
harry
never
knew
whether
or
not
he
had
actually
dropped
off
to
sleep
his
fantasies
of
flying
like
Krum
might
well
have
slipped
into
actual
dreams
all
he
knew
was
that
quite
suddenly
mr.
Weasley
was
shouting
get
up
ron
Harry
come
on
now
get
up
this
is
urgent
harry
sat
up
quickly
and
the
top
of
his
head
hit
canvas
s
matter
he
said
dimly
he
could
tell
that
something
was
wrong
the
noises
in
the
campsite
had
changed
the
singing
had
stopped
he
could
hear
screams
and
the
sound
of
people
running
he
slipped
down
from
the
bunk
and
reached
for
his
clothes
but
mr.
Weasley
who
had
pulled
on
his
jeans
over
his
own
pajamas
said
No
time
Harry
just
grab
a
jacket
and
get
outside
quickly
harry
did
as
he
was
told
and
hurried
out
of
the
tent
Ron
at
his
heels
by
the
light
of
the
few
fires
that
were
still
burning
he
could
see
people
running
away
into
the
woods
fleeing
something
that
was
moving
across
the
field
toward
them
something
that
was
emitting
odd
flashes
of
light
and
noises
like
gunfire
loud
jeering
roars
of
laughter
and
drunken
yells
were
drifting
toward
them
then
came
a
burst
of
strong
green
light
which
illuminated
the
scene
a
crowd
of
wizards
tightly
packed
and
moving
together
with
wands
pointing
straight
upward
was
marching
slowly
across
the
field
harry
squinted
at
them
they
didn't
seem
to
have
faces
then
he
realized
that
their
heads
were
hooded
and
their
faces
masked
high
above
them
floating
along
in
midair
four
struggling
figures
were
being
contorted
into
grotesque
shapes
it
was
as
though
the
masked
wizards
on
the
ground
were
puppeteers
and
the
people
above
them
were
marionettes
operated
by
invisible
strings
that
rose
from
the
wands
into
the
air
two
of
the
figures
were
very
small
more
wizards
were
joining
the
marching
group
laughing
and
pointing
up
at
the
floating
bodies
tents
crumpled
and
fell
as
the
marching
crowd
swelled
once
or
twice
Harry
saw
one
of
the
marchers
blast
a
tent
out
of
his
way
with
his
wand
several
caught
fire
the
screaming
grew
louder
the
floating
people
were
suddenly
illuminated
as
they
passed
over
a
burning
tent
and
Harry
recognized
one
of
them
mr.
Roberts
the
campsite
manager
the
other
three
looked
as
though
they
might
be
his
wife
and
children
one
of
the
marchers
below
flipped
Mrs
roberts
upside
down
with
his
wand
her
nightdress
fell
down
to
reveal
voluminous
drawers
and
she
struggled
to
cover
herself
up
as
the
crowd
below
her
screeched
and
hooted
with
glee
that's
sick
Ron
muttered
watching
the
smallest
Muggle
child
who
had
begun
to
spin
like
a
top
sixty
feet
above
the
ground
his
head
flopping
limply
from
side
to
side
that
is
really
sick
hermione
and
Ginny
came
hurrying
toward
them
pulling
coats
over
their
nightdresses
with
mr.
Weasley
right
behind
them
at
the
same
moment
Bill
Charlie
and
Percy
emerged
from
the
boys
tent
fully
dressed
with
their
sleeves
rolled
up
and
their
wands
out
we're
going
to
help
the
Ministry
mr.
Weasley
shouted
over
all
the
noise
rolling
up
his
own
sleeves
you
lot
get
into
the
woods
and
stick
together
i'll
come
and
fetch
you
when
we've
sorted
this
out
bill
Charlie
and
Percy
were
already
sprinting
away
toward
the
oncoming
marchers
mr.
Weasley
tore
after
them
ministry
wizards
were
dashing
from
every
direction
toward
the
source
of
the
trouble
the
crowd
beneath
the
Roberts
family
was
coming
ever
closer
c'mon
said
Fred
grabbing
ginny's
hand
and
starting
to
pull
her
toward
the
wood
harry
Ron
Hermione
and
George
followed
they
all
looked
back
as
they
reached
the
trees
the
crowd
beneath
the
Roberts
family
was
larger
than
ever
they
could
see
the
Ministry
wizards
trying
to
get
through
it
to
the
hooded
wizards
in
the
center
but
they
were
having
great
difficulty
it
looked
as
though
they
were
scared
to
perform
any
spell
that
might
make
the
Roberts
family
fall
the
colored
lanterns
that
had
lit
the
path
to
the
stadium
had
been
extinguished
dark
figures
were
blundering
through
the
trees
children
were
crying
anxious
shouts
and
panicked
voices
were
reverberating
around
them
in
the
cold
night
air
harry
felt
himself
being
pushed
hither
and
thither
by
people
whose
faces
he
could
not
see
then
he
heard
Ron
yell
with
pain
what
happened
said
Hermione
anxiously
stopping
so
abruptly
that
Harry
walked
into
her
ron
where
are
you
oh
this
is
stupid
lumos
she
illuminated
her
wand
and
directed
its
narrow
beam
across
the
path
ron
was
lying
sprawled
on
the
ground
tripped
over
a
tree
root
he
said
angrily
getting
to
his
feet
again
well
with
feet
that
size
hard
not
to
said
a
drawling
voice
from
behind
them
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
turned
sharply
draco
Malfoy
was
standing
alone
nearby
leaning
against
a
tree
looking
utterly
relaxed
his
arms
folded
he
seemed
to
have
been
watching
the
scene
at
the
campsite
through
a
gap
in
the
trees
ron
told
Malfoy
to
do
something
that
Harry
knew
he
would
never
have
dared
say
in
front
of
Mrs
weasley
language
Weasley
said
Malfoy
his
pale
eyes
glittering
hadn't
you
better
be
hurrying
along
now
you
wouldn't
like
her
spotted
would
you
he
nodded
at
Hermione
and
at
the
same
moment
a
blast
like
a
bomb
sounded
from
the
campsite
and
a
flash
of
green
light
momentarily
lit
the
trees
around
them
what's
that
supposed
to
mean
said
Hermione
defiantly
granger
they're
after
Muggles
said
Malfoy
d'you
want
to
be
showing
off
your
knickers
in
midair
because
if
you
do
hang
around
they're
moving
this
way
and
it
would
give
us
all
a
laugh
hermione's
a
witch
Harry
snarled
have
it
your
own
way
Potter
said
Malfoy
grinning
maliciously
if
you
think
they
can't
spot
a
Mudblood
stay
where
you
are
you
watch
your
mouth
shouted
Ron
everybody
present
knew
that
Mudblood
was
a
very
offensive
term
for
a
witch
or
wizard
of
Muggle
parentage
never
mind
Ron
said
Hermione
quickly
seizing
ron's
arm
to
restrain
him
as
he
took
a
step
toward
Malfoy
there
came
a
bang
from
the
other
side
of
the
trees
that
was
louder
than
anything
they
had
heard
several
people
nearby
screamed
malfoy
chuckled
softly
scare
easily
don't
they
he
said
lazily
i
suppose
your
daddy
told
you
all
to
hide
what's
he
up
to
trying
to
rescue
the
Muggles
where're
your
parents
said
Harry
his
temper
rising
out
there
wearing
masks
are
they
malfoy
turned
his
face
to
Harry
still
smiling
well
if
they
were
I
wouldn't
be
likely
to
tell
you
would
I
Potter
oh
come
on
said
Hermione
with
a
disgusted
look
at
Malfoy
let's
go
and
find
the
others
keep
that
big
bushy
head
down
Granger
sneered
Malfoy
come
on
Hermione
repeated
and
she
pulled
Harry
and
Ron
up
the
path
again
i'll
bet
you
anything
his
dad
is
one
of
that
masked
lot
said
Ron
hotly
well
with
any
luck
the
Ministry
will
catch
him
said
Hermione
fervently
oh
I
can't
believe
this
where
have
the
others
got
to
fred
George
and
Ginny
were
nowhere
to
be
seen
though
the
path
was
packed
with
plenty
of
other
people
all
looking
nervously
over
their
shoulders
toward
the
commotion
back
at
the
campsite
a
huddle
of
teenagers
in
pajamas
was
arguing
vociferously
a
little
way
along
the
path
when
they
saw
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
a
girl
with
thick
curly
hair
turned
and
said
quickly
O
est
Madame
Maxime
nous
l'avons
perdue
er
what
said
Ron
oh
the
girl
who
had
spoken
turned
her
back
on
him
and
as
they
walked
on
they
distinctly
heard
her
say
Ogwarts
beauxbatons
muttered
Hermione
sorry
said
Harry
they
must
go
to
Beauxbatons
said
Hermione
you
know
beauxbatons
Academy
of
Magic
i
read
about
it
in
An
Appraisal
ofMagical
Education
in
Europe
oh
yeah
right
said
Harry
fred
and
George
can't
have
gone
that
far
said
Ron
pulling
out
his
wand
lighting
it
like
hermione's
and
squinting
up
the
path
harry
dug
in
the
pockets
of
his
jacket
for
his
own
wand
but
it
wasn't
there
the
only
thing
he
could
find
was
his
Omnioculars
ah
no
I
don't
believe
it
i've
lost
my
wand
you're
kidding
ron
and
Hermione
raised
their
wands
high
enough
to
spread
the
narrow
beams
of
light
farther
on
the
ground
Harry
looked
all
around
him
but
his
wand
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
maybe
it's
back
in
the
tent
said
Ron
maybe
it
fell
out
of
your
pocket
when
we
were
running
hermione
suggested
anxiously
yeah
said
Harry
maybe
he
usually
kept
his
wand
with
him
at
all
times
in
the
wizarding
world
and
finding
himself
without
it
in
the
midst
of
a
scene
like
this
made
him
feel
very
vulnerable
a
rustling
noise
nearby
made
all
three
of
them
jump
winky
the
houseelf
was
fighting
her
way
out
of
a
clump
of
bushes
nearby
she
was
moving
in
a
most
peculiar
fashion
apparently
with
great
difficulty
it
was
as
though
someone
invisible
were
trying
to
hold
her
back
there
is
bad
wizards
about
she
squeaked
distractedly
as
she
leaned
forward
and
labored
to
keep
running
people
high
high
in
the
air
winky
is
getting
out
of
the
way
and
she
disappeared
into
the
trees
on
the
other
side
of
the
path
panting
and
squeaking
as
she
fought
the
force
that
was
restraining
her
what's
up
with
her
said
Ron
looking
curiously
after
Winky
why
can't
she
run
properly
bet
she
didn't
ask
permission
to
hide
said
Harry
he
was
thinking
of
Dobby
every
time
he
had
tried
to
do
something
the
Malfoys
wouldn't
like
the
houseelf
had
been
forced
to
start
beating
himself
up
you
know
houseelves
get
a
very
raw
deal
said
Hermione
indignantly
it's
slavery
that's
what
it
is
that
mr.
Crouch
made
her
go
up
to
the
top
of
the
stadium
and
she
was
terrified
and
he's
got
her
bewitched
so
she
can't
even
run
when
they
start
trampling
tents
why
doesn't
anyone
do
something
about
it
well
the
elves
are
happy
aren't
they
ron
said
you
heard
old
Winky
back
at
the
match
houseelves
is
not
supposed
to
have
fun
that's
what
she
likes
being
bossed
around
it's
people
like
you
Ron
Hermione
began
hotly
who
prop
up
rotten
and
unjust
systems
just
because
they're
too
lazy
to
another
loud
bang
echoed
from
the
edge
of
the
wood
let's
just
keep
moving
shall
we
said
Ron
and
Harry
saw
him
glance
edgily
at
Hermione
perhaps
there
was
truth
in
what
Malfoy
had
said
perhaps
Hermione
was
in
more
danger
than
they
were
they
set
off
again
Harry
still
searching
his
pockets
even
though
he
knew
his
wand
wasn't
there
they
followed
the
dark
path
deeper
into
the
wood
still
keeping
an
eye
out
for
Fred
George
and
Ginny
they
passed
a
group
of
goblins
who
were
cackling
over
a
sack
of
gold
that
they
had
undoubtedly
won
betting
on
the
match
and
who
seemed
quite
unperturbed
by
the
trouble
at
the
campsite
farther
still
along
the
path
they
walked
into
a
patch
of
silvery
light
and
when
they
looked
through
the
trees
they
saw
three
tall
and
beautiful
veela
standing
in
a
clearing
surrounded
by
a
gaggle
of
young
wizards
all
of
whom
were
talking
very
loudly
i
pull
down
about
a
hundred
sacks
of
Galleons
a
year
one
of
them
shouted
i'm
a
dragon
killer
for
the
Committee
for
the
Disposal
of
Dangerous
Creatures
no
you're
not
yelled
his
friend
you're
a
dishwasher
at
the
Leaky
Cauldron
but
i'm
a
vampire
hunter
i've
killed
about
ninety
so
far
a
third
young
wizard
whose
pimples
were
visible
even
by
the
dim
silvery
light
of
the
veela
now
cut
in
i'm
about
to
become
the
youngest
ever
Minister
of
Magic
I
am
harry
snorted
with
laughter
he
recognized
the
pimply
wizard
His
name
was
Stan
Shunpike
and
he
was
in
fact
a
conductor
on
the
tripledecker
Knight
Bus
he
turned
to
tell
Ron
this
but
ron's
face
had
gone
oddly
slack
and
next
second
Ron
was
yelling
Did
I
tell
you
i've
invented
a
broomstick
that'll
reach
Jupiter
honestly
said
Hermione
and
she
and
Harry
grabbed
Ron
firmly
by
the
arms
wheeled
him
around
and
marched
him
away
by
the
time
the
sounds
of
the
veela
and
their
admirers
had
faded
completely
they
were
in
the
very
heart
of
the
wood
they
seemed
to
be
alone
now
everything
was
much
quieter
harry
looked
around
i
reckon
we
can
just
wait
here
you
know
we'll
hear
anyone
coming
a
mile
off
the
words
were
hardly
out
of
his
mouth
when
Ludo
Bagman
emerged
from
behind
a
tree
right
ahead
of
them
even
by
the
feeble
light
of
the
two
wands
Harry
could
see
that
a
great
change
had
come
over
Bagman
he
no
longer
looked
buoyant
and
rosyfaced
there
was
no
more
spring
in
his
step
he
looked
very
white
and
strained
who's
that
he
said
blinking
down
at
them
trying
to
make
out
their
faces
what
are
you
doing
in
here
all
alone
they
looked
at
one
another
surprised
well
there's
a
sort
of
riot
going
on
said
Ron
bagman
stared
at
him
what
at
the
campsite
some
people
have
got
hold
of
a
family
of
Muggles
bagman
swore
loudly
damn
them
he
said
looking
quite
distracted
and
without
another
word
he
Disapparated
with
a
small
pop
not
exactly
on
top
of
things
mr.
Bagman
is
he
said
Hermione
frowning
he
was
a
great
Beater
though
said
Ron
leading
the
way
off
the
path
into
a
small
clearing
and
sitting
down
on
a
patch
of
dry
grass
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
the
Wimbourne
Wasps
won
the
league
three
times
in
a
row
while
he
was
with
them
he
took
his
small
figure
of
Krum
out
of
his
pocket
set
it
down
on
the
ground
and
watched
it
walk
around
like
the
real
Krum
the
model
was
slightly
duckfooted
and
roundshouldered
much
less
impressive
on
his
splayed
feet
than
on
his
broomstick
harry
was
listening
for
noise
from
the
campsite
everything
seemed
much
quieter
perhaps
the
riot
was
over
i
hope
the
others
are
okay
said
Hermione
after
a
while
they'll
be
fine
said
Ron
imagine
if
your
dad
catches
Lucius
Malfoy
said
Harry
sitting
down
next
to
Ron
and
watching
the
small
figure
of
Krum
slouching
over
the
fallen
leaves
he's
always
said
he'd
like
to
get
something
on
him
that'd
wipe
the
smirk
off
old
draco's
face
all
right
said
Ron
those
poor
Muggles
though
said
Hermione
nervously
what
if
they
can't
get
them
down
they
will
said
Ron
reassuringly
they'll
find
a
way
mad
though
to
do
something
like
that
when
the
whole
Ministry
of
magic's
out
here
tonight
said
Hermione
i
mean
how
do
they
expect
to
get
away
with
it
do
you
think
they've
been
drinking
or
are
they
just
but
she
broke
off
abruptly
and
looked
over
her
shoulder
harry
and
Ron
looked
quickly
around
too
it
sounded
as
though
someone
was
staggering
toward
their
clearing
they
waited
listening
to
the
sounds
of
the
uneven
steps
behind
the
dark
trees
but
the
footsteps
came
to
a
sudden
halt
hello
called
Harry
there
was
silence
harry
got
to
his
feet
and
peered
around
the
tree
it
was
too
dark
to
see
very
far
but
he
could
sense
somebody
standing
just
beyond
the
range
of
his
vision
who's
there
he
said
and
then
without
warning
the
silence
was
rent
by
a
voice
unlike
any
they
had
heard
in
the
wood
and
it
uttered
not
a
panicked
shout
but
what
sounded
like
a
spell
morsmordre
and
something
vast
green
and
glittering
erupted
from
the
patch
of
darkness
harry's
eyes
had
been
struggling
to
penetrate
it
flew
up
over
the
treetops
and
into
the
sky
what
the
gasped
Ron
as
he
sprang
to
his
feet
again
staring
up
at
the
thing
that
had
appeared
for
a
split
second
Harry
thought
it
was
another
leprechaun
formation
then
he
realized
that
it
was
a
colossal
skull
comprised
of
what
looked
like
emerald
stars
with
a
serpent
protruding
from
its
mouth
like
a
tongue
as
they
watched
it
rose
higher
and
higher
blazing
in
a
haze
of
greenish
smoke
etched
against
the
black
sky
like
a
new
constellation
suddenly
the
wood
all
around
them
erupted
with
screams
harry
didn't
understand
why
but
the
only
possible
cause
was
the
sudden
appearance
of
the
skull
which
had
now
risen
high
enough
to
illuminate
the
entire
wood
like
some
grisly
neon
sign
he
scanned
the
darkness
for
the
person
who
had
conjured
the
skull
but
he
couldn't
see
anyone
who's
there
he
called
again
harry
come
on
move
hermione
had
seized
the
collar
of
his
jacket
and
was
tugging
him
backward
what's
the
matter
harry
said
startled
to
see
her
face
so
white
and
terrified
it's
the
Dark
Mark
Harry
hermione
moaned
pulling
him
as
hard
as
she
could
youknowwho's
sign
voldemort's
Harry
come
on
harry
turned
Ron
was
hurriedly
scooping
up
his
miniature
Krum
the
three
of
them
started
across
the
clearing
but
before
they
had
taken
a
few
hurried
steps
a
series
of
popping
noises
announced
the
arrival
of
twenty
wizards
appearing
from
thin
air
surrounding
them
harry
whirled
around
and
in
an
instant
he
registered
one
fact
Each
of
these
wizards
had
his
wand
out
and
every
wand
was
pointing
right
at
himself
Ron
and
Hermione
without
pausing
to
think
he
yelled
duck
he
seized
the
other
two
and
pulled
them
down
onto
the
ground
stupefy
roared
twenty
voices
there
was
a
blinding
series
of
flashes
and
Harry
felt
the
hair
on
his
head
ripple
as
though
a
powerful
wind
had
swept
the
clearing
raising
his
head
a
fraction
of
an
inch
he
saw
jets
of
fiery
red
light
flying
over
them
from
the
wizards
wands
crossing
one
another
bouncing
off
tree
trunks
rebounding
into
the
darkness
Stop
yelled
a
voice
he
recognized
stop
that's
my
son
harry's
hair
stopped
blowing
about
he
raised
his
head
a
little
higher
the
wizard
in
front
of
him
had
lowered
his
wand
he
rolled
over
and
saw
mr.
Weasley
striding
toward
them
looking
terrified
ron
Harry
his
voice
sounded
shaky
Hermione
are
you
all
right
out
of
the
way
Arthur
said
a
cold
curt
voice
it
was
mr.
Crouch
he
and
the
other
Ministry
wizards
were
closing
in
on
them
harry
got
to
his
feet
to
face
them
mr.
crouch's
face
was
taut
with
rage
which
of
you
did
it
he
snapped
his
sharp
eyes
darting
between
them
which
of
you
conjured
the
Dark
Mark
we
didn't
do
that
said
Harry
gesturing
up
at
the
skull
we
didn't
do
anything
said
Ron
who
was
rubbing
his
elbow
and
looking
indignantly
at
his
father
what
did
you
want
to
attack
us
for
do
not
lie
sir
shouted
mr.
Crouch
his
wand
was
still
pointing
directly
at
Ron
and
his
eyes
were
popping
he
looked
slightly
mad
you
have
been
discovered
at
the
scene
of
the
crime
barty
whispered
a
witch
in
a
long
woolen
dressing
gown
they're
kids
Barty
they'd
never
have
been
able
to
Where
did
the
Mark
come
from
you
three
said
mr.
Weasley
quickly
over
there
said
Hermione
shakily
pointing
at
the
place
where
they
had
heard
the
voice
there
was
someone
behind
the
trees
they
shouted
words
an
incantation
oh
stood
over
there
did
they
said
mr.
Crouch
turning
his
popping
eyes
on
Hermione
now
disbelief
etched
all
over
his
face
said
an
incantation
did
they
you
seem
very
well
informed
about
how
that
Mark
is
summoned
missy
but
none
of
the
Ministry
wizards
apart
from
mr.
Crouch
seemed
to
think
it
remotely
likely
that
Harry
Ron
or
Hermione
had
conjured
the
skull
on
the
contrary
at
hermione's
words
they
had
all
raised
their
wands
again
and
were
pointing
in
the
direction
she
had
indicated
squinting
through
the
dark
trees
we're
too
late
said
the
witch
in
the
woolen
dressing
gown
shaking
her
head
they'll
have
Disapparated
i
don't
think
so
said
a
wizard
with
a
scrubby
brown
beard
it
was
Amos
Diggory
cedric's
father
our
Stunners
went
right
through
those
trees
there's
a
good
chance
we
got
them
amos
be
careful
said
a
few
of
the
wizards
warningly
as
mr.
Diggory
squared
his
shoulders
raised
his
wand
marched
across
the
clearing
and
disappeared
into
the
darkness
hermione
watched
him
vanish
with
her
hands
over
her
mouth
a
few
seconds
later
they
heard
mr.
Diggory
shout
yes
we
got
them
there's
someone
here
unconscious
it's
but
blimey
you've
got
someone
shouted
mr.
Crouch
sounding
highly
disbelieving
who
who
is
it
they
heard
snapping
twigs
the
rustling
of
leaves
and
then
crunching
footsteps
as
mr.
Diggory
reemerged
from
behind
the
trees
he
was
carrying
a
tiny
limp
figure
in
his
arms
harry
recognized
the
tea
towel
at
once
it
was
Winky
mr.
Crouch
did
not
move
or
speak
as
mr.
Diggory
deposited
his
elf
on
the
ground
at
his
feet
the
other
Ministry
wizards
were
all
staring
at
mr.
Crouch
for
a
few
seconds
Crouch
remained
transfixed
his
eyes
blazing
in
his
white
face
as
he
stared
down
at
Winky
then
he
appeared
to
come
to
life
again
this
cannot
be
he
said
jerkily
no
he
moved
quickly
around
mr.
Diggory
and
strode
off
toward
the
place
where
he
had
found
Winky
no
point
mr.
Crouch
mr.
Diggory
called
after
him
there's
no
one
else
there
but
mr.
Crouch
did
not
seem
prepared
to
take
his
word
for
it
they
could
hear
him
moving
around
and
the
rustling
of
leaves
as
he
pushed
the
bushes
aside
searching
bit
embarrassing
mr.
Diggory
said
grimly
looking
down
at
winky's
unconscious
form
barty
crouch's
houseelf
i
mean
to
say
come
off
it
Amos
said
mr.
Weasley
quietly
you
don't
seriously
think
it
was
the
elf
the
Dark
mark's
a
wizard's
sign
it
requires
a
wand
yeah
said
mr.
Diggory
and
she
had
a
wand
what
said
mr.
Weasley
here
look
mr.
Diggory
held
up
a
wand
and
showed
it
to
mr.
Weasley
had
it
in
her
hand
so
that's
clause
three
of
the
Code
of
Wand
Use
broken
for
a
start
no
nonhuman
creature
is
permitted
to
carry
or
use
a
wand
just
then
there
was
another
pop
and
Ludo
Bagman
Apparated
right
next
to
Mr
weasley
looking
breathless
and
disorientated
he
spun
on
the
spot
goggling
upward
at
the
emeraldgreen
skull
the
Dark
Mark
he
panted
almost
trampling
Winky
as
he
turned
inquiringly
to
his
colleagues
who
did
it
did
you
get
them
barry
what's
going
on
mr.
Crouch
had
returned
emptyhanded
his
face
was
still
ghostly
white
and
his
hands
and
his
toothbrush
mustache
were
both
twitching
where
have
you
been
Barty
said
Bagman
why
weren't
you
at
the
match
your
elf
was
saving
you
a
seat
too
gulping
gargoyles
bagman
had
just
noticed
Winky
lying
at
his
feet
what
happened
to
her
i
have
been
busy
Ludo
said
mr.
Crouch
still
talking
in
the
same
jerky
fashion
barely
moving
his
lips
and
my
elf
has
been
stunned
stunned
by
you
lot
you
mean
but
why
comprehension
dawned
suddenly
on
bagman's
round
shiny
face
he
looked
up
at
the
skull
down
at
Winky
and
then
at
mr.
Crouch
no
he
said
winky
conjure
the
Dark
Mark
she
wouldn't
know
how
she'd
need
a
wand
for
a
start
and
she
had
one
said
mr.
Diggory
i
found
her
holding
one
Ludo
if
it's
all
right
with
you
mr.
Crouch
I
think
we
should
hear
what
she's
got
to
say
for
herself
crouch
gave
no
sign
that
he
had
heard
mr.
Diggory
but
mr.
Diggory
seemed
to
take
his
silence
for
assent
he
raised
his
own
wand
pointed
it
at
Winky
and
said
Ennervate
winky
stirred
feebly
her
great
brown
eyes
opened
and
she
blinked
several
times
in
a
bemused
sort
of
way
watched
by
the
silent
wizards
she
raised
herself
shakily
into
a
sitting
position
she
caught
sight
of
mr.
diggory's
feet
and
slowly
tremulously
raised
her
eyes
to
stare
up
into
his
face
then
more
slowly
still
she
looked
up
into
the
sky
harry
could
see
the
floating
skull
reflected
twice
in
her
enormous
glassy
eyes
she
gave
a
gasp
looked
wildly
around
the
crowded
clearing
and
burst
into
terrified
sobs
elf
said
mr.
Diggory
sternly
do
you
know
who
I
am
i'm
a
member
of
the
Department
for
the
Regulation
and
Control
of
Magical
Creatures
winky
began
to
rock
backward
and
forward
on
the
ground
her
breath
coming
in
sharp
bursts
harry
was
reminded
forcibly
of
Dobby
in
his
moments
of
terrified
disobedience
as
you
see
elf
the
Dark
Mark
was
conjured
here
a
short
while
ago
said
Mr
diggory
and
you
were
discovered
moments
later
right
beneath
it
an
explanation
if
you
please
i
I
I
is
not
doing
it
sir
winky
gasped
i
is
not
knowing
how
sir
you
were
found
with
a
wand
in
your
hand
barked
mr.
Diggory
brandishing
it
in
front
of
her
and
as
the
wand
caught
the
green
light
that
was
filling
the
clearing
from
the
skull
above
Harry
recognized
it
Hey
that's
mine
he
said
Everyone
in
the
clearing
looked
at
him
excuse
me
said
mr.
Diggory
incredulously
that's
my
wand
said
Harry
i
dropped
it
you
dropped
it
repeated
mr.
Diggory
in
disbelief
is
this
a
confession
you
threw
it
aside
after
you
conjured
the
Mark
amos
think
who
you're
talking
to
said
mr.
Weasley
very
angrily
is
Harry
Potter
likely
to
conjure
the
Dark
Mark
er
of
course
not
mumbled
mr.
Diggory
sorry
carried
away
i
didn't
drop
it
there
anyway
said
Harry
jerking
his
thumb
toward
the
trees
beneath
the
skull
i
missed
it
right
after
we
got
into
the
wood
so
said
mr.
Diggory
his
eyes
hardening
as
he
turned
to
look
at
Winky
again
cowering
at
his
feet
you
found
this
wand
eh
elf
and
you
picked
it
up
and
thought
you'd
have
some
fun
with
it
did
you
i
is
not
doing
magic
with
it
sir
squealed
Winky
tears
streaming
down
the
sides
of
her
squashed
and
bulbous
nose
i
is
i
is
i
is
just
picking
it
up
sir
i
is
not
making
the
Dark
Mark
sir
i
is
not
knowing
how
it
wasn't
her
said
Hermione
she
looked
very
nervous
speaking
up
in
front
of
all
these
Ministry
wizards
yet
determined
all
the
same
winky's
got
a
squeaky
little
voice
and
the
voice
we
heard
doing
the
incantation
was
much
deeper
she
looked
around
at
Harry
and
Ron
appealing
for
their
support
it
didn't
sound
anything
like
Winky
did
it
no
said
Harry
shaking
his
head
it
definitely
didn't
sound
like
an
elf
yeah
it
was
a
human
voice
said
Ron
well
we'll
soon
see
growled
mr.
Diggory
looking
unimpressed
there's
a
simple
way
of
discovering
the
last
spell
a
wand
performed
elf
did
you
know
that
winky
trembled
and
shook
her
head
frantically
her
ears
flapping
as
mr.
Diggory
raised
his
own
wand
again
and
placed
it
tip
to
tip
with
harry's
prior
Incantato
roared
mr.
Diggory
harry
heard
Hermione
gasp
horrified
as
a
gigantic
serpenttongued
skull
erupted
from
the
point
where
the
two
wands
met
but
it
was
a
mere
shadow
of
the
green
skull
high
above
them
it
looked
as
though
it
were
made
of
thick
gray
smoke
the
ghost
of
a
spell
deletrius
mr.
Diggory
shouted
and
the
smoky
skull
vanished
in
a
wisp
of
smoke
so
said
mr.
Diggory
with
a
kind
of
savage
triumph
looking
down
upon
Winky
who
was
still
shaking
convulsively
i
is
not
doing
it
she
squealed
her
eyes
rolling
in
terror
i
is
not
I
is
not
I
is
not
knowing
how
i
is
a
good
elf
I
isn't
using
wands
I
isn't
knowing
how
you've
been
caught
redhanded
elf
mr.
Diggory
roared
caught
with
the
guilty
wand
in
your
hand
amos
said
mr.
Weasley
loudly
think
about
it
precious
few
wizards
know
how
to
do
that
spell
where
would
she
have
learned
it
perhaps
Amos
is
suggesting
said
mr.
Crouch
cold
anger
in
every
syllable
that
I
routinely
teach
my
servants
to
conjure
the
Dark
Mark
there
was
a
deeply
unpleasant
silence
amos
Diggory
looked
horrified
mr
crouch
not
not
at
all
you
have
now
come
very
close
to
accusing
the
two
people
in
this
clearing
who
are
least
likely
to
conjure
that
Mark
barked
mr.
Crouch
harry
Potter
and
myself
i
suppose
you
are
familiar
with
the
boy's
story
Amos
of
course
everyone
knows
muttered
mr.
Diggory
looking
highly
discomforted
and
I
trust
you
remember
the
many
proofs
I
have
given
over
a
long
career
that
I
despise
and
detest
the
Dark
Arts
and
those
who
practice
them
mr.
Crouch
shouted
his
eyes
bulging
again
mr.
Crouch
I
I
never
suggested
you
had
anything
to
do
with
it
amos
Diggory
muttered
again
now
reddening
behind
his
scrubby
brown
beard
if
you
accuse
my
elf
you
accuse
me
Diggory
shouted
mr.
Crouch
where
else
would
she
have
learned
to
conjure
it
she
she
might've
picked
it
up
anywhere
precisely
Amos
said
mr.
Weasley
she
might
have
picked
it
up
anywhere
winky
he
said
kindly
turning
to
the
elf
but
she
flinched
as
though
he
too
was
shouting
at
her
where
exactly
did
you
find
harry's
wand
winky
was
twisting
the
hem
of
her
tea
towel
so
violently
that
it
was
fraying
beneath
her
fingers
i
I
is
finding
it
finding
it
there
sir
she
whispered
there
in
the
trees
sir
you
see
Amos
said
mr.
Weasley
whoever
conjured
the
Mark
could
have
Disapparated
right
after
they'd
done
it
leaving
harry's
wand
behind
a
clever
thing
to
do
not
using
their
own
wand
which
could
have
betrayed
them
and
Winky
here
had
the
misfortune
to
come
across
the
wand
moments
later
and
pick
it
up
but
then
she'd
have
been
only
a
few
feet
away
from
the
real
culprit
said
Mr
diggory
impatiently
elf
did
you
see
anyone
winky
began
to
tremble
worse
than
ever
her
giant
eyes
flickered
from
Mr
diggory
to
Ludo
Bagman
and
onto
mr.
Crouch
then
she
gulped
and
said
I
is
seeing
no
one
sir
no
one
amos
said
mr.
Crouch
curtly
I
am
fully
aware
that
in
the
ordinary
course
of
events
you
would
want
to
take
Winky
into
your
department
for
questioning
i
ask
you
however
to
allow
me
to
deal
with
her
mr.
Diggory
looked
as
though
he
didn't
think
much
of
this
suggestion
at
all
but
it
was
clear
to
Harry
that
mr.
Crouch
was
such
an
important
member
of
the
Ministry
that
he
did
not
dare
refuse
him
you
may
rest
assured
that
she
will
be
punished
mr.
Crouch
added
coldly
mmmaster
winky
stammered
looking
up
at
mr.
Crouch
her
eyes
brimming
with
tears
mmmaster
ppplease
mr.
Crouch
stared
back
his
face
somehow
sharpened
each
line
upon
it
more
deeply
etched
there
was
no
pity
in
his
gaze
winky
has
behaved
tonight
in
a
manner
I
would
not
have
believed
possible
he
said
slowly
i
told
her
to
remain
in
the
tent
i
told
her
to
stay
there
while
I
went
to
sort
out
the
trouble
and
I
find
that
she
disobeyed
me
this
means
clothes
no
shrieked
Winky
prostrating
herself
at
mr.
crouch's
feet
no
master
not
clothes
not
clothes
harry
knew
that
the
only
way
to
turn
a
houseelf
free
was
to
present
it
with
proper
garments
it
was
pitiful
to
see
the
way
Winky
clutched
at
her
tea
towel
as
she
sobbed
over
mr.
crouch's
feet
but
she
was
frightened
hermione
burst
out
angrily
glaring
at
mr.
Crouch
your
elf's
scared
of
heights
and
those
wizards
in
masks
were
levitating
people
you
can't
blame
her
for
wanting
to
get
out
of
their
way
mr.
Crouch
took
a
step
backward
freeing
himself
from
contact
with
the
elf
whom
he
was
surveying
as
though
she
were
something
filthy
and
rotten
that
was
contaminating
his
overshined
shoes
i
have
no
use
for
a
houseelf
who
disobeys
me
he
said
coldly
looking
over
at
Hermione
i
have
no
use
for
a
servant
who
forgets
what
is
due
to
her
master
and
to
her
master's
reputation
winky
was
crying
so
hard
that
her
sobs
echoed
around
the
clearing
there
was
a
very
nasty
silence
which
was
ended
by
mr.
Weasley
who
said
quietly
Well
I
think
i'll
take
my
lot
back
to
the
tent
if
nobody's
got
any
objections
amos
that
wand's
told
us
all
it
can
if
Harry
could
have
it
back
please
mr.
Diggory
handed
Harry
his
wand
and
Harry
pocketed
it
come
on
you
three
mr.
Weasley
said
quietly
but
Hermione
didn't
seem
to
want
to
move
her
eyes
were
still
upon
the
sobbing
elf
hermione
mr.
Weasley
said
more
urgently
she
turned
and
followed
Harry
and
Ron
out
of
the
clearing
and
off
through
the
trees
what's
going
to
happen
to
Winky
said
Hermione
the
moment
they
had
left
the
clearing
i
don't
know
said
mr.
Weasley
the
way
they
were
treating
her
said
Hermione
furiously
mr.
Diggory
calling
her
elf
all
the
time
and
mr.
Crouch
he
knows
she
didn't
do
it
and
he's
still
going
to
sack
her
he
didn't
care
how
frightened
she'd
been
or
how
upset
she
was
it
was
like
she
wasn't
even
human
well
she's
not
said
Ron
hermione
rounded
on
him
that
doesn't
mean
she
hasn't
got
feelings
Ron
it's
disgusting
the
way
hermione
I
agree
with
you
said
mr.
Weasley
quickly
beckoning
her
on
but
now
is
not
the
time
to
discuss
elf
rights
i
want
to
get
back
to
the
tent
as
fast
as
we
can
what
happened
to
the
others
we
lost
them
in
the
dark
said
Ron
dad
why
was
everyone
so
uptight
about
that
skull
thing
i'll
explain
everything
back
at
the
tent
said
mr.
Weasley
tensely
but
when
they
reached
the
edge
of
the
wood
their
progress
was
impeded
a
large
crowd
of
frightenedlooking
witches
and
wizards
was
congregated
there
and
when
they
saw
mr.
Weasley
coming
toward
them
many
of
them
surged
forward
what's
going
on
in
there
who
conjured
it
arthur
it's
not
Him
of
course
it's
not
Him
said
mr.
Weasley
impatiently
we
don't
know
who
it
was
it
looks
like
they
Disapparated
now
excuse
me
please
I
want
to
get
to
bed
he
led
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
through
the
crowd
and
back
into
the
campsite
all
was
quiet
now
there
was
no
sign
of
the
masked
wizards
though
several
ruined
tents
were
still
smoking
charlie's
head
was
poking
out
of
the
boys
tent
dad
what's
going
on
he
called
through
the
dark
fred
George
and
Ginny
got
back
okay
but
the
others
i've
got
them
here
said
mr.
Weasley
bending
down
and
entering
the
tent
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
entered
after
him
bill
was
sitting
at
the
small
kitchen
table
holding
a
bedsheet
to
his
arm
which
was
bleeding
profusely
charlie
had
a
large
rip
in
his
shirt
and
Percy
was
sporting
a
bloody
nose
fred
George
and
Ginny
looked
unhurt
though
shaken
did
you
get
them
Dad
said
Bill
sharply
the
person
who
conjured
the
Mark
no
said
mr.
Weasley
we
found
Barry
crouch's
elf
holding
harry's
wand
but
we're
none
the
wiser
about
who
actually
conured
the
Mark
what
said
Bill
Charlie
and
Percy
together
harry's
wand
said
Fred
mr.
crouch's
elf
said
Percy
sounding
thunderstruck
with
some
assistance
from
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
mr.
Weasley
explained
what
had
happened
in
the
woods
when
they
had
finished
their
story
Percy
swelled
indignantly
well
mr.
Crouch
is
quite
right
to
get
rid
of
an
elf
like
that
he
said
running
away
when
he'd
expressly
told
her
not
to
embarrassing
him
in
front
of
the
whole
Ministry
how
would
that
have
looked
if
she'd
been
brought
up
in
front
of
the
Department
for
the
Regulation
and
Control
she
didn't
do
anything
she
was
just
in
the
wrong
place
at
the
wrong
time
hermione
snapped
at
Percy
who
looked
very
taken
aback
hermione
had
always
got
on
fairly
well
with
Percy
better
indeed
than
any
of
the
others
hermione
a
wizard
in
mr.
crouch's
position
can't
afford
a
houseelf
who's
going
to
run
amok
with
a
wand
said
Percy
pompously
recovering
himself
she
didn't
run
amok
shouted
Hermione
she
just
picked
it
up
off
the
ground
look
can
someone
just
explain
what
that
skull
thing
was
said
Ron
impatiently
it
wasn't
hurting
anyone
why's
it
such
a
big
deal
i
told
you
it's
youknowwho's
symbol
Ron
said
Hermione
before
anyone
else
could
answer
i
read
about
it
in
The
Rise
and
Fall
of
the
Dark
Arts
and
it
hasn't
been
seen
for
thirteen
years
said
mr.
Weasley
quietly
of
course
people
panicked
it
was
almost
like
seeing
YouKnowWho
back
again
i
don't
get
it
said
Ron
frowning
i
mean
it's
still
only
a
shape
in
the
sky
ron
YouKnowWho
and
his
followers
sent
the
Dark
Mark
into
the
air
whenever
they
killed
said
mr.
Weasley
the
terror
it
inspired
you
have
no
idea
you're
too
young
just
picture
coming
home
and
finding
the
Dark
Mark
hovering
over
your
house
and
knowing
what
you're
about
to
find
inside
mr.
Weasley
winced
everyone's
worst
fear
the
very
worst
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
then
Bill
removing
the
sheet
from
his
arm
to
check
on
his
cut
said
Well
it
didn't
help
us
tonight
whoever
conjured
it
it
scared
the
Death
Eaters
away
the
moment
they
saw
it
they
all
Disapparated
before
we'd
got
near
enough
to
unmask
any
of
them
we
caught
the
Robertses
before
they
hit
the
ground
though
they're
having
their
memories
modified
right
now
death
Eaters
said
Harry
what
are
Death
Eaters
it's
what
youknowwho's
supporters
called
themselves
said
Bill
i
think
we
saw
what's
left
of
them
tonight
the
ones
who
managed
to
keep
themselves
out
of
Azkaban
anyway
we
can't
prove
it
was
them
Bill
said
mr.
Weasley
though
it
probably
was
he
added
hopelessly
yeah
I
bet
it
was
said
Ron
suddenly
dad
we
met
Draco
Malfoy
in
the
woods
and
he
as
good
as
told
us
his
dad
was
one
of
those
nutters
in
masks
and
we
all
know
the
Malfoys
were
right
in
with
YouKnowWho
but
what
were
voldemort's
supporters
Harry
began
everybody
flinched
like
most
of
the
wizarding
world
the
Weasleys
always
avoided
saying
voldemort's
name
sorry
said
Harry
quickly
what
were
youknowwho's
supporters
up
to
levitating
Muggles
i
mean
what
was
the
point
the
point
said
mr.
Weasley
with
a
hollow
laugh
harry
that's
their
idea
of
fun
half
the
Muggle
killings
back
when
YouKnowWho
was
in
power
were
done
for
fun
i
suppose
they
had
a
few
drinks
tonight
and
couldn't
resist
reminding
us
all
that
lots
of
them
are
still
at
large
a
nice
little
reunion
for
them
he
finished
disgustedly
but
if
they
were
the
Death
Eaters
why
did
they
Disapparate
when
they
saw
the
Dark
Mark
said
Ron
they'd
have
been
pleased
to
see
it
wouldn't
they
use
your
brains
Ron
said
Bill
if
they
really
were
Death
Eaters
they
worked
very
hard
to
keep
out
of
Azkaban
when
YouKnowWho
lost
power
and
told
all
sorts
of
lies
about
him
forcing
them
to
kill
and
torture
people
i
bet
they'd
be
even
more
frightened
than
the
rest
of
us
to
see
him
come
back
they
denied
they'd
ever
been
involved
with
him
when
he
lost
his
powers
and
went
back
to
their
daily
lives
i
don't
reckon
he'd
be
overpleased
with
them
do
you
so
whoever
conjured
the
Dark
Mark
said
Hermione
slowly
were
they
doing
it
to
show
support
for
the
Death
Eaters
or
to
scare
them
away
your
guess
is
as
good
as
ours
Hermione
said
mr.
Weasley
but
i'll
tell
you
this
it
was
only
the
Death
Eaters
who
ever
knew
how
to
conjure
it
i'd
be
very
surprised
if
the
person
who
did
it
hadn't
been
a
Death
Eater
once
even
if
they're
not
now
listen
it's
very
late
and
if
your
mother
hears
what's
happened
she'll
be
worried
sick
we'll
get
a
few
more
hours
sleep
and
then
try
and
get
an
early
Portkey
out
of
here
harry
got
back
into
his
bunk
with
his
head
buzzing
he
knew
he
ought
to
feel
exhausted
It
was
nearly
three
in
the
morning
but
he
felt
wideawake
wide
awake
and
worried
three
days
ago
it
felt
like
much
longer
but
it
had
only
been
three
days
he
had
awoken
with
his
scar
burning
and
tonight
for
the
first
time
in
thirteen
years
Lord
voldemort's
mark
had
appeared
in
the
sky
what
did
these
things
mean
he
thought
of
the
letter
he
had
written
to
Sirius
before
leaving
Privet
Drive
would
Sirius
have
gotten
it
yet
when
would
he
reply
harry
lay
looking
up
at
the
canvas
but
no
flying
fantasies
came
to
him
now
to
ease
him
to
sleep
and
it
was
a
long
time
after
charlie's
snores
filled
the
tent
that
Harry
finally
dozed
off
chapter
ten
mayhem
at
the
ministry
mr.
Weasley
woke
them
after
only
a
few
hours
sleep
he
used
magic
to
pack
up
the
tents
and
they
left
the
campsite
as
quickly
as
possible
passing
mr.
Roberts
at
the
door
of
his
cottage
mr.
Roberts
had
a
strange
dazed
look
about
him
and
he
waved
them
off
with
a
vague
Merry
Christmas
he'll
be
all
right
said
mr.
Weasley
quietly
as
they
marched
off
onto
the
moor
sometimes
when
a
person's
memory's
modified
it
makes
him
a
bit
disorientated
for
a
while
and
that
was
a
big
thing
they
had
to
make
him
forget
they
heard
urgent
voices
as
they
approached
the
spot
where
the
Portkeys
lay
and
when
they
reached
it
they
found
a
great
number
of
witches
and
wizards
gathered
around
Basil
the
keeper
of
the
Portkeys
all
clamoring
to
get
away
from
the
campsite
as
quickly
as
possible
mr.
Weasley
had
a
hurried
discussion
with
Basil
they
joined
the
queue
and
were
able
to
take
an
old
rubber
tire
back
to
Stoatshead
Hill
before
the
sun
had
really
risen
they
walked
back
through
Ottery
St
catchpole
and
up
the
damp
lane
toward
the
Burrow
in
the
dawn
light
talking
very
little
because
they
were
so
exhausted
and
thinking
longingly
of
their
breakfast
as
they
rounded
the
corner
and
the
Burrow
came
into
view
a
cry
echoed
along
the
lane
oh
thank
goodness
thank
goodness
mrs
weasley
who
had
evidently
been
waiting
for
them
in
the
front
yard
came
running
toward
them
still
wearing
her
bedroom
slippers
her
face
pale
and
strained
a
rolledup
copy
of
the
Daily
Prophet
clutched
in
her
hand
arthur
i've
been
so
worried
so
worried
she
flung
her
arms
around
mr.
weasley's
neck
and
the
Daily
Prophet
fell
out
of
her
limp
hand
onto
the
ground
looking
down
Harry
saw
the
headline
scenes
of
terror
at
the
quidditch
world
cup
complete
with
a
twinkling
blackandwhite
photograph
of
the
Dark
Mark
over
the
treetops
you're
all
right
Mrs
weasley
muttered
distractedly
releasing
mr.
Weasley
and
staring
around
at
them
all
with
red
eyes
you're
alive
oh
boys
and
to
everybody's
surprise
she
seized
Fred
and
George
and
pulled
them
both
into
such
a
tight
hug
that
their
heads
banged
together
ouch
mum
you're
strangling
us
i
shouted
at
you
before
you
left
mrs
weasley
said
starting
to
sob
it's
all
i've
been
thinking
about
what
if
YouKnowWho
had
got
you
and
the
last
thing
I
ever
said
to
you
was
that
you
didn't
get
enough
ow
l.s
Oh
Fred
george
come
on
now
Molly
we're
all
perfectly
okay
said
mr.
Weasley
soothingly
prising
her
off
the
twins
and
leading
her
back
toward
the
house
bill
he
added
in
an
undertone
pick
up
that
paper
I
want
to
see
what
it
says
when
they
were
all
crammed
into
the
tiny
kitchen
and
Hermione
had
made
Mrs
weasley
a
cup
of
very
strong
tea
into
which
mr.
Weasley
insisted
on
pouring
a
shot
of
Ogdens
Old
Firewhiskey
Bill
handed
his
father
the
newspaper
mr
weasley
scanned
the
front
page
while
Percy
looked
over
his
shoulder
i
knew
it
said
mr.
Weasley
heavily
ministry
blunders
culprits
not
apprehended
lax
security
dark
wizards
running
unchecked
national
disgrace
who
wrote
this
ah
of
course
rita
Skeeter
that
woman's
got
it
in
for
the
Ministry
of
Magic
said
Percy
furiously
last
week
she
was
saying
we're
wasting
our
time
quibbling
about
cauldron
thickness
when
we
should
be
stamping
out
vampires
as
if
it
wasn't
specifically
stated
in
paragraph
twelve
of
the
Guidelines
for
the
Treatment
of
NonWizard
PartHumans
do
us
a
favor
Perce
said
Bill
yawning
and
shut
up
i'm
mentioned
said
mr.
Weasley
his
eyes
widening
behind
his
glasses
as
he
reached
the
bottom
of
the
Daily
Prophet
article
where
spluttered
Mrs
weasley
choking
on
her
tea
and
whiskey
if
i'd
seen
that
i'd
have
known
you
were
alive
not
by
name
said
mr.
Weasley
listen
to
this
If
the
terrified
wizards
and
witches
who
waited
breathlessly
for
news
at
the
edge
of
the
wood
expected
reassurance
from
the
Ministry
ofMagic
they
were
sadly
disappointed
a
Ministry
official
emerged
some
time
after
the
appearance
of
the
Dark
Mark
alleging
that
nobody
had
been
hurt
but
reflising
to
give
any
more
information
whether
this
statement
will
be
enough
to
quash
the
rumors
that
several
bodies
were
removed
from
the
woods
an
hour
later
remains
to
be
seen
oh
really
said
mr.
Weasley
in
exasperation
handing
the
paper
to
Percy
nobody
was
hurt
what
was
I
supposed
to
say
rumors
that
several
bodies
were
removed
from
the
woods
well
there
certainly
will
be
rumors
now
she's
printed
that
he
heaved
a
deep
sigh
molly
i'm
going
to
have
to
go
into
the
office
this
is
going
to
take
some
smoothing
over
i'll
come
with
you
Father
said
Percy
importantly
mr.
Crouch
will
need
all
hands
on
deck
and
I
can
give
him
my
cauldron
report
in
person
he
bustled
out
of
the
kitchen
mrs
weasley
looked
most
upset
arthur
you're
supposed
to
be
on
holiday
this
hasn't
got
anything
to
do
with
your
office
surely
they
can
handle
this
without
you
i've
got
to
go
Molly
said
mr.
Weasley
i've
made
things
worse
i'll
just
change
into
my
robes
and
i'll
be
off
mrs
weasley
said
Harry
suddenly
unable
to
contain
himself
Hedwig
hasn't
arrived
with
a
letter
for
me
has
she
hedwig
dear
said
Mrs
weasley
distractedly
no
no
there
hasn't
been
any
post
at
all
ron
and
Hermione
looked
curiously
at
Harry
with
a
meaningful
look
at
both
of
them
he
said
All
right
if
I
go
and
dump
my
stuff
in
your
room
Ron
yeah
think
I
will
too
said
Ron
at
once
hermione
yes
she
said
quickly
and
the
three
of
them
marched
out
of
the
kitchen
and
up
the
stairs
what's
up
Harry
said
Ron
the
moment
they
had
closed
the
door
of
the
attic
room
behind
them
there's
something
I
haven't
told
you
Harry
said
on
Saturday
morning
I
woke
up
with
my
scar
hurting
again
ron's
and
hermione's
reactions
were
almost
exactly
as
Harry
had
imagined
them
back
in
his
bedroom
on
Privet
Drive
hermione
gasped
and
started
making
suggestions
at
once
mentioning
a
number
of
reference
books
and
everybody
from
Albus
Dumbledore
to
Madam
Pomfrey
the
Hogwarts
nurse
ron
simply
looked
dumbstruck
but
he
wasn't
there
was
he
youKnowWho
i
mean
last
time
your
scar
kept
hurting
he
was
at
Hogwarts
wasn't
he
i'm
sure
he
wasn't
on
Privet
Drive
said
Harry
but
I
was
dreaming
about
him
him
and
Peter
you
know
Wormtail
i
can't
remember
all
of
it
now
but
they
were
plotting
to
kill
someone
he
had
teetered
for
a
moment
on
the
verge
of
saying
me
but
couldn't
bring
himself
to
make
Hermione
look
any
more
horrified
than
she
already
did
it
was
only
a
dream
said
Ron
bracingly
just
a
nightmare
yeah
but
was
it
though
said
Harry
turning
to
look
out
of
the
window
at
the
brightening
sky
it's
weird
isn't
it
my
scar
hurts
and
three
days
later
the
Death
Eaters
are
on
the
march
and
voldemort's
sign's
up
in
the
sky
again
don't
say
his
name
ron
hissed
through
gritted
teeth
and
remember
what
Professor
Trelawney
said
harry
went
on
ignoring
Ron
at
the
end
of
last
year
professor
Trelawney
was
their
Divination
teacher
at
Hogwarts
hermione's
terrified
look
vanished
as
she
let
out
a
derisive
snort
oh
Harry
you
aren't
going
to
pay
attention
to
anything
that
old
fraud
says
you
weren't
there
said
Harry
you
didn't
hear
her
this
time
was
different
i
told
you
she
went
into
a
trance
a
real
one
and
she
said
the
Dark
Lord
would
rise
again
greater
and
more
terrible
than
ever
before
and
he'd
manage
it
because
his
servant
was
going
to
go
back
to
him
and
that
night
Wormtail
escaped
there
was
a
silence
in
which
Ron
fidgeted
absentmindedly
with
a
hole
in
his
Chudley
Cannons
bedspread
why
were
you
asking
if
Hedwig
had
come
Harry
hermione
asked
are
you
expecting
a
letter
i
told
Sirius
about
my
scar
said
Harry
shrugging
i'm
waiting
for
his
answer
good
thinking
said
Ron
his
expression
clearing
i
bet
sirius'll
know
what
to
do
i
hoped
he'd
get
back
to
me
quickly
said
Harry
but
we
don't
know
where
Sirius
is
he
could
be
in
Africa
or
somewhere
couldn't
he
said
Hermione
reasonably
hedwig's
not
going
to
manage
that
journey
in
a
few
days
yeah
I
know
said
Harry
but
there
was
a
leaden
feeling
in
his
stomach
as
he
looked
out
of
the
window
at
the
Hedwigfree
sky
come
and
have
a
game
of
Quidditch
in
the
orchard
Harry
said
Ron
come
on
three
on
three
Bill
and
Charlie
and
Fred
and
George
will
play
you
can
try
out
the
Wronski
Feint
ron
said
Hermione
in
an
idon'tthinkyou'rebeingverysensitive
sort
of
voice
Harry
doesn't
want
to
play
Quidditch
right
now
he's
worried
and
he's
tired
we
all
need
to
go
to
bed
yeah
I
want
to
play
Quidditch
said
Harry
suddenly
hang
on
i'll
get
my
Firebolt
hermione
left
the
room
muttering
something
that
sounded
very
much
like
Boys
neither
mr.
Weasley
nor
Percy
was
at
home
much
over
the
following
week
both
left
the
house
each
morning
before
the
rest
of
the
family
got
up
and
returned
well
after
dinner
every
night
it's
been
an
absolute
uproar
Percy
told
them
importantly
the
Sunday
evening
before
they
were
due
to
return
to
Hogwarts
i've
been
putting
out
fires
all
week
people
keep
sending
Howlers
and
of
course
if
you
don't
open
a
Howler
straight
away
it
explodes
scorch
marks
all
over
my
desk
and
my
best
quill
reduced
to
cinders
why
are
they
all
sending
Howlers
asked
Ginny
who
was
mending
her
copy
of
One
Thousand
Magical
Herbs
and
Fungi
with
Spellotape
on
the
rug
in
front
of
the
living
room
fire
complaining
about
security
at
the
World
Cup
said
Percy
they
want
compensation
for
their
ruined
property
mundungus
fletcher's
put
in
a
claim
for
a
twelvebedroomed
tent
with
ensuite
Jacuzzi
but
i've
got
his
number
i
know
for
a
fact
he
was
sleeping
under
a
cloak
propped
on
sticks
mrs
weasley
glanced
at
the
grandfather
clock
in
the
corner
harry
liked
this
clock
it
was
completely
useless
if
you
wanted
to
know
the
time
but
otherwise
very
informative
it
had
nine
golden
hands
and
each
of
them
was
engraved
with
one
of
the
Weasley
family's
names
there
were
no
numerals
around
the
face
but
descriptions
of
where
each
family
member
might
be
home
school
and
work
were
there
but
there
was
also
traveling
lost
hospital
prison
and
in
the
position
where
the
number
twelve
would
be
on
a
normal
clock
mortal
peril
eight
of
the
hands
were
currently
pointing
to
the
home
position
but
Mr
weasley's
which
was
the
longest
was
still
pointing
to
work
mrs
weasley
sighed
your
father
hasn't
had
to
go
into
the
office
on
weekends
since
the
days
of
You
KnowWho
she
said
they're
working
him
far
too
hard
his
dinner's
going
to
be
ruined
if
he
doesn't
come
home
soon
well
Father
feels
he's
got
to
make
up
for
his
mistake
at
the
match
doesn't
he
said
Percy
if
truth
be
told
he
was
a
tad
unwise
to
make
a
public
statement
without
clearing
it
with
his
Head
of
Department
first
don't
you
dare
blame
your
father
for
what
that
wretched
Skeeter
woman
wrote
said
Mrs
weasley
flaring
up
at
once
if
Dad
hadn't
said
anything
old
Rita
would
just
have
said
it
was
disgraceful
that
nobody
from
the
Ministry
had
commented
said
Bill
who
was
playing
chess
with
Ron
rita
Skeeter
never
makes
anyone
look
good
remember
she
interviewed
all
the
Gringotts
Charm
Breakers
once
and
called
me
a
longhaired
pillock
well
it
is
a
bit
long
dear
said
Mrs
weasley
gently
if
you'd
just
let
me
no
Mum
rain
lashed
against
the
living
room
window
hermione
was
immersed
in
The
Standard
Book
of
Spells
Grade
copies
of
which
Mrs
weasley
had
bought
for
her
Harry
and
Ron
in
Diagon
Alley
charlie
was
darning
a
fireproof
balaclava
harry
was
polishing
his
Firebolt
the
broomstick
servicing
kit
Hermione
had
given
him
for
his
thirteenth
birthday
open
at
his
feet
fred
and
George
were
sitting
in
a
far
corner
quills
out
talking
in
whispers
their
heads
bent
over
a
piece
of
parchment
what
are
you
two
up
to
said
Mrs
weasley
sharply
her
eyes
on
the
twins
homework
said
Fred
vaguely
don't
be
ridiculous
you're
still
on
holiday
said
Mrs
weasley
yeah
we've
left
it
a
bit
late
said
George
you're
not
by
any
chance
writing
out
a
new
order
form
are
you
said
Mrs
weasley
shrewdly
you
wouldn't
be
thinking
of
restarting
Weasleys
Wizard
Wheezes
by
any
chance
now
Mum
said
Fred
looking
up
at
her
a
pained
look
on
his
face
if
the
Hogwarts
Express
crashed
tomorrow
and
George
and
I
died
how
would
you
feel
to
know
that
the
last
thing
we
ever
heard
from
you
was
an
unfounded
accusation
everyone
laughed
even
Mrs
weasley
oh
your
father's
coming
she
said
suddenly
looking
up
at
the
clock
again
mr.
weasley's
hand
had
suddenly
spun
from
work
to
traveling
a
second
later
it
had
shuddered
to
a
halt
on
home
with
the
others
and
they
heard
him
calling
from
the
kitchen
coming
Arthur
called
Mrs
weasley
hurrying
out
of
the
room
a
few
moments
later
mr.
Weasley
came
into
the
warm
living
room
carrying
his
dinner
on
a
tray
he
looked
completely
exhausted
well
the
fat's
really
in
the
fire
now
he
told
Mrs
weasley
as
he
sat
down
in
an
armchair
near
the
hearth
and
toyed
unenthusiastically
with
his
somewhat
shriveled
cauliflower
rita
skeeter's
been
ferreting
around
all
week
looking
for
more
Ministry
messups
to
report
and
now
she's
found
out
about
poor
old
Bertha
going
missing
so
that'll
be
the
headline
in
the
Prophet
tomorrow
i
told
Bagman
he
should
have
sent
someone
to
look
for
her
ages
ago
mr.
Crouch
has
been
saying
it
for
weeks
and
weeks
said
Percy
swiftly
crouch
is
very
lucky
Rita
hasn't
found
out
about
Winky
said
mr.
Weasley
irritably
there'd
be
a
week's
worth
of
headlines
in
his
houseelf
being
caught
holding
the
wand
that
conjured
the
Dark
Mark
i
thought
we
were
all
agreed
that
that
elf
while
irresponsible
did
not
conjure
the
Mark
said
Percy
hotly
if
you
ask
me
mr.
Crouch
is
very
lucky
no
one
at
the
Daily
Prophet
knows
how
mean
he
is
to
elves
said
Hermione
angrily
now
look
here
Hermione
said
Percy
a
highranking
Ministry
official
like
mr.
Crouch
deserves
unswerving
obedience
from
his
servants
his
slave
you
mean
said
Hermione
her
voice
rising
passionately
because
he
didn't
pay
Winky
did
he
i
think
you'd
all
better
go
upstairs
and
check
that
you've
packed
properly
said
Mrs
weasley
breaking
up
the
argument
come
on
now
all
of
you
harry
repacked
his
broomstick
servicing
kit
put
his
Firebolt
over
his
shoulder
and
went
back
upstairs
with
Ron
the
rain
sounded
even
louder
at
the
top
of
the
house
accompanied
by
loud
whistlings
and
moans
from
the
wind
not
to
mention
sporadic
howls
from
the
ghoul
who
lived
in
the
attic
pigwidgeon
began
twittering
and
zooming
around
his
cage
when
they
entered
the
sight
of
the
halfpacked
trunks
seemed
to
have
sent
him
into
a
frenzy
of
excitement
bung
him
some
Owl
Treats
said
Ron
throwing
a
packet
across
to
Harry
it
might
shut
him
up
harry
poked
a
few
Owl
Treats
through
the
bars
of
pigwidgeon's
cage
then
turned
to
his
trunk
hedwig's
cage
stood
next
to
it
still
empty
it's
been
over
a
week
Harry
said
looking
at
hedwig's
deserted
perch
ron
you
don't
reckon
Sirius
has
been
caught
do
you
nah
it
would've
been
in
the
Daily
Prophet
said
Ron
the
Ministry
would
want
to
show
they'd
caught
someone
wouldn't
they
yeah
I
suppose
look
here's
the
stuff
Mum
got
for
you
in
Diagon
Alley
and
she's
got
some
gold
out
of
your
vault
for
you
and
she's
washed
all
your
socks
he
heaved
a
pile
of
parcels
onto
harry's
camp
bed
and
dropped
the
money
bag
and
a
load
of
socks
next
to
it
harry
started
unwrapping
the
shopping
apart
from
The
Standard
Book
of
Spells
Grade
by
Miranda
Goshawk
he
had
a
handful
of
new
quills
a
dozen
rolls
of
parchment
and
refills
for
his
potionmaking
kit
he
had
been
running
low
on
spine
of
lionfish
and
essence
of
belladonna
he
was
just
piling
underwear
into
his
cauldron
when
Ron
made
a
loud
noise
of
disgust
behind
him
what
is
that
supposed
to
be
he
was
holding
up
something
that
looked
to
Harry
like
a
long
maroon
velvet
dress
it
had
a
moldylooking
lace
frill
at
the
collar
and
matching
lace
cuffs
there
was
a
knock
on
the
door
and
Mrs
weasley
entered
carrying
an
armful
of
freshly
laundered
Hogwarts
robes
here
you
are
she
said
sorting
them
into
two
piles
now
mind
you
pack
them
properly
so
they
don't
crease
mum
you've
given
me
ginny's
new
dress
said
Ron
handing
it
out
to
her
of
course
I
haven't
said
Mrs
weasley
that's
for
you
dress
robes
what
said
Ron
looking
horrorstruck
dress
robes
repeated
Mrs
weasley
it
says
on
your
school
list
that
you're
supposed
to
have
dress
robes
this
year
robes
for
formal
occasions
you've
got
to
be
kidding
said
Ron
in
disbelief
i'm
not
wearing
that
no
way
everyone
wears
them
Ron
said
Mrs
weasley
crossly
they're
all
like
that
your
father's
got
some
for
smart
parties
i'll
go
starkers
before
I
put
that
on
said
Ron
stubbornly
don't
be
so
silly
said
Mrs
weasley
you've
got
to
have
dress
robes
they're
on
your
list
i
got
some
for
Harry
too
show
him
Harry
in
some
trepidation
Harry
opened
the
last
parcel
on
his
camp
bed
it
wasn't
as
bad
as
he
had
expected
however
his
dress
robes
didn't
have
any
lace
on
them
at
all
in
fact
they
were
more
or
less
the
same
as
his
school
ones
except
that
they
were
bottle
green
instead
of
black
i
thought
they'd
bring
out
the
color
of
your
eyes
dear
said
Mrs
weasley
fondly
well
they're
okay
said
Ron
angrily
looking
at
harry's
robes
why
couldn't
I
have
some
like
that
because
well
I
had
to
get
yours
secondhand
and
there
wasn't
a
lot
of
choice
said
Mrs
weasley
flushing
harry
looked
away
he
would
willingly
have
split
all
the
money
in
his
Gringotts
vault
with
the
Weasleys
but
he
knew
they
would
never
take
it
i'm
never
wearing
them
Ron
was
saying
stubbornly
never
fine
snapped
Mrs
weasley
go
naked
and
Harry
make
sure
you
get
a
picture
of
him
goodness
knows
I
could
do
with
a
laugh
she
left
the
room
slamming
the
door
behind
her
there
was
a
funny
spluttering
noise
from
behind
them
pigwidgeon
was
choking
on
an
overlarge
Owl
Treat
why
is
everything
I
own
rubbish
said
Ron
furiously
striding
across
the
room
to
unstick
pigwidgeon's
beak
chapter
eleven
aboard
the
hogwart
express
there
was
a
definite
endoftheholidays
gloom
in
the
air
when
Harry
awoke
next
morning
heavy
rain
was
still
splattering
against
the
window
as
he
got
dressed
in
jeans
and
a
sweatshirt
they
would
change
into
their
school
robes
on
the
Hogwarts
Express
he
Ron
Fred
and
George
had
just
reached
the
firstfloor
landing
on
their
way
down
to
breakfast
when
Mrs
weasley
appeared
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
looking
harassed
arthur
she
called
up
the
staircase
arthur
urgent
message
from
the
Ministry
harry
flattened
himself
against
the
wall
as
mr.
Weasley
came
clattering
past
with
his
robes
on
backtofront
and
hurtled
out
of
sight
when
Harry
and
the
others
entered
the
kitchen
they
saw
Mrs
weasley
rummaging
anxiously
in
the
drawers
i've
got
a
quill
here
somewhere
and
mr.
Weasley
bending
over
the
fire
talking
to
Harry
shut
his
eyes
hard
and
opened
them
again
to
make
sure
that
they
were
working
properly
amos
diggory's
head
was
sitting
in
the
middle
of
the
flames
like
a
large
bearded
egg
it
was
talking
very
fast
completely
unperturbed
by
the
sparks
flying
around
it
and
the
flames
licking
its
ears
muggle
neighbors
heard
bangs
and
shouting
so
they
went
and
called
those
whatd'youcall'ems
pleasemen
arthur
you've
got
to
get
over
there
here
said
Mrs
weasley
breathlessly
pushing
a
piece
of
parchment
a
bottle
of
ink
and
a
crumpled
quill
into
mr.
weasley's
hands
it's
a
real
stroke
of
luck
I
heard
about
it
said
mr.
diggory's
head
i
had
to
come
into
the
office
early
to
send
a
couple
of
owls
and
I
found
the
Improper
Use
of
Magic
lot
all
setting
off
if
Rita
Skeeter
gets
hold
of
this
one
Arthur
what
does
MadEye
say
happened
asked
mr.
Weasley
unscrewing
the
ink
bottle
loading
up
his
quill
and
preparing
to
take
notes
mr.
diggory's
head
rolled
its
eyes
says
he
heard
an
intruder
in
his
yard
says
he
was
creeping
toward
the
house
but
was
ambushed
by
his
dustbins
what
did
the
dustbins
do
asked
mr.
Weasley
scribbling
frantically
made
one
hell
of
a
noise
and
fired
rubbish
everywhere
as
far
as
I
can
tell
said
mr.
Diggory
apparently
one
of
them
was
still
rocketing
around
when
the
please
men
turned
up
mr.
Weasley
groaned
and
what
about
the
intruder
arthur
you
know
MadEye
said
mr.
diggory's
head
rolling
its
eyes
again
someone
creeping
into
his
yard
in
the
dead
of
night
more
likely
there's
a
very
shellshocked
cat
wandering
around
somewhere
covered
in
potato
peelings
but
if
the
Improper
Use
of
Magic
lot
get
their
hands
on
MadEye
he's
had
it
think
of
his
record
we've
got
to
get
him
off
on
a
minor
charge
something
in
your
department
what
are
exploding
dustbins
worth
might
be
a
caution
said
mr.
Weasley
still
writing
very
fast
his
brow
furrowed
madEye
didn't
use
his
wand
he
didn't
actually
attack
anyone
i'll
bet
he
leapt
out
of
bed
and
started
jinxing
everything
he
could
reach
through
the
window
said
mr.
Diggory
but
they'll
have
a
job
proving
it
there
aren't
any
casualties
all
right
i'm
off
mr.
Weasley
said
and
he
stuffed
the
parchment
with
his
notes
on
it
into
his
pocket
and
dashed
out
of
the
kitchen
again
mr.
diggory's
head
looked
around
at
Mrs
weasley
sorry
about
this
Molly
it
said
more
calmly
bothering
you
so
early
and
everything
but
arthur's
the
only
one
who
can
get
MadEye
off
and
madeye's
supposed
to
be
starting
his
new
job
today
why
he
had
to
choose
last
night
never
mind
Amos
said
Mrs
weasley
sure
you
won't
have
a
bit
of
toast
or
anything
before
you
go
oh
go
on
then
said
mr.
Diggory
mrs
weasley
took
a
piece
of
buttered
toast
from
a
stack
on
the
kitchen
table
put
it
into
the
fire
tongs
and
transferred
it
into
mr.
diggory's
mouth
fanks
he
said
in
a
muffled
voice
and
then
with
a
small
pop
vanished
harry
could
hear
mr.
Weasley
calling
hurried
goodbyes
to
Bill
Charlie
Percy
and
the
girls
within
five
minutes
he
was
back
in
the
kitchen
his
robes
on
the
right
way
now
dragging
a
comb
through
his
hair
i'd
better
hurry
you
have
a
good
term
boys
said
mr.
Weasley
to
Harry
Ron
and
the
twins
fastening
a
cloak
over
his
shoulders
and
preparing
to
Disapparate
molly
are
you
going
to
be
all
right
taking
the
kids
to
king's
Cross
of
course
I
will
she
said
you
just
look
after
MadEye
we'll
be
fine
as
mr.
Weasley
vanished
Bill
and
Charlie
entered
the
kitchen
did
someone
say
MadEye
bill
asked
what's
he
been
up
to
now
he
says
someone
tried
to
break
into
his
house
last
night
said
Mrs
weasley
madEye
Moody
said
George
thoughtfully
spreading
marmalade
on
his
toast
isn't
he
that
nutter
your
father
thinks
very
highly
of
MadEye
Moody
said
Mrs
weasley
sternly
yeah
well
Dad
collects
plugs
doesn't
he
said
Fred
quietly
as
Mrs
weasley
left
the
room
birds
of
a
feather
moody
was
a
great
wizard
in
his
time
said
Bill
he's
an
old
friend
of
dumbledore's
isn't
he
said
Charlie
dumbledore's
not
what
you'd
call
normal
though
is
he
said
Fred
i
mean
I
know
he's
a
genius
and
everything
who
is
MadEye
asked
Harry
he's
retired
used
to
work
at
the
Ministry
said
Charlie
i
met
him
once
when
Dad
took
me
into
work
with
him
he
was
an
Auror
one
of
the
best
a
Dark
wizard
catcher
he
added
seeing
harry's
blank
look
Half

Azkaban
are
full
because
of
him
he
made
himself
loads
of
enemies
though
the
families
of
people
he
caught
mainly
and
I
heard
he's
been
getting
really
paranoid
in
his
old
age
doesn't
trust
anyone
anymore
sees
Dark
wizards
everywhere
bill
and
Charlie
decided
to
come
and
see
everyone
off
at
king's
Cross
station
but
Percy
apologizing
most
profusely
said
that
he
really
needed
to
get
to
work
i
just
can't
justify
taking
more
time
off
at
the
moment
he
told
them
mr
crouch
is
really
starting
to
rely
on
me
yeah
you
know
what
Percy
said
George
seriously
i
reckon
he'll
know
your
name
soon
mrs
weasley
had
braved
the
telephone
in
the
village
post
office
to
order
three
ordinary
Muggle
taxis
to
take
them
into
London
arthur
tried
to
borrow
Ministry
cars
for
us
Mrs
weasley
whispered
to
Harry
as
they
stood
in
the
rainwashed
yard
watching
the
taxi
drivers
heaving
six
heavy
Hogwarts
trunks
into
their
cars
but
there
weren't
any
to
spare
oh
dear
they
don't
look
happy
do
they
harry
didn't
like
to
tell
Mrs
weasley
that
Muggle
taxi
drivers
rarely
transported
overexcited
owls
and
Pigwidgeon
was
making
an
earsplitting
racket
nor
did
it
help
that
a
number
of
filibuster's
Fabulous
NoHeat
WetStart
Fireworks
went
off
unexpectedly
when
fred's
trunk
sprang
open
causing
the
driver
carrying
it
to
yell
with
fright
and
pain
as
Crookshanks
clawed
his
way
up
the
man's
leg
the
journey
was
uncomfortable
owing
to
the
fact
that
they
were
jammed
in
the
back
of
the
taxis
with
their
trunks
crookshanks
took
quite
a
while
to
recover
from
the
fireworks
and
by
the
time
they
entered
London
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
were
all
severely
scratched
they
were
very
relieved
to
get
out
at
king's
Cross
even
though
the
rain
was
coming
down
harder
than
ever
and
they
got
soaked
carrying
their
trunks
across
the
busy
road
and
into
the
station
harry
was
used
to
getting
onto
platform
nine
and
threequarters
by
now
it
was
a
simple
matter
of
walking
straight
through
the
apparently
solid
barrier
dividing
platforms
nine
and
ten
the
only
tricky
part
was
doing
this
in
an
unobtrusive
way
so
as
to
avoid
attracting
Muggle
attention
they
did
it
in
groups
today
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
the
most
conspicuous
since
they
were
accompanied
by
Pigwidgeon
and
Crookshanks
went
first
they
leaned
casually
against
the
barrier
chatting
unconcernedly
and
slid
sideways
through
it
and
as
they
did
so
platform
nine
and
threequarters
materialized
in
front
of
them
the
Hogwarts
Express
a
gleaming
scarlet
steam
engine
was
already
there
clouds
of
steam
billowing
from
it
through
which
the
many
Hogwarts
students
and
parents
on
the
platform
appeared
like
dark
ghosts
pigwidgeon
became
noisier
than
ever
in
response
to
the
hooting
of
many
owls
through
the
mist
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
set
off
to
find
seats
and
were
soon
stowing
their
luggage
in
a
compartment
halfway
along
the
train
they
then
hopped
back
down
onto
the
platform
to
say
goodbye
to
Mrs
weasley
Bill
and
Charlie
i
might
be
seeing
you
all
sooner
than
you
think
said
Charlie
grinning
as
he
hugged
Ginny
goodbye
why
said
Fred
keenly
you'll
see
said
Charlie
just
don't
tell
Percy
I
mentioned
it
it's
classified
information
until
such
time
as
the
Ministry
sees
fit
to
release
it
after
all
yeah
I
sort
of
wish
I
were
back
at
Hogwarts
this
year
said
Bill
hands
in
his
pockets
looking
almost
wistfully
at
the
train
why
said
George
impatiently
you're
going
to
have
an
interesting
year
said
Bill
his
eyes
twinkling
i
might
even
get
time
off
to
come
and
watch
a
bit
of
it
a
bit
of
what
said
Ron
but
at
that
moment
the
whistle
blew
and
Mrs
weasley
chivvied
them
toward
the
train
doors
thanks
for
having
us
to
stay
Mrs
weasley
said
Hermione
as
they
climbed
on
board
closed
the
door
and
leaned
out
of
the
window
to
talk
to
her
yeah
thanks
for
everything
Mrs
weasley
said
Harry
oh
it
was
my
pleasure
dears
said
Mrs
weasley
i'd
invite
you
for
Christmas
but
well
I
expect
you're
all
going
to
want
to
stay
at
Hogwarts
what
with
one
thing
and
another
mum
said
Ron
irritably
what
d'you
three
know
that
we
don't
you'll
find
out
this
evening
I
expect
said
Mrs
weasley
smiling
it's
going
to
be
very
exciting
mind
you
i'm
very
glad
they've
changed
the
rules
what
rules
said
Harry
Ron
Fred
and
George
together
i'm
sure
Professor
Dumbledore
will
tell
you
now
behave
won't
you
won't
you
Fred
and
you
George
the
pistons
hissed
loudly
and
the
train
began
to
move
tell
us
what's
happening
at
Hogwarts
fred
bellowed
out
of
the
window
as
Mrs
weasley
Bill
and
Charlie
sped
away
from
them
what
rules
are
they
changing
but
Mrs
weasley
only
smiled
and
waved
before
the
train
had
rounded
the
corner
she
Bill
and
Charlie
had
Disapparated
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
went
back
to
their
compartment
the
thick
rain
splattering
the
windows
made
it
very
difficult
to
see
out
of
them
ron
undid
his
trunk
pulled
out
his
maroon
dress
robes
and
flung
them
over
pigwidgeon's
cage
to
muffle
his
hooting
bagman
wanted
to
tell
us
what's
happening
at
Hogwarts
he
said
grumpily
sitting
down
next
to
Harry
at
the
World
Cup
remember
but
my
own
mother
won't
say
wonder
what
shh
hermione
whispered
suddenly
pressing
her
finger
to
her
lips
and
pointing
toward
the
compartment
next
to
theirs
harry
and
Ron
listened
and
heard
a
familiar
drawling
voice
drifting
in
through
the
open
door
father
actually
considered
sending
me
to
Durmstrang
rather
than
Hogwarts
you
know
he
knows
the
headmaster
you
see
well
you
know
his
opinion
of
Dumbledore
the
man's
such
a
Mudbloodlover
and
Durmstrang
doesn't
admit
that
sort
of
riffraff
but
Mother
didn't
like
the
idea
of
me
going
to
school
so
far
away
father
says
Durmstrang
takes
a
far
more
sensible
line
than
Hogwarts
about
the
Dark
Arts
durmstrang
students
actually
learn
them
not
just
the
defense
rubbish
we
do
hermione
got
up
tiptoed
to
the
compartment
door
and
slid
it
shut
blocking
out
malfoy's
voice
so
he
thinks
Durmstrang
would
have
suited
him
does
he
she
said
angrily
i
wish
he
had
gone
then
we
wouldn't
have
to
put
up
with
him
durmstrang's
another
wizarding
school
said
Harry
yes
said
Hermione
sniffily
and
it's
got
a
horrible
reputation
according
to
An
Appraisal
ofMagical
Education
in
Europe
it
puts
a
lot
of
emphasis
on
the
Dark
Arts
i
think
i've
heard
of
it
said
Ron
vaguely
where
is
it
what
country
well
nobody
knows
do
they
said
Hermione
raising
her
eyebrows
er
why
not
said
Harry
there's
traditionally
been
a
lot
of
rivalry
between
all
the
magic
schools
durmstrang
and
Beauxbatons
like
to
conceal
their
whereabouts
so
nobody
can
steal
their
secrets
said
Hermione
matteroffactly
come
off
it
said
Ron
starting
to
laugh
durmstrang's
got
to
be
about
the
same
size
as
Hogwarts
how
are
you
going
to
hide
a
great
big
castle
but
Hogwarts
is
hidden
said
Hermione
in
surprise
everyone
knows
that
well
everyone
who's
read
Hogwarts
A
History
anyway
just
you
then
said
Ron
so
go
on
how
d'you
hide
a
place
like
Hogwarts
it's
bewitched
said
Hermione
if
a
Muggle
looks
at
it
all
they
see
is
a
moldering
old
ruin
with
a
sign
over
the
entrance
saying
danger
do
not
enter
unsafe
so
durmstrang'll
just
look
like
a
ruin
to
an
outsider
too
maybe
said
Hermione
shrugging
or
it
might
have
Mugglerepelling
charms
on
it
like
the
World
Cup
stadium
and
to
keep
foreign
wizards
from
finding
it
they'll
have
made
it
Unplottable
come
again
well
you
can
enchant
a
building
so
it's
impossible
to
plot
on
a
map
can't
you
er
if
you
say
so
said
Harry
but
I
think
Durmstrang
must
be
somewhere
in
the
far
north
said
Hermione
thoughtfully
somewhere
very
cold
because
they've
got
fur
capes
as
part
of
their
uniforms
ah
think
of
the
possibilities
said
Ron
dreamily
it
would've
been
so
easy
to
push
Malfoy
off
a
glacier
and
make
it
look
like
an
accident
shame
his
mother
likes
him
the
rain
became
heavier
and
heavier
as
the
train
moved
farther
north
the
sky
was
so
dark
and
the
windows
so
steamy
that
the
lanterns
were
lit
by
midday
the
lunch
trolley
came
rattling
along
the
corridor
and
Harry
bought
a
large
stack
of
Cauldron
Cakes
for
them
to
share
several
of
their
friends
looked
in
on
them
as
the
afternoon
progressed
including
Seamus
Finnigan
Dean
Thomas
and
Neville
Longbottom
a
roundfaced
extremely
forgetful
boy
who
had
been
brought
up
by
his
formidable
witch
of
a
grandmother
seamus
was
still
wearing
his
Ireland
rosette
some
of
its
magic
seemed
to
be
wearing
off
now
it
was
still
squeaking
Troy
Mullet
Moran
but
in
a
very
feeble
and
exhausted
sort
of
way
after
half
an
hour
or
so
Hermione
growing
tired
of
the
endless
Quidditch
talk
buried
herself
once
more
in
The
Standard
Book
of
Spells
Grade
and
started
trying
to
learn
a
Summoning
Charm
neville
listened
jealously
to
the
others
conversation
as
they
relived
the
Cup
match
gran
didn't
want
to
go
he
said
miserably
wouldn't
buy
tickets
it
sounded
amazing
though
it
was
said
Ron
look
at
this
Neville
he
rummaged
in
his
trunk
up
in
the
luggage
rack
and
pulled
out
the
miniature
figure
of
Viktor
Krum
oh
wow
said
Neville
enviously
as
Ron
tipped
Krum
onto
his
pudgy
hand
we
saw
him
right
up
close
as
well
said
Ron
we
were
in
the
Top
Box
for
the
first
and
last
time
in
your
life
Weasley
draco
Malfoy
had
appeared
in
the
doorway
behind
him
stood
Crabbe
and
Goyle
his
enormous
thuggish
cronies
both
of
whom
appeared
to
have
grown
at
least
a
foot
during
the
summer
evidently
they
had
overheard
the
conversation
through
the
compartment
door
which
Dean
and
Seamus
had
left
ajar
don't
remember
asking
you
to
join
us
Malfoy
said
Harry
coolly
weasley
what
is
that
said
Malfoy
pointing
at
pigwidgeon's
cage
a
sleeve
of
ron's
dress
robes
was
dangling
from
it
swaying
with
the
motion
of
the
train
the
moldy
lace
cuff
very
obvious
ron
made
to
stuff
the
robes
out
of
sight
but
Malfoy
was
too
quick
for
him
he
seized
the
sleeve
and
pulled
look
at
this
said
Malfoy
in
ecstasy
holding
up
ron's
robes
and
showing
Crabbe
and
Goyle
Weasley
you
weren't
thinking
of
wearing
these
were
you
i
mean
they
were
very
fashionable
in
about
eighteen
ninety
eat
dung
Malfoy
said
Ron
the
same
color
as
the
dress
robes
as
he
snatched
them
back
out
of
malfoy's
grip
malfoy
howled
with
derisive
laughter
Crabbe
and
Goyle
guffawed
stupidly
so
going
to
enter
Weasley
going
to
try
and
bring
a
bit
of
glory
to
the
family
name
there's
money
involved
as
well
you
know
you'd
be
able
to
afford
some
decent
robes
if
you
won
what
are
you
talking
about
snapped
Ron
are
you
going
to
enter
malfoy
repeated
i
suppose
you
will
Potter
you
never
miss
a
chance
to
show
off
do
you
either
explain
what
you're
on
about
or
go
away
Malfoy
said
Hermione
testily
over
the
top
of
The
Standard
Book
of
Spells
Grade
a
gleeful
smile
spread
across
malfoy's
pale
face
don't
tell
me
you
don't
know
he
said
delightedly
you've
got
a
father
and
brother
at
the
Ministry
and
you
don't
even
know
my
God
my
father
told
me
about
it
ages
ago
heard
it
from
Cornelius
Fudge
but
then
father's
always
associated
with
the
top
people
at
the
Ministry
maybe
your
father's
too
junior
to
know
about
it
Weasley
yes
they
probably
don't
talk
about
important
stuff
in
front
of
him
laughing
once
more
Malfoy
beckoned
to
Crabbe
and
Goyle
and
the
three
of
them
disappeared
ron
got
to
his
feet
and
slammed
the
sliding
compartment
door
so
hard
behind
them
that
the
glass
shattered
ron
said
Hermione
reproachfully
and
she
pulled
out
her
wand
muttered
Reparo
and
the
glass
shards
flew
back
into
a
single
pane
and
back
into
the
door
well
making
it
look
like
he
knows
everything
and
we
don't
ron
snarled
father's
always
associated
with
the
top
peopie
at
the
Ministry
dad
could've
got
a
promotion
any
time
he
just
likes
it
where
he
is
of
course
he
does
said
Hermione
quietly
don't
let
Malfoy
get
to
you
Ron
him
get
to
me
as
if
said
Ron
picking
up
one
of
the
remaining
Cauldron
Cakes
and
squashing
it
into
a
pulp
ron's
bad
mood
continued
for
the
rest
of
the
journey
he
didn't
talk
much
as
they
changed
into
their
school
robes
and
was
still
glowering
when
the
Hogwarts
Express
slowed
down
at
last
and
finally
stopped
in
the
pitchdarkness
of
Hogsmeade
station
as
the
train
doors
opened
there
was
a
rumble
of
thunder
overhead
hermione
bundled
up
Crookshanks
in
her
cloak
and
Ron
left
his
dress
robes
over
Pigwidgeon
as
they
left
the
train
heads
bent
and
eyes
narrowed
against
the
downpour
the
rain
was
now
coming
down
so
thick
and
fast
that
it
was
as
though
buckets
of
icecold
water
were
being
emptied
repeatedly
over
their
heads
hi
Hagrid
harry
yelled
seeing
a
gigantic
silhouette
at
the
far
end
of
the

Harry

Hogwarts
Castle
by
sailing
across
the
lake
with
Hagrid
oooh
I
wouldn't
fancy
crossing
the
lake
in
this
weather
said
Hermione
fervently
shivering
as
they
inched
slowly
along
the
dark
platform
with
the
rest
of
the
crowd
a
hundred
horseless
carriages
stood
waiting
for
them
outside
the
station
harry
Ron
Hermione
and
Neville
climbed
gratefully
into
one
of
them
the
door
shut
with
a
snap
and
a
few
moments
later
with
a
great
lurch
the
long
procession
of
carriages
was
rumbling
and
splashing
its
way
up
the
track
toward
Hogwarts
Castle
chapter
twelve
the
triwizard
tournament
through
the
gates
flanked
with
statues
of
winged
boars
and
up
the
sweeping
drive
the
carriages
trundled
swaying
dangerously
in
what
was
fast
becoming
a
gale
leaning
against
the
window
Harry
could
see
Hogwarts
coming
nearer
its
many
lighted
windows
blurred
and
shimmering
behind
the
thick
curtain
of
rain
lightning
flashed
across
the
sky
as
their
carriage
came
to
a
halt
before
the
great
oak
front
doors
which
stood
at
the
top
of
a
flight
of
stone
steps
people
who
had
occupied
the
carriages
in
front
were
already
hurrying
up
the
stone
steps
into
the
castle
harry
Ron
Hermione
and
Neville
jumped
down
from
their
carriage
and
dashed
up
the
steps
too
looking
up
only
when
they
were
safely
inside
the
cavernous
torchlit
entrance
hall
with
its
magnificent
marble
staircase
blimey

Ron
shaking
his
head
and
sending
water
everywhere
if
that

arrgh
a
large
red
waterfilled
balloon
had
dropped
from
out
of
the
ceiling
onto
ron's
head
and
exploded
drenched
and
sputtering
Ron
staggered
sideways
into
Harry
just
as
a
second
water
bomb
dropped
narrowly
missing
Hermione
it
burst
at
harry's
feet
sending
a
wave
of
cold
water
over
his
sneakers
into
his
socks
people
all
around
them
shrieked
and
started
pushing
one
another
in
their
efforts
to
get
out
of
the
line
of
fire
harry
looked
up
and
saw
floating
twenty
feet
above
them
Peeves
the
Poltergeist
a
little
man
in
a
bellcovered
hat
and
orange

and
head
of
Gryffindor
House
had
come
dashing
out
of
the
Great
Hall
she
skidded
on
the
wet
floor
and
grabbed
Hermione
around
the
neck
to
stop
herself
from
falling
ouch
sorry
Miss
Granger
that's
all
right
Professor
hermione
gasped
massaging
her
throat
peeves
get
down
here
now
barked
Professor
McGonagall
straightening
her
pointed
hat
and
glaring
upward
through
her
squarerimmed
spectacles
not
doing
nothing
cackled
Peeves
lobbing
a
water
bomb
at
several
fifthyear
girls
who
screamed
and
dived
into
the
Great
Hall
already
wet
aren't
they
little
squirts
wheeeeeeeeee
and
he
aimed
another
bomb
at
a
group
of
second
years
who
had
just
arrived
i
shall
call
the
headmaster
shouted
Professor
McGonagall
i'm
warning
you
Peeves
peeves
stuck
out
his
tongue
threw
the
last
of
his
water
bombs
into
the
air
and
zoomed
off
up
the
marble
staircase
cackling
insanely
well
move
along
then
said
Professor
McGonagall
sharply
to
the
bedraggled
crowd
into
the
Great
Hall
come
on
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
slipped
and
slid
across
the
entrance
hall
and
through
the
double
doors
on
the
right
Ron
muttering
furiously
under
his
breath
as
he
pushed
his
sopping
hair
off
his
face
the
Great
Hall
looked
its
usual
splendid
self
decorated
for
the
startofterm
feast
golden
plates
and
goblets
gleamed
by
the
light
of
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
candles
floating
over
the
tables
in
midair
the
four
long
House
tables
were
packed
with
chattering
students
at
the
top
of
the
Hall
the
staff
sat
along
one
side
of
a
fifth
table
facing
their
pupils
it
was
much
warmer
in
here
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
walked
past
the
Slytherins
the
Ravenclaws
and
the
Hufflepuffs
and
sat
down
with
the
rest
of
the
Gryffindors
at
the
far
side
of
the
Hall
next
to
Nearly
Headless
Nick
the
Gryffindor
ghost
pearly
white
and
semitransparent
Nick
was
dressed
tonight
in
his
usual
doublet
but
with
a
particularly
large
ruff
which
served
the
dual
purpose
of
looking
extrafestive
and
insuring
that
his
head
didn't
wobble
too
much
on
his
partially
severed
neck
good
evening
he
said
beaming
at
them
says
who
said
Harry
taking
off
his
sneakers
and
emptying
them
of
water
hope
they
hurry
up
with
the
Sorting
i'm
starving
the
Sorting
of
the
new
students
into
Houses
took
place
at
the
start
of
every
school
year
but
by
an
unlucky
combination
of
circumstances
Harry
hadn't
been
present
at
one
since
his
own
he
was
quite
looking
forward
to
it
just
then
a
highly
excited
breathless
voice
called
down
the
table
hiya
Harry
it
was
Colin
Creevey
a
third
year
to
whom
Harry
was
something
of
a
hero
hi
Colin
said
Harry
warily
harry
guess
what
guess
what
Harry
my
brother's
starting
my
brother
Dennis
er
good
said
Harry
he's
really
excited
said
Colin
practically
bouncing
up
and
down
in
his
seat
i
just
hope
he's
in
Gryffindor
keep
your
fingers
crossed
eh
Harry
er
yeah
all
right
said
Harry
he
turned
back
to
Hermione
Ron
and
Nearly
Headless
Nick
brothers
and
sisters
usually
go
in
the
same
Houses
don't
they
he
said
he
was
judging
by
the
Weasleys
all
seven
of
whom
had
been
put
into
Gryffindor
oh
no
not
necessarily
said
Hermione
parvati
patil's
twin's
in
Ravenclaw
and
they're
identical
you'd
think
they'd
be
together
wouldn't
you
harry
looked
up
at
the
staff
table
there
seemed
to
be
rather
more
empty
seats
there
than
usual
hagrid
of
course
was
still
fighting
his
way
across
the
lake
with
the
first
years
Professor
McGonagall
was
presumably
supervising
the
drying
of
the
entrance
hall
floor
but
there
was
another
empty
chair
too
and
Harry
couldn't
think
who
else
was
missing
where's
the
new
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
teacher
said
Hermione
who
was
also
looking
up
at
the
teachers
they
had
never
yet
had
a
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
teacher
who
had
lasted
more
than
three
terms
harry's
favorite
by
far
had
been
Professor
Lupin
who
had
resigned
last
year
he
looked
up
and
down
the
staff
table
there
was
definitely
no
new
face
there
maybe
they
couldn't
get
anyone
said
Hermione
looking
anxious
harry
scanned
the
table
more
carefully
tiny
little
Professor
Flitwick
the
Charms
teacher
was
sitting
on
a
large
pile
of
cushions
beside
Professor
Sprout
the
Herbology
teacher
whose
hat
was
askew
over
her
flyaway
gray
hair
she
was
talking
to
Professor
Sinistra
of
the
Astronomy
department
on
Professor
sinistra's
other
side
was
the
sallowfaced
hooknosed
greasyhaired
Potions
master
Snape
harry's
least
favorite
person
at
Hogwarts
harry's
loathing
of
Snape
was
matched
only
by
snape's
hatred
of
him
a
hatred
which
had
if
possible
intensified
last
year
when
Harry
had
helped
Sirius
escape
right
under
snape's
overlarge
nose
Snape
and
Sirius
had
been
enemies
since
their
own
school
days
on
snape's
other
side
was
an
empty
seat
which
Harry
guessed
was
Professor
mcgonagall's
next
to
it
and
in
the
very
center
of
the
table
sat
Professor
Dumbledore
the
headmaster
his
sweeping
silver
hair
and
beard
shining
in
the
candlelight
his
magnificent
deep
green
robes
embroidered
with
many
stars
and
moons
the
tips
of
dumbledore's
long
thin
fingers
were
together
and
he
was
resting
his
chin
upon
them
staring
up
at
the
ceiling
through
his
halfmoon
spectacles
as
though
lost
in
thought
harry
glanced
up
at
the
ceiling
too
it
was
enchanted
to
look
like
the
sky
outside
and
he
had
never
seen
it
look
this
stormy
black
and
purple
clouds
were
swirling
across
it
and
as
another
thunderclap
sounded
outside
a
fork
of
lightning
flashed
across
it
oh
hurry
up
Ron
moaned
beside
Harry
I
could
eat
a
hippogriff
the
words
were
no
sooner
out
of
his
mouth
than
the
doors
of
the
Great
Hall
opened
and
silence
fell
professor
McGonagall
was
leading
a
long
line
of
first
years
up
to
the
top
of
the
Hall
if
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
were
wet
it
was
nothing
to
how
these
first
years
looked
they
appeared
to
have
swum
across
the
lake
rather
than
sailed
all
of
them
were
shivering
with
a
combination
of
cold
and
nerves
as
they
filed
along
the
staff
table
and
came
to
a
halt
in
a
line
facing
the
rest
of
the
school
all
of
them
except
the
smallest
of
the
lot
a
boy
with
mousy
hair
who
was
wrapped
in
what
Harry
recognized
as
hagrid's
moleskin
overcoat
the
coat
was
so
big
for
him
that
it
hooked
as
though
he
were
draped
in
a
furry
black
circus
tent
his
small
face
protruded
from
over
the
collar
looking
almost
painfully
excited
when
he
had
lined
up
with
his
terrifiedlooking
peers
he
caught
Colin
creevey's
eye
gave
a
double
thumbsup
and
mouthed
I
fell
in
the
lake
he
looked
positively
delighted
about
it
professor
McGonagall
now
placed
a
threelegged
stool
on
the
ground
before
the
first
years
and
on
top
of
it
an
extremely
old
dirty
patched
wizard's
hat
the
first
years
stared
at
it
so
did
everyone
else
for
a
moment
there
was
silence
then
a
long
tear
near
the
brim
opened
wide
like
a
mouth
and
the
hat
broke
into
song
a
thousand
years
or
more
ago
When
I
was
newly
sewn
There
lived
four
wizards
of
renown
Whose
names
are
still
well
known
bold
Gryffindor
from
wild
moor
Fair
Ravenclaw
from
glen
Sweet
Hufflepuff
from
valley
broad
Shrewd
Slytherin
from
fin
they
shared
a
wish
a
hope
a
dream
They
hatched
a
daring
plan
To
educate
young
sorcerers
Thus
Hogwarts
School
began
now
each
of
these
four
founders
Formed
their
own
house
for
each
Did
value
different
virtues
In
the
ones
they
had
to
teach
by
Gryffindor
the
bravest
were
Prized
far
beyond
the
rest
For
Ravenclaw
the
cleverest
Would
always
be
the
best
For
Hufflepuff
hard
workers
were
Most
worthy
of
admission
and
powerhungry
Slytherin
Loved
those
of
great
ambition
while
still
alive
they
did
divide
Their
favorites
from
the
throng
Yet
how
to
pick
the
worthy
ones
When
they
were
dead
and
gone
twas
Gryffindor
who
found
the
way
He
whipped
me
off
his
head
The
founders
put
some
brains
in
me
So
I
could
choose
instead
now
slip
me
snug
about
your
ears
i've
never
yet
been
wrong
i'll
have
a
look
inside
your
mind
And
tell
where
you
belong
the
Great
Hall
rang
with
applause
as
the
Sorting
Hat
finished
that's
not
the
song
it
sang
when
it
Sorted
us
said
Harry
clapping
along
with
everyone
else
sings
a
different
one
every
year
said
Ron
it's
got
to
be
a
pretty
boring
life
hasn't
it
being
a
hat
i
suppose
it
spends
all
year
making
up
the
next
one
professor
McGonagall
was
now
unrolling
a
large
scroll
of
parchment
when
I
call
out
your
name
you
will
put
on
the
hat
and
sit
on
the
stool
she
told
the
first
years
when
the
hat
announces
your
House
you
will
go
and
sit
at
the
appropriate
table
ackerley
Stewart
a
boy
walked
forward
visibly
trembling
from
head
to
foot
picked
up
the
Sorting
Hat
put
it
on
and
sat
down
on
the
stool
ravenclaw
shouted
the
hat
stewart
Ackerley
took
off
the
hat
and
hurried
into
a
seat
at
the
Ravenclaw
table
where
everyone
was
applauding
him
harry
caught
a
glimpse
of
Cho
the
Ravenclaw
Seeker
cheering
Stewart
Ackerley
as
he
sat
down
for
a
fleeting
second
Harry
had
a
strange
desire
to
join
the
Ravenclaw
table
too
baddock
Malcolm
slytherin
the
table
on
the
other
side
of
the
hall
erupted
with
cheers
Harry
could
see
Malfoy
clapping
as
Baddock
joined
the
Slytherins
harry
wondered
whether
Baddock
knew
that
Slytherin
House
had
turned
out
more
Dark
witches
and
wizards
than
any
other
fred
and
George
hissed
Malcolm

tiny
Dennis
Creevey
staggered
forward
tripping
over
hagrid's
moleskin
just
as
Hagrid
himself
sidled
into
the
Hall
through
a
door
behind
the
teachers
table
about
twice
as
tall
as
a
normal
man
and
at
least
three
times
as
broad
Hagrid
with
his
long
wild
tangled
black
hair
and
beard
looked
slightly
alarming
a
misleading
impression
for
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
knew
Hagrid
to
possess
a
very
kind
nature
he
winked
at
them
as
he
sat
down
at
the
end
of
the
staff
table
and
watched
Dennis
Creevey
putting
on
the
Sorting
Hat
the
rip
at
the
brim
opened
wide
gryffindor
the

shouted
hagrid
clapped
along
with
the
Gryffindors
as
Dennis
Creevey
beaming
widely
took
off
the
hat
placed
it
back
on
the
stool
and
hurried
over
to
join
his
brother
colin
I
fell
in
he
said
shrilly
throwing
himself
into
an
empty
seat
it
was
brilliant
and
something
in
the
water
grabbed
me
and
pushed
me
back
in
the
boat
cool
said
Colin
just
as
excitedly
it
was
probably
the
giant
squid
Dennis
wow
said
Dennis
as
though
nobody
in
their
wildest
dreams
could
hope
for
more
than
being
thrown
into
a
stormtossed
fathomsdeep
lake
and
pushed
out
of
it
again
by
a
giant
sea
monster
dennis
dennis

that
boy
down
there
the
one
with
the
black

and

away
staring
very
hard
at
the
Sorting
Hat
now
Sorting
Emma

the
Sorting
continued
boys
and
girls
with
varying
degrees
of
fright
on
their
faces
moving
one
by
one
to
the
threelegged
stool
the
line
dwindling
slowly
as
professor
McGonagall
passed
the
l's
oh
hurry
up
Ron
moaned
massaging
his
stomach
now
Ron
the
sorting's
much
more
important
than
food
said
Nearly
Headless
Nick
as
Madley
Laura
became
a
Hufflepuff
course
it
is
if
you're
dead
snapped
Ron
i
do
hope
this
year's
batch
of
Gryffindors
are
up
to
scratch
said
Nearly
Headless
Nick
applauding
as
McDonald
Natalie
joined
the
Gryffindor
table
we
don't
want
to
break
our
winning
streak
do
we

had
won
the
InterHouse

for

and
finally
with

hufflepuff
the
Sorting
ended
professor
McGonagall
picked
up
the
hat
and
the
stool
and
carried
them
away
about
time
said
Ron
seizing
his
knife
and
fork
and
looking
expectantly
at
his
golden
plate
professor
Dumbledore
had
gotten
to
his
feet
he
was
smiling
around
at
the
students
his
arms
opened
wide
in
welcome
i
have
only
two
words
to
say
to
you
he
told
them
his
deep
voice
echoing
around
the
Hall
tuck
in
hear
hear
said
Harry
and
Ron
loudly
as
the
empty
dishes
filled
magically
before
their
eyes
nearly
Headless
Nick
watched
mournfully
as
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
loaded
their
own
plates
aaah
at's
be'er
said
Ron
with
his
mouth
full
of
mashed
potato
you're
lucky
there's
a
feast
at
all
tonight
you
know
said
Nearly
Headless
Nick
there
was
trouble
in
the
kitchens
earlier
why
wha
appened
said
Harry
through
a
sizable
chunk
of
steak
peeves
of
course
said
Nearly
Headless
Nick
shaking
his
head
which
wobbled
dangerously
he
pulled
his
ruff
a
little
higher
up
on
his
neck
the
usual
argument
you
know
he
wanted
to
attend
the
feast
well
it's
quite
out
of
the
question
you
know
what
he's
like
utterly
uncivilized
can't
see
a
plate
of
food
without
throwing
it
we
held
a
ghost's
council
the
Fat
Friar
was
all
for
giving
him
the
chance
but
most
wisely
in
my
opinion
the
Bloody
Baron
put
his
foot
down
the
Bloody
Baron
was
the
Slytherin
ghost
a
gaunt
and
silent
specter
covered
in
silver
bloodstains
he
was
the
only
person
at
Hogwarts
who
could
really
control
Peeves
yeah
we
thought
Peeves
seemed
hacked
off
about
something
said
Ron
darkly
so
what
did
he
do
in
the
kitchens
oh
the
usual
said
Nearly
Headless
Nick
shrugging
wreaked
havoc
and
mayhem
pots
and
pans
everywhere
place
swimming
in
soup
terrified
the
house
elves
out
of
their
wits
clang
hermione
had
knocked
over
her
golden
goblet
pumpkin
juice
spread
steadily
over
the
tablecloth
staining
several
feet
of
white
linen
orange
but
Hermione
paid
no
attention
there
are
houseelves
here
she
said
staring
horrorstruck
at
Nearly
Headless
Nick
here
at
Hogwarts
certainly
said
Nearly
Headless
Nick
looking
surprised
at
her
reaction
the
largest
number
in
any
dwelling
in
Britain
I
believe
over
a
hundred
i've
never
seen
one
said
Hermione
well
they
hardly
ever
leave
the
kitchen
by
day
do
they
said
Nearly
Headless
Nick
they
come
out
at
night
to
do
a
bit
of
cleaning
see
to
the
fires
and
so
on
i
mean
you're
not
supposed
to
see
them
are
you
that's
the
mark
of
a
good
houseelf
isn't
it
that
you
don't
know
it's
there
hermione
stared
at
him
but
they
get
paid
she
said
they
get
holidays
don't
they
and
and
sick
leave
and
pensions
and
everything
nearly
Headless
Nick
chortled
so
much
that
his
ruff
slipped
and
his
head
flopped
off
dangling
on
the
inch
or
so
of
ghostly
skin
and
muscle
that
still
attached
it
to
his
neck
sick
leave
and
pensions
he
said
pushing
his
head
back
onto
his
shoulders
and
securing
it
once
more
with
his
ruff
houseelves
don't
want
sick
leave
and
pensions
hermione
looked
down
at
her
hardly
touched
plate
of
food
then
put
her
knife
and
fork
down
upon
it
and
pushed
it
away
from
her
oh
c'mon
Ermyknee
said
Ron
accidentally
spraying
Harry
with
bits
of
yorkshire
pudding
oops
sorry
Arry
He
swallowed
you
won't
get
them
sick
leave
by
starving
yourself
slave
labor
said
Hermione
breathing
hard
through
her
nose
that's
what
made
this
dinner
slave
labor
and
she
refused
to
eat
another
bite
the
rain
was
still
drumming
heavily
against
the
high
dark
glass
another
clap
of
thunder
shook
the
windows
and
the
stormy
ceiling
flashed
illuminating
the
golden
plates
as
the
remains
of
the
first
course
vanished
and
were
replaced
instantly
with
puddings
treacle
tart
Hermione
said
Ron
deliberately
wafting
its
smell
toward
her
spotted
dick
look
chocolate
gateau
but
Hermione
gave
him
a
look
so
reminiscent
of
Professor
McGonagall
that
he
gave
up
when
the
puddings
too
had
been
demolished
and
the
last
crumbs
had
faded
off
the
plates
leaving
them
sparkling
clean
Albus
Dumbledore
got
to
his
feet
again
the
buzz
of
chatter
filling
the
Hall
ceased
almost
at
once
so
that
only
the
howling
wind
and
pounding
rain
could
be
heard
so
said
Dumbledore
smiling
around
at
them
all
now
that
we
are
all
fed
and
watered
Hmph
said
Hermione
I
must
once
more
ask
for
your
attention
while
I
give
out
a
few
notices
mr.
Filch
the
caretaker
has
asked
me
to
tell
you
that
the
list
of
objects
forbidden
inside
the
castle
has
this
year
been
extended
to
include
Screaming
Yoyos
Fanged
Frisbees
and
EverBashing
Boomerangs
the
full
list
comprises
some
four
hundred
and
thirtyseven
items
I
believe
and
can
be
viewed
in
mr.
filch's
office
if
anybody
would
like
to
check
it
the
corners
of
dumbledore's
mouth
twitched
he
continued
As
ever
I
would
like
to
remind
you
all
that
the
forest
on
the
grounds
is
outofbounds
to
students
as
is
the
village
of
Hogsmeade
to
all
below
third
year
it
is
also
my
painful
duty
to
inform
you
that
the
InterHouse
Quidditch
Cup
will
not
take
place
this
year
what
harry
gasped
he
looked
around
at
Fred
and
George
his
fellow
members
of
the
Quidditch
team
they
were
mouthing
soundlessly
at
Dumbledore
apparently
too
appalled
to
speak
dumbhedore
went
on
This
is
due
to
an
event
that
will
be
starting
in
October
and
continuing
throughout
the
school
year
taking
up
much
of
the
teachers
time
and
energy
but
I
am
sure
you
will
all
enjoy
it
immensely
i
have
great
pleasure
in
announcing
that
this
year
at
Hogwarts
but
at
that
moment
there
was
a
deafening
rumble
of
thunder
and
the
doors
of
the
Great
Hall
banged
open
a
man
stood
in
the
doorway
leaning
upon
a
long
staff
shrouded
in
a
black
traveling
cloak
every
head
in
the
Great
Hall
swiveled
toward
the
stranger
suddenly
brightly
illuminated
by
a
fork
of
lightning
that
flashed
across
the
ceiling
he
lowered
his
hood
shook
out
a
long
mane
of
grizzled
dark
gray
hair
then
began
to
walk
up
toward
the
teachers
table
a
dull
clunk
echoed
through
the
Hall
on
his
every
other
step
he
reached
the
end
of
the
top
table
turned
right
and
limped
heavily
toward
Dumbledore
another
flash
of
lightning
crossed
the
ceiling
hermione
gasped
the
lightning
had
thrown
the
man's
face
into
sharp
relief
and
it
was
a
face
unlike
any
Harry
had
ever
seen
it
looked
as
though
it
had
been
carved
out
of
weathered
wood
by
someone
who
had
only
the
vaguest
idea
of
what
human
faces
are
supposed
to
look
like
and
was
none
too
skilled
with
a
chisel
every
inch
of
skin
seemed
to
be
scarred
the
mouth
looked
like
a
diagonal
gash
and
a
large
chunk
of
the
nose
was
missing
but
it
was
the
man's
eyes
that
made
him
frightening
one
of
them
was
small
dark
and
beady
the
other
was
large
round
as
a
coin
and
a
vivid
electric
blue
the
blue
eye
was
moving
ceaselessly
without
blinking
and
was
rolling
up
down
and
from
side
to
side
quite
independently
of
the
normal
eye
and
then
it
rolled
right
over
pointing
into
the
back
of
the
man's
head
so
that
all
they
could
see
was
whiteness
the
stranger
reached
Dumbledore
he
stretched
out
a
hand
that
was
as
badly
scarred
as
his
face
and
Dumbhedore
shook
it
muttering
words
Harry
couldn't
hear
he
seemed
to
be
making
some
inquiry
of
the
stranger
who
shook
his
head
unsmilingly
and
replied
in
an
undertone
dumbledore
nodded
and
gestured
the
man
to
the
empty
seat
on
his
righthand
side
the
stranger
sat
down
shook
his
mane
of
dark
gray
hair
out
of
his
face
pulled
a
plate
of
sausages
toward
him
raised
it
to
what
was
left
of
his
nose
and
sniffed
it
he
then
took
a
small
knife
out
of
his
pocket
speared
a
sausage
on
the
end
of
it
and
began
to
eat
his
normal
eye
was
fixed
upon
the
sausages
but
the
blue
eye
was
still
darting
restlessly
around
in
its
socket
taking
in
the
Hall
and
the
students
may
I
introduce
our
new
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
teacher
said
Dumbledore
brightly
into
the
silence
professor
Moody
it
was
usual
for
new
staff
members
to
be
greeted
with
applause
but
none
of
the
staff
or
students
chapped
except
Dumbledore
and
Hagrid
who
both
put
their
hands
together
and
applauded
but
the
sound
echoed
dismally
into
the
silence
and
they
stopped
fairly
quickly
everyone
else
seemed
too
transfixed
by
moody's
bizarre
appearance
to
do
more
than
stare
at
him
moody
harry
muttered
to
Ron
madEye
Moody
the
one
your
dad
went
to
help
this
morning
must
be
said
Ron
in
a
low
awed
voice
what
happened
to
him
hermione
whispered
what
happened
to
his
face
dunno
Ron
whispered
back
watching
Moody
with
fascination
moody
seemed
totally
indifferent
to
his
lessthanwarm
welcome
ignoring
the
jug
of
pumpkin
juice
in
front
of
him
he
reached
again
into
his
traveling
cloak
pulled
out
a
hip
flask
and
took
a
long
draught
from
it
as
he
lifted
his
arm
to
drink
his
cloak
was
pulled
a
few
inches
from
the
ground
and
Harry
saw
below
the
table
several
inches
of
carved
wooden
leg
ending
in
a
clawed
foot
dumbledore
cleared
his
throat
as
I
was
saying
he
said
smiling
at
the
sea
of
students
before
him
all
of
whom
were
still
gazing
transfixed
at
MadEye
Moody
we
are
to
have
the
honor
of
hosting
a
very
exciting
event
over
the
coming
months
an
event
that
has
not
been
held
for
over
a
century
it
is
my
very
great
pleasure
to
inform
you
that
the
Triwizard
Tournament
will
be
taking
place
at
Hogwarts
this
year
you're
joking
said
Fred
Weasley
loudly
the
tension
that
had
filled
the
Hall
ever
since
moody's
arrival
suddenly
broke
nearly
everyone
laughed
and
Dumbledore
chuckled
appreciatively
i
am
not
joking
mr.
Weasley
he
said
though
now
that
you
mention
it
I
did
hear
an
excellent
one
over
the
summer
about
a
troll
a
hag
and
a
leprechaun
who
all
go
into
a
bar
professor
McGonagall
cleared
her
throat
loudly
er
but
maybe
this
is
not
the
time
no
said
Dumbledore
where
was
I
ah
yes
the
Triwizard
Tournament
well
some
of
you
will
not
know
what
this
tournament
involves
so
I
hope
those
who
do
know
will
forgive
me
for
giving
a
short
explanation
and
allow
their
attention
to
wander
freely
the
Triwizard
Tournament
was
first
established
some
seven
hundred
years
ago
as
a
friendly
competition
between
the
three
largest
European
schools
of
wizardry
Hogwarts
Beauxbatons
and
Durmstrang
a
champion
was
selected
to
represent
each
school
and
the
three
champions
competed
in
three
magical
tasks
the
schools
took
it
in
turns
to
host
the
tournament
once
every
five
years
and
it
was
generally
agreed
to
be
a
most
excellent
way
of
establishing
ties
between
young
witches
and
wizards
of
different
nationalities
until
that
is
the
death
toll
mounted
so
high
that
the
tournament
was
discontinued
death
toll
hermione
whispered
looking
alarmed
but
her
anxiety
did
not
seem
to
be
shared
by
the
majority
of
students
in
the
Hall
many
of
them
were
whispering
excitedly
to
one
another
and
Harry
himself
was
far
more
interested
in
hearing
about
the
tournament
than
in
worrying
about
deaths
that
had
happened
hundreds
of
years
ago
there
have
been
several
attempts
over
the
centuries
to
reinstate
the
tournament
dumbledore
continued
none
of
which
has
been
very
successful
however
our
own
departments
of
International
Magical
Cooperation
and
Magical
Games
and
Sports
have
decided
the
time
is
ripe
for
another
attempt
we
have
worked
hard
over
the
summer
to
ensure
that
this
time
no
champion
will
find
himself
or
herself
in
mortal
danger
the
heads
of
Beauxbatons
and
Durmstrang
will
be
arriving
with
their
shortlisted
contenders
in
October
and
the
selection
of
the
three
champions
will
take
place
at
Halloween
an
impartial
judge
will
decide
which
students
are
most
worthy
to
compete
for
the
Triwizard
Cup
the
glory
of
their
school
and
a
thousand
Galleons
personal
prize
money
i'm
going
for
it
fred
Weasley
hissed
down
the
table
his
face
lit
with
enthusiasm
at
the
prospect
of
such
glory
and
riches
he
was
not
the
only
person
who
seemed
to
be
visualizing
himself
as
the
Hogwarts
champion
at
every
House
table
Harry
could
see
people
either
gazing
raptly
at
Dumbledore
or
else
whispering
fervently
to
their
neighbors
but
then
Dumbledore
spoke
again
and
the
Hall
quieted
once
more
eager
though
I
know
all
of
you
will
be
to
bring
the
Triwizard
Cup
to
Hogwarts
he
said
the
heads
of
the
participating
schools
along
with
the
Ministry
of
Magic
have
agreed
to
impose
an
age
restriction
on
contenders
this
year
only
students
who
are
of
age
that
is
to
say
seventeen
years
or
older
will
be
allowed
to
put
forward
their
names
for
consideration
this
Dumbledore
raised
his
voice
slightly
for
several
people
had
made
noises
of
outrage
at
these
words
and
the
Weasley
twins
were
suddenly
looking
furious
is
a
measure
we
feel
is
necessary
given
that
the
tournament
tasks
will
still
be
difficult
and
dangerous
whatever
precautions
we
take
and
it
is
highly
unlikely
that
students
below
sixth
and
seventh
year
will
be
able
to
cope
with
them
i
will
personally
be
ensuring
that
no
underage
student
hoodwinks
our
impartial
judge
into
making
them
Hogwarts
champion
his
light
blue
eyes
twinkled
as
they
flickered
over
fred's
and
george's
mutinous
faces
i
therefore
beg
you
not
to
waste
your
time
submitting
yourself
if
you
are
under
seventeen
the
delegations
from
Beauxbatons
and
Durmstrang
will
be
arriving
in
October
and
remaining
with
us
for
the
greater
part
of
this
year
i
know
that
you
will
all
extend
every
courtesy
to
our
foreign
guests
while
they
are
with
us
and
will
give
your
wholehearted
support
to
the
Hogwarts
champion
when
he
or
she
is
selected
and
now
it
is
late
and
I
know
how
important
it
is
to
you
all
to
be
alert
and
rested
as
you
enter
your
lessons
tomorrow
morning
bedtime
chop
chop
dumbledore
sat
down
again
and
turned
to
talk
to
MadEye
Moody
there
was
a
great
scraping
and
banging
as
all
the
students
got
to
their
feet
and
swarmed
toward
the
double
doors
into
the
entrance
hall
they
can't
do
that
said
George
Weasley
who
had
not
joined
the
crowd
moving
toward
the
door
but
was
standing
up
and
glaring
at
Dumbledore
we're
seventeen
in
April
why
can't
we
have
a
shot
they're
not
stopping
me
entering
said
Fred
stubbornly
also
scowling
at
the
top
table
the
champions'll
get
to
do
all
sorts
of
stuff
you'd
never
be
allowed
to
do
normally
and
a
thousand
Galleons
prize
money
yeah
said
Ron
a
faraway
look
on
his
face
yeah
a
thousand
Galleons
come
on
said
Hermione
we'll
be
the
only
ones
left
here
if
you
don't
move
harry
Ron
Hermione
Fred
and
George
set
off
for
the
entrance
hall
Fred
and
George
debating
the
ways
in
which
Dumbledore
might
stop
those
who
were
under
seventeen
from
entering
the
tournament
who's
this
impartial
judge
who's
going
to
decide
who
the
champions
are
said
Harry
dunno
said
Fred
but
it's
them
we'll
have
to
fool
i
reckon
a
couple
of
drops
of
Aging
Potion
might
do
it
George
dumbledore
knows
you're
not
of
age
though
said
Ron
yeah
but
he's
not
the
one
who
decides
who
the
champion
is
is
he
said
Fred
shrewdly
sounds
to
me
like
once
this
judge
knows
who
wants
to
enter
he'll
choose
the
best
from
each
school
and
never
mind
how
old
they
are
dumbledore's
trying
to
stop
us
giving
our
names
people
have
died
though
said
Hermione
in
a
worried
voice
as
they
walked
through
a
door
concealed
behind
a
tapestry
and
started
up
another
narrower
staircase
yeah
said
Fred
airily
but
that
was
years
ago
wasn't
it
anyway
where's
the
fun
without
a
bit
of
risk
hey
Ron
what
if
we
find
out
how
to
get
round
Dumbledore
fancy
entering
what
d'you
reckon
ron
asked
Harry
be
cool
to
enter
wouldn't
it
but
I
s'pose
they
might
want
someone
older
dunno
if
we've
learned
enough
i
definitely
haven't
came
nevihle's
gloomy
voice
from
behind
Fred
and
George
i
expect
my
gran'd
want
me
to
try
though
she's
always
going
on
about
how
I
should
be
upholding
the
family
honor
i'll
just
have
to
oops
neville's
foot
had
sunk
right
through
a
step
halfway
up
the
staircase
there
were
many
of
these
trick
stairs
at
Hogwarts
it
was
second
nature
to
most
of
the
older
students
to
jump
this
particular
step
but
neville's
memory
was
notoriously
poor
harry
and
Ron
seized
him
under
the
armpits
and
pulled
him
out
while
a
suit
of
armor
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
creaked
and
clanked
laughing
wheezily
shut
it
you
said
Ron
banging
down
its
visor
as
they
passed
they
made
their
way
up
to
the
entrance
to
Gryffindor
Tower
which
was
concealed
behind
a
large
portrait
of
a
fat
lady
in
a
pink
silk
dress
password
she
said
as
they
approached
balderdash
said
George
a
prefect
downstairs
told
me
the
portrait
swung
forward
to
reveal
a
hole
in
the
wall
through
which
they
all
climbed
a
crackling
fire
warmed
the
circular
common
room
which
was
full
of
squashy
armchairs
and
tables
hermione
cast
the
merrily
dancing
flames
a
dark
look
and
Harry
distinctly
heard
her
mutter
Slave
labor
before
bidding
them
good
night
and
disappearing
through
the
doorway
to
the
girls
dormitory
harry
Ron
and
Neville
climbed
up
the
last
spiral
staircase
until
they
reached
their
own
dormitory
which
was
situated
at
the
top
of
the
tower
five
fourposter
beds
with
deep
crimson
hangings
stood
against
the
walls
each
with
its
owner's
trunk
at
the
foot
dean
and
Seamus
were
already
getting
into
bed
Seamus
had
pinned
his
Ireland
rosette
to
his
headboard
and
Dean
had
tacked
up
a
poster
of
Viktor
Krum
over
his
bedside
table
his
old
poster
of
the
West
Ham
football
team
was
pinned
right
next
to
it
mental
Ron
sighed
shaking
his
head
at
the
completely
stationary
soccer
players
harry
Ron
and
Neville
got
into
their
pajamas
and
into
bed
someone
a
house
elf
no
doubt
had
placed
warming
pans
between
the
sheets
it
was
extremely
comfortable
lying
there
in
bed
and
listening
to
the
storm
raging
outside
i
might
go
in
for
it
you
know
Ron
said
sleepily
through
the
darkness
if
Fred
and
George
find
out
how
to
the
tournament
you
never
know
do
you
s'pose
not
harry
rolled
over
in
bed
a
series
of
dazzling
new
pictures
forming
in
his
mind's
eye
he
had
hoodwinked
the
impartial
judge
into
believing
he
was
seventeen
he
had
become
Hogwarts
champion
he
was
standing
on
the
grounds
his
arms
raised
in
triumph
in
front
of
the
whole
school
all
of
whom
were
applauding
and
screaming
he
had
just
won
the
Triwizard
Tournament
cho's
face
stood
out
particularly
clearly
in
the
blurred
crowd
her
face
glowing
with
admiration
harry
grinned
into
his
pillow
exceptionally
glad
that
Ron
couldn't
see
what
he
could
chapter
thirteen
madeye
moody
the
storm
had
blown
itself
out
by
the
following
morning
though
the
ceiling
in
the
Great
Hall
was
still
gloomy
heavy
clouds
of
pewter
gray
swirled
overhead
as
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
examined
their
new
course
schedules
at
breakfast
a
few
seats
along
Fred
George
and
Lee
Jordan
were
discussing
magical
methods
of
aging
themselves
and
bluffing
their
way
into
the
Triwizard
Tournament
today's
not
bad
outside
all
morning
said
Ron
who
was
running
his
finger
down
the
Monday
column
of
his
schedule
herbology
with
the
Hufflepuffs
and
Care
of
Magical
Creatures
damn
it
we're
still
with
the
Slytherins
double
Divination
this
afternoon
Harry
groaned
looking
down
divination
was
his
least
favorite
subject
apart
from
Potions
professor
Trelawney
kept
predicting
harry's
death
which
he
found
extremely
annoying
you
should
have
given
it
up
like
me
shouldn't
you
said
Hermione
briskly
buttering
herself
some
toast
then
you'd
be
doing
something
sensible
like
Arithmancy
you're
eating
again
I
notice
said
Ron
watching
Hermione
adding
liberal
amounts
of
jam
to
her
toast
too
i've
decided
there
are
better
ways
of
making
a
stand
about
elf
rights
said
Hermione
haughtily
yeah
and
you
were
hungry
said
Ron
grinning
there
was
a
sudden
rustling
noise
above
them
and
a
hundred
owls
came
soaring
through
the
open
windows
carrying
the
morning
mail
instinctively
Harry
looked
up
but
there
was
no
sign
of
white
among
the
mass
of
brown
and
gray
the
owls
circled
the
tables
looking
for
the
people
to
whom
their
letters
and
packages
were
addressed
a
large
tawny
owl
soared
down
to
Neville
Longbottom
and
deposited
a
parcel
into
his
lap
Neville
almost
always
forgot
to
pack
something
on
the
other
side
of
the
Hall
Draco
malfoy's
eagle
owl
had
landed
on
his
shoulder
carrying
what
looked
like
his
usual
supply
of
sweets
and
cakes
from
home
trying
to
ignore
the
sinking
feeling
of
disappointment
in
his
stomach
Harry
returned
to
his
porridge
was
it
possible
that
something
had
happened
to
Hedwig
and
that
Sirius
hadn't
even
got
his
letter
his
preoccupation
lasted
all
the
way
across
the
sodden
vegetable
patch
until
they
arrived
in
greenhouse
three
but
here
he
was
distracted
by
Professor
Sprout
showing
the
class
the
ugliest
plants
Harry
had
ever
seen
indeed
they
looked
less
like
plants
than
thick
black
giant
slugs
protruding
vertically
out
of
the
soil
each
was
squirming
slightly
and
had
a
number
of
large
shiny
swellings
upon
it
which
appeared
to
be
full
of
liquid
bubotubers
Professor
Sprout
told
them
briskly
they
need
squeezing
you
will
collect
the
pus
the
what
said
Seamus
Finnigan
sounding
revolted
pus
Finnigan
pus
said
Professor
Sprout
and
it's
extremely
valuable
so
don't
waste
it
you
will
collect
the
pus
I
say
in
these
bottles
wear
your
dragonhide
gloves
it
can
do
funny
things
to
the
skin
when
undiluted
bubotuber
pus
squeezing
the
bubotubers
was
disgusting
but
oddly
satisfying
as
each
swelling
was
popped
a
large
amount
of
thick
yellowishgreen
liquid
burst
forth
which
smelled
strongly
of
petrol
they
caught
it
in
the
bottles
as
Professor
Sprout
had
indicated
and
by
the
end
of
the
lesson
had
collected
several
pints
this'll
keep
Madam
Pomfrey
happy
said
Professor
Sprout
stoppering
the
last
bottle
with
a
cork
an
excellent
remedy
for
the
more
stubborn
forms
of
acne
bubotuber
pus
should
stop
students
resorting
to
desperate
measures
to
rid
themselves
of
pimples
like
poor
Eloise
Midgen
said
Hannah
Abbott
a
Hufflepuff
in
a
hushed
voice
she
tried
to
curse
hers
off
silly
girl
said
Professor
Sprout
shaking
her
head
but
Madam
Pomfrey
fixed
her
nose
back
on
in
the
end
a
booming
bell
echoed
from
the
castle
across
the
wet
grounds
signaling
the
end
of
the
lesson
and
the
class
separated
the
Hufflepuffs
climbing
the
stone
steps
for
Transfiguration
and
the
Gryffindors
heading
in
the
other
direction
down
the
sloping
lawn
toward
hagrid's
small
wooden
cabin
which
stood
on
the
edge
of
the
Forbidden
Forest
hagrid
was
standing
outside
his
hut
one
hand
on
the
collar
of
his
enormous
black
boarhound
Fang
there
were
several
open
wooden
crates
on
the
ground
at
his
feet
and
Fang
was
whimpering
and
straining
at
his
collar
apparently
keen
to
investigate
the
contents
more
closely
as
they
drew
nearer
an
odd
rattling
noise
reached
their
ears
punctuated
by
what
sounded
like
minor
explosions
mornin
hagrid
said
grinning
at
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
be'er
wait
fer
the
Slytherins
they
won
want
ter
miss
this
BlastEnded
Skrewts
come
again
said
Ron
hagrid
pointed
down
into
the
crates
eurgh
squealed
Lavender
Brown
jumping
backward
eurgh
just
about
summed
up
the
BlastEnded
Skrewts
in
harry's
opinion
they
looked
like
deformed
shellless
lobsters
horribly
pale
and
slimylooking
with
legs
sticking
out
in
very
odd
places
and
no
visible
heads
there
were
about
a
hundred
of
them
in
each
crate
each
about
six
inches
long
crawling
over
one
another
bumping
blindly
into
the
sides
of
the
boxes
they
were
giving
off
a
very
powerful
smell
of
rotting
fish
every
now
and
then
sparks
would
fly
out
of
the
end
of
a
skrewt
and
with
a
small
phut
it
would
be
propelled
forward
several
inches
on'y
jus
hatched
said
Hagrid
proudly
so
yeh'll
be
able
ter
raise
em
yerselves
thought
we'd
make
a
bit
of
a
project
of
it
and
why
would
we
want
to
raise
them
said
a
cold
voice
the
Slytherins
had
arrived
the
speaker
was
Draco
Malfoy
crabbe
and
Goyle
were
chuckling
appreciatively
at
his
words
hagrid
looked
stumped
at
the
question
i
mean
what
do
they
do
asked
Malfoy
what
is
the
point
of
them
hagrid
opened
his
mouth
apparently
thinking
hard
there
was
a
few
seconds
pause
then
he
said
roughly
tha's
next
lesson
Malfoy
yer
jus
feedin
em
today
now
yeh'll
wan
ter
try
em
on
a
few
diff'rent
things
i've
never
had
em
before
not
sure
what
they'll
go
fer
I
got
ant
eggs
an
frog
livers
an
a
bit
o
grass
snake
just
try
em
out
with
a
bit
of
each
first
pus
and
now
this
muttered
Seamus
nothing
but
deep
affection
for
Hagrid
could
have
made
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
pick
up
squelchy
handfuls
of
frog
liver
and
lower
them
into
the
crates
to
tempt
the
BlastEnded
Skrewts
harry
couldn't
suppress
the
suspicion
that
the
whole
thing
was
entirely
pointless
because
the
skrewts
didn't
seem
to
have
mouths
ouch
yelled
Dean
Thomas
after
about
ten
minutes
it
got
me
hagrid
hurried
over
to
him
looking
anxious
its
end
exploded
said
Dean
angrily
showing
Hagrid
a
burn
on
his
hand
ah
yeah
that
can
happen
when
they
blast
off
said
Hagrid
nodding
eurgh
said
Lavender
Brown
again
eurgh
Hagrid
what's
that
pointy
thing
on
it
ah
some
of
em
have
got
stings
said
Hagrid
enthusiastically
Lavender
quickly
withdrew
her
hand
from
the
box
i
reckon
they're
the
males
the
females've
got
sorta
sucker
things
on
their
bellies
i
think
they
might
be
ter
suck
blood
well
I
can
certainly
see
why
we're
trying
to
keep
them
alive
said
Malfoy
sarcastically
who
wouldn't
want
pets
that
can
burn
sting
and
bite
all
at
once
just
because
they're
not
very
pretty
it
doesn't
mean
they're
not
useful
Hermione
snapped
dragon
blood's
amazingly
magical
but
you
wouldn't
want
a
dragon
for
a
pet
would
you
harry
and
Ron
grinned
at
Hagrid
who
gave
them
a
furtive
smile
from
behind
his
bushy
beard
hagrid
would
have
liked
nothing
better
than
a
pet
dragon
as
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
knew
only
too
well
he
had
owned
one
for
a
brief
period
during
their
first
year
a
vicious
Norwegian
Ridgeback
by
the
name
of
Norbert
hagrid
simply
loved
monstrous
creatures
the
more
lethal
the
better
well
at
least
the
skrewts
are
small
said
Ron
as
they
made
their
way
back
up
to
the
castle
for
lunch
an
hour
later
they
are
now
said
Hermione
in
an
exasperated
voice
but
once
hagrid's
found
out
what
they
eat
I
expect
they'll
be
six
feet
long
well
that
won't
matter
if
they
turn
out
to
cure
seasickness
or
something
will
it
said
Ron
grinning
slyly
at
her
you
know
perfectly
well
I
only
said
that
to
shut
Malfoy
up
said
Hermione
as
a
matter
of
fact
I
think
he's
right
the
best
thing
to
do
would
be
to
stamp
on
the
lot
of
them
before
they
start
attacking
us
all
they
sat
down
at
the
Gryffindor
table
and
helped
themselves
to
lamb
chops
and
potatoes
hermione
began
to
eat
so
fast
that
Harry
and
Ron
stared
at
her
er
is
this
the
new
stand
on
elf
rights
said
Ron
you're
going
to
make
yourself
puke
instead
no
said
Hermione
with
as
much
dignity
as
she
could
muster
with
her
mouth
bulging
with
sprouts
i
just
want
to
get
to
the
library
what
said
Ron
in
disbelief
hermione
it's
the
first
day
back
we
haven't
even
got
homework
yet
hermione
shrugged
and
continued
to
shovel
down
her
food
as
though
she
had
not
eaten
for
days
then
she
leapt
to
her
feet
said
See
you
at
dinner
and
departed
at
high
speed
when
the
bell
rang
to
signal
the
start
of
afternoon
lessons
Harry
and
Ron
set
off
for
North
Tower
where
at
the
top
of
a
tightly
spiraling
staircase
a
silver
stepladder
led
to
a
circular
trapdoor
in
the
ceiling
and
the
room
where
Professor
Trelawney
lived
the
familiar
sweet
perfume
spreading
from
the
fire
met
their
nostrils
as
they
emerged
at
the
top
of
the
stepladder
as
ever
the
curtains
were
all
closed
the
circular
room
was
bathed
in
a
dim
reddish
light
cast
by
the
many
lamps
which
were
all
draped
with
scarves
and
shawls
harry
and
Ron
walked
through
the
mass
of
occupied
chintz
chairs
and
poufs
that
cluttered
the
room
and
sat
down
at
the
same
small
circular
table
good
day
said
the
misty
voice
of
Professor
Trelawney
right
behind
Harry
making
him
jump
a
very
thin
woman
with
enormous
glasses
that
made
her
eyes
appear
far
too
large
for
her
face
Professor
Trelawney
was
peering
down
at
Harry
with
the
tragic
expression
she
always
wore
whenever
she
saw
him
the
usual
large
amount
of
beads
chains
and
bangles
glittered
upon
her
person
in
the
firelight
you
are
preoccupied
my
dear
she
said
mournfully
to
Harry
my
inner
eye
sees
past
your
brave
face
to
the
troubled
soul
within
and
I
regret
to
say
that
your
worries
are
not
baseless
i
see
difficult
times
ahead
for
you
alas
most
difficult
i
fear
the
thing
you
dread
will
indeed
come
to
pass
and
perhaps
sooner
than
you
think
her
voice
dropped
almost
to
a
whisper
ron
rolled
his
eyes
at
Harry
who
looked
stonily
back
professor
Trelawney
swept
past
them
and
seated
herself
in
a
large
winged
armchair
before
the
fire
facing
the
class
lavender
Brown
and
Parvati
Patil
who
deeply
admired
Professor
Trelawney
were
sitting
on
poufs
very
close
to
her
my
dears
it
is
time
for
us
to
consider
the
stars
she
said
the
movements
of
the
planets
and
the
mysterious
portents
they
reveal
only
to
those
who
understand
the
steps
of
the
celestial
dance
human
destiny
may
be
deciphered
by
the
planetary
rays
which
intermingle
but
harry's
thoughts
had
drifted
the
perfumed
fire
always
made
him
feel
sleepy
and
dullwitted
and
Professor
trelawney's
rambling
talks
on
fortunetelling
never
held
him
exactly
spellbound
though
he
couldn't
help
thinking
about
what
she
had
just
said
to
him
i
fear
the
thing
you
dread
will
indeed
come
to
pass
but
Hermione
was
right
Harry
thought
irritably
Professor
Trelawney
really
was
an
old
fraud
he
wasn't
dreading
anything
at
the
moment
at
all
well
unless
you
counted
his
fears
that
Sirius
had
been
caught
but
what
did
Professor
Trelawney
know
he
had
long
since
come
to
the
conclusion
that
her
brand
of
fortunetelling
was
really
no
more
than
lucky
guesswork
and
a
spooky
manner
except
of
course
for
that
time
at
the
end
of
last
term
when
she
had
made
the
prediction
about
Voldemort
rising
again
and
Dumbledore
himself
had
said
that
he
thought
that
trance
had
been
genuine
when
Harry
had
described
it
to
him
harry
ron
muttered
what
harry
looked
around
the
whole
class
was
staring
at
him
he
sat
up
straight
he
had
been
almost
dozing
off
lost
in
the
heat
and
his
thoughts
i
was
saying
my
dear
that
you
were
clearly
born
under
the
baleful
influence
of
Saturn
said
Professor
Trelawney
a
faint
note
of
resentment
in
her
voice
at
the
fact
that
he
had
obviously
not
been
hanging
on
her
words
born
under
what
sorry
said
Harry
saturn
dear
the
planet
Saturn
said
Professor
Trelawney
sounding
definitely
irritated
that
he
wasn't
riveted
by
this
news
i
was
saying
that
Saturn
was
surely
in
a
position
of
power
in
the
heavens
at
the
moment
of
your
birth
your
dark
hair
your
mean
stature
tragic
losses
so
young
in
life
i
think
I
am
right
in
saying
my
dear
that
you
were
born
in
midwinter
no
said
Harry
I
was
born
in
July
ron
hastily
turned
his
laugh
into
a
hacking
cough
half
an
hour
later
each
of
them
had
been
given
a
complicated
circular
chart
and
was
attempting
to
fill
in
the
position
of
the
planets
at
their
moment
of
birth
it
was
dull
work
requiring
much
consultation
of
timetables
and
calculation
of
angles
i've
got
two
Neptunes
here
said
Harry
after
a
while
frowning
down
at
his
piece
of
parchment
that
can't
be
right
can
it
aaaaah
said
Ron
imitating
Professor
trelawney's
mystical
whisper
when
two
Neptunes
appear
in
the
sky
it
is
a
sure
sign
that
a
midget
in
glasses
is
being
born
Harry
seamus
and
Dean
who
were
working
nearby
sniggered
loudly
though
not
loudly
enough
to
mask
the
excited
squeals
from
Lavender
Brown
Oh
Professor
look
i
think
i've
got
an
unaspected
planet
oooh
which
one's
that
Professor
it
is
Uranus
my
dear
said
Professor
Trelawney
peering
down
at
the
chart
can
I
have
a
look
at
Uranus
too
Lavender
said
Ron
most
unfortunately
Professor
Trelawney
heard
him
and
it
was
this
perhaps
that
made
her
give
them
so
much
homework
at
the
end
of
the
class
a
detailed
analysis
of
the
way
the
planetary
movements
in
the
coming
month
will
affect
you
with
reference
to
your
personal
chart
she
snapped
sounding
much
more
like
Professor
McGonagall
than
her
usual
airyfairy
self
i
want
it
ready
to
hand
in
next
Monday
and
no
excuses
miserable
old
bat
said
Ron
bitterly
as
they
joined
the
crowds
descending
the
staircases
back
to
the
Great
Hall
and
dinner
that'll
take
all
weekend
that
will
lots
of
homework
said
Hermione
brightly
catching
up
with
them
professor
Vector
didn't
give
us
any
at
all
well
bully
for
Professor
Vector
said
Ron
moodily
they
reached
the
entrance
hall
which
was
packed
with
people
queuing
for
dinner
they
had
just
joined
the
end
of
the
line
when
a
loud
voice
rang
out
behind
them
weasley
hey
Weasley
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
turned
malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
were
standing
there
each
looking
thoroughly
pleased
about
something
what
said
Ron
shortly
your
dad's
in
the
paper
Weasley
said
Malfoy
brandishing
a
copy
of
the
Daily
Prophet
and
speaking
very
loudly
so
that
everyone
in
the
packed
entrance
hall
could
hear
listen
to
this
further
mistakes
at
the
ministry
of
magic
It
seems
as
though
the
Ministry
of
magic's
troubles
are
not
yet
at
an
end
writes
Rita
Skeeter
Special
Correspondent
recently
under
fire
for
its
poor
crowd
control
at
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
and
still
unable
to
account
for
the
disappearance
of
one
of
its
witches
the
Ministry
was
plunged
into
fresh
embarrassment
yesterday
by
the
antics
of
Arnold
Weasley
of
the
Misuse
of
Muggle
Artifacts
Office
malfoy
looked
up
imagine
them
not
even
getting
his
name
right
Weasley
it's
almost
as
though
he's
a
complete
nonentity
isn't
it
he
crowed
everyone
in
the
entrance
hall
was
listening
now
malfoy
straightened
the
paper
with
a
flourish
and
read
on
Arnold
Weasley
who
was
charged
with
possession
of
a
flying
car
two
years
ago
was
yesterday
involved
in
a
tussle
with
several
Muggle
lawkeepers
policemen
over
a
number
of
highly
aggressive
dustbins
mr.
Weasley
appears
to
have
rushed
to
the
aid
of
MadEye
Moody
the
aged
exAuror
who
retired
from
the
Ministry
when
no
longer
able
to
tell
the
difference
between
a
handshake
and
attempted
murder
unsurprisingly
mr.
Weasley
found
upon
arrival
at
mr.
moody's
heavily
guarded
house
that
mr.
Moody
had
once
again
raised
a
false
alarm
mr.
Weasley
was
forced
to
modify
several
memories
before
he
could
escape
from
the
policemen
but
refused
to
answer
Daily
Prophet
questions
about
why
he
had
involved
the
Ministry
in
such
an
undignified
and
potentially
embarrassing
scene
and
there's
a
picture
Weasley
said
Malfoy
flipping
the
paper
over
and
holding
it
up
a
picture
of
your
parents
outside
their
house
if
you
can
call
it
a
house
your
mother
could
do
with
losing
a
bit
of
weight
couldn't
she
ron
was
shaking
with
fury
everyone
was
staring
at
him
get
stuffed
Malfoy
said
Harry
c'mon
Ron
oh
yeah
you
were
staying
with
them
this
summer
weren't
you
Potter
sneered
Malfoy
so
tell
me
is
his
mother
really
that
porky
or
is
it
just
the
picture
you
know
your
mother
Malfoy
said
Harry
both
he
and
Hermione
had
grabbed
the
back
of
ron's
robes
to
stop
him
from
launching
himself
at
Malfoy
that
expression
she's
got
like
she's
got
dung
under
her
nose
has
she
always
looked
like
that
or
was
it
just
because
you
were
with
her
malfoy's
pale
face
went
slightly
pink
don't
you
dare
insult
my
mother
Potter
keep
your
fat
mouth
shut
then
said
Harry
turning
away
bang
several
people
screamed
Harry
felt
something
whitehot
graze
the
side
of
his
face
he
plunged
his
hand
into
his
robes
for
his
wand
but
before
he'd
even
touched
it
he
heard
a
second
loud
bang
and
a
roar
that
echoed
through
the
entrance
hall
oh
no
you
don't
laddie
harry
spun
around
professor
Moody
was
limping
down
the
marble
staircase
his
wand
was
out
and
it
was
pointing
right
at
a
pure
white
ferret
which
was
shivering
on
the
stoneflagged
floor
exactly
where
Malfoy
had
been
standing
there
was
a
terrified
silence
in
the
entrance
hall
nobody
but
Moody
was
moving
a
muscle
moody
turned
to
look
at
Harry
at
least
his
normal
eye
was
looking
at
Harry
the
other
one
was
pointing
into
the
back
of
his
head
did
he
get
you
moody
growled
his
voice
was
low
and
gravelly
no
said
Harry
missed
leave
it
moody
shouted
leave
what
harry
said
bewildered
not
you
him
moody
growled
jerking
his
thumb
over
his
shoulder
at
Crabbe
who
had
just
frozen
about
to
pick
up
the
white
ferret
it
seemed
that
moody's
rolling
eye
was
magical
and
could
see
out
of
the
back
of
his
head
moody
started
to
limp
toward
Crabbe
Goyle
and
the
ferret
which
gave
a
terrified
squeak
and
took
off
streaking
toward
the
dungeons
i
don't
think
so
roared
Moody
pointing
his
wand
at
the
ferret
again
it
flew
ten
feet
into
the
air
fell
with
a
smack
to
the
floor
and
then
bounced
upward
once
more
i
don't
like
people
who
attack
when
their
opponent's
back's
turned
growled
Moody
as
the
ferret
bounced
higher
and
higher
squealing
in
pain
stinking
cowardly
scummy
thing
to
do
the
ferret
flew
through
the
air
its
legs
and
tail
flailing
helplessly
never
do
that
again
said
Moody
speaking
each
word
as
the
ferret
hit
the
stone
floor
and
bounced
upward
again
professor
Moody
said
a
shocked
voice
professor
McGonagall
was
coming
down
the
marble
staircase
with
her
arms
full
of
books
hello
Professor
McGonagall
said
Moody
calmly
bouncing
the
ferret
still
higher
what
what
are
you
doing
said
Professor
McGonagall
her
eyes
following
the
bouncing
ferret's
progress
through
the
air
teaching
said
Moody
teach
Moody
is
that
a
student
shrieked
Professor
McGonagall
the
books
spilling
out
of
her
arms
yep
said
Moody
no
cried
Professor
McGonagall
running
down
the
stairs
and
pulling
out
her
wand
a
moment
later
with
a
loud
snapping
noise
Draco
Malfoy
had
reappeared
lying
in
a
heap
on
the
floor
with
his
sleek
blond
hair
all
over
his
now
brilliantly
pink
face
he
got
to
his
feet
wincing
moody
we
never
use
Transfiguration
as
a
punishment
said
Professor
McGonagall
wealdy
surely
Professor
Dumbledore
told
you
that
he
might've
mentioned
it
yeah
said
Moody
scratching
his
chin
unconcernedly
but
I
thought
a
good
sharp
shock
we
give
detentions
Moody
or
speak
to
the
offender's
Head
of
House
i'll
do
that
then
said
Moody
staring
at
Malfoy
with
great
dislike
malfoy
whose
pale
eyes
were
still
watering
with
pain
and
humiliation
looked
malevolently
up
at
Moody
and
muttered
something
in
which
the
words
my
father
were
distinguishable
oh
yeah
said
Moody
quietly
limping
forward
a
few
steps
the
dull
clunk
of
his
wooden
leg
echoing
around
the
hall
well
I
know
your
father
of
old
boy
you
tell
him
moody's
keeping
a
close
eye
on
his
son
you
tell
him
that
from
me
now
your
Head
of
house'll
be
Snape
will
it
yes
said
Malfoy
resentfully
another
old
friend
growled
Moody
i've
been
looking
forward
to
a
chat
with
old
Snape
come
on
you
and
he
seized
malfoy's
upper
arm
and
marched
him
off
toward
the
dungeons
professor
McGonagall
stared
anxiously
after
them
for
a
few
moments
then
waved
her
wand
at
her
fallen
books
causing
them
to
soar
up
into
the
air
and
back
into
her
arms
don't
talk
to
me
Ron
said
quietly
to
Harry
and
Hermione
as
they
sat
down
at
the
Gryffindor
table
a
few
minutes
later
surrounded
by
excited
talk
on
all
sides
about
what
had
just
happened
why
not
said
Hermione
in
surprise
because
I
want
to
fix
that
in
my
memory
forever
said
Ron
his
eyes
closed
and
an
uplifted
expression
on
his
face
draco
Malfoy
the
amazing
bouncing
ferret
harry
and
Hermione
both
laughed
and
Hermione
began
doling
beef
casserole
onto
each
of
their
plates
he
could
have
really
hurt
Malfoy
though
she
said
it
was
good
really
that
Professor
McGonagall
stopped
it
hermione
said
Ron
furiously
his
eyes
snapping
open
again
you're
ruining
the
best
moment
of
my
life
hermione
made
an
impatient
noise
and
began
to
eat
at
top
speed
again
don't
tell
me
you're
going
back
to
the
library
this
evening
said
Harry
watching
her
got
to
said
Hermione
thickly
loads
to
do
but
you
told
us
Professor
Vector
it's
not
schoolwork
she
said
within
five
minutes
she
had
cleared
her
plate
and
departed
no
sooner
had
she
gone
than
her
seat
was
taken
by
Fred
Weasley
moody
he
said
how
cool
is
he
beyond
cool
said
George
sitting
down
opposite
Fred
supercool
said
the
twins
best
friend
Lee
Jordan
sliding
into
the
seat
beside
George
we
had
him
this
afternoon
he
told
Harry
and
Ron
what
was
it
like
said
Harry
eagerly
fred
George
and
Lee
exchanged
looks
full
of
meaning
never
had
a
lesson
like
it
said
Fred
he
knows
man
said
Lee
knows
what
said
Ron
leaning
forward
knows
what
it's
like
to
be
out
there
doing
it
said
George
impressively
doing
what
said
Harry
fighting
the
Dark
Arts
said
Fred
he's
seen
it
all
said
George
mazing
said
Lee
ron
dived
into
his
bag
for
his
schedule
we
haven't
got
him
till
Thursday
he
said
in
a
disappointed
voice
chapter
fourteen
the
unforgivable
curses
the
next
two
days
passed
without
great
incident
unless
you
counted
Neville
melting
his
sixth
cauldron
in
Potions
professor
Snape
who
seemed
to
have
attained
new
levels
of
vindictiveness
over
the
summer
gave
Nevihle
detention
and
Neville
returned
from
it
in
a
state
of
nervous
collapse
having
been
made
to
disembowel
a
barrel
full
of
horned
toads
you
know
why
snape's
in
such
a
foul
mood
don't
you
said
Ron
to
Harry
as
they
watched
Hermione
teaching
Neville
a
Scouring
Charm
to
remove
the
frog
guts
from
under
his
fingernails
yeah
said
Harry
moody
it
was
common
knowledge
that
Snape
really
wanted
the
Dark
Arts
job
and
he
had
now
failed
to
get
it
for
the
fourth
year
running
snape
had
disliked
all
of
their
previous
Dark
Arts
teachers
and
shown
it
but
he
seemed
strangely
wary
of
displaying
overt
animosity
to
MadEye
Moody
indeed
whenever
Harry
saw
the
two
of
them
together
at
mealtimes
or
when
they
passed
in
the
corridors
he
had
the
distinct
impression
that
Snape
was
avoiding
moody's
eye
whether
magical
or
normal
i
reckon
snape's
a
bit
scared
of
him
you
know
Harry
said
thoughtfully
imagine
if
Moody
turned
Snape
into
a
horned
toad
said
Ron
his
eyes
misting
over
and
bounced
him
all
around
his
dungeon
the
Gryffindor
fourth
years
were
looking
forward
to
moody's
first
lesson
so
much
that
they
arrived
early
on
Thursday
lunchtime
and
queued
up
outside
his
classroom
before
the
bell
had
even
rung
the
only
person
missing
was
Hermione
who
turned
up
just
in
time
for
the
lesson
been
in
the
library
harry
finished
her
sentence
for
her
c'mon
quick
or
we
won't
get
decent
seats
they
hurried
into
three
chairs
right
in
front
of
the
teacher's
desk
took
out
their
copies
of
The
Dark
Forces
A
Guide
to
SelfProtection
and
waited
unusually
quiet
soon
they
heard
moody's
distinctive
clunking
footsteps
coming
down
the
corridor
and
he
entered
the
room
looking
as
strange
and
frightening
as
ever
they
could
just
see
his
clawed
wooden
foot
protruding
from
underneath
his
robes
you
can
put
those
away
he
growled
stumping
over
to
his
desk
and
sitting
down
those
books
you
won't
need
them
they
returned
the
books
to
their
bags
Ron
looking
excited
moody
took
out
a
register
shook
his
long
mane
of
grizzled
gray
hair
out
of
his
twisted
and
scarred
face
and
began
to
call
out
names
his
normal
eye
moving
steadily
down
the
list
while
his
magical
eye
swiveled
around
fixing
upon
each
student
as
he
or
she
answered
right
then
he
said
when
the
last
person
had
declared
themselves
present
i've
had
a
letter
from
Professor
Lupin
about
this
class
seems
you've
had
a
pretty
thorough
grounding
in
tackling
Dark
creatures
you've
covered
boggarts
Red
Caps
hinkypunks
grindylows
Kappas
and
werewolves
is
that
right
there
was
a
general
murmur
of
assent
but
you're
behind
very
behind
on
dealing
with
curses
said
Moody
so
i'm
here
to
bring
you
up
to
scratch
on
what
wizards
can
do
to
each
other
i've
got
one
year
to
teach
you
how
to
deal
with
Dark
what
aren't
you
staying
ron
blurted
out
moody's
magical
eye
spun
around
to
stare
at
Ron
Ron
looked
extremely
apprehensive
but
after
a
moment
Moody
smiled
the
first
time
Harry
had
seen
him
do
so
the
effect
was
to
make
his
heavily
scarred
face
look
more
twisted
and
contorted
than
ever
but
it
was
nevertheless
good
to
know
that
he
ever
did
anything
as
friendly
as
smile
ron
looked
deeply
relieved
you'll
be
Arthur
weasley's
son
eh
moody
said
your
father
got
me
out
of
a
very
tight
corner
a
few
days
ago
yeah
i'm
staying
just
the
one
year
special
favor
to
Dumbledore
one
year
and
then
back
to
my
quiet
retirement
he
gave
a
harsh
laugh
and
then
clapped
his
gnarled
hands
together
so
straight
into
it
curses
they
come
in
many
strengths
and
forms
now
according
to
the
Ministry
of
Magic
i'm
supposed
to
teach
you
countercurses
and
leave
it
at
that
i'm
not
supposed
to
show
you
what
illegal
Dark
curses
look
like
until
you're
in
the
sixth
year
you're
not
supposed
to
be
old
enough
to
deal
with
it
till
then
but
Professor
dumbledore's
got
a
higher
opinion
of
your
nerves
he
reckons
you
can
cope
and
I
say
the
sooner
you
know
what
you're
up
against
the
better
how
are
you
supposed
to
defend
yourself
against
something
you've
never
seen
a
wizard
who's
about
to
put
an
illegal
curse
on
you
isn't
going
to
tell
you
what
he's
about
to
do
he's
not
going
to
do
it
nice
and
polite
to
your
face
you
need
to
be
prepared
you
need
to
be
alert
and
watchful
you
need
to
put
that
away
Miss
Brown
when
i'm
talking
lavender
jumped
and
blushed
she
had
been
showing
Parvati
her
completed
horoscope
under
the
desk
apparently
moody's
magical
eye
could
see
through
solid
wood
as
well
as
out
of
the
back
of
his
head
so
do
any
of
you
know
which
curses
are
most
heavily
punished
by
wizarding
law
several
hands
rose
tentatively
into
the
air
including
ron's
and
hermione's
moody
pointed
at
Ron
though
his
magical
eye
was
still
fixed
on
Lavender
er
said
Ron
tentatively
my
dad
told
me
about
one
is
it
called
the
Imperius
Curse
or
something
ah
yes
said
Moody
appreciatively
your
father
would
know
that
one
gave
the
Ministry
a
lot
of
trouble
at
one
time
the
Imperius
Curse
moody
got
heavily
to
his
mismatched
feet
opened
his
desk
drawer
and
took
out
a
glass
jar
three
large
black
spiders
were
scuttling
around
inside
it
harry
felt
Ron
recoil
slightly
next
to
him
Ron
hated
spiders
moody
reached
into
the
jar
caught
one
of
the
spiders
and
held
it
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
so
that
they
could
all
see
it
he
then
pointed
his
wand
at
it
and
muttered
Imperio
the
spider
leapt
from
moody's
hand
on
a
fine
thread
of
silk
and
began
to
swing
backward
and
forward
as
though
on
a
trapeze
it
stretched
out
its
legs
rigidly
then
did
a
back
flip
breaking
the
thread
and
landing
on
the
desk
where
it
began
to
cartwheel
in
circles
moody
jerked
his
wand
and
the
spider
rose
onto
two
of
its
hind
legs
and
went
into
what
was
unmistakably
a
tap
dance
everyone
was
laughing
everyone
except
Moody
think
it's
funny
do
you
he
growled
you'd
like
it
would
you
if
I
did
it
to
you
the
laughter
died
away
almost
instantly
total
control
said
Moody
quietly
as
the
spider
balled
itself
up
and
began
to
roll
over
and
over
i
could
make
it
jump
out
of
the
window
drown
itself
throw
itself
down
one
of
your
throats
ron
gave
an
involuntary
shudder
years
back
there
were
a
lot
of
witches
and
wizards
being
controlled
by
the
Imperius
Curse
said
Moody
and
Harry
knew
he
was
talking
about
the
days
in
which
Voldemort
had
been
allpowerful
some
job
for
the
Ministry
trying
to
sort
out
who
was
being
forced
to
act
and
who
was
acting
of
their
own
free
will
the
Imperius
Curse
can
be
fought
and
i'll
be
teaching
you
how
but
it
takes
real
strength
of
character
and
not
everyone's
got
it
better
avoid
being
hit
with
it
if
you
can
constant
vigilance
he
barked
and
everyone
jumped
moody
picked
up
the
somersaulting
spider
and
threw
it
back
into
the
jar
anyone
else
know
one
another
illegal
curse
hermione's
hand
flew
into
the
air
again
and
so
to
harry's
slight
surprise
did
neville's
the
only
class
in
which
Neville
usually
volunteered
information
was
herbology
which
was
easily
his
best
subject
neville
looked
surprised
at
his
own
daring
yes
said
Moody
his
magical
eye
rolling
right
over
to
fix
on
Neville
there's
one
the
Cruciatus
Curse
said
Neville
in
a
small
but
distinct
voice
moody
was
looking
very
intently
at
Neville
this
time
with
both
eyes
your
name's
Longbottom
he
said
his
magical
eye
swooping
down
to
check
the
register
again
neville
nodded
nervously
but
Moody
made
no
further
inquiries
turning
back
to
the
class
at
large
he
reached
into
the
jar
for
the
next
spider
and
placed
it
upon
the
desktop
where
it
remained
motionless
apparently
too
scared
to
move
the
Cruciatus
Curse
said
Moody
needs
to
be
a
bit
bigger
for
you
to
get
the
idea
he
said
pointing
his
wand
at
the
spider
engorgio
the
spider
swelled
it
was
now
larger
than
a
tarantula
abandoning
all
pretense
Ron
pushed
his
chair
backward
as
far
away
from
moody's
desk
as
possible
moody
raised
his
wand
again
pointed
it
at
the
spider
and
muttered
Crucio
at
once
the
spider's
legs
bent
in
upon
its
body
it
rolled
over
and
began
to
twitch
horribly
rocking
from
side
to
side
no
sound
came
from
it
but
Harry
was
sure
that
if
it
could
have
given
voice
it
would
have
been
screaming
moody
did
not
remove
his
wand
and
the
spider
started
to
shudder
and
jerk
more
violently
Stop
it
hermione
said
shrilly
harry
looked
around
at
her
she
was
looking
not
at
the
spider
but
at
Neville
and
Harry
following
her
gaze
saw
that
neville's
hands
were
clenched
upon
the
desk
in
front
of
him
his
knuckles
white
his
eyes
wide
and
horrified
moody
raised
his
wand
the
spider's
legs
relaxed
but
it
continued
to
twitch
reducio
Moody
muttered
and
the
spider
shrank
back
to
its
proper
size
he
put
it
back
into
the
jar
pain
said
Moody
softly
you
don't
need
thumbscrews
or
knives
to
torture
someone
if
you
can
perform
the
Cruciatus
Curse
that
one
was
very
popular
once
too
right
anyone
know
any
others
harry
looked
around
from
the
looks
on
everyone's
faces
he
guessed
they
were
all
wondering
what
was
going
to
happen
to
the
last
spider
hermione's
hand
shook
slightly
as
for
the
third
time
she
raised
it
into
the
air
yes
said
Moody
looking
at
her
avada
Kedavra
Hermione
whispered
several
people
looked
uneasily
around
at
her
including
Ron
ah
said
Moody
another
slight
smile
twisting
his
lopsided
mouth
yes
the
last
and
worst
avada
Kedavra
the
Killing
Curse
he
put
his
hand
into
the
glass
jar
and
almost
as
though
it
knew
what
was
coming
the
third
spider
scuttled
frantically
around
the
bottom
of
the
jar
trying
to
evade
moody's
fingers
but
he
trapped
it
and
placed
it
upon
the
desktop
it
started
to
scuttle
frantically
across
the
wooden
surface
moody
raised
his
wand
and
Harry
felt
a
sudden
thrill
of
foreboding
avada
Kedavra
moody
roared
there
was
a
flash
of
blinding
green
light
and
a
rushing
sound
as
though
a
vast
invisible
something
was
soaring
through
the
air
instantaneously
the
spider
rolled
over
onto
its
back
unmarked
but
unmistakably
dead
several
of
the
students
stifled
cries
Ron
had
thrown
himself
backward
and
almost
toppled
off
his
seat
as
the
spider
skidded
toward
him
moody
swept
the
dead
spider
off
the
desk
onto
the
floor
not
nice
he
said
calmly
not
pleasant
and
there's
no
countercurse
there's
no
blocking
it
only
one
known
person
has
ever
survived
it
and
he's
sitting
right
in
front
of
me
harry
felt
his
face
redden
as
moody's
eyes
both
of
them
looked
into
his
own
he
could
feel
everyone
else
looking
around
at
him
too
harry
stared
at
the
blank
blackboard
as
though
fascinated
by
it
but
not
really
seeing
it
at
all
so
that
was
how
his
parents
had
died
exactly
like
that
spider
had
they
been
unblemished
and
unmarked
too
had
they
simply
seen
the
flash
of
green
light
and
heard
the
rush
of
speeding
death
before
life
was
wiped
from
their
bodies
harry
had
been
picturing
his
parents
deaths
over
and
over
again
for
three
years
now
ever
since
he'd
found
out
they
had
been
murdered
ever
since
he'd
found
out
what
had
happened
that
night
Wormtail
had
betrayed
his
parents
whereabouts
to
Voldemort
who
had
come
to
find
them
at
their
cottage
how
Voldemort
had
killed
harry's
father
first
how
James
Potter
had
tried
to
hold
him
off
while
he
shouted
at
his
wife
to
take
Harry
and
run
voldemort
had
advanced
on
Lily
Potter
told
her
to
move
aside
so
that
he
could
kill
Harry
how
she
had
begged
him
to
kill
her
instead
refused
to
stop
shielding
her
son
and
so
Voldemort
had
murdered
her
too
before
turning
his
wand
on
Harry
harry
knew
these
details
because
he
had
heard
his
parents
voices
when
he
had
fought
the
dementors
last
year
for
that
was
the
terrible
power
of
the
dementors
to
force
their
victims
to
relive
the
worst
memories
of
their
lives
and
drown
powerless
in
their
own
despair
moody
was
speaking
again
from
a
great
distance
it
seemed
to
Harry
with
a
massive
effort
he
pulled
himself
back
to
the
present
and
listened
to
what
Moody
was
saying
avada
kedavra's
a
curse
that
needs
a
powerful
bit
of
magic
behind
it
you
could
all
get
your
wands
out
now
and
point
them
at
me
and
say
the
words
and
I
doubt
i'd
get
so
much
as
a
nosebleed
but
that
doesn't
matter
i'm
not
here
to
teach
you
how
to
do
it
now
if
there's
no
countercurse
why
am
I
showing
you
because
you've
got
to
know
you've
got
to
appreciate
what
the
worst
is
you
don't
want
to
find
yourself
in
a
situation
where
you're
facing
it
constant
vigilance
he
roared
and
the
whole
class
jumped
again
now
those
three
curses
Avada
Kedavra
Imperius
and
Cruciatus
are
known
as
the
Unforgivable
Curses
the
use
of
any
one
of
them
on
a
fellow
human
being
is
enough
to
earn
a
life
sentence
in
Azkaban
that's
what
you're
up
against
that's
what
i've
got
to
teach
you
to
fight
you
need
preparing
you
need
arming
but
most
of
all
you
need
to
practice
constant
neverceasing
vigilance
get
out
your
quills
copy
this
down
they
spent
the
rest
of
the
lesson
taking
notes
on
each
of
the
Unforgivable
Curses
no
one
spoke
until
the
bell
rang
but
when
Moody
had
dismissed
them
and
they
had
left
the
classroom
a
torrent
of
talk
burst
forth
most
people
were
discussing
the
curses
in
awed
voices
Did
you
see
it
twitch
and
when
he
killed
it
just
like
that
they
were
talking
about
the
lesson
Harry
thought
as
though
it
had
been
some
sort
of
spectacular
show
but
he
hadn't
found
it
very
entertaining
and
nor
it
seemed
had
Hermione
hurry
up
she
said
tensely
to
Harry
and
Ron
not
the
ruddy
library
again
said
Ron
no
said
Hermione
curtly
pointing
up
a
side
passage
neville
neville
was
standing
alone
halfway
up
the
passage
staring
at
the
stone
wall
opposite
him
with
the
same
horrified
wideeyed
look
he
had
worn
when
Moody
had
demonstrated
the
Cruciatus
Curse
neville
hermione
said
gently
neville
looked
around
oh
hello
he
said
his
voice
much
higher
than
usual
interesting
lesson
wasn't
it
i
wonder
what's
for
dinner
i'm
i'm
starving
aren't
you
neville
are
you
all
right
said
Hermione
oh
yes
i'm
fine
Neville
gabbled
in
the
same
unnaturally
high
voice
very
interesting
dinner
I
mean
lesson
what's
for
eating
ron
gave
Harry
a
startled
look
neville
what
but
an
odd
clunking
noise
sounded
behind
them
and
they
turned
to
see
Professor
Moody
limping
toward
them
all
four
of
them
fell
silent
watching
him
apprehensively
but
when
he
spoke
it
was
in
a
much
lower
and
gentler
growl
than
they
had
yet
heard
it's
all
right
sonny
he
said
to
Neville
why
don't
you
come
up
to
my
office
come
on
we
can
have
a
cup
of
tea
neville
looked
even
more
frightened
at
the
prospect
of
tea
with
Moody
he
neither
moved
nor
spoke
moody
turned
his
magical
eye
upon
Harry
you
all
right
are
you
Potter
yes
said
Harry
almost
defiantly
moody's
blue
eye
quivered
slightly
in
its
socket
as
it
surveyed
Harry
then
he
said
you've
got
to
know
it
seems
harsh
maybe
but
you've
got
to
know
no
point
pretending
well
come
on
Longbottom
i've
got
some
books
that
might
interest
you
neville
looked
pleadingly
at
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
but
they
didn't
say
anything
so
Neville
had
no
choice
but
to
allow
himself
to
be
steered
away
one
of
moody's
gnarled
hands
on
his
shoulder
what
was
that
about
said
Ron
watching
Neville
and
Moody
turn
the
corner
i
don't
know
said
Hermione
looking
pensive
some
lesson
though
eh
said
Ron
to
Harry
as
they
set
off
for
the
Great
Hall
fred
and
George
were
right
weren't
they
he
really
knows
his
stuff
Moody
doesn't
he
when
he
did
Avada
Kedavra
the
way
that
spider
just
died
just
snuffed
it
right
but
Ron
fell
suddenly
silent
at
the
look
on
harry's
face
and
didn't
speak
again
until
they
reached
the
Great
Hall
when
he
said
he
supposed
they
had
better
make
a
start
on
Professor
trelawney's
predictions
tonight
since
they
would
take
hours
hermione
did
not
join
in
with
Harry
and
ron's
conversation
during
dinner
but
ate
furiously
fast
and
then
left
for
the
library
again
harry
and
Ron
walked
back
to
Gryffindor
Tower
and
Harry
who
had
been
thinking
of
nothing
else
all
through
dinner
now
raised
the
subject
of
the
Unforgivable
Curses
himself
wouldn't
Moody
and
Dumbledore
be
in
trouble
with
the
Ministry
if
they
knew
we'd
seen
the
curses
harry
asked
as
they
approached
the
Fat
Lady
yeah
probably
said
Ron
but
dumbledore's
always
done
things
his
way
hasn't
he
and
moody's
been
getting
in
trouble
for
years
I
reckon
attacks
first
and
asks
questions
later
look
at
his
dustbins
balderdash
the
Fat
Lady
swung
forward
to
reveal
the
entrance
hole
and
they
climbed
into
the
Gryffindor
common
room
which
was
crowded
and
noisy
shall
we
get
our
Divination
stuff
then
said
Harry
i
s'pose
Ron
groaned
they
went
up
to
the
dormitory
to
fetch
their
books
and
charts
to
find
Neville
there
alone
sitting
on
his
bed
reading
he
looked
a
good
deal
calmer
than
at
the
end
of
moody's
lesson
though
still
not
entirely
normal
his
eyes
were
rather
red
you
all
right
Neville
harry
asked
him
oh
yes
said
Neville
i'm
fine
thanks
just
reading
this
book
Professor
Moody
lent
me
he
held
up
the
book
Magical
Water
Plants
of
the
Mediterranean
apparently
Professor
Sprout
told
Professor
Moody
i'm
really
good
at
Herbology
Neville
said
there
was
a
faint
note
of
pride
in
his
voice
that
Harry
had
rarely
heard
there
before
he
thought
i'd
like
this
telling
Neville
what
Professor
Sprout
had
said
Harry
thought
had
been
a
very
tactful
way
of
cheering
Neville
up
for
Neville
very
rarely
heard
that
he
was
good
at
anything
it
was
the
sort
of
thing
Professor
Lupin
would
have
done
harry
and
Ron
took
their
copies
of
Unfogging
the
Future
back
down
to
the
common
room
found
a
table
and
set
to
work
on
their
predictions
for
the
coming
month
an
hour
later
they
had
made
very
little
progress
though
their
table
was
littered
with
bits
of
parchment
bearing
sums
and
symbols
and
harry's
brain
was
as
fogged
as
though
it
had
been
filled
with
the
fumes
from
Professor
trelawney's
fire
i
haven't
got
a
clue
what
this
lot's
supposed
to
mean
he
said
staring
down
at
a
long
list
of
calculations
you
know
said
Ron
whose
hair
was
on
end
because
of
all
the
times
he
had
run
his
fingers
through
it
in
frustration
I
think
it's
back
to
the
old
Divination
standby
what
make
it
up
yeah
said
Ron
sweeping
the
jumble
of
scrawled
notes
off
the
table
dipping
his
pen
into
some
ink
and
starting
to
write
next
Monday
he
said
as
he
scribbled
I
am
likely
to
develop
a
cough
owing
to
the
unlucky
conjunction
of
Mars
and
Jupiter
he
looked
up
at
Harry
you
know
her
just
put
in
loads
of
misery
she'll
lap
it
up
right
said
Harry
crumpling
up
his
first
attempt
and
lobbing
it
over
the
heads
of
a
group
of
chattering
first
years
into
the
fire
okay
on
Monday
I
will
be
in
danger
of
er
burns
yeah
you
will
be
said
Ron
darkly
we're
seeing
the
skrewts
again
on
Monday
okay
Tuesday
i'll
erm
lose
a
treasured
possession
said
Harry
who
was
flicking
through
Unfogging
the
Future
for
ideas
good
one
said
Ron
copying
it
down
because
of
erm
mercury
why
don't
you
get
stabbed
in
the
back
by
someone
you
thought
was
a
friend
yeah
cool
said
Harry
scribbling
it
down
because
venus
is
in
the
twelfth
house
and
on
Wednesday
I
think
i'll
come
off
worst
in
a
fight
aaah
I
was
going
to
have
a
fight
okay
i'll
lose
a
bet
yeah
you'll
be
betting
i'll
win
my
fight
they
continued
to
make
up
predictions
which
grew
steadily
more
tragic
for
another
hour
while
the
common
room
around
them
slowly
emptied
as
people
went
up
to
bed
crookshanks
wandered
over
to
them
leapt
lightly
into
an
empty
chair
and
stared
inscrutably
at
Harry
rather
as
Hermione
might
look
if
she
knew
they
weren't
doing
their
homework
properly
staring
around
the
room
trying
to
think
of
a
kind
of
misfortune
he
hadn't
yet
used
Harry
saw
Fred
and
George
sitting
together
against
the
opposite
wall
heads
together
quills
out
poring
over
a
single
piece
of
parchment
it
was
most
unusual
to
see
Fred
and
George
hidden
away
in
a
corner
and
working
silently
they
usually
liked
to
be
in
the
thick
of
things
and
the
noisy
center
of
attention
there
was
something
secretive
about
the
way
they
were
working
on
the
piece
of
parchment
and
Harry
was
reminded
of
how
they
had
sat
together
writing
something
back
at
the
Burrow
he
had
thought
then
that
it
was
another
order
form
for
Weasleys
Wizard
Wheezes
but
it
didn't
look
like
that
this
time
if
it
had
been
they
would
surely
have
let
Lee
Jordan
in
on
the
joke
he
wondered
whether
it
had
anything
to
do
with
entering
the
Triwizard
Tournament
as
Harry
watched
George
shook
his
head
at
Fred
scratched
out
something
with
his
quill
and
said
in
a
very
quiet
voice
that
nevertheless
carried
across
the
almost
deserted
room
No
that
sounds
like
we're
accusing
him
got
to
be
careful
then
George
looked
over
and
saw
Harry
watching
him
harry
grinned
and
quickly
returned
to
his
predictions
he
didn't
want
George
to
think
he
was
eavesdropping
shortly
after
that
the
twins
rolled
up
their
parchment
said
good
night
and
went
off
to
bed
fred
and
George
had
been
gone
ten
minutes
or
so
when
the
portrait
hole
opened
and
Hermione
climbed
into
the
common
room
carrying
a
sheaf
of
parchment
in
one
hand
and
a
box
whose
contents
rattled
as
she
walked
in
the
other
crookshanks
arched
his
back
purring
hello
she
said
i've
just
finished
so
have
I
said
Ron
triumphantly
throwing
down
his
quill
hermione
sat
down
laid
the
things
she
was
carrying
in
an
empty
armchair
and
pulled
ron's
predictions
toward
her
not
going
to
have
a
very
good
month
are
you
she
said
sardonically
as
Crookshanks
curled
up
in
her
lap
ah
well
at
least
i'm
forewarned
Ron
yawned
you
seem
to
be
drowning
twice
said
Hermione
oh
am
I
said
Ron
peering
down
at
his
predictions
i'd
better
change
one
of
them
to
getting
trampled
by
a
rampaging
hippogriff
don't
you
think
it's
a
bit
obvious
you've
made
these
up
said
Hermione
how
dare
you
said
Ron
in
mock
outrage
we've
been
working
like
house
elves
here
hermione
raised
her
eyebrows
it's
just
an
expression
said
Ron
hastily
harry
laid
down
his
quill
too
having
just
finished
predicting
his
own
death
by
decapitation
what's
in
the
box
he
asked
pointing
at
it
funny
you
should
ask
said
Hermione
with
a
nasty
look
at
Ron
she
took
off
the
lid
and
showed
them
the
contents
inside
were
about
fifty
badges
all
of
different
colors
but
all
bearing
the
same
letters
S
spew
said
Harry
picking
up
a
badge
and
looking
at
it
what's
this
about
not
spew
said
Hermione
impatiently
it's
spew
stands
for
the
Society
for
the
Promotion
of
Elfish
Welfare
never
heard
of
it
said
Ron
well
of
course
you
haven't
said
Hermione
briskly
i've
only
just
started
it
yeah
said
Ron
in
mild
surprise
how
many
members
have
you
got
well
if
you
two
join
three
said
Hermione
and
you
think
we
want
to
walk
around
wearing
badges
saying
spew
do
you
said
Ron
spew
said
Hermione
hotly
i
was
going
to
put
Stop
the
Outrageous
Abuse
of
Our
Fellow
Magical
Creatures
and
Campaign
for
a
Change
in
Their
Legal
Status
but
it
wouldn't
fit
so
that's
the
heading
of
our
manifesto
she
brandished
the
sheaf
of
parchment
at
them
i've
been
researching
it
thoroughly
in
the
library
elf
enslavement
goes
back
centuries
i
can't
believe
no
one's
done
anything
about
it
before
now
hermione
open
your
ears
said
Ron
loudly
they
like
it.
They
like
being
enslaved
our
shortterm
aims
said
Hermione
speaking
even
more
loudly
than
Ron
and
acting
as
though
she
hadn't
heard
a
word
are
to
secure
houseelves
fair
wages
and
working
conditions
our
longterm
aims
include
changing
the
law
about
non
wand
use
and
trying
to
get
an
elf
into
the
Department
for
the
Regulation
and
Control
of
Magical
Creatures
because
they're
shockingly
underrepresented
and
how
do
we
do
all
this
harry
asked
we
start
by
recruiting
members
said
Hermione
happily
i
thought
two
Sickles
to
join
that
buys
a
badge
and
the
proceeds
can
fund
our
leaflet
campaign
you're
treasurer
Ron
i've
got
you
a
collecting
tin
upstairs
and
Harry
you're
secretary
so
you
might
want
to
write
down
everything
i'm
saying
now
as
a
record
of
our
first
meeting
there
was
a
pause
in
which
Hermione
beamed
at
the
pair
of
them
and
Harry
sat
torn
between
exasperation
at
Hermione
and
amusement
at
the
look
on
ron's
face
the
silence
was
broken
not
by
Ron
who
in
any
case
looked
as
though
he
was
temporarily
dumbstruck
but
by
a
soft
tap
tap
on
the
window
harry
looked
across
the
now
empty
common
room
and
saw
illuminated
by
the
moonlight
a
snowy
owl
perched
on
the
windowsill
hedwig
he
shouted
and
he
launched
himself
out
of
his
chair
and
across
the
room
to
pull
open
the
window
hedwig
flew
inside
soared
across
the
room
and
landed
on
the
table
on
top
of
harry's
predictions
about
time
said
Harry
hurrying
after
her
she's
got
an
answer
said
Ron
excitedly
pointing
at
the
grubby
piece
of
parchment
tied
to
hedwig's
leg
harry
hastily
untied
it
and
sat
down
to
read
whereupon
Hedwig
fluttered
onto
his
knee
hooting
softly
what
does
it
say
hermione
asked
breathlessly
the
letter
was
very
short
and
looked
as
though
it
had
been
scrawled
in
a
great
hurry
harry
read
it
aloud
Harry
i'm
flying
north
immediately
this
news
about
your
scar
is
the
latest
in
a
series
of
strange
rumors
that
have
reached
me
here
if
it
hurts
again
go
straight
to
Dumbledore
they're
saying
he's
got
MadEye
out
of
retirement
which
means
he's
reading
the
signs
even
if
no
one
else
is
i'll
be
in
touch
soon
my
best
to
Ron
and
Hermione
keep
your
eyes
open
Harry
sirius
Harry
looked
up
at
Ron
and
Hermione
who
stared
back
at
him
he's
flying
north
hermione
whispered
he's
coming
back
dumbledore's
reading
what
signs
said
Ron
looking
perplexed
harry
what's
up
for
Harry
had
just
hit
himself
in
the
forehead
with
his
fist
jolting
Hedwig
out
of
his
lap
i
shouldn't've
told
him
harry
said
furiously
what
are
you
on
about
said
Ron
in
surprise
it's
made
him
think
he's
got
to
come
back
said
Harry
now
slamming
his
fist
on
the
table
so
that
Hedwig
landed
on
the
back
of
ron's
chair
hooting
indignantly
coming
back
because
he
thinks
i'm
in
trouble
and
there's
nothing
wrong
with
me
and
I
haven't
got
anything
for
you
Harry
snapped
at
Hedwig
who
was
clicking
her
beak
expectantly
you'll
have
to
go
up
to
the
Owlery
if
you
want
food
hedwig
gave
him
an
extremely
offended
look
and
took
off
for
the
open
window
cuffing
him
around
the
head
with
her
outstretched
wing
as
she
went
harry
Hermione
began
in
a
pacifying
sort
of
voice
i'm
going
to
bed
said
Harry
shortly
see
you
in
the
morning
upstairs
in
the
dormitory
he
pulled
on
his
pajamas
and
got
into
his
fourposter
but
he
didn't
feel
remotely
tired
if
Sirius
came
back
and
got
caught
it
would
be
his
harry's
fault
why
hadn't
he
kept
his
mouth
shut
a
few
seconds
pain
and
he'd
had
to
blab
if
he'd
just
had
the
sense
to
keep
it
to
himself
he
heard
Ron
come
up
into
the
dormitory
a
short
while
later
but
did
not
speak
to
him
for
a
long
time
Harry
lay
staring
up
at
the
dark
canopy
of
his
bed
the
dormitory
was
completely
silent
and
had
he
been
less
preoccupied
Harry
would
have
realized
that
the
absence
of
neville's
usual
snores
meant
that
he
was
not
the
only
one
lying
awake
chapter
fifteen
beauxbatons
and
durmstrang
early
next
morning
Harry
woke
with
a
plan
fully
formed
in
his
mind
as
though
his
sleeping
brain
had
been
working
on
it
all
night
he
got
up
dressed
in
the
pale
dawn
light
left
the
dormitory
without
waking
Ron
and
went
back
down
to
the
deserted
common
room
here
he
took
a
piece
of
parchment
from
the
table
upon
which
his
Divination
homework
still
lay
and
wrote
the
following
letter
Dear
Sirius
I
reckon
I
just
imagined
my
scar
hurting
I
was
half
asleep
when
I
wrote
to
you
last
time
there's
no
point
coming
back
everything's
fine
here
don't
worry
about
me
my
head
feels
completely
normal
harry
He
then
climbed
out
of
the
portrait
hole
up
through
the
silent
castle
held
up
only
briefly
by
Peeves
who
tried
to
overturn
a
large
vase
on
him
halfway
along
the
fourthfloor
corridor
finally
arriving
at
the
Owlery
which
was
situated
at
the
top
of
West
Tower
the
Owlery
was
a
circular
stone
room
rather
cold
and
drafty
because
none
of
the
windows
had
glass
in
them
the
floor
was
entirely
covered
in
straw
owl
droppings
and
the
regurgitated
skeletons
of
mice
and
voles
hundreds
upon
hundreds
of
owls
of
every
breed
imaginable
were
nestled
here
on
perches
that
rose
right
up
to
the
top
of
the
tower
nearly
all
of
them
asleep
though
here
and
there
a
round
amber
eye
glared
at
Harry
he
spotted
Hedwig
nestled
between
a
barn
owl
and
a
tawny
and
hurried
over
to
her
sliding
a
little
on
the
droppingstrewn
floor
it
took
him
a
while
to
persuade
her
to
wake
up
and
then
to
look
at
him
as
she
kept
shuffling
around
on
her
perch
showing
him
her
tail
she
was
evidently
still
furious
about
his
lack
of
gratitude
the
previous
night
in
the
end
it
was
Harry
suggesting
she
might
be
too
tired
and
that
perhaps
he
would
ask
Ron
to
borrow
Pigwidgeon
that
made
her
stick
out
her
leg
and
allow
him
to
tie
the
letter
to
it
just
find
him
all
right
harry
said
stroking
her
back
as
he
carried
her
on
his
arm
to
one
of
the
holes
in
the
wall
before
the
dementors
do
she
nipped
his
finger
perhaps
rather
harder
than
she
would
ordinarily
have
done
but
hooted
softly
in
a
reassuring
sort
of
way
all
the
same
then
she
spread
her
wings
and
took
off
into
the
sunrise
harry
watched
her
fly
out
of
sight
with
the
familiar
feeling
of
unease
back
in
his
stomach
he
had
been
so
sure
that
sirius's
reply
would
alleviate
his
worries
rather
than
increasing
them
that
was
a
lie
Harry
said
Hermione
sharply
over
breakfast
when
he
told
her
and
Ron
what
he
had
done
you
didn't
imagine
your
scar
hurting
and
you
know
it
so
what
said
Harry
he's
not
going
back
to
Azkaban
because
of
me
drop
it
said
Ron
sharply
to
Hermione
as
she
opened
her
mouth
to
argue
some
more
and
for
once
Hermione
heeded
him
and
fell
silent
harry
did
his
best
not
to
worry
about
Sirius
over
the
next
couple
of
weeks
true
he
could
not
stop
himself
from
looking
anxiously
around
every
morning
when
the
post
owls
arrived
nor
late
at
night
before
he
went
to
sleep
prevent
himself
from
seeing
horrible
visions
of
Sirius
cornered
by
dementors
down
some
dark
London
street
but
betweentimes
he
tried
to
keep
his
mind
off
his
godfather
he
wished
he
still
had
Quidditch
to
distract
him
nothing
worked
so
well
on
a
troubled
mind
as
a
good
hard
training
session
on
the
other
hand
their
lessons
were
becoming
more
difficult
and
demanding
than
ever
before
particularly
moody's
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
to
their
surprise
Professor
Moody
had
announced
that
he
would
be
putting
the
Imperius
Curse
on
each
of
them
in
turn
to
demonstrate
its
power
and
to
see
whether
they
could
resist
its
effects
but
but
you
said
it's
illegal
Professor
said
Hermione
uncertainly
as
Moody
cleared
away
the
desks
with
a
sweep
of
his
wand
leaving
a
large
clear
space
in
the
middle
of
the
room
you
said
to
use
it
against
another
human
was
dumbledore
wants
you
taught
what
it
feels
like
said
Moody
his
magical
eye
swiveling
onto
Hermione
and
fixing
her
with
an
eerie
unblinking
stare
if
you'd
rather
learn
the
hard
way
when
someone's
putting
it
on
you
so
they
can
control
you
completely
fine
by
me
you're
excused
off
you
go
he
pointed
one
gnarled
finger
toward
the
door
hermione
went
very
pink
and
muttered
something
about
not
meaning
that
she
wanted
to
leave
harry
and
Ron
grinned
at
each
other
they
knew
Hermione
would
rather
eat
bubotuber
pus
than
miss
such
an
important
lesson
moody
began
to
beckon
students
forward
in
turn
and
put
the
Imperius
Curse
upon
them
harry
watched
as
one
by
one
his
classmates
did
the
most
extraordinary
things
under
its
influence
dean
Thomas
hopped
three
times
around
the
room
singing
the
national
anthem
lavender
Brown
imitated
a
squirrel
neville
performed
a
series
of
quite
astonishing
gymnastics
he
would
certainly
not
have
been
capable
of
in
his
normal
state
not
one
of
them
seemed
to
be
able
to
fight
off
the
curse
and
each
of
them
recovered
only
when
Moody
had
removed
it
potter
Moody
growled
you
next
harry
moved
forward
into
the
middle
of
the
classroom
into
the
space
that
Moody
had
cleared
of
desks
moody
raised
his
wand
pointed
it
at
Harry
and
said
mperio
it
was
the
most
wonderful
feeling
harry
felt
a
floating
sensation
as
every
thought
and
worry
in
his
head
was
wiped
gently
away
leaving
nothing
but
a
vague
untraceable
happiness
he
stood
there
feeling
immensely
relaxed
only
dimly
aware
of
everyone
watching
him
and
then
he
heard
MadEye
moody's
voice
echoing
in
some
distant
chamber
of
his
empty
brain
Jump
onto
the
desk
jump
onto
the
desk
harry
bent
his
knees
obediently
preparing
to
spring
jump
onto
the
desk
why
though
another
voice
had
awoken
in
the
back
of
his
brain
stupid
thing
to
do
really
said
the
voice
jump
onto
the
desk
no
I
don't
think
I
will
thanks
said
the
other
voice
a
little
more
firmly
no
I
don't
really
want
to
jump
now
the
next
thing
Harry
felt
was
considerable
pain
he
had
both
jumped
and
tried
to
prevent
himself
from
jumping
the
result
was
that
he'd
smashed
headlong
into
the
desk
knocking
it
over
and
by
the
feeling
in
his
legs
fractured
both
his
kneecaps
now
that's
more
like
it
growled
moody's
voice
and
suddenly
Harry
felt
the
empty
echoing
feeling
in
his
head
disappear
he
remembered
exactly
what
was
happening
and
the
pain
in
his
knees
seemed
to
double
look
at
that
you
lot
potter
fought
he
fought
it
and
he
damn
near
beat
it
we'll
try
that
again
Potter
and
the
rest
of
you
pay
attention
watch
his
eyes
that's
where
you
see
it
very
good
Potter
very
good
indeed
they'll
have
trouble
controlling
you
the
way
he
talks
Harry
muttered
as
he
hobbled
out
of
the
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
class
an
hour
later
Moody
had
insisted
on
putting
Harry
through
his
paces
four
times
in
a
row
until
Harry
could
throw
off
the
curse
entirely
you'd
think
we
were
all
going
to
be
attacked
any
second
yeah
I
know
said
Ron
who
was
skipping
on
every
alternate
step
he
had
had
much
more
difficulty
with
the
curse
than
Harry
though
Moody
assured
him
the
effects
would
wear
off
by
lunchtime
talk
about
paranoid
ron
glanced
nervously
over
his
shoulder
to
check
that
Moody
was
definitely
out
of
earshot
and
went
on
no
wonder
they
were
glad
to
get
shot
of
him
at
the
Ministry
did
you
hear
him
telling
Seamus
what
he
did
to
that
witch
who
shouted
Boo
behind
him
on
April
Fools
Day
and
when
are
we
supposed
to
read
up
on
resisting
the
Imperius
Curse
with
everything
else
we've
got
to
do
all
the
fourth
years
had
noticed
a
definite
increase
in
the
amount
of
work
they
were
required
to
do
this
term
professor
McGonagall
explained
why
when
the
class
gave
a
particularly
loud
groan
at
the
amount
of
Transfiguration
homework
she
had
assigned
you
are
now
entering
a
most
important
phase
of
your
magical
education
she
told
them
her
eyes
glinting
dangerously
behind
her
square
spectacles
your
Ordinary
Wizarding
Levels
are
drawing
closer
we
don't
take
O
w.l.s
till
fifth
year
s
aid
Dean
Thomas
indignantly
maybe
not
Thomas
but
believe
me
you
need
all
the
preparation
you
can
get
miss
Granger
remains
the
only
person
in
this
class
who
has
managed
to
turn
a
hedgehog
into
a
satisfactory
pincushion
i
might
remind
you
that
your
pincushion
Thomas
still
curls
up
in
fright
if
anyone
approaches
it
with
a
pin
hermione
who
had
turned
rather
pink
again
seemed
to
be
trying
not
to
look
too
pleased
with
herself
harry
and
Ron
were
deeply
amused
when
Professor
Trelawney
told
them
that
they
had
received
top
marks
for
their
homework
in
their
next
Divination
class
she
read
out
large
portions
of
their
predictions
commending
them
for
their
unflinching
acceptance
of
the
horrors
in
store
for
them
but
they
were
less
amused
when
she
asked
them
to
do
the
same
thing
for
the
month
after
next
both
of
them
were
running
out
of
ideas
for
catastrophes
meanwhile
Professor
Binns
the
ghost
who
taught
History
of
Magic
had
them
writing
weekly
essays
on
the
goblin
rebellions
of
the
eighteenth
century
professor
Snape
was
forcing
them
to
research
antidotes
they
took
this
one
seriously
as
he
had
hinted
that
he
might
be
poisoning
one
of
them
before
Christmas
to
see
if
their
antidote
worked
professor
Flitwick
had
asked
them
to
read
three
extra
books
in
preparation
for
their
lesson
on
Summoning
Charms
even
Hagrid
was
adding
to
their
workload
the
BlastEnded
Skrewts
were
growing
at
a
remarkable
pace
given
that
nobody
had
yet
discovered
what
they
ate
hagrid
was
delighted
and
as
part
of
their
project
suggested
that
they
come
down
to
his
hut
on
alternate
evenings
to
observe
the
skrewts
and
make
notes
on
their
extraordinary
behavior
i
will
not
said
Draco
Malfoy
flatly
when
Hagrid
had
proposed
this
with
the
air
of
Father
Christmas
pulling
an
extralarge
toy
out
of
his
sack
i
see
enough
of
these
foul
things
during
lessons
thanks
hagrid's
smile
faded
off
his
face
yeh'll
do
wha
yer
told
he
growled
or
i'll
be
takin
a
leaf
outta
Professor
moody's
book
i

yeh
made
a
good
ferret
Malfoy
the
Gryffindors
roared
with
laughter
malfoy
flushed
with
anger
but
apparently
the
memory
of
moody's
punishment
was
still
sufficiently
painful
to
stop
him
from
retorting
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
returned
to
the
castle
at
the
end
of
the
lesson
in
high
spirits
seeing
Hagrid
put
down
Malfoy
was
particularly
satisfying
especially
because
Malfoy
had
done
his
very
best
to
get
Hagrid
sacked
the
previous
year
when
they
arrived
in
the
entrance
hall
they
found
themselves
unable
to
proceed
owing
to
the
large
crowd
of
students
congregated
there
all
milling
around
a
large
sign
that
had
been
erected
at
the
foot
of
the
marble
staircase
ron
the
tallest
of
the
three
stood
on
tiptoe
to
see
over
the
heads
in
front
of
them
and
read
the
sign
aloud
to
the
other
two
triwizard
tournament
the
delegations
from
beauxbatons
and
durmstrang
will
be
arriving
at
o'clock
on
friday
the
th
of
october
lessons
will
end
half
an
hour
early
Brilliant
said
Harry
it's
Potions
last
thing
on
Friday
snape
won't
have
time
to
poison
us
all
students
will
return
their
bags
and
books
to
their
dormitories
and
assemble
in
front
of
the
castle
to
greet
our
guests
before
the
welcoming
feast
only
a
week
away
said
Ernie
Macmillan
of
Hufflepuff
emerging
from
the
crowd
his
eyes
gleaming
i
wonder
if
Cedric
knows
think
i'll
go
and
tell
him
cedric
said
Ron
blankly
as
Ernie
hurried
off
diggory
said
Harry
he
must
be
entering
the
tournament
that
idiot
Hogwarts
champion
said
Ron
as
they
pushed
their
way
through
the
chattering
crowd
toward
the
staircase
he's
not
an
idiot
you
just
don't
like
him
because
he
beat
Gryffindor
at
Quidditch
said
Hermione
i've
heard
he's
a
really
good
student
and
he's
a
prefect
she
spoke
as
though
this
settled
the
matter
you
only
like
him
because
he's
handsome
said
Ron
scathingly
excuse
me
I
don't
like
people
just
because
they're
handsome
said
Hermione
indignantly
ron
gave
a
loud
false
cough
which
sounded
oddly
like
Lockhart
the
appearance
of
the
sign
in
the
entrance
hall
had
a
marked
effect
upon
the
inhabitants
of
the
castle
during
the
following
week
there
seemed
to
be
only
one
topic
of
conversation
no
matter
where
Harry
went
the
Triwizard
Tournament
rumors
were
flying
from
student
to
student
like
highly
contagious
germs
who
was
going
to
try
for
Hogwarts
champion
what
the
tournament
would
involve
how
the
students
from
Beauxbatons
and
Durmstrang
differed
from
themselves
harry
noticed
too
that
the
castle
seemed
to
be
undergoing
an
extrathorough
cleaning
several
grimy
portraits
had
been
scrubbed
much
to
the
displeasure
of
their
subjects
who
sat
huddled
in
their
frames
muttering
darkly
and
wincing
as
they
felt
their
raw
pink
faces
the
suits
of
armor
were
suddenly
gleaming
and
moving
without
squeaking
and
Argus
Filch
the
caretaker
was
behaving
so
ferociously
to
any
students
who
forgot
to
wipe
their
shoes
that
he
terrified
a
pair
of
firstyear
girls
into
hysterics
other
members
of
the
staff
seemed
oddly
tense
too
longbottom
kindly
do
not
reveal
that
you
can't
even
perform
a
simple
Switching
Spell
in
front
of
anyone
from
Durmstrang
professor
McGonagall
barked
at
the
end
of
one
particularly
difficult
lesson
during
which
Neville
had
accidentally
transplanted
his
own
ears
onto
a
cactus
when
they
went
down
to
breakfast
on
the
morning
of
the
thirtieth
of
October
they
found
that
the
Great
Hall
had
been
decorated
overnight
enormous
silk
banners
hung
from
the
walls
each
of
them
representing
a
Hogwarts
House
red
with
a
gold
lion
for
Gryffiindor
blue
with
a
bronze
eagle
for
Ravenclaw
yellow
with
a
black
badger
for
Hufflepuff
and
green
with
a
silver
serpent
for
Slytherin
behind
the
teachers
table
the
largest
banner
of
all
bore
the
Hogwarts
coat
of
arms
lion
eagle
badger
and
snake
united
around
a
large
letter
H
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
sat
down
beside
Fred
and
George
at
the
Gryffindor
table
once
again
and
most
unusually
they
were
sitting
apart
from
everyone
else
and
conversing
in
low
voices
ron
led
the
way
over
to
them
it's
a
bummer
all
right
George
was
saying
gloomily
to
Fred
but
if
he
won't
talk
to
us
in
person
we'll
have
to
send
him
the
letter
after
all
or
we'll
stuff
it
into
his
hand
he
can't
avoid
us
forrever
who's
avoiding
you
said
Ron
sitting
down
next
to
them
wish
you
would
said
Fred
looking
irritated
at
the
interruption
what's
a
bummer
ron
asked
George
having
a
nosy
git
like
you
for
a
brother
said
George
you
two
got
any
ideas
on
the
Triwizard
Tournament
yet
harry
asked
thought
any
more
about
trying
to
enter
i
asked
McGonagall
how
the
champions
are
chosen
but
she
wasn't
telling
said
George
bitterly
she
just
told
me
to
shut
up
and
get
on
with
transfiguring
my
raccoon
wonder
what
the
tasks
are
going
to
be
said
Ron
thoughtfully
you
know
I
bet
we
could
do
them
Harry
we've
done
dangerous
stuff
before
not
in
front
of
a
panel
of
judges
you
haven't
said
Fred
mcGonagall
says
the
champions
get
awarded
points
according
to
how
well
they've
done
the
tasks
who
are
the
judges
harry
asked
well
the
Heads
of
the
participating
schools
are
always
on
the
panel
said
Hermione
and
everyone
looked
around
at
her
rather
surprised
because
all
three
of
them
were
injured
during
the
Tournament
of
when
a
cockatrice
the
champions
were
supposed
to
be
catching
went
on
the
rampage
she
noticed
them
all
looking
at
her
and
said
with
her
usual
air
of
impatience
that
nobody
else
had
read
all
the
books
she
had
it's
all
in
Hogwarts
A
History
though
of
course
that
book's
not
entirely
reliable
a
Revised
History
of
Hogwarts
would
be
a
more
accurate
title
or
A
Highly
Biased
and
Selective
History
of
Hogwarts
Which
Glosses
Over
the
Nastier
Aspects
of
the
School
what
are
you
on
about
said
Ron
though
Harry
thought
he
knew
what
was
coming
houseelves
said
Hermione
her
eyes
flashing
not
once
in
over
a
thousand
pages
does
Hogwarts
A
History
mention
that
we
are
all
colluding
in
the
oppression
of
a
hundred
slaves
harry
shook
his
head
and
applied
himself
to
his
scrambled
eggs
his
and
ron's
lack
of
enthusiasm
had
done
nothing
whatsoever
to
curb
hermione's
determination
to
pursue
justice
for
houseelves
true
both
of
them
had
paid
two
Sickles
for
a
S
p.e.w.
badge
but
they
had
only
done
it
to
keep
her
quiet
their
Sickles
had
been
wasted
however
if
anything
they
seemed
to
have
made
Hermione
more
vociferous
she
had
been
badgering
Harry
and
Ron
ever
since
first
to
wear
the
badges
then
to
persuade
others
to
do
the
same
and
she
had
also
taken
to
rattling
around
the
Gryffindor
common
room
every
evening
cornering
people
and
shaking
the
collecting
tin
under
their
noses
you
do
realize
that
your
sheets
are
changed
your
fires
lit
your
classrooms
cleaned
and
your
food
cooked
by
a
group
of
magical
creatures
who
are
unpaid
and
enslaved
she
kept
saying
fiercely
some
people
like
Neville
had
paid
up
just
to
stop
Hermione
from
glowering
at
them
a
few
seemed
mildly
interested
in
what
she
had
to
say
but
were
reluctant
to
take
a
more
active
role
in
campaigning
many
regarded
the
whole
thing
as
a
joke
ron
now
rolled
his
eyes
at
the
ceiling
which
was
flooding
them
all
in
autumn
sunlight
and
Fred
became
extremely
interested
in
his
bacon
both
twins
had
refused
to
buy
a
S
p.e.w.
badge
george
however
leaned
in
toward
Hermione
listen
have
you
ever
been
down
in
the
kitchens
Hermione
no
of
course
not
said
Hermione
curtly
I
hardly
think
students
are
supposed
to
well
we
have
said
George
indicating
Fred
loads
of
times
to
nick
food
and
we've
met
them
and
they're
happy
they
think
they've
got
the
best
job
in
the
world
that's
because
they're
uneducated
and
brainwashed
hermione
began
hotly
but
her
next
few
words
were
drowned
out
by
the
sudden
whooshing
noise
from
overhead
which
announced
the
arrival
of
the
post
owls
harry
looked
up
at
once
and
saw
Hedwig
soaring
toward
him
hermione
stopped
talking
abruptly
she
and
Ron
watched
Hedwig
anxiously
as
she
fluttered
down
onto
harry's
shoulder
folded
her
wings
and
held
out
her
leg
wearily
harry
pulled
off
sirius's
reply
and
offered
Hedwig
his
bacon
rinds
which
she
ate
gratefully
then
checking
that
Fred
and
George
were
safely
immersed
in
further
discussions
about
the
Triwizard
Tournament
Harry
read
out
sirius's
letter
in
a
whisper
to
Ron
and
Hermione
nice
try
Harry
i'm
back
in
the
country
and
well
hidden
i
want
you
to
keep
me
posted
on
everything
that's
going
on
at
Hogwarts
don't
use
Hedwig
keep
changing
owls
and
don't
worry
about
me
just
watch
out
for
yourself
don't
forget
what
I
said
about
your
scar
sirius
Why
d'you
have
to
keep
changing
owls
ron
asked
in
a
low
voice
hedwig'll
attract
too
much
attention
said
Hermione
at
once
she
stands
out
a
snowy
owl
that
keeps
returning
to
wherever
he's
hiding
i
mean
they're
not
native
birds
are
they
harry
rolled
up
the
letter
and
slipped
it
inside
his
robes
wondering
whether
he
felt
more
or
less
worried
than
before
he
supposed
that
Sirius
managing
to
get
back
without
being
caught
was
something
he
couldn't
deny
either
that
the
idea
that
Sirius
was
much
nearer
was
reassuring
at
least
he
wouldn't
have
to
wait
so
long
for
a
response
every
time
he
wrote
thanks
Hedwig
he
said
stroking
her
she
hooted
sleepily
dipped
her
beak
briefly
into
his
goblet
of
orange
juice
then
took
off
again
clearly
desperate
for
a
good
long
sleep
in
the
Owlery
there
was
a
pleasant
feeling
of
anticipation
in
the
air
that
day
nobody
was
very
attentive
in
lessons
being
much
more
interested
in
the
arrival
that
evening
of
the
people
from
Beauxbatons
and
Durmstrang
even
Potions
was
more
bearable
than
usual
as
it
was
half
an
hour
shorter
when
the
bell
rang
early
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
hurried
up
to
Gryffindor
Tower
deposited
their
bags
and
books
as
they
had
been
instructed
pulled
on
their
cloaks
and
rushed
back
downstairs
into
the
entrance
hall
the
Heads
of
Houses
were
ordering
their
students
into
lines
weasley
straighten
your
hat
Professor
McGonagall
snapped
at
Ron
miss
Patil
take
that
ridiculous
thing
out
of
your
hair
parvati
scowled
and
removed
a
large
ornamental
butterfly
from
the
end
of
her
plait
follow
me
please
said
Professor
McGonagall
first
years
in
front
no
pushing
they
filed
down
the
steps
and
lined
up
in
front
of
the
castle
it
was
a
cold
clear
evening
dusk
was
falling
and
a
pale
transparentlooking
moon
was
already
shining
over
the
Forbidden
Forest
harry
standing
between
Ron
and
Hermione
in
the
fourth
row
from
the
front
saw
Dennis
Creevey
positively
shivering
with
anticipation
among
the
other
first
years
nearly
six
said
Ron
checking
his
watch
and
then
staring
down
the
drive
that
led
to
the
front
gates
how
d'you
reckon
they're
coming
the
train
i
doubt
it
said
Hermione
how
then
broomsticks
harry
suggested
looking
up
at
the
starry
sky
i
don't
think
so
not
from
that
far
away
a
Portkey
ron
suggested
or
they
could
Apparate
maybe
you're
allowed
to
do
it
under
seventeen
wherever
they
come
from
you
can't
Apparate
inside
the
Hogwarts
grounds
how
often
do
I
have
to
tell
you
said
Hermione
impatiently
they
scanned
the
darkening
grounds
excitedly
but
nothing
was
moving
everything
was
still
silent
and
quite
as
usual
harry
was
starting
to
feel
cold
he
wished
they'd
hurry
up
maybe
the
foreign
students
were
preparing
a
dramatic
entrance
he
remembered
what
mr.
Weasley
had
said
back
at
the
campsite
before
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
always
the
same
we
can't
resist
showing
off
when
we
get
together
and
then
Dumbledore
called
out
from
the
back
row
where
he
stood
with
the
other
teachers
Aha
unless
I
am
very
much
mistaken
the
delegation
from
Beauxbatons
approaches
where
said
many
students
eagerly
all
looking
in
different
directions
there
yelled
a
sixth
year
pointing
over
the
forest
something
large
much
larger
than
a
broomstick
or
indeed
a
hundred
broomsticks
was
hurtling
across
the
deep
blue
sky
toward
the
castle
growing
larger
all
the
time
it's
a
dragon
shrieked
one
of
the
first
years
losing
her
head
completely
don't
be
stupid
it's
a
flying
house
said
Dennis
Creevey
dennis's
guess
was
closer
as
the
gigantic
black
shape
skimmed
over
the
treetops
of
the
Forbidden
Forest
and
the
lights
shining
from
the
castle
windows
hit
it
they
saw
a
gigantic
powderblue
horsedrawn
carriage
the
size
of
a
large
house
soaring
toward
them
pulled
through
the
air
by
a
dozen
winged
horses
all
palominos
and
each
the
size
of
an
elephant
the
front
three
rows
of
students
drew
backward
as
the
carriage
hurtled
ever
lower
coming
in
to
land
at
a
tremendous
speed
then
with
an
almighty
crash
that
made
Neville
jump
backward
onto
a
Slytherin
fifth
year's
foot
the
horses
hooves
larger
than
dinner
plates
hit
the
ground
a
second
later
the
carriage
landed
too
bouncing
upon
its
vast
wheels
while
the
golden
horses
tossed
their
enormous
heads
and
rolled
large
fiery
red
eyes
harry
just
had
time
to
see
that
the
door
of
the
carriage
bore
a
coat
of
arms
two
crossed
golden
wands
each
emitting
three
stars
before
it
opened
a
boy
in
pale
blue
robes
jumped
down
from
the
carriage
bent
forward
fumbled
for
a
moment
with
something
on
the
carriage
floor
and
unfolded
a
set
of
golden
steps
he
sprang
back
respectfully
then
Harry
saw
a
shining
highheeled
black
shoe
emerging
from
the
inside
of
the
carriage
a
shoe
the
size
of
a
child's
sled
followed
almost
immediately
by
the
largest
woman
he
had
ever
seen
in
his
life
the
size
of
the
carriage
and
of
the
horses
was
immediately
explained
a
few
people
gasped
harry
had
only
ever
seen
one
person
as
large
as
this
woman
in
his
life
and
that
was
Hagrid
he
doubted
whether
there
was
an
inch
difference
in
their
heights
yet
somehow
maybe
simply
because
he
was
used
to
Hagrid
this
woman
now
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
and
looking
around
at
the
waiting
wideeyed
crowd
seemed
even
more
unnaturally
large
as
she
stepped
into
the
light
flooding
from
the
entrance
hall
she
was
revealed
to
have
a
handsome
oliveskinned
face
large
black
liquidlooking
eyes
and
a
rather
beaky
nose
her
hair
was
drawn
back
in
a
shining
knob
at
the
base
of
her
neck
she
was
dressed
from
head
to
foot
in
black
satin
and
many
magnificent
opals
gleamed
at
her
throat
and
on
her
thick
fingers
dumbledore
started
to
clap
the
students
following
his
lead
broke
into
applause
too
many
of
them
standing
on
tiptoe
the
better
to
look
at
this
woman
her
face
relaxed
into
a
gracious
smile
and
she
walked
forward
toward
Dumbledore
extending
a
glittering
hand
dumbledore
though
tall
himself
had
barely
to
bend
to
kiss
it
my
dear
Madame
Maxime
he
said
welcome
to
Hogwarts
dumblydort
said
Madame
Maxime
in
a
deep
voice
i
ope
I
find
you
well
in
excellent
form
I
thank
you
said
Dumbledore
my
pupils
said
Madame
Maxime
waving
one
of
her
enormous
hands
carelessly
behind
her
harry
whose
attention
had
been
focused
completely
upon
Madame
Maxime
now
noticed
that
about
a
dozen
boys
and
girls
all
by
the
look
of
them
in
their
late
teens
had
emerged
from
the
carriage
and
were
now
standing
behind
Madame
Maxime
they
were
shivering
which
was
unsurprising
given
that
their
robes
seemed
to
be
made
of
fine
silk
and
none
of
them
were
wearing
cloaks
a
few
had
wrapped
scarves
and
shawls
around
their
heads
from
what
Harry
could
see
of
them
they
were
standing
in
Madame
maxime's
enormous
shadow
they
were
staring
up
at
Hogwarts
with
apprehensive
looks
on
their
faces
as
Karkaroff
arrived
yet
madame
Maxime
asked
he
should
be
here
any
moment
said
Dumbledore
would
you
like
to
wait
here
and
greet
him
or
would
you
prefer
to
step
inside
and
warm
up
a
trifle
warm
up
I
think
said
Madame
Maxime
but
ze
orses
our
Care
of
Magical
Creatures
teacher
will
be
delighted
to
take
care
of
them
said
Dumbledore
the
moment
he
has
returned
from
dealing
with
a
slight
situation
that
has
arisen
with
some
of
his
other
er
charges
skrewts
Ron
muttered
to
Harry
grinning
my
steeds
require
er
forceful
andling
said
Madame
Maxime
looking
as
though
she
doubted
whether
any
Care
of
Magical
Creatures
teacher
at
Hogwarts
could
be
up
to
the
job
zey
are
very
strong
i
assure
you
that
Hagrid
will
be
well
up
to
the
job
said
Dumbledore
smiling
very
well
said
Madame
Maxime
bowing
slightly
will
you
please
inform
zis
Agrid
zat
ze
orses
drink
only
singlemalt
whiskey
it
will
be
attended
to
said
Dumbledore
also
bowing
come
said
Madame
Maxime
imperiously
to
her
students
and
the
Hogwarts
crowd
parted
to
allow
her
and
her
students
to
pass
up
the
stone
steps
how
big
d'you
reckon
durmstrang's
horses
are
going
to
be
seamus
Finnigan
said
leaning
around
Lavender
and
Parvati
to
address
Harry
and
Ron
well
if
they're
any
bigger
than
this
lot
even
Hagrid
won't
be
able
to
handle
them
said
Harry
that's
if
he
hasn't
been
attacked
by
his
skrewts
wonder
what's
up
with
them
maybe
they've
escaped
said
Ron
hopefully
oh
don't
say
that
said
Hermione
with
a
shudder
imagine
that
lot
loose
on
the
grounds
they
stood
shivering
slightly
now
waiting
for
the
Durmstrang
party
to
arrive
most
people
were
gazing
hopefully
up
at
the
sky
for
a
few
minutes
the
silence
was
broken
only
by
Madame
maxime's
huge
horses
snorting
and
stamping
but
then
Can
you
hear
something
said
Ron
suddenly
harry
listened
a
loud
and
oddly
eerie
noise
was
drifting
toward
them
from
out
of
the
darkness
a
muffled
rumbling
and
sucking
sound
as
though
an
immense
vacuum
cleaner
were
moving
along
a
riverbed
the
lake
yelled
Lee
Jordan
pointing
down
at
it
look
at
the
lake
from
their
position
at
the
top
of
the
lawns
overlooking
the
grounds
they
had
a
clear
view
of
the
smooth
black
surface
of
the
water
except
that
the
surface
was
suddenly
not
smooth
at
all
some
disturbance
was
taking
place
deep
in
the
center
great
bubbles
were
forming
on
the
surface
waves
were
now
washing
over
the
muddy
banks
and
then
out
in
the
very
middle
of
the
lake
a
whirlpool
appeared
as
if
a
giant
plug
had
just
been
pulled
out
of
the
lake's
floor
what
seemed
to
be
a
long
black
pole
began
to
rise
slowly
out
of
the
heart
of
the
whirlpool
and
then
Harry
saw
the
rigging
it's
a
mast
he
said
to
Ron
and
Hermione
slowly
magnificently
the
ship
rose
out
of
the
water
gleaming
in
the
moonlight
it
had
a
strangely
skeletal
look
about
it
as
though
it
were
a
resurrected
wreck
and
the
dim
misty
lights
shimmering
at
its
portholes
looked
like
ghostly
eyes
finally
with
a
great
sloshing
noise
the
ship
emerged
entirely
bobbing
on
the
turbulent
water
and
began
to
glide
toward
the
bank
a
few
moments
later
they
heard
the
splash
of
an
anchor
being
thrown
down
in
the
shallows
and
the
thud
of
a
plank
being
lowered
onto
the
bank
people
were
disembarking
they
could
see
their
silhouettes
passing
the
lights
in
the
ship's
portholes
all
of
them
Harry
noticed
seemed
to
be
built
along
the
lines
of
Crabbe
and
Goyle
but
then
as
they
drew
nearer
walking
up
the
lawns
into
the
light
streaming
from
the
entrance
hall
he
saw
that
their
bulk
was
really
due
to
the
fact
that
they
were
wearing
cloaks
of
some
kind
of
shaggy
matted
fur
but
the
man
who
was
leading
them
up
to
the
castle
was
wearing
furs
of
a
different
sort
sleek
and
silver
like
his
hair
dumbledore
he
called
heartily
as
he
walked
up
the
slope
how
are
you
my
dear
fellow
how
are
you
blooming
thank
you
Professor
Karkaroff
Dumbledore
replied
karkaroff
had
a
fruity
unctuous
voice
when
he
stepped
into
the
light
pouring
from
the
front
doors
of
the
castle
they
saw
that
he
was
tall
and
thin
like
Dumbledore
but
his
white
hair
was
short
and
his
goatee
finishing
in
a
small
curl
did
not
entirely
hide
his
rather
weak
chin
when
he
reached
Dumbledore
he
shook
hands
with
both
of
his
own
dear
old
Hogwarts
he
said
looking
up
at
the
castle
and
smiling
his
teeth
were
rather
yellow
and
Harry
noticed
that
his
smile
did
not
extend
to
his
eyes
which
remained
cold
and
shrewd
how
good
it
is
to
be
here
how
good
viktor
come
along
into
the
warmth
you
don't
mind
Dumbledore
viktor
has
a
slight
head
cold
karkaroff
beckoned
forward
one
of
his
students
as
the
boy
passed
Harry
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
prominent
curved
nose
and
thick
black
eyebrows
he
didn't
need
the
punch
on
the
arm
Ron
gave
him
or
the
hiss
in
his
ear
to
recognize
that
profile
harry
it's
Krum
chapter
sixteen
the
goblet
of
fire
i
don't
believe
it
ron
said
in
a
stunned
voice
as
the
Hogwarts
students
filed
back
up
the
steps
behind
the
party
from
Durmstrang
krum
Harry
viktor
Krum
for
heaven's
sake
Ron
he's
only
a
Quidditch
player
said
Hermione
only
a
Quidditch
player
ron
said
looking
at
her
as
though
he
couldn't
believe
his
ears
hermione
he's
one
of
the
best
Seekers
in
the
world
i
had
no
idea
he
was
still
at
school
as
they
recrossed
the
entrance
hall
with
the
rest
of
the
Hogwarts
students
heading
for
the
Great
Hall
Harry
saw
Lee
Jordan
jumping
up
and
down
on
the
soles
of
his
feet
to
get
a
better
look
at
the
back
of
krum's
head
several
sixthyear
girls
were
frantically
searching
their
pockets
as
they
walked
Oh
I
don't
believe
it
I
haven't
got
a
single
quill
on
me
d'you
think
he'd
sign
my
hat
in
lipstick
really
Hermione
said
loftily
as
they
passed
the
girls
now
squabbling
over
the
lipstick
i'm
getting
his
autograph
if
I
can
said
Ron
you
haven't
got
a
quill
have
you
Harry
nope
they're
upstairs
in
my
bag
said
Harry
they
walked
over
to
the
Gryffindor
table
and
sat
down
ron
took
care
to
sit
on
the
side
facing
the
doorway
because
Krum
and
his
fellow
Durmstrang
students
were
still
gathered
around
it
apparently
unsure
about
where
they
should
sit
the
students
from
Beauxbatons
had
chosen
seats
at
the
Ravenclaw
table
they
were
looking
around
the
Great
Hall
with
glum
expressions
on
their
faces
three
of
them
were
still
clutching
scarves
and
shawls
around
their
heads
it's
not
that
cold
said
Hermione
defensively
why
didn't
they
bring
cloaks
over
here
come
and
sit
over
here
ron
hissed
over
here
hermione
budge
up
make
a
space
what
too
late
said
Ron
bitterly
viktor
Krum
and
his
fellow
Durmstrang
students
had
settled
themselves
at
the
Slytherin
table
harry
could
see
Malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
looking
very
smug
about
this
as
he
watched
Malfoy
bent
forward
to
speak
to
Krum
yeah
that's
right
smarm
up
to
him
Malfoy
said
Ron
scathingly
i
bet
Krum
can
see
right
through
him
though
bet
he
gets
people
fawning
over
him
all
the
time
where
d'you
reckon
they're
going
to
sleep
we
could
offer
him
a
space
in
our
dormitory
Harry
i
wouldn't
mind
giving
him
my
bed
I
could
kip
on
a
camp
bed
hermione
snorted
they
look
a
lot
happier
than
the
Beauxbatons
lot
said
Harry
the
Durmstrang
students
were
pulling
off
their
heavy
furs
and
looking
up
at
the
starry
black
ceiling
with
expressions
of
interest
a
couple
of
them
were
picking
up
the
golden
plates
and
goblets
and
examining
them
apparently
impressed
up
at
the
staff
table
Filch
the
caretaker
was
adding
chairs
he
was
wearing
his
moldy
old
tailcoat
in
honor
of
the
occasion
harry
was
surprised
to
see
that
he
added
four
chairs
two
on
either
side
of
dumbledore's
but
there
are
only
two
extra
people
Harry
said
why's
Filch
putting
out
four
chairs
who
else
is
coming
eh
said
Ron
vaguely
he
was
still
staring
avidly
at
Krum
when
all
the
students
had
entered
the
Hall
and
settled
down
at
their
House
tables
the
staff
entered
filing
up
to
the
top
table
and
taking
their
seats
last
in
line
were
Professor
Dumbledore
Professor
Karkaroff
and
Madame
Maxime
when
their
headmistress
appeared
the
pupils
from
Beauxbatons
leapt
to
their
feet
a
few
of
the
Hogwarts
students
laughed
the
Beauxbatons
party
appeared
quite
unembarrassed
however
and
did
not
resume
their
seats
until
Madame
Maxime
had
sat
down
on
dumbledore's
lefthand
side
dumbledore
remained
standing
and
a
silence
fell
over
the
Great
Hall
good
evening
ladies
and
gentlemen
ghosts
and
most
particularly
guests
said
Dumbledore
beaming
around
at
the
foreign
students
i
have
great
pleasure
in
welcoming
you
all
to
Hogwarts
i
hope
and
trust
that
your
stay
here
will
be
both
comfortable
and
enjoyable
one
of
the
Beauxbatons
girls
still
clutching
a
muffler
around
her
head
gave
what
was
unmistakably
a
derisive
laugh
no
one's
making
you
stay
hermione
whispered
bristling
at
her
the
tournament
will
be
officially
opened
at
the
end
of
the
feast
said
Dumbledore
i
now
invite
you
all
to
eat
drink
and
make
yourselves
at
home
he
sat
down
and
Harry
saw
Karkaroff
lean
forward
at
once
and
engage
him
in
conversation
the
plates
in
front
of
them
filled
with
food
as
usual
the
houseelves
in
the
kitchen
seemed
to
have
pulled
out
all
the
stops
there
was
a
greater
variety
of
dishes
in
front
of
them
than
Harry
had
ever
seen
including
several
that
were
definitely
foreign
what's
that
said
Ron
pointing
at
a
large
dish
of
some
sort
of
shellfish
stew
that
stood
beside
a
large
steakandkidney
pudding
bouillabaisse
said
Hermione
bless
you
said
Ron
it's
French
said
Hermione
I
had
it
on
holiday
summer
before
last
it's
very
nice
i'll
take
your
word
for
it
said
Ron
helping
himself
to
black
pudding
the
Great
Hall
seemed
somehow
much
more
crowded
than
usual
even
though
there
were
barely
twenty
additional
students
there
perhaps
it
was
because
their
differently
colored
uniforms
stood
out
so
clearly
against
the
black
of
the
Hogwarts
robes
now
that
they
had
removed
their
furs
the
Durmstrang
students
were
revealed
to
be
wearing
robes
of
a
deep
bloodred
hagrid
sidled
into
the
Hall
through
a
door
behind
the
staff
table
twenty
minutes
after
the
start
of
the
feast
he
slid
into
his
seat
at
the
end
and
waved
at
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
with
a
very
heavily
bandaged
hand
skrewts
doing
all
right
Hagrid
harry
called
thrivin
Hagrid
called
back
happily
yeah
i'll
just
bet
they
are
said
Ron
quietly
looks
like
they've
finally
found
a
food
they
like
doesn't
it
hagrid's
fingers
at
that
moment
a
voice
said
Excuse
me
are
you
wanting
ze
bouillabaisse
it
was
the
girl
from
Beauxbatons
who
had
laughed
during
dumbledore's
speech
she
had
finally
removed
her
muffler
a
long
sheet
of
silveryblonde
hair
fell
almost
to
her
waist
she
had
large
deep
blue
eyes
and
very
white
even
teeth
ron
went
purple
he
stared
up
at
her
opened
his
mouth
to
reply
but
nothing
came
out
except
a
faint
gurgling
noise
yeah
have
it
said
Harry
pushing
the
dish
toward
the
girl
you
ave
finished
wiz
it
yeah
Ron
said
breathlessly
yeah
it
was
excellent
the
girl
picked
up
the
dish
and
carried
it
carefully
off
to
the
Ravenclaw
table
ron
was
still
goggling
at
the
girl
as
though
he
had
never
seen
one
before
harry
started
to
laugh
the
sound
seemed
to
jog
Ron
back
to
his
senses
she's
a
veela
he
said
hoarsely
to
Harry
of
course
she
isn't
said
Hermione
tartly
i
don't
see
anyone
else
gaping
at
her
like
an
idiot
but
she
wasn't
entirely
right
about
that
as
the
girl
crossed
the
Hall
many
boys
heads
turned
and
some
of
them
seemed
to
have
become
temporarily
speechless
just
like
Ron
i'm
telling
you
that's
not
a
normal
girl
said
Ron
leaning
sideways
so
he
could
keep
a
clear
view
of
her
they
don't
make
them
like
that
at
Hogwarts
they
make
them
okay
at
Hogwarts
said
Harry
without
thinking
cho
happened
to
be
sitting
only
a
few
places
away
from
the
girl
with
the
silvery
hair
when
you've
both
put
your
eyes
back
in
said
Hermione
briskly
you'll
be
able
to
see
who's
just
arrived
she
was
pointing
up
at
the
staff
table
the
two
remaining
empty
seats
had
just
been
filled
ludo
Bagman
was
now
sitting
on
Professor
karkaroff's
other
side
while
mr.
Crouch
percy's
boss
was
next
to
Madame
Maxime
what
are
they
doing
here
said
Harry
in
surprise
they
organized
the
Triwizard
Tournament
didn't
they
said
Hermione
i
suppose
they
wanted
to
be
here
to
see
it
start
when
the
second
course
arrived
they
noticed
a
number
of
unfamiliar
desserts
too
ron
examined
an
odd
sort
of
pale
blancmange
closely
then
moved
it
carefully
a
few
inches
to
his
right
so
that
it
would
be
clearly
visible
from
the
Ravenclaw
table
the
girl
who
looked
like
a
veela
appeared
to
have
eaten
enough
however
and
did
not
come
over
to
get
it
once
the
golden
plates
had
been
wiped
clean
Dumbledore
stood
up
again
a
pleasant
sort
of
tension
seemed
to
fill
the
Hall
now
harry
felt
a
slight
thrill
of
excitement
wondering
what
was
coming
several
seats
down
from
them
Fred
and
George
were
leaning
forward
staring
at
Dumbledore
with
great
concentration
the
moment
has
come
said
Dumbledore
smiling
around
at
the
sea
of
upturned
faces
the
Triwizard
Tournament
is
about
to
start
i
would
like
to
say
a
few
words
of
explanation
before
we
bring
in
the
casket
the
what
harry
muttered
ron
shrugged
just
to
clarify
the
procedure
that
we
will
be
following
this
year
but
first
let
me
introduce
for
those
who
do
not
know
them
mr.
Bartemius
Crouch
Head
of
the
Department
of
International
Magical
Cooperation
there
was
a
smattering
of
polite
applause
and
mr.
Ludo
Bagman
Head
of
the
Department
of
Magical
Games
and
Sports
there
was
a
much
louder
round
of
applause
for
Bagman
than
for
Crouch
perhaps
because
of
his
fame
as
a
Beater
or
simply
because
he
looked
so
much
more
likable
he
acknowledged
it
with
a
jovial
wave
of
his
hand
bartemius
Crouch
did
not
smile
or
wave
when
his
name
was
announced
remembering
him
in
his
neat
suit
at
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
Harry
thought
he
looked
strange
in
wizard's
robes
his
toothbrush
mustache
and
severe
parting
looked
very
odd
next
to
dumbledore's
long
white
hair
and
beard
mr.
Bagman
and
mr.
Crouch
have
worked
tirelessly
over
the
last
few
months
on
the
arrangements
for
the
Triwizard
Tournament
Dumbledore
continued
and
they
will
be
joining
myself
Professor
Karkaroff
and
Madame
Maxime
on
the
panel
that
will
judge
the
champions
efforts
at
the
mention
of
the
word
champions
the
attentiveness
of
the
listening
students
seemed
to
sharpen
perhaps
Dumbledore
had
noticed
their
sudden
stillness
for
he
smiled
as
he
said
The
casket
then
if
you
please
mr.
Filch
filch
who
had
been
lurking
unnoticed
in
a
far
corner
of
the
Hall
now
approached
Dumbledore
carrying
a
great
wooden
chest
encrusted
with
jewels
it
looked
extremely
old
a
murmur
of
excited
interest
rose
from
the
watching
students
Dennis
Creevey
actually
stood
on
his
chair
to
see
it
properly
but
being
so
tiny
his
head
hardly
rose
above
anyone
else's
the
instructions
for
the
tasks
the
champions
will
face
this
year
have
already
been
examined
by
mr.
Crouch
and
mr.
Bagman
said
Dumbledore
as
Filch
placed
the
chest
carefully
on
the
table
before
him
and
they
have
made
the
necessary
arrangements
for
each
challenge
there
will
be
three
tasks
spaced
throughout
the
school
year
and
they
will
test
the
champions
in
many
different
ways
their
magical
prowess
their
daring
their
powers
of
deduction
and
of
course
their
ability
to
cope
with
danger
at
this
last
word
the
Hall
was
filled
with
a
silence
so
absolute
that
nobody
seemed
to
be
breathing
as
you
know
three
champions
compete
in
the
tournament
Dumbledore
went
on
calmly
one
from
each
of
the
participating
schools
they
will
be
marked
on
how
well
they
perform
each
of
the
Tournament
tasks
and
the
champion
with
the
highest
total
after
task
three
will
win
the
Triwizard
Cup
the
champions
will
be
chosen
by
an
impartial
selector
the
Goblet
of
Fire
dumbledore
now
took
out
his
wand
and
tapped
three
times
upon
the
top
of
the
casket
the
lid
creaked
slowly
open
dumbledore
reached
inside
it
and
pulled
out
a
large
roughly
hewn
wooden
cup
it
would
have
been
entirely
unremarkable
had
it
not
been
full
to
the
brim
with
dancing
bluewhite
flames
dumbledore
closed
the
casket
and
placed
the
goblet
carefully
on
top
of
it
where
it
would
be
clearly
visible
to
everyone
in
the
Hall
anybody
wishing
to
submit
themselves
as
champion
must
write
their
name
and
school
clearly
upon
a
slip
of
parchment
and
drop
it
into
the
goblet
said
Dumbledore
aspiring
champions
have
twentyfour
hours
in
which
to
put
their
names
forward
tomorrow
night
Halloween
the
goblet
will
return
the
names
of
the
three
it
has
judged
most
worthy
to
represent
their
schools
the
goblet
will
be
placed
in
the
entrance
hall
tonight
where
it
will
be
freely
accessible
to
all
those
wishing
to
compete
to
ensure
that
no
underage
student
yields
to
temptation
said
Dumbledore
I
will
be
drawing
an
Age
Line
around
the
Goblet
of
Fire
once
it
has
been
placed
in
the
entrance
hall
nobody
under
the
age
of
seventeen
will
be
able
to
cross
this
line
finally
I
wish
to
impress
upon
any
of
you
wishing
to
compete
that
this
tournament
is
not
to
be
entered
into
lightly
once
a
champion
has
been
selected
by
the
Goblet
of
Fire
he
or
she
is
obliged
to
see
the
tournament
through
to
the
end
the
placing
of
your
name
in
the
goblet
constitutes
a
binding
magical
contract
there
can
be
no
change
of
heart
once
you
have
become
a
champion
please
be
very
sure
therefore
that
you
are
wholeheartedly
prepared
to
play
before
you
drop
your
name
into
the
goblet
now
I
think
it
is
time
for
bed
good
night
to
you
all
an
Age
Line
fred
Weasley
said
his
eyes
glinting
as
they
all
made
their
way
across
the
Hall
to
the
doors
into
the
entrance
hall
well
that
should
be
fooled
by
an
Aging
Potion
shouldn't
it
and
once
your
name's
in
that
goblet
you're
laughing
it
can't
tell
whether
you're
seventeen
or
not
but
I
don't
think
anyone
under
seventeen
will
stand
a
chance
said
Hermione
we
just
haven't
learned
enough
speak
for
yourself
said
George
shortly
you'll
try
and
get
in
won't
you
Harry
harry
thought
briefly
of
dumbledore's
insistence
that
nobody
under
seventeen
should
submit
their
name
but
then
the
wonderful
picture
of
himself
winning
the
Triwizard
Tournament
filled
his
mind
again
he
wondered
how
angry
Dumbledore
would
be
if
someone
younger
than
seventeen
did
find
a
way
to
get
over
the
Age
Line
where
is
he
said
Ron
who
wasn't
listening
to
a
word
of
this
conversation
but
looking
through
the
crowd
to
see
what
had
become
of
Krum
dumbledore
didn't
say
where
the
Durmstrang
people
are
sleeping
did
he
but
this
query
was
answered
almost
instantly
they
were
level
with
the
Slytherin
table
now
and
Karkaroff
had
just
bustled
up
to
his
students
back
to
the
ship
then
he
was
saying
viktor
how
are
you
feeling
did
you
eat
enough
should
I
send
for
some
mulled
wine
from
the
kitchens
harry
saw
Krum
shake
his
head
as
he
pulled
his
furs
back
on
professor
Ivood
like
some
vine
said
one
of
the
other
Durmstrang
boys
hopefully
i
wasn't
offering
it
to
you
Poliakoff
snapped
Karkaroff
his
warmly
paternal
air
vanishing
in
an
instant
i
notice
you
have
dribbled
food
all
down
the
front
of
your
robes
again
disgusting
boy
karkaroff
turned
and
led
his
students
toward
the
doors
reaching
them
at
exactly
the
same
moment
as
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
harry
stopped
to
let
him
walk
through
first
thank
you
said
Karkaroff
carelessly
glancing
at
him
and
then
Karkaroff
froze
he
turned
his
head
back
to
Harry
and
stared
at
him
as
though
he
couldn't
believe
his
eyes
behind
their
headmaster
the
students
from
Durmstrang
came
to
a
halt
too
karkaroff's
eyes
moved
slowly
up
harry's
face
and
fixed
upon
his
scar
the
Durmstrang
students
were
staring
curiously
at
Harry
too
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
Harry
saw
comprehension
dawn
on
a
few
of
their
faces
the
boy
with
food
all
down
his
front
nudged
the
girl
next
to
him
and
pointed
openly
at
harry's
forehead
yeah
that's
Harry
Potter
said
a
growling
voice
from
behind
them
professor
Karkaroff
spun
around
madEye
Moody
was
standing
there
leaning
heavily
on
his
staff
his
magical
eye
glaring
unblinkingly
at
the
Durmstrang
headmaster
the
color
drained
from
karkaroff's
face
as
Harry
watched
a
terrible
look
of
mingled
fury
and
fear
came
over
him
you
he
said
staring
at
Moody
as
though
unsure
he
was
really
seeing
him
me
said
Moody
grimly
and
unless
you've
got
anything
to
say
to
Potter
Karkaroff
you
might
want
to
move
you're
blocking
the
doorway
it
was
true
half
the
students
in
the
Hall
were
now
waiting
behind
them
looking
over
one
another's
shoulders
to
see
what
was
causing
the
holdup
without
another
word
Professor
Karkaroff
swept
his
students
away
with
him
moody
watched
him
until
he
was
out
of
sight
his
magical
eye
fixed
upon
his
back
a
look
of
intense
dislike
upon
his
mutilated
face
as
the
next
day
was
Saturday
most
students
would
normally
have
breakfasted
late
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
however
were
not
alone
in
rising
much
earlier
than
they
usually
did
on
weekends
when
they
went
down
into
the
entrance
hall
they
saw
about
twenty
people
milling
around
it
some
of
them
eating
toast
all
examining
the
Goblet
of
Fire
it
had
been
placed
in
the
center
of
the
hall
on
the
stool
that
normally
bore
the
Sorting
Hat
a
thin
golden
line
had
been
traced
on
the
floor
forming
a
circle
ten
feet
around
it
in
every
direction
anyone
put
their
name
in
yet
ron
asked
a
thirdyear
girl
eagerly
all
the
Durmstrang
lot
she
replied
but
I
haven't
seen
anyone
from
Hogwarts
yet
bet
some
of
them
put
it
in
last
night
after
we'd
all
gone
to
bed
said
Harry
i
would've
if
it
had
been
me
wouldn't
have
wanted
everyone
watching
what
if
the
goblet
just
gobbed
you
right
back
out
again
someone
laughed
behind
Harry
turning
he
saw
Fred
George
and
Lee
Jordan
hurrying
down
the
staircase
all
three
of
them
looking
extremely
excited
done
it
Fred
said
in
a
triumphant
whisper
to
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
just
taken
it
what
said
Ron
the
Aging
Potion
dung
brains
said
Fred
one
drop
each
said
George
rubbing
his
hands
together
with
glee
we
only
need
to
be
a
few
months
older
we're
going
to
split
the
thousand
Galleons
between
the
three
of
us
if
one
of
us
wins
said
Lee
grinning
broadly
i'm
not
sure
this
is
going
to
work
you
know
said
Hermione
warningly
i'm
sure
Dumbledore
will
have
thought
of
this
fred
George
and
Lee
ignored
her
ready
fred
said
to
the
other
two
quivering
with
excitement
c'mon
then
i'll
go
first
harry
watched
fascinated
as
Fred
pulled
a
slip
of
parchment
out
of
his
pocket
bearing
the
words
Fred
Weasley
Hogwarts
fred
walked
right
up
to
the
edge
of
the
line
and
stood
there
rocking
on
his
toes
like
a
diver
preparing
for
a
fiftyfoot
drop
then
with
the
eyes
of
every
person
in
the
entrance
hall
upon
him
he
took
a
great
breath
and
stepped
over
the
line
for
a
split
second
Harry
thought
it
had
worked
George
certainly
thought
so
for
he
let
out
a
yell
of
triumph
and
leapt
after
Fred
but
next
moment
there
was
a
loud
sizzling
sound
and
both
twins
were
hurled
out
of
the
golden
circle
as
though
they
had
been
thrown
by
an
invisible
shotputter
they
landed
painfully
ten
feet
away
on
the
cold
stone
floor
and
to
add
insult
to
injury
there
was
a
loud
popping
noise
and
both
of
them
sprouted
identical
long
white
beards
the
entrance
hall
rang
with
laughter
even
Fred
and
George
joined
in
once
they
had
gotten
to
their
feet
and
taken
a
good
look
at
each
other's
beards
i
did
warn
you
said
a
deep
amused
voice
and
everyone
turned
to
see
Professor
Dumbledore
coming
out
of
the
Great
Hall
he
surveyed
Fred
and
George
his
eyes
twinkling
i
suggest
you
both
go
up
to
Madam
Pomfrey
she
is
already
tending
to
Miss
Fawcett
of
Ravenclaw
and
mr.
Summers
of
Hufflepuff
both
of
whom
decided
to
age
themselves
up
a
little
too
though
I
must
say
neither
of
their
beards
is
anything
like
as
fine
as
yours
fred
and
George
set
off
for
the
hospital
wing
accompanied
by
Lee
who
was
howling
with
laughter
and
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
also
chortling
went
in
to
breakfast
the
decorations
in
the
Great
Hall
had
changed
this
morning
as
it
was
Halloween
a
cloud
of
live
bats
was
fluttering
around
the
enchanted
ceiling
while
hundreds
of
carved
pumpkins
leered
from
every
corner
harry
led
the
way
over
to
Dean
and
Seamus
who
were
discussing
those
Hogwarts
students
of
seventeen
or
over
who
might
be
entering
there's
a
rumor
going
around
that
Warrington
got
up
early
and
put
his
name
in
dean
told
Harry
that
big
bloke
from
Slytherin
who
looks
like
a
sloth
harry
who
had
played
Quidditch
against
Warrington
shook
his
head
in
disgust
we
can't
have
a
Slytherin
champion
and
all
the
Hufflepuffs
are
talking
about
Diggory
said
Seamus
contemptuously
but
I
wouldn't
have
thought
he'd
have
wanted
to
risk
his
good
looks
listen
said
Hermione
suddenly
people
were
cheering
out
in
the
entrance
hall
they
all
swiveled
around
in
their
seats
and
saw
Angelina
Johnson
coming
into
the
Hall
grinning
in
an
embarrassed
sort
of
way
a
tall
black
girl
who
played
Chaser
on
the
Gryffindor
Quidditch
team
Angelina
came
over
to
them
sat
down
and
said
Well
i've
done
it
just
put
my
name
in
you're
kidding
said
Ron
looking
impressed
are
you
seventeen
then
asked
Harry
course
she
is
can't
see
a
beard
can
you
said
Ron
i
had
my
birthday
last
week
said
Angelina
well
i'm
glad
someone
from
gryffindor's
entering
said
Hermione
i
really
hope
you
get
it
Angelina
thanks
Hermione
said
Angelina
smiling
at
her
yeah
better
you
than
PrettyBoy
Diggory
said
Seamus
causing
several
Hufflepuffs
passing
their
table
to
scowl
heavily
at
him
what're
we
going
to
do
today
then
ron
asked
Harry
and
Hermione
when
they
had
finished
breakfast
and
were
leaving
the
Great
Hall
we
haven't
been
down
to
visit
Hagrid
yet
said
Harry
okay
said
Ron
just
as
long
as
he
doesn't
ask
us
to
donate
a
few
fingers
to
the
skrewts
a
look
of
great
excitement
suddenly
dawned
on
hermione's
face
i've
just
realized
I
haven't
asked
Hagrid
to
join
S
p.e.w.
yet
she
said
brightly
wait
for
me
will
you
while
I
nip
upstairs
and
get
the
badges
what
is
it
with
her
said
Ron
exasperated
as
Hermione
ran
away
up
the
marble
staircase
hey
Ron
said
Harry
suddenly
it's
your
friend
the
students
from
Beauxbatons
were
coming
through
the
front
doors
from
the
grounds
among
them
the
veelagirl
those
gathered
around
the
Goblet
of
Fire
stood
back
to
let
them
pass
watching
eagerly
madame
Maxime
entered
the
hall
behind
her
students
and
organized
them
into
a
line
one
by
one
the
Beauxbatons
students
stepped
across
the
Age
Line
and
dropped
their
slips
of
parchment
into
the
bluewhite
flames
as
each
name
entered
the
fire
it
turned
briefly
red
and
emitted
sparks
what
d'you
reckon'll
happen
to
the
ones
who
aren't
chosen
ron
muttered
to
Harry
as
the
veelagirl
dropped
her
parchment
into
the
Goblet
of
Fire
reckon
they'll
go
back
to
school
or
hang
around
to
watch
the
tournament
dunno
said
Harry
hang
around
I
suppose
madame
maxime's
staying
to
judge
isn't
she
when
all
the
Beauxbatons
students
had
submitted
their
names
Madame
Maxime
led
them
back
out
of
the
hall
and
out
onto
the
grounds
again
where
are
they
sleeping
then
said
Ron
moving
toward
the
front
doors
and
staring
after
them
a
loud
rattling
noise
behind
them
announced
hermione's
reappearance
with
the
box
of
S
w.
badges
oh
good
hurry
up
said
Ron
and
he
jumped
down
the
stone
steps
keeping
his
eyes
on
the
back
of
the
veelagirl
who
was
now
halfway
across
the
lawn
with
Madame
Maxime
as
they
neared
hagrid's
cabin
on
the
edge
of
the
Forbidden
Forest
the
mystery
of
the
Beauxbatons
sleeping
quarters
was
solved
the
gigantic
powderblue
carriage
in
which
they
had
arrived
had
been
parked
two
hundred
yards
from
hagrid's
front
door
and
the
students
were
climbing
back
inside
it
the
elephantine
flying
horses
that
had
pulled
the
carriage
were
now
grazing
in
a
makeshift
paddock
alongside
it
harry
knocked
on
hagrid's
door
and
fang's
booming
barks
answered
instantly
bout
time
said
Hagrid
when
he'd
flung
open
the
door
thought
you
lot'd
forgotten
where
I
live
we've
been
really
busy
Hag
Hermione
started
to
say
but
then
she
stopped
dead
looking
up
at
Hagrid
apparently
lost
for
words
hagrid
was
wearing
his
best
and
very
horrible
hairy
brown
suit
plus
a
checked
yellowandorange
tie
this
wasn't
the
worst
of
it
though
he
had
evidently
tried
to
tame
his
hair
using
large
quantities
of
what
appeared
to
be
axle
grease
it
was
now
slicked
down
into
two
bunches
perhaps
he
had
tried
a
ponytail
like
bill's
but
found
he
had
too
much
hair
the
look
didn't
really
suit
Hagrid
at
all
for
a
moment
Hermione
goggled
at
him
then
obviously
deciding
not
to
comment
she
said
Erm
where
are
the
skrewts
out
by
the
pumpkin
patch
said
Hagrid
happily
they're
gettin
massive
mus
be
nearly
three
foot
long
now
on'y
trouble
is
they've
started
killin
each
other
oh
no
really
said
Hermione
shooting
a
repressive
look
at
Ron
who
staring
at
hagrid's
odd
hairstyle
had
just
opened
his
mouth
to
say
something
about
it
yeah
said
Hagrid
sadly
s
okay
though
i've
got
em
in
separate
boxes
now
still
got
abou
twenty
well
that's
lucky
said
Ron
hagrid
missed
the
sarcasm
hagrid's
cabin
comprised
a
single
room
in
one
corner
of
which
was
a
gigantic
bed
covered
in
a
patchwork
quilt
a
similarly
enormous
wooden
table
and
chairs
stood
in
front
of
the
fire
beneath
the
quantity
of
cured
hams
and
dead
birds
hanging
from
the
ceiling
they
sat
down
at
the
table
while
Hagrid
started
to
make
tea
and
were
soon
immersed
in
yet
more
discussion
of
the
Triwizard
Tournament
hagrid
seemed
quite
as
excited
about
it
as
they
were
you
wait
he
said
grinning
you
jus
wait
yer
going
ter
see
some
stuff
yeh've
never
seen
before
firs
task
ah
but
i'm
not
supposed
ter
say
go
on
Hagrid
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
urged
him
but
he
just
shook
his
head
grinning
i
don
want
ter
spoil
it
fer
yeh
said
Hagrid
but
it's
gonna
be
spectacular
i'll
tell
yeh
that
them
champions're
going
ter
have
their
work
cut
out
never
thought
i'd
live
ter
see
the
Triwizard
Tournament
played
again
they
ended
up
having
lunch
with
Hagrid
though
they
didn't
eat
much
Hagrid
had
made
what
he
said
was
a
beef
casserole
but
after
Hermione
unearthed
a
large
talon
in
hers
she
Harry
and
Ron
rather
lost
their
appetites
however
they
enjoyed
themselves
trying
to
make
Hagrid
tell
them
what
the
tasks
in
the
tournament
were
going
to
be
speculating
which
of
the
entrants
were
likely
to
be
selected
as
champions
and
wondering
whether
Fred
and
George
were
beardless
yet
a
light
rain
had
started
to
fall
by
midafternoon
it
was
very
cozy
sitting
by
the
fire
listening
to
the
gentle
patter
of
the
drops
on
the
window
watching
Hagrid
darning
his
socks
and
arguing
with
Hermione
about
houseelves
for
he
flatly
refused
to
join
S
p.e.w.
when
she
showed
him
her
badges
it'd
be
doin
em
an
unkindness
Hermione
he
said
gravely
threading
a
massive
bone
needle
with
thick
yellow
yarn
it's
in
their
nature
ter
look
after
humans
that's
what
they
like
see
yeh'd
be
makin
em
unhappy
ter
take
away
their
work
an
insutin
em
if
yeh
tried
ter
pay
em
but
Harry
set
Dobby
free
and
he
was
over
the
moon
about
it
said
Hermione
and
we
heard
he's
asking
for
wages
now
yeah
well
yeh
get
weirdos
in
every
breed
i'm
not
sayin
there
isn't
the
odd
elf
who'd
take
freedom
but
yeh'll
never
persuade
most
of
em
ter
do
it
no
nothin
doin
Hermione
hermione
looked
very
cross
indeed
and
stuffed
her
box
of
badges
back
into
her
cloak
pocket
by
half
past
five
it
was
growing
dark
and
Ron
Harry
and
Hermione
decided
it
was
time
to
get
back
up
to
the
castle
for
the
Halloween
feast
and
more
important
the
announcement
of
the
school
champions
i'll
come
with
yeh
said
Hagrid
putting
away
his
darning
jus
give
us
a
sec
hagrid
got
up
went
across
to
the
chest
of
drawers
beside
his
bed
and
began
searching
for
something
inside
it
they
didn't
pay
too
much
attention
until
a
truly
horrible
smell
reached
their
nostrils
coughing
Ron
said
Hagrid
what's
that
eh
said
Hagrid
turning
around
with
a
large
bottle
in
his
hand
don
yeh
like
it
is
that
aftershave
said
Hermione
in
a
slightly
choked
voice
er
eau
de
cologne
Hagrid
muttered
he
was
blushing
maybe
it's
a
bit
much
he
said
gruffly
i'll
go
take
it
off
hang
on
he
stumped
out
of
the
cabin
and
they
saw
him
washing
himself
vigorously
in
the
water
barrel
outside
the
window
eau
de
cologne
said
Hermione
in
amazement
hagrid
and
what's
with
the
hair
and
the
suit
said
Harry
in
an
undertone
look
said
Ron
suddenly
pointing
out
of
the
window
hagrid
had
just
straightened
up
and
turned
round
if
he
had
been
blushing
before
it
was
nothing
to
what
he
was
doing
now
getting
to
their
feet
very
cautiously
so
that
Hagrid
wouldn't
spot
them
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
peered
through
the
window
and
saw
that
Madame
Maxime
and
the
Beauxbatons
students
had
just
emerged
from
their
carriage
clearly
about
to
set
off
for
the
feast
too
they
couldn't
hear
what
Hagrid
was
saying
but
he
was
talking
to
Madame
Maxime
with
a
rapt
mistyeyed
expression
Harry
had
only
ever
seen
him
wear
once
before
when
he
had
been
looking
at
the
baby
dragon
Norbert
he's
going
up
to
the
castle
with
her
said
Hermione
indignantly
i
thought
he
was
waiting
for
us
without
so
much
as
a
backward
glance
at
his
cabin
Hagrid
was
trudging
off
up
the
grounds
with
Madame
Maxime
the
Beauxbatons
students
following
in
their
wake
jogging
to
keep
up
with
their
enormous
strides
he
fancies
her
said
Ron
incredulously
well
if
they
end
up
having
children
they'll
be
setting
a
world
record
bet
any
baby
of
theirs
would
weigh
about
a
ton
they
let
themselves
out
of
the
cabin
and
shut
the
door
behind
them
it
was
surprisingly
dark
outside
drawing
their
cloaks
more
closely
around
themselves
they
set
off
up
the
sloping
lawns
ooh
it's
them
look
hermione
whispered
the
Durmstrang
party
was
walking
up
toward
the
castle
from
the
lake
viktor
Krum
was
walking
side
by
side
with
Karkaroff
and
the
other
Durmstrang
students
were
straggling
along
behind
them
ron
watched
Krum
excitedly
but
Krum
did
not
look
around
as
he
reached
the
front
doors
a
little
ahead
of
Hermione
Ron
and
Harry
and
proceeded
through
them
when
they
entered
the
candlelit
Great
Hall
it
was
almost
full
the
Goblet
of
Fire
had
been
moved
it
was
now
standing
in
front
of
dumbledore's
empty
chair
at
the
teachers
table
fred
and
George
cleanshaven
again
seemed
to
have
taken
their
disappointment
fairly
well
hope
it's
Angelina
said
Fred
as
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
sat
down
so
do
I
said
Hermione
breathlessly
well
we'll
soon
know
the
Halloween
feast
seemed
to
take
much
longer
than
usual
perhaps
because
it
was
their
second
feast
in
two
days
Harry
didn't
seem
to
fancy
the
extravagantly
prepared
food
as
much
as
he
would
have
normally
like
everyone
else
in
the
Hall
judging
by
the
constantly
craning
necks
the
impatient
expressions
on
every
face
the
fidgeting
and
the
standing
up
to
see
whether
Dumbledore
had
finished
eating
yet
Harry
simply
wanted
the
plates
to
clear
and
to
hear
who
had
been
selected
as
champions
at
long
last
the
golden
plates
returned
to
their
original
spotless
state
there
was
a
sharp
upswing
in
the
level
of
noise
within
the
Hall
which
died
away
almost
instantly
as
Dumbledore
got
to
his
feet
on
either
side
of
him
Professor
Karkaroff
and
Madame
Maxime
looked
as
tense
and
expectant
as
anyone
ludo
Bagman
was
beaming
and
winking
at
various
students
mr.
Crouch
however
looked
quite
uninterested
almost
bored
well
the
goblet
is
almost
ready
to
make
its
decision
said
Dumbledore
i
estimate
that
it
requires
one
more
minute
now
when
the
champions
names
are
called
I
would
ask
them
please
to
come
up
to
the
top
of
the
Hall
walk
along
the
staff
table
and
go
through
into
the
next
chamber
he
indicated
the
door
behind
the
staff
table
where
they
will
be
receiving
their
first
instructions
he
took
out
his
wand
and
gave
a
great
sweeping
wave
with
it
at
once
all
the
candles
except
those
inside
the
carved
pumpkins
were
extinguished
plunging
them
into
a
state
of
semidarkness
the
Goblet
of
Fire
now
shone
more
brightly
than
anything
in
the
whole
Hall
the
sparkling
bright
blueywhiteness
of
the
flames
almost
painful
on
the
eyes
everyone
watched
waiting
a
few
people
kept
checking
their
watches
any
second
Lee
Jordan
whispered
two
seats
away
from
Harry
the
flames
inside
the
goblet
turned
suddenly
red
again
sparks
began
to
fly
from
it
next
moment
a
tongue
of
flame
shot
into
the
air
a
charred
piece
of
parchment
fluttered
out
of
it
the
whole
room
gasped
dumbledore
caught
the
piece
of
parchment
and
held
it
at
arm's
length
so
that
he
could
read
it
by
the
light
of
the
flames
which
had
turned
back
to
bluewhite
the
champion
for
Durmstrang
he
read
in
a
strong
clear
voice
will
be
Viktor
Krum
no
surprises
there
yelled
Ron
as
a
storm
of
applause
and
cheering
swept
the
Hall
harry
saw
Viktor
Krum
rise
from
the
Slytherin
table
and
slouch
up
toward
Dumbledore
he
turned
right
walked
along
the
staff
table
and
disappeared
through
the
door
into
the
next
chamber
bravo
Viktor
boomed
Karkaroff
so
loudly
that
everyone
could
hear
him
even
over
all
the
applause
knew
you
had
it
in
you
the
clapping
and
chatting
died
down
now
everyone's
attention
was
focused
again
on
the
goblet
which
seconds
later
turned
red
once
more
a
second
piece
of
parchment
shot
out
of
it
propelled
by
the
flames
the
champion
for
Beauxbatons
said
Dumbledore
is
Fleur
Delacour
it's
her
Ron
harry
shouted
as
the
girl
who
so
resembled
a
veela
got
gracefully
to
her
feet
shook
back
her
sheet
of
silvery
blonde
hair
and
swept
up
between
the
Ravenclaw
and
Hufflepuff
tables
oh
look
they're
all
disappointed
Hermione
said
over
the
noise
nodding
toward
the
remainder
of
the
Beauxbatons
party
disappointed
was
a
bit
of
an
understatement
Harry
thought
two
of
the
girls
who
had
not
been
selected
had
dissolved
into
tears
and
were
sobbing
with
their
heads
on
their
arms
when
Fleur
Delacour
too
had
vanished
into
the
side
chamber
silence
fell
again
but
this
time
it
was
a
silence
so
stiff
with
excitement
you
could
almost
taste
it
the
Hogwarts
champion
next
and
the
Goblet
of
Fire
turned
red
once
more
sparks
showered
out
of
it
the
tongue
of
flame
shot
high
into
the
air
and
from
its
tip
Dumbledore
pulled
the
third
piece
of
parchment
the
Hogwarts
champion
he
called
is
Cedric
Diggory
no
said
Ron
loudly
but
nobody
heard
him
except
Harry
the
uproar
from
the
next
table
was
too
great
every
single
Hufflepuff
had
jumped
to
his
or
her
feet
screaming
and
stamping
as
Cedric
made
his
way
past
them
grinning
broadly
and
headed
off
toward
the
chamber
behind
the
teachers
table
indeed
the
applause
for
Cedric
went
on
so
long
that
it
was
some
time
before
Dumbledore
could
make
himself
heard
again
excellent
dumbledore
called
happily
as
at
last
the
tumult
died
down
well
we
now
have
our
three
champions
i
am
sure
I
can
count
upon
all
of
you
including
the
remaining
students
from
Beauxbatons
and
Durmstrang
to
give
your
champions
every
ounce
of
support
you
can
muster
by
cheering
your
champion
on
you
will
contribute
in
a
very
real
but
Dumbledore
suddenly
stopped
speaking
and
it
was
apparent
to
everybody
what
had
distracted
him
the
fire
in
the
goblet
had
just
turned
red
again
sparks
were
flying
out
of
it
a
long
flame
shot
suddenly
into
the
air
and
borne
upon
it
was
another
piece
of
parchment
automatically
it
seemed
Dumbledore
reached
out
a
long
hand
and
seized
the
parchment
he
held
it
out
and
stared
at
the
name
written
upon
it
there
was
a
long
pause
during
which
Dumbledore
stared
at
the
slip
in
his
hands
and
everyone
in
the
room
stared
at
Dumbledore
and
then
Dumbledore
cleared
his
throat
and
read
out
Harry
Potter
chapter
seventeen
the
four
champions
harry
sat
there
aware
that
every
head
in
the
Great
Hall
had
turned
to
look
at
him
he
was
stunned
he
felt
numb
he
was
surely
dreaming
he
had
not
heard
correctly
there
was
no
applause
a
buzzing
as
though
of
angry
bees
was
starting
to
fill
the
Hall
some
students
were
standing
up
to
get
a
better
look
at
Harry
as
he
sat
frozen
in
his
seat
up
at
the
top
table
Professor
McGonagall
had
got
to
her
feet
and
swept
past
Ludo
Bagman
and
Professor
Karkaroff
to
whisper
urgently
to
Professor
Dumbledore
who
bent
his
ear
toward
her
frowning
slightly
harry
turned
to
Ron
and
Hermione
beyond
them
he
saw
the
long
Gryffindor
table
all
watching
him
openmouthed
i
didn't
put
my
name
in
Harry
said
blankly
you
know
I
didn't
both
of
them
stared
just
as
blankly
back
at
the
top
table
Professor
Dumbledore
had
straightened
up
nodding
to
Professor
McGonagall
harry
Potter
he
called
again
harry
up
here
if
you
please
go
on
Hermione
whispered
giving
Harry
a
slight
push
harry
got
to
his
feet
trod
on
the
hem
of
his
robes
and
stumbled
slightly
he
set
off
up
the
gap
between
the
Gryffindor
and
Hufflepuff
tables
it
felt
like
an
immensely
long
walk
the
top
table
didn't
seem
to
be
getting
any
nearer
at
all
and
he
could
feel
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
eyes
upon
him
as
though
each
were
a
searchlight
the
buzzing
grew
louder
and
louder
after
what
seemed
like
an
hour
he
was
right
in
front
of
Dumbledore
feeling
the
stares
of
all
the
teachers
upon
him
well
through
the
door
Harry
said
Dumbledore
he
wasn't
smiling
harry
moved
off
along
the
teachers
table
hagrid
was
seated
right
at
the
end
he
did
not
wink
at
Harry
or
wave
or
give
any
of
his
usual
signs
of
greeting
he
looked
completely
astonished
and
stared
at
Harry
as
he
passed
like
everyone
else
harry
went
through
the
door
out
of
the
Great
Hall
and
found
himself
in
a
smaller
room
lined
with
paintings
of
witches
and
wizards
a
handsome
fire
was
roaring
in
the
fireplace
opposite
him
the
faces
in
the
portraits
turned
to
look
at
him
as
he
entered
he
saw
a
wizened
witch
flit
out
of
the
frame
of
her
picture
and
into
the
one
next
to
it
which
contained
a
wizard
with
a
walrus
mustache
the
wizened
witch
started
whispering
in
his
ear
viktor
Krum
Cedric
Diggory
and
Fleur
Delacour
were
grouped
around
the
fire
they
looked
strangely
impressive
silhouetted
against
the
flames
krum
hunched
up
and
brooding
was
leaning
against
the
mantelpiece
slightly
apart
from
the
other
two
cedric
was
standing
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
staring
into
the
fire
fleur
Delacour
looked
around
when
Harry
walked
in
and
threw
back
her
sheet
of
long
silvery
hair
what
is
it
she
said
do
zey
want
us
back
in
ze
Hall
she
thought
he
had
come
to
deliver
a
message
harry
didn't
know
how
to
explain
what
had
just
happened
he
just
stood
there
looking
at
the
three
champions
it
struck
him
how
very
tall
all
of
them
were
there
was
a
sound
of
scurrying
feet
behind
him
and
Ludo
Bagman
entered
the
room
he
took
Harry
by
the
arm
and
led
him
forward
extraordinary
he
muttered
squeezing
harry's
arm
absolutely
extraordinary
gentlemen
lady
he
added
approaching
the
fireside
and
addressing
the
other
three
may
I
introduce
incredible
though
it
may
seem
the
fourth
Triwizard
champion
viktor
Krum
straightened
up
his
surly
face
darkened
as
he
surveyed
Harry
cedric
looked
nonplussed
he
looked
from
Bagman
to
Harry
and
back
again
as
though
sure
he
must
have
misheard
what
Bagman
had
said
fleur
Delacour
however
tossed
her
hair
smiling
and
said
Oh
vairy
funny
joke
Meester
Bagman
joke
bagman
repeated
bewildered
no
no
not
at
all
harry's
name
just
came
out
of
the
Goblet
of
Fire
krum's
thick
eyebrows
contracted
slightly
cedric
was
still
looking
politely
bewildered
fleur
frowned
but
evidently
zair
as
been
a
mistake
she
said
contemptuously
to
Bagman
e
cannot
compete
e
is
too
young
well
it
is
amazing
said
Bagman
rubbing
his
smooth
chin
and
smiling
down
at
Harry
but
as
you
know
the
age
restriction
was
only
imposed
this
year
as
an
extra
safety
measure
and
as
his
name's
come
out
of
the
goblet
i
mean
I
don't
think
there
can
be
any
ducking
out
at
this
stage
it's
down
in
the
rules
you're
obliged
harry
will
just
have
to
do
the
best
he
the
door
behind
them
opened
again
and
a
large
group
of
people
came
in
Professor
Dumbledore
followed
closely
by
mr.
Crouch
Professor
Karkaroff
Madame
Maxime
Professor
McGonagall
and
Professor
Snape
harry
heard
the
buzzing
of
the
hundreds
of
students
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
before
Professor
mcGonagall
closed
the
door
madame
Maxime
said
Fleur
at
once
striding
over
to
her
headmistress
zey
are
saying
zat
zis
little
boy
is
to
compete
also
somewhere
under
harry's
numb
disbelief
he
felt
a
ripple
of
anger
little
boy
madame
Maxime
had
drawn
herself
up
to
her
full
and
considerable
height
the
top
of
her
handsome
head
brushed
the
candlefilled
chandelier
and
her
gigantic
blacksatin
bosom
swelled
what
is
ze
meaning
of
zis
Dumblydorr
she
said
imperiously
i'd
rather
like
to
know
that
myself
Dumbledore
said
Professor
Karkaroff
he
was
wearing
a
steely
smile
and
his
blue
eyes
were
like
chips
of
ice
two
Hogwarts
champions
i
don't
remember
anyone
telling
me
the
host
school
is
allowed
two
champions
or
have
I
not
read
the
rules
carefully
enough
he
gave
a
short
and
nasty
laugh
c'est
impossible
said
Madame
Maxime
whose
enormous
hand
with
its
many
superb
opals
was
resting
upon
fleur's
shoulder
ogwarts
cannot
ave
two
champions
it
is
most
injust
we
were
under
the
impression
that
your
Age
Line
would
keep
out
younger
contestants
Dumbledore
said
Karkaroff
his
steely
smile
still
in
place
though
his
eyes
were
colder
than
ever
otherwise
we
would
of
course
have
brought
along
a
wider
selection
of
candidates
from
our
own
schools
it's
no
one's
fault
but
potter's
Karkaroff
said
Snape
softly
his
black
eyes
were
alight
with
malice
don't
go
blaming
Dumbledore
for
potter's
determination
to
break
rules
he
has
been
crossing
lines
ever
since
he
arrived
here
thank
you
Severus
said
Dumbledore
firmly
and
Snape
went
quiet
though
his
eyes
still
glinted
malevolently
through
his
curtain
of
greasy
black
hair
professor
Dumbledore
was
now
looking
down
at
Harry
who
looked
right
back
at
him
trying
to
discern
the
expression
of
the
eyes
behind
the
halfmoon
spectacles
did
you
put
your
name
into
the
Goblet
of
Fire
Harry
he
asked
calmly
no
said
Harry
he
was
very
aware
of
everybody
watching
him
closely
snape
made
a
soft
noise
of
impatient
disbelief
in
the
shadows
did
you
ask
an
older
student
to
put
it
into
the
Goblet
of
Fire
for
you
said
Professor
Dumbledore
ignoring
Snape
no
said
Harry
vehemently
ah
but
of
course
e
is
lying
cried
Madame
Maxime
snape
was
now
shaking
his
head
his
lip
curling
he
could
not
have
crossed
the
Age
Line
said
Professor
McGonagall
sharply
i
am
sure
we
are
all
agreed
on
that
dumblydorr
must
ave
made
a
mistake
wiz
ze
line
said
Madame
Maxime
shrugging
it
is
possible
of
course
said
Dumbledore
politely
dumbledore
you
know
perfectly
well
you
did
not
make
a
mistake
said
Professor
McGonagall
angrily
really
what
nonsense
harry
could
not
have
crossed
the
line
himself
and
as
Professor
Dumbledore
believes
that
he
did
not
persuade
an
older
student
to
do
it
for
him
i'm
sure
that
should
be
good
enough
for
everybody
else
she
shot
a
very
angry
look
at
Professor
Snape
mr.
Crouch
mr.
Bagman
said
Karkaroff
his
voice
unctuous
once
more
you
are
our
er
objective
judges
surely
you
will
agree
that
this
is
most
irregular
bagman
wiped
his
round
boyish
face
with
his
handkerchief
and
looked
at
Mr
crouch
who
was
standing
outside
the
circle
of
the
firelight
his
face
half
hidden
in
shadow
he
looked
slightly
eerie
the
half
darkness
making
him
look
much
older
giving
him
an
almost
skulllike
appearance
when
he
spoke
however
it
was
in
his
usual
curt
voice
we
must
follow
the
rules
and
the
rules
state
clearly
that
those
people
whose
names
come
out
of
the
Goblet
of
Fire
are
bound
to
compete
in
the
tournament
well
Barty
knows
the
rule
book
back
to
front
said
Bagman
beaming
and
turning
back
to
Karkaroff
and
Madame
Maxime
as
though
the
matter
was
now
closed
i
insist
upon
resubmitting
the
names
of
the
rest
of
my
students
said
Karkaroff
he
had
dropped
his
unctuous
tone
and
his
smile
now
his
face
wore
a
very
ugly
look
indeed
you
will
set
up
the
Goblet
of
Fire
once
more
and
we
will
continue
adding
names
until
each
school
has
two
champions
it's
only
fair
Dumbledore
but
Karkaroff
it
doesn't
work
like
that
said
Bagman
the
Goblet
of
fire's
just
gone
out
it
won't
reignite
until
the
start
of
the
next
tournament
in
which
Durmstrang
will
most
certainly
not
be
competing
exploded
Karkaroff
after
all
our
meetings
and
negotiations
and
compromises
I
little
expected
something
of
this
nature
to
occur
i
have
half
a
mind
to
leave
now
empty
threat
Karkaroff
growled
a
voice
from
near
the
door
you
can't
leave
your
champion
now
he's
got
to
compete
they've
all
got
to
compete
binding
magical
contract
like
Dumbledore
said
convenient
eh
moody
had
just
entered
the
room
he
limped
toward
the
fire
and
with
every
right
step
he
took
there
was
a
loud
clunk
convenient
said
Karkaroff
i'm
afraid
I
don't
understand
you
Moody
harry
could
tell
he
was
trying
to
sound
disdainful
as
though
what
Moody
was
saying
was
barely
worth
his
notice
but
his
hands
gave
him
away
they
had
balled
themselves
into
fists
don't
you
said
Moody
quietly
it's
very
simple
Karkaroff
someone
put
potter's
name
in
that
goblet
knowing
he'd
have
to
compete
if
it
came
out
evidently
someone
oo
wished
to
give
Ogwarts
two
bites
at
ze
apple
said
Madame
Maxime
i
quite
agree
Madame
Maxime
said
Karkaroff
bowing
to
her
i
shall
be
lodging
complaints
with
the
Ministry
of
Magic
and
the
International
Confederation
of
Wizards
if
anyone's
got
reason
to
complain
it's
Potter
growled
Moody
but
funny
thing
i
don't
hear
him
saying
a
word
why
should
e
complain
burst
out
Fleur
Delacour
stamping
her
foot
e
as
ze
chance
to
compete
asn't
e
we
ave
all
been
oping
to
be
chosen
for
weeks
and
weeks
ze
honor
for
our
schools
a
thousand
Galleons
in
prize
money
zis
is
a
chance
many
would
die
for
maybe
someone's
hoping
Potter
is
going
to
die
for
it
said
Moody
with
the
merest
trace
of
a
growl
an
extremely
tense
silence
followed
these
words
ludo
Bagman
who
was
looking
very
anxious
indeed
bounced
nervously
up
and
down
on
his
feet
and
said
Moody
old
man
what
a
thing
to
say
we
all
know
Professor
Moody
considers
the
morning
wasted
if
he
hasn't
discovered
six
plots
to
murder
him
before
lunchtime
said
Karkaroff
loudly
apparently
he
is
now
teaching
his
students
to
fear
assassination
too
an
odd
quality
in
a
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
teacher
Dumbledore
but
no
doubt
you
had
your
reasons
imagining
things
am
I
growled
Moody
seeing
things
eh
it
was
a
skilled
witch
or
wizard
who
put
the
boy's
name
in
that
goblet
ah
what
evidence
is
zere
of
zat
said
Madame
Maxime
throwing
up
her
huge
hands
because
they
hoodwinked
a
very
powerful
magical
object
said
Moody
it
would
have
needed
an
exceptionally
strong
Confundus
Charm
to
bamboozle
that
goblet
into
forgetting
that
only
three
schools
compete
in
the
tournament
i'm
guessing
they
submitted
potter's
name
under
a
fourth
school
to
make
sure
he
was
the
only
one
in
his
category
you
seem
to
have
given
this
a
great
deal
of
thought
Moody
said
Karkaroff
coldly
and
a
very
ingenious
theory
it
is
though
of
course
I
heard
you
recently
got
it
into
your
head
that
one
of
your
birthday
presents
contained
a
cunningly
disguised
basilisk
egg
and
smashed
it
to
pieces
before
realizing
it
was
a
carriage
clock
so
you'll
understand
if
we
don't
take
you
entirely
seriously
there
are
those
who'll
turn
innocent
occasions
to
their
advantage
Moody
retorted
in
a
menacing
voice
it's
my
job
to
think
the
way
Dark
wizards
do
Karkaroff
as
you
ought
to
remember
alastor
said
Dumbledore
warningly
harry
wondered
for
a
moment
whom
he
was
speaking
to
but
then
realized
MadEye
could
hardly
be
moody's
real
first
name
moody
fell
silent
though
still
surveying
Karkaroff
with
satisfaction
karkaroff's
face
was
burning
how
this
situation
arose
we
do
not
know
said
Dumbledore
speaking
to
everyone
gathered
in
the
room
it
seems
to
me
however
that
we
have
no
choice
but
to
accept
it
both
Cedric
and
Harry
have
been
chosen
to
compete
in
the
Tournament
this
therefore
they
will
do
ah
but
Dumblydorr
my
dear
Madame
Maxime
if
you
have
an
alternative
I
would
be
delighted
to
hear
it
dumbledore
waited
but
Madame
Maxime
did
not
speak
she
merely
glared
she
wasn't
the
only
one
either
snape
looked
furious
Karkaroff
livid
Bagman
however
looked
rather
excited
well
shall
we
crack
on
then
he
said
rubbing
his
hands
together
and
smiling
around
the
room
got
to
give
our
champions
their
instructions
haven't
we
barty
want
to
do
the
honors
mr.
Crouch
seemed
to
come
out
of
a
deep
reverie
yes
he
said
instructions
yes
the
first
task
he
moved
forward
into
the
firelight
close
up
Harry
thought
he
looked
ill
there
were
dark
shadows
beneath
his
eyes
and
a
thin
papery
look
about
his
wrinkled
skin
that
had
not
been
there
at
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
the
first
task
is
designed
to
test
your
daring
he
told
Harry
Cedric
Fleur
and
Viktor
so
we
are
not
going
to
be
telling
you
what
it
is
courage
in
the
face
of
the
unknown
is
an
important
quality
in
a
wizard
very
important
the
first
task
will
take
place
on
November
the
twentyfourth
in
front
of
the
other
students
and
the
panel
of
judges
the
champions
are
not
permitted
to
ask
for
or
accept
help
of
any
kind
from
their
teachers
to
complete
the
tasks
in
the
tournament
the
champions
will
face
the
first
challenge
armed
only
with
their
wands
they
will
receive
information
about
the
second
task
when
the
first
is
over
owing
to
the
demanding
and
timeconsuming
nature
of
the
tournament
the
champions
are
exempted
from
endofyear
tests
mr.
Crouch
turned
to
look
at
Dumbledore
i
think
that's
all
is
it
Albus
i
think
so
said
Dumbledore
who
was
looking
at
mr.
Crouch
with
mild
concern
are
you
sure
you
wouldn't
like
to
stay
at
Hogwarts
tonight
Barty
no
Dumbledore
I
must
get
back
to
the
Ministry
said
mr.
Crouch
it
is
a
very
busy
very
difficult
time
at
the
moment
i've
left
young
Weatherby
in
charge
very
enthusiastic
a
little
overenthusiastic
if
truth
be
told
you'll
come
and
have
a
drink
before
you
go
at
least
said
Dumbledore
come
on
Barry
i'm
staying
said
Bagman
brightly
it's
all
happening
at
Hogwarts
now
you
know
much
more
exciting
here
than
at
the
office
i
think
not
Ludo
said
Crouch
with
a
touch
of
his
old
impatience
professor
Karkaroff
Madame
Maxime
a
nightcap
said
Dumbledore
but
Madame
Maxime
had
already
put
her
arm
around
fleur's
shoulders
and
was
leading
her
swiftly
out
of
the
room
harry
could
hear
them
both
talking
very
fast
in
French
as
they
went
off
into
the
Great
Hall
karkaroff
beckoned
to
Krum
and
they
too
exited
though
in
silence
harry
Cedric
I
suggest
you
go
up
to
bed
said
Dumbledore
smiling
at
both
of
them
i
am
sure
Gryffindor
and
Hufflepuff
are
waiting
to
celebrate
with
you
and
it
would
be
a
shame
to
deprive
them
of
this
excellent
excuse
to
make
a
great
deal
of
mess
and
noise
harry
glanced
at
Cedric
who
nodded
and
they
left
together
the
Great
Hall
was
deserted
now
the
candles
had
burned
low
giving
the
jagged
smiles
of
the
pumpkins
an
eerie
flickering
quality
so
said
Cedric
with
a
slight
smile
we're
playing
against
each
other
again
i
s'pose
said
Harry
he
really
couldn't
think
of
anything
to
say
the
inside
of
his
head
seemed
to
be
in
complete
disarray
as
though
his
brain
had
been
ransacked
so
tell
me
said
Cedric
as
they
reached
the
entrance
hall
which
was
now
lit
only
by
torches
in
the
absence
of
the
Goblet
of
Fire
how
did
you
get
your
name
in
i
didn't
said
Harry
staring
up
at
him
i
didn't
put
it
in
i
was
telling
the
truth
ah
okay
said
Cedric
harry
could
tell
Cedric
didn't
believe
him
well
see
you
then
instead
of
going
up
the
marble
staircase
Cedric
headed
for
a
door
to
its
right
harry
stood
listening
to
him
going
down
the
stone
steps
beyond
it
then
slowly
he
started
to
climb
the
marble
ones
was
anyone
except
Ron
and
Hermione
going
to
believe
him
or
would
they
all
think
he'd
put
himself
in
for
the
tournament
yet
how
could
anyone
think
that
when
he
was
facing
competitors
who'd
had
three
years
more
magical
education
than
he
had
when
he
was
now
facing
tasks
that
not
only
sounded
very
dangerous
but
which
were
to
be
performed
in
front
of
hundreds
of
people
yes
he'd
thought
about
it
he'd
fantasized
about
it
but
it
had
been
a
joke
really
an
idle
sort
of
dream
he'd
never
really
seriously
considered
entering
but
someone
else
had
considered
it
someone
else
had
wanted
him
in
the
tournament
and
had
made
sure
he
was
entered
why
to
give
him
a
treat
he
didn't
think
so
somehow
to
see
him
make
a
fool
of
himself
well
they
were
likely
to
get
their
wish
but
to
get
him
killed
was
Moody
just
being
his
usual
paranoid
self
couldn't
someone
have
put
harry's
name
in
the
goblet
as
a
trick
a
practical
joke
did
anyone
really
want
him
dead
harry
was
able
to
answer
that
at
once
yes
someone
wanted
him
dead
someone
had
wanted
him
dead
ever
since
he
had
been
a
year
old
lord
Voldemort
but
how
could
Voldemort
have
ensured
that
harry's
name
got
into
the
Goblet
of
Fire
voldemort
was
supposed
to
be
far
away
in
some
distant
country
in
hiding
alone
feeble
and
powerless
yet
in
that
dream
he
had
had
just
before
he
had
awoken
with
his
scar
hurting
Voldemort
had
not
been
alone
he
had
been
talking
to
Wormtail
plotting
harry's
murder
harry
got
a
shock
to
find
himself
facing
the
Fat
Lady
already
he
had
barely
noticed
where
his
feet
were
carrying
him
it
was
also
a
surprise
to
see
that
she
was
not
alone
in
her
frame
the
wizened
witch
who
had
flitted
into
her
neighbor's
painting
when
he
had
joined
the
champions
downstairs
was
now
sitting
smugly
beside
the
Fat
Lady
she
must
have
dashed
through
every
picture
lining
seven
staircases
to
reach
here
before
him
both
she
and
the
Fat
Lady
were
looking
down
at
him
with
the
keenest
interest
well
well
well
said
the
Fat
Lady
violet's
just
told
me
everything
who's
just
been
chosen
as
school
champion
then
balderdash
said
Harry
dully
it
most
certainly
isn't
said
the
pale
witch
indignantly
no
no
Vi
it's
the
password
said
the
Fat
Lady
soothingly
and
she
swung
forward
on
her
hinges
to
let
Harry
into
the
common
room
the
blast
of
noise
that
met
harry's
ears
when
the
portrait
opened
almost
knocked
him
backward
next
thing
he
knew
he
was
being
wrenched
inside
the
common
room
by
about
a
dozen
pairs
of
hands
and
was
facing
the
whole
of
Gryffindor
House
all
of
whom
were
screaming
applauding
and
whistling
you
should've
told
us
you'd
entered
bellowed
Fred
he
looked
half
annoyed
half
deeply
impressed
how
did
you
do
it
without
getting
a
beard
brilliant
roared
George
i
didn't
Harry
said
i
don't
know
how
but
Angelina
had
now
swooped
down
upon
him
Oh
if
it
couldn't
be
me
at
least
it's
a
Gryffindor
you'll
be
able
to
pay
back
Diggory
for
that
last
Quidditch
match
Harry
shrieked
Katie
Bell
another
of
the
Gryffindor
Chasers
we've
got
food
Harry
come
and
have
some
i'm
not
hungry
I
had
enough
at
the
feast
but
nobody
wanted
to
hear
that
he
wasn't
hungry
nobody
wanted
to
hear
that
he
hadn't
put
his
name
in
the
goblet
not
one
single
person
seemed
to
have
noticed
that
he
wasn't
at
all
in
the
mood
to
celebrate
lee
Jordan
had
unearthed
a
Gryffindor
banner
from
somewhere
and
he
insisted
on
draping
it
around
Harry
like
a
cloak
harry
couldn't
get
away
whenever
he
tried
to
sidle
over
to
the
staircase
up
to
the
dormitories
the
crowd
around
him
closed
ranks
forcing
another
butterbeer
on
him
stuffing
crisps
and
peanuts
into
his
hands
everyone
wanted
to
know
how
he
had
done
it
how
he
had
tricked
dumbledore's
Age
Line
and
managed
to
get
his
name
into
the
goblet
i
didn't
he
said
over
and
over
again
I
don't
know
how
it
happened
but
for
all
the
notice
anyone
took
he
might
just
as
well
not
have
answered
at
all
i'm
tired
he
bellowed
finally
after
nearly
half
an
hour
no
seriously
George
i'm
going
to
bed
he
wanted
more
than
anything
to
find
Ron
and
Hermione
to
find
a
bit
of
sanity
but
neither
of
them
seemed
to
be
in
the
common
room
insisting
that
he
needed
to
sleep
and
almost
flattening
the
little
Creevey
brothers
as
they
attempted
to
waylay
him
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
Harry
managed
to
shake
everyone
off
and
climb
up
to
the
dormitory
as
fast
as
he
could
to
his
great
relief
he
found
Ron
was
lying
on
his
bed
in
the
otherwise
empty
dormitory
still
fully
dressed
he
looked
up
when
Harry
slammed
the
door
behind
him
where've
you
been
harry
said
oh
hello
said
Ron
he
was
grinning
but
it
was
a
very
odd
strained
sort
of
grin
harry
suddenly
became
aware
that
he
was
still
wearing
the
scarlet
Gryffindor
banner
that
Lee
had
tied
around
him
he
hastened
to
take
it
off
but
it
was
knotted
very
tightly
ron
lay
on
the
bed
without
moving
watching
Harry
struggle
to
remove
it
so
he
said
when
Harry
had
finally
removed
the
banner
and
thrown
it
into
a
corner
congratulations
what
d'you
mean
congratulations
said
Harry
staring
at
Ron
there
was
definitely
something
wrong
with
the
way
Ron
was
smiling
It
was
more
like
a
grimace
well
no
one
else
got
across
the
Age
Line
said
Ron
not
even
Fred
and
George
what
did
you
use
the
Invisibility
Cloak
the
Invisibility
Cloak
wouldn't
have
got
me
over
that
line
said
Harry
slowly
oh
right
said
Ron
i
thought
you
might've
told
me
if
it
was
the
cloak
because
it
would've
covered
both
of
us
wouldn't
it
but
you
found
another
way
did
you
listen
said
Harry
I
didn't
put
my
name
in
that
goblet
someone
else
must've
done
it
ron
raised
his
eyebrows
what
would
they
do
that
for
i
dunno
said
Harry
he
felt
it
would
sound
very
melodramatic
to
say
To
kill
me
ron's
eyebrows
rose
so
high
that
they
were
in
danger
of
disappearing
into
his
hair
it's
okay
you
know
you
can
tell
me
the
truth
he
said
if
you
don't
want
everyone
else
to
know
fine
but
I
don't
know
why
you're
bothering
to
lie
you
didn't
get
into
trouble
for
it
did
you
that
friend
of
the
Fat
lady's
that
Violet
she's
already
told
us
all
dumbledore's
letting
you
enter
a
thousand
Galleons
prize
money
eh
and
you
don't
have
to
do
endofyear
tests
either
i
didn't
put
my
name
in
that
goblet
said
Harry
starting
to
feel
angry
yeah
okay
said
Ron
in
exactly
the
same
sceptical
tone
as
Cedric
only
you
said
this
morning
you'd
have
done
it
last
night
and
no
one
would've
seen
you
i'm
not
stupid
you
know
you're
doing
a
really
good
impression
of
it
Harry
snapped
yeah
said
Ron
and
there
was
no
trace
of
a
grin
forced
or
otherwise
on
his
face
now
you
want
to
get
to
bed
Harry
i
expect
you'll
need
to
be
up
early
tomorrow
for
a
photocall
or
something
he
wrenched
the
hangings
shut
around
his
fourposter
leaving
Harry
standing
there
by
the
door
staring
at
the
dark
red
velvet
curtains
now
hiding
one
of
the
few
people
he
had
been
sure
would
believe
him
chapter
eighteen
the
weighing
of
the
wands
when
Harry
woke
up
on
Sunday
morning
it
took
him
a
moment
to
remember
why
he
felt
so
miserable
and
worried
then
the
memory
of
the
previous
night
rolled
over
him
he
sat
up
and
ripped
back
the
curtains
of
his
own
fourposter
intending
to
talk
to
Ron
to
force
Ron
to
believe
him
only
to
find
that
ron's
bed
was
empty
he
had
obviously
gone
down
to
breakfast
harry
dressed
and
went
down
the
spiral
staircase
into
the
common
room
the
moment
he
appeared
the
people
who
had
already
finished
breakfast
broke
into
applause
again
the
prospect
of
going
down
into
the
Great
Hall
and
facing
the
rest
of
the
Gryffindors
all
treating
him
like
some
sort
of
hero
was
not
inviting
it
was
that
however
or
stay
here
and
allow
himself
to
be
cornered
by
the
Creevey
brothers
who
were
both
beckoning
frantically
to
him
to
join
them
he
walked
resolutely
over
to
the
portrait
hole
pushed
it
open
climbed
out
of
it
and
found
himself
facetoface
with
Hermione
hello
she
said
holding
up
a
stack
of
toast
which
she
was
carrying
in
a
napkin
i
brought
you
this
want
to
go
for
a
walk
good
idea
said
Harry
gratefully
they
went
downstairs
crossed
the
entrance
hall
quickly
without
looking
in
at
the
Great
Hall
and
were
soon
striding
across
the
lawn
toward
the
lake
where
the
Durmstrang
ship
was
moored
reflected
blackly
in
the
water
it
was
a
chilly
morning
and
they
kept
moving
munching
their
toast
as
Harry
told
Hermione
exactly
what
had
happened
after
he
had
left
the
Gryffindor
table
the
night
before
to
his
immense
relief
Hermione
accepted
his
story
without
question
well
of
course
I
knew
you
hadn't
entered
yourself
she
said
when
he'd
finished
telling
her
about
the
scene
in
the
chamber
off
the
Hall
the
look
on
your
face
when
Dumbledore
read
out
your
name
but
the
question
is
who
did
put
it
in
because
moody's
right
Harry
i
don't
think
any
student
could
have
done
it
they'd
never
be
able
to
fool
the
Goblet
or
get
over
dumbledore's
have
you
seen
Ron
harry
interrupted
hermione
hesitated
erm
yes
he
was
at
breakfast
she
said
does
he
still
think
I
entered
myself
well
no
I
don't
think
so
not
really
said
Hermione
awkwardly
what's
that
supposed
to
mean
not
really
oh
Harry
isn't
it
obvious
hermione
said
despairingly
he's
jealous
jealous
harry
said
incredulously
jealous
of
what
he
wants
to
make
a
prat
of
himself
in
front
of
the
whole
school
does
he
look
said
Hermione
patiently
it's
always
you
who
gets
all
the
attention
you
know
it
is
i
know
it's
not
your
fault
she
added
quickly
seeing
Harry
open
his
mouth
furiously
i
know
you
don't
ask
for
it
but
well
you
know
ron's
got
all
those
brothers
to
compete
against
at
home
and
you're
his
best
friend
and
you're
really
famous
he's
always
shunted
to
one
side
whenever
people
see
you
and
he
puts
up
with
it
and
he
never
mentions
it
but
I
suppose
this
is
just
one
time
too
many
great
said
Harry
bitterly
really
great
tell
him
from
me
i'll
swap
any
time
he
wants
tell
him
from
me
he's
welcome
to
it
people
gawping
at
my
forehead
everywhere
I
go
i'm
not
teiling
him
anything
Hermione
said
shortly
tell
him
yourself
it's
the
only
way
to
sort
this
out
i'm
not
running
around
after
him
trying
to
make
him
grow
up
harry
said
so
loudly
that
several
owls
in
a
nearby
tree
took
flight
in
alarm
maybe
he'll
believe
i'm
not
enjoying
myself
once
i've
got
my
neck
broken
or
that's
not
funny
said
Hermione
quietly
that's
not
funny
at
all
she
looked
extremely
anxious
harry
i've
been
thinking
you
know
what
we've
got
to
do
don't
you
straight
away
the
moment
we
get
back
to
the
castle
yeah
give
Ron
a
good
kick
up
the
write
to
Sirius
you've
got
to
tell
him
what's
happened
he
asked
you
to
keep
him
posted
on
everything
that's
going
on
at
Hogwarts
it's
almost
as
if
he
expected
something
like
this
to
happen
i
brought
some
parchment
and
a
quill
out
with
me
come
off
it
said
Harry
looking
around
to
check
that
they
couldn't
be
overheard
but
the
grounds
were
quite
deserted
he
came
back
to
the
country
just
because
my
scar
twinged
he'll
probably
come
bursting
right
into
the
castle
if
I
tell
him
someone's
entered
me
in
the
Triwizard
Tournament
he'd
want
you
to
tell
him
said
Hermione
sternly
he's
going
to
find
out
anyway
how
harry
this
isn't
going
to
be
kept
quiet
said
Hermione
very
seriously
this
tournament's
famous
and
you're
famous
i'll
be
really
surprised
if
there
isn't
anything
in
the
Daily
Prophet
about
you
competing
you're
already
in
half
the
books
about
YouKnowWho
you
know
and
Sirius
would
rather
hear
it
from
you
I
know
he
would
okay
okay
i'll
write
to
him
said
Harry
throwing
his
last
piece
of
toast
into
the
lake
they
both
stood
and
watched
it
floating
there
for
a
moment
before
a
large
tentacle
rose
out
of
the
water
and
scooped
it
beneath
the
surface
then
they
returned
to
the
castle
whose
owl
am
I
going
to
use
harry
said
as
they
climbed
the
stairs
he
told
me
not
to
use
Hedwig
again
ask
Ron
if
you
can
borrow
i'm
not
asking
Ron
for
anything
Harry
said
flatly
well
borrow
one
of
the
school
owls
then
anyone
can
use
them
said
Hermione
they
went
up
to
the
Owlery
hermione
gave
Harry
a
piece
of
parchment
a
quill
and
a
bottle
of
ink
then
strolled
around
the
long
lines
of
perches
looking
at
all
the
different
owls
while
Harry
sat
down
against
a
wall
and
wrote
his
letter
dear
Sirius
You
told
me
to
keep
you
posted
on
what's
happening
at
Hogwarts
so
here
goes
I
don't
know
if
you've
heard
but
the
Triwizard
tournament's
happening
this
year
and
on
Saturday
night
I
got
picked
as
a
fourth
champion
i
don't
who
put
my
name
in
the
Goblet
of
Fire
because
I
didn't
the
other
Hogwarts
champion
is
Cedric
Diggory
from
Hufflepuff
He
paused
at
this
point
thinking
he
had
an
urge
to
say
something
about
the
large
weight
of
anxiety
that
seemed
to
have
settled
inside
his
chest
since
last
night
but
he
couldn't
think
how
to
translate
this
into
words
so
he
simply
dipped
his
quill
back
into
the
ink
bottle
and
wrote
Hope
you're
okay
and
Buckbeak
Harry
Finished
he
told
Hermione
getting
to
his
feet
and
brushing
straw
off
his
robes
at
this
Hedwig
fluttered
down
onto
his
shoulder
and
held
out
her
leg
i
can't
use
you
Harry
told
her
looking
around
for
the
school
owls
i've
got
to
use
one
of
these
hedwig
gave
a
very
loud
hoot
and
took
off
so
suddenly
that
her
talons
cut
into
his
shoulder
she
kept
her
back
to
Harry
all
the
time
he
was
tying
his
letter
to
the
leg
of
a
large
barn
owl
when
the
barn
owl
had
flown
off
Harry
reached
out
to
stroke
Hedwig
but
she
clicked
her
beak
furiously
and
soared
up
into
the
rafters
out
of
reach
first
Ron
then
you
Harry
said
angrily
this
isn't
my
fault
if
Harry
had
thought
that
matters
would
improve
once
everyone
got
used
to
the
idea
of
him
being
champion
the
following
day
showed
him
how
mistaken
he
was
he
could
no
longer
avoid
the
rest
of
the
school
once
he
was
back
at
lessons
and
it
was
clear
that
the
rest
of
the
school
just
like
the
Gryffindors
thought
Harry
had
entered
himself
for
the
tournament
unlike
the
Gryffindors
however
they
did
not
seem
impressed
the
Hufflepuffs
who
were
usually
on
excellent
terms
with
the
Gryffindors
had
turned
remarkably
cold
toward
the
whole
lot
of
them
one
Herbology
lesson
was
enough
to
demonstrate
this
it
was
plain
that
the
Hufflepuffs
felt
that
Harry
had
stolen
their
champion's
glory
a
feeling
exacerbated
perhaps
by
the
fact
that
Hufflepuff
House
very
rarely
got
any
glory
and
that
Cedric
was
one
of
the
few
who
had
ever
given
them
any
having
beaten
Gryffindor
once
at
Quidditch
ernie
Macmillan
and
Justin
FinchFletchley
with
whom
Harry
normally
got
on
very
well
did
not
talk
to
him
even
though
they
were
repotting
Bouncing
Bulbs
at
the
same
tray
though
they
did
laugh
rather
unpleasantly
when
one
of
the
Bouncing
Bulbs
wriggled
free
from
harry's
grip
and
smacked
him
hard
in
the
face
ron
wasn't
talking
to
Harry
either
hermione
sat
between
them
making
very
forced
conversation
but
though
both
answered
her
normally
they
avoided
making
eye
contact
with
each
other
harry
thought
even
Professor
Sprout
seemed
distant
with
him
but
then
she
was
Head
of
Hufflepuff
House
he
would
have
been
looking
forward
to
seeing
Hagrid
under
normal
circumstances
but
Care
of
Magical
Creatures
meant
seeing
the
Slytherins
too
the
first
time
he
would
come
facetoface
with
them
since
becoming
champion
predictably
Malfoy
arrived
at
hagrid's
cabin
with
his
familiar
sneer
firmly
in
place
ah
look
boys
it's
the
champion
he
said
to
Crabbe
and
Goyle
the
moment
he
got
within
earshot
of
Harry
got
your
autograph
books
better
get
a
signature
now
because
I
doubt
he's
going
to
be
around
much
longer
half
the
Triwizard
champions
have
died
how
long
d'you
reckon
you're
going
to
last
Potter
ten
minutes
into
the
first
task's
my
bet
crabbe
and
Goyle
guffawed
sycophantically
but
Malfoy
had
to
stop
there
because
Hagrid
emerged
from
the
back
of
his
cabin
balancing
a
teetering
tower
of
crates
each
containing
a
very
large
BlastEnded
Skrewt
to
the
class's
horror
Hagrid
proceeded
to
explain
that
the
reason
the
skrewts
had
been
killing
one
another
was
an
excess
of
pentup
energy
and
that
the
solution
would
be
for
each
student
to
fix
a
leash
on
a
skrewt
and
take
it
for
a
short
walk
the
only
good
thing
about
this
plan
was
that
it
distracted
Malfoy
completely
take
this
thing
for
a
walk
he
repeated
in
disgust
staring
into
one
of
the
boxes
and
where
exactly
are
we
supposed
to
fix
the
leash
around
the
sting
the
blasting
end
or
the
sucker
roun
the
middle
said
Hagrid
demonstrating
er
yeh
might
want
ter
put
on
yer
dragonhide
gloves
jus
as
an
extra
precaution
like
harry
you
come
here
an
help
me
with
this
big
one
hagrid's
real
intention
however
was
totalk
to
Harry
away
from
the
rest
of
the
class
he
waited
until
everyone
else
had
set
off
with
their
skrewts
then
turned
to
Harry
and
said
very
seriously
So
yer
competin
Harry
in
the
tournament
school
champion
one
of
the
champions
Harry
corrected
him
hagrid's
beetleblack
eyes
looked
very
anxious
under
his
wild
eyebrows
no
idea
who
put
yeh
in
fer
it
Harry
you
believe
I
didn't
do
it
then
said
Harry
concealing
with
difficulty
the
rush
of
gratitude
he
felt
at
hagrid's
words
course
I
do
Hagrid
grunted
yeh
say
it
wasn
you
an
I
believe
yeh
an
Dumbledore
believes
yer
an
all
wish
I
knew
who
did
do
it
said
Harry
bitterly
the
pair
of
them
looked
out
over
the
lawn
the
class
was
widely
scattered
now
and
all
in
great
difficulty
the
skrewts
were
now
over
three
feet
long
and
extremely
powerful
no
longer
shellless
and
colorless
they
had
developed
a
kind
of
thick
grayish
shiny
armor
they
looked
like
a
cross
between
giant
scorpions
and
elongated
crabs
but
still
without
recognizable
heads
or
eyes
they
had
become
immensely
strong
and
very
hard
to
control
look
like
they're
havin
fun
don
they
hagrid
said
happily
harry
assumed
he
was
talking
about
the
skrewts
because
his
classmates
certainly
weren't
every
now
and
then
with
an
alarming
bang
one
of
the
skrewts
ends
would
explode
causing
it
to
shoot
forward
several
yards
and
more
than
one
person
was
being
dragged
along
on
their
stomach
trying
desperately
to
get
back
on
their
feet
ah
I
don
know
Harry
Hagrid
sighed
suddenly
looking
back
down
at
him
with
a
worried
expression
on
his
face
school
champion
everythin
seems
ter
happen
ter
you
doesn
it
harry
didn't
answer
yes
everything
did
seem
to
happen
to
him
that
was
more
or
less
what
Hermione
had
said
as
they
had
walked
around
the
lake
and
that
was
the
reason
according
to
her
that
Ron
was
no
longer
talking
to
him
the
next
few
days
were
some
of
harry's
worst
at
Hogwarts
the
closest
he
had
ever
come
to
feeling
like
this
had
been
during
those
months
in
his
second
year
when
a
large
part
of
the
school
had
suspected
him
of
attacking
his
fellow
students
but
Ron
had
been
on
his
side
then
he
thought
he
could
have
coped
with
the
rest
of
the
school's
behavior
if
he
could
just
have
had
Ron
back
as
a
friend
but
he
wasn't
going
to
try
and
persuade
Ron
to
talk
to
him
if
Ron
didn't
want
to
nevertheless
it
was
lonely
with
dislike
pouring
in
on
him
from
all
sides
he
could
understand
the
Hufflepuffs
attitude
even
if
he
didn't
like
it
they
had
their
own
champion
to
support
he
expected
nothing
less
than
vicious
insults
from
the
Slytherins
he
was
highly
unpopular
there
and
always
had
been
because
he
had
helped
Gryffindor
beat
them
so
often
both
at
Quidditch
and
in
the
Inter
House
Championship
but
he
had
hoped
the
Ravenclaws
might
have
found
it
in
their
hearts
to
support
him
as
much
as
Cedric
he
was
wrong
however
most
Ravenclaws
seemed
to
think
that
he
had
been
desperate
to
earn
himself
a
bit
more
fame
by
tricking
the
goblet
into
accepting
his
name
then
there
was
the
fact
that
Cedric
looked
the
part
of
a
champion
so
much
more
than
he
did
exceptionally
handsome
with
his
straight
nose
dark
hair
and
gray
eyes
it
was
hard
to
say
who
was
receiving
more
admiration
these
days
Cedric
or
Viktor
Krum
harry
actually
saw
the
same
sixthyear
girls
who
had
been
so
keen
to
get
krum's
autograph
begging
Cedric
to
sign
their
school
bags
one
lunchtime
meanwhile
there
was
no
reply
from
Sirius
Hedwig
was
refusing
to
come
anywhere
near
him
Professor
Trelawney
was
predicting
his
death
with
even
more
certainty
than
usual
and
he
did
so
badly
at
Summoning
Charms
in
Professor
flitwick's
class
that
he
was
given
extra
homework
the
only
person
to
get
any
apart
from
Neville
it's
really
not
that
difficult
Harry
Hermione
tried
to
reassure
him
as
they
left
flitwick's
class
she
had
been
making
objects
zoom
across
the
room
to
her
all
lesson
as
though
she
were
some
sort
of
weird
magnet
for
board
dusters
wastepaper
baskets
and
lunascopes
you
just
weren't
concentrating
properly
wonder
why
that
was
said
Harry
darkly
as
Cedric
Diggory
walked
past
surrounded
by
a
large
group
of
simpering
girls
all
of
whom
looked
at
Harry
as
though
he
were
a
particularly
large
BlastEnded
Skrewt
still
never
mind
eh
double
Potions
to
look
forward
to
this
afternoon
double
Potions
was
always
a
horrible
experience
but
these
days
it
was
nothing
short
of
torture
being
shut
in
a
dungeon
for
an
hour
and
a
half
with
Snape
and
the
Slytherins
all
of
whom
seemed
determined
to
punish
Harry
as
much
as
possible
for
daring
to
become
school
champion
was
about
the
most
unpleasant
thing
Harry
could
imagine
he
had
already
struggled
through
one
friday's
worth
with
Hermione
sitting
next
to
him
intoning
ignore
them
ignore
them
ignore
them
under
her
breath
and
he
couldn't
see
why
today
should
be
any
better
when
he
and
Hermione
arrived
at
snape's
dungeon
after
lunch
they
found
the
Slytherins
waiting
outside
each
and
every
one
of
them
wearing
a
large
badge
on
the
front
of
his
or
her
robes
for
one
wild
moment
Harry
thought
they
were
S
p.e.w.
badges
then
he
saw
that
they
all
bore
the
same
message
in
luminous
red
letters
that
burnt
brightly
in
the
dimly
lit
underground
passage
support
cedric
diggory
the
real
hogwarts
champion
like
them
Potter
said
Malfoy
loudly
as
Harry
approached
and
this
isn't
all
they
do
look
he
pressed
his
badge
into
his
chest
and
the
message
upon
it
vanished
to
be
replaced
by
another
one
which
glowed
green
potter
stinks
the
Slytherins
howled
with
laughter
each
of
them
pressed
their
badges
too
until
the
message
potter
stinks
was
shining
brightly
all
around
Harry
he
felt
the
heat
rise
in
his
face
and
neck
oh
very
funny
Hermione
said
sarcastically
to
Pansy
Parkinson
and
her
gang
of
Slytherin
girls
who
were
laughing
harder
than
anyone
really
witty
ron
was
standing
against
the
wall
with
Dean
and
Seamus
he
wasn't
laughing
but
he
wasn't
sticking
up
for
Harry
either
want
one
Granger
said
Malfoy
holding
out
a
badge
to
Hermione
i've
got
loads
but
don't
touch
my
hand
now
i've
just
washed
it
you
see
don't
want
a
Mudblood
sliming
it
up
some
of
the
anger
Harry
had
been
feeling
for
days
and
days
seemed
to
burst
through
a
dam
in
his
chest
he
had
reached
for
his
wand
before
he'd
thought
what
he
was
doing
people
all
around
them
scrambled
out
of
the
way
backing
down
the
corridor
harry
hermione
said
warningly
go
on
then
Potter
Malfoy
said
quietly
drawing
out
his
own
wand
moody's
not
here
to
look
after
you
now
do
it
if
you've
got
the
guts
for
a
split
second
they
looked
into
each
other's
eyes
then
at
exactly
the
same
time
both
acted
funnunculus
harry
yelled
densaugeo
screamed
Malfoy
jets
of
light
shot
from
both
wands
hit
each
other
in
midair
and
ricocheted
off
at
angles
harry's
hit
Goyle
in
the
face
and
malfoy's
hit
Hermione
goyle
bellowed
and
put
his
hands
to
his
nose
where
great
ugly
boils
were
springing
up
Hermione
whimpering
in
panic
was
clutching
her
mouth
hermione
ron
had
hurried
forward
to
see
what
was
wrong
with
her
Harry
turned
and
saw
Ron
dragging
hermione's
hand
away
from
her
face
it
wasn't
a
pretty
sight
hermione's
front
teeth
already
larger
than
average
were
now
growing
at
an
alarming
rate
she
was
looking
more
and
more
like
a
beaver
as
her
teeth
elongated
past
her
bottom
lip
toward
her
chin
panicstricken
she
felt
them
and
let
out
a
terrified
cry
and
what
is
all
this
noise
about
said
a
soft
deadly
voice
snape
had
arrived
the
Slytherins
clamored
to
give
their
explanations
Snape
pointed
a
long
yellow
finger
at
Malfoy
and
said
Explain
potter
attacked
me
sir
we
attacked
each
other
at
the
same
time
harry
shouted
and
he
hit
Goyle
look
snape
examined
Goyle
whose
face
now
resembled
something
that
would
have
been
at
home
in
a
book
on
poisonous
fungi
hospital
wing
Goyle
Snape
said
calmly
malfoy
got
Hermione
ron
said
look
he
forced
Hermione
to
show
Snape
her
teeth
she
was
doing
her
best
to
hide
them
with
her
hands
though
this
was
difficult
as
they
had
now
grown
down
past
her
collar
pansy
Parkinson
and
the
other
Slytherin
girls
were
doubled
up
with
silent
giggles
pointing
at
Hermione
from
behind
snape's
back
snape
looked
coldly
at
Hermione
then
said
I
see
no
difference
hermione
let
out
a
whimper
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
she
turned
on
her
heel
and
ran
ran
all
the
way
up
the
corridor
and
out
of
sight
it
was
lucky
perhaps
that
both
Harry
and
Ron
started
shouting
at
Snape
at
the
same
time
lucky
their
voices
echoed
so
much
in
the
stone
corridor
for
in
the
confused
din
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
hear
exactly
what
they
were
calling
him
he
got
the
gist
however
let's
see
he
said
in
his
silkiest
voice
fifty
points
from
Gryffindor
and
a
detention
each
for
Potter
and
Weasley
now
get
inside
or
it'll
be
a
week's
worth
of
detentions
harry's
ears
were
ringing
the
injustice
of
it
made
him
want
to
curse
Snape
into
a
thousand
slimy
pieces
he
passed
Snape
walked
with
Ron
to
the
back
of
the
dungeon
and
slammed
his
bag
down
onto
the
table
ron
was
shaking
with
anger
too
for
a
moment
it
felt
as
though
everything
was
back
to
normal
between
them
but
then
Ron
turned
and
sat
down
with
Dean
and
Seamus
instead
leaving
Harry
alone
at
his
table
on
the
other
side
of
the
dungeon
Malfoy
turned
his
back
on
Snape
and
pressed
his
badge
smirking
potter
stinks
flashed
once
more
across
the
room
harry
sat
there
staring
at
Snape
as
the
lesson
began
picturing
horrific
things
happening
to
him
if
only
he
knew
how
to
do
the
Cruciatus
Curse
he'd
have
Snape
flat
on
his
back
like
that
spider
jerking
and
twitching
antidotes
said
Snape
looking
around
at
them
all
his
cold
black
eyes
glittering
unpleasantly
you
should
all
have
prepared
your
recipes
now
i
want
you
to
brew
them
carefully
and
then
we
will
be
selecting
someone
on
whom
to
test
one
snape's
eyes
met
harry's
and
Harry
knew
what
was
coming
snape
was
going
to
poison
him
harry
imagined
picking
up
his
cauldron
and
sprinting
to
the
front
of
the
class
and
bringing
it
down
on
snape's
greasy
head
And
then
a
knock
on
the
dungeon
door
burst
in
on
harry's
thoughts
it
was
Colin
Creevey
he
edged
into
the
room
beaming
at
Harry
and
walked
up
to
snape's
desk
at
the
front
of
the
room
yes
said
Snape
curtly
please
sir
i'm
supposed
to
take
Harry
Potter
upstairs
snape
stared
down
his
hooked
nose
at
Colin
whose
smile
faded
from
his
eager
face
potter
has
another
hour
of
Potions
to
complete
said
Snape
coldly
he
will
come
upstairs
when
this
class
is
finished
colin
went
pink
sir
sir
mr.
Bagman
wants
him
he
said
nervously
all
the
champions
have
got
to
go
I
think
they
want
to
take
photographs
harry
would
have
given
anything
he
owned
to
have
stopped
Colin
saying
those
last
few
words
he
chanced
half
a
glance
at
Ron
but
Ron
was
staring
determinedly
at
the
ceiling
very
well
very
well
Snape
snapped
potter
leave
your
things
here
I
want
you
back
down
here
later
to
test
your
antidote
please
sir
he's
got
to
take
his
things
with
him
squeaked
Cohn
all
the
champions
very
well
said
Snape
potter
take
your
bag
and
get
out
of
my
sight
harry
swung
his
bag
over
his
shoulder
got
up
and
headed
for
the
door
as
he
walked
through
the
Slytherin
desks
potter
stinks
flashed
at
him
from
every
direction
it's
amazing
isn't
it
Harry
said
Colin
starting
to
speak
the
moment
Harry
had
closed
the
dungeon
door
behind
him
isn't
it
though
you
being
champion
yeah
really
amazing
said
Harry
heavily
as
they
set
off
toward
the
steps
into
the
entrance
hall
what
do
they
want
photos
for
Colin
the
Daily
Prophet
I
think
great
said
Harry
dully
exactly
what
I
need
more
publicity
good
luck
said
Colin
when
they
had
reached
the
right
room
harry
knocked
on
the
door
and
entered
he
was
in
a
fairly
small
classroom
most
of
the
desks
had
been
pushed
away
to
the
back
of
the
room
leaving
a
large
space
in
the
middle
three
of
them
however
had
been
placed
endtoend
in
front
of
the
blackboard
and
covered
with
a
long
length
of
velvet
five
chairs
had
been
set
behind
the
velvetcovered
desks
and
Ludo
Bagman
was
sitting
in
one
of
them
talking
to
a
witch
Harry
had
never
seen
before
who
was
wearing
magenta
robes
viktor
Krum
was
standing
moodily
in
a
corner
as
usual
and
not
talking
to
anybody
cedric
and
Fheur
were
in
conversation
fheur
looked
a
good
deal
happier
than
Harry
had
seen
her
so
far
she
kept
throwing
back
her
head
so
that
her
long
silvery
hair
caught
the
light
a
paunchy
man
holding
a
large
black
camera
that
was
smoking
slightly
was
watching
Fleur
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
bagman
suddenly
spotted
Harry
got
up
quickly
and
bounded
forward
ah
here
he
is
champion
number
four
in
you
come
Harry
in
you
come
nothing
to
worry
about
it's
just
the
wand
weighing
ceremony
the
rest
of
the
judges
will
be
here
in
a
moment
wand
weighing
harry
repeated
nervously
we
have
to
check
that
your
wands
are
fully
functional
no
problems
you
know
as
they're
your
most
important
tools
in
the
tasks
ahead
said
Bagman
the
expert's
upstairs
now
with
Dumbledore
and
then
there's
going
to
be
a
little
photo
shoot
this
is
Rita
Skeeter
he
added
gesturing
toward
the
witch
in
magenta
robes
she's
doing
a
small
piece
on
the
tournament
for
the
Daily
Prophet
maybe
not
that
small
Ludo
said
Rita
Skeeter
her
eyes
on
Harry
her
hair
was
set
in
elaborate
and
curiously
rigid
curls
that
contrasted
oddly
with
her
heavyjawed
face
she
wore
jeweled
spectacles
the
thick
fingers
clutching
her
crocodileskin
handbag
ended
in
twoinch
nails
painted
crimson
i
wonder
if
I
could
have
a
little
word
with
Harry
before
we
start
she
said
to
Bagman
but
still
gazing
fixedly
at
Harry
the
youngest
champion
you
know
to
add
a
bit
of
color
certainly
cried
Bagman
that
is
if
Harry
has
no
objection
er
said
Harry
lovely
said
Rita
Skeeter
and
in
a
second
her
scarlettaloned
fingers
had
harry's
upper
arm
in
a
surprisingly
strong
grip
and
she
was
steering
him
out
of
the
room
again
and
opening
a
nearby
door
we
don't
want
to
be
in
there
with
all
that
noise
she
said
let's
see
ah
yes
this
is
nice
and
cozy
it
was
a
broom
cupboard
harry
stared
at
her
come
along
dear
that's
right
lovely
said
Rita
Skeeter
again
perching
herself
precariously
upon
an
upturned
bucket
pushing
Harry
down
onto
a
cardboard
box
and
closing
the
door
throwing
them
into
darkness
let's
see
now
she
unsnapped
her
crocodileskin
handbag
and
pulled
out
a
handful
of
candles
which
she
lit
with
a
wave
of
her
wand
and
magicked
into
midair
so
that
they
could
see
what
they
were
doing
you
won't
mind
Harry
if
I
use
a
QuickQuotes
Quill
it
leaves
me
free
to
talk
to
you
normally
a
what
said
Harry
rita
skeeter's
smile
widened
harry
counted
three
gold
teeth
she
reached
again
into
her
crocodile
bag
and
drew
out
a
long
acidgreen
quill
and
a
roll
of
parchment
which
she
stretched
out
between
them
on
a
crate
of
Mrs
skower's
All
Purpose
Magical
Mess
Remover
she
put
the
tip
of
the
green
quill
into
her
mouth
sucked
it
for
a
moment
with
apparent
relish
then
placed
it
upright
on
the
parchment
where
it
stood
balanced
on
its
point
quivering
slightly
testing
my
name
is
Rita
Skeeter
Daily
Prophet
reporter
harry
hooked
down
quickly
at
the
quill
the
moment
Rita
Skeeter
had
spoken
the
green
quill
had
started
to
scribble
skidding
across
the
parchment
Attractive
blonde
Rita
Skeeter
fortythree
who's
savage
quill
has
punctured
many
inflated
reputations
Lovely
said
Rita
Skeeter
yet
again
and
she
ripped
the
top
piece
of
parchment
off
crumpled
it
up
and
stuffed
it
into
her
handbag
now
she
leaned
toward
Harry
and
said
So
Harry
what
made
you
decide
to
enter
the
Triwizard
Tournament
er
said
Harry
again
but
he
was
distracted
by
the
quill
even
though
he
wasn't
speaking
it
was
dashing
across
the
parchment
and
in
its
wake
he
could
make
out
a
fresh
sentence
An
ugly
scar
souvenier
of
a
tragic
past
disfigures
the
otherwise
charming
face
of
Harry
Potter
whose
eyes
Ignore
the
quill
Harry
said
Rita
Skeeter
firmly
reluctantly
Harry
looked
up
at
her
instead
now
why
did
you
decide
to
enter
the
tournament
Harry
i
didn't
said
Harry
i
don't
know
how
my
name
got
into
the
Goblet
of
Fire
i
didn't
put
it
in
there
rita
Skeeter
raised
one
heavily
penciled
eyebrow
come
now
Harry
there's
no
need
to
be
scared
of
getting
into
trouble
we
all
know
you
shouldn't
really
have
entered
at
all
but
don't
worry
about
that
our
readers
hove
a
rebel
but
I
didn't
enter
Harry
repeated
i
don't
know
who
how
do
you
feel
about
the
tasks
ahead
said
Rita
Skeeter
excited
nervous
i
haven't
really
thought
yeah
nervous
I
suppose
said
Harry
his
insides
squirmed
uncomfortably
as
he
spoke
champions
have
died
in
the
past
haven't
they
said
Rita
Skeeter
briskly
have
you
thought
about
that
at
all
well
they
say
it's
going
to
be
a
lot
safer
this
year
said
Harry
the
quill
whizzed
across
the
parchment
between
them
back
and
forward
as
though
it
were
skating
of
course
you've
looked
death
in
the
face
before
haven't
you
said
Rita
Skeeter
watching
him
closely
how
would
you
say
that's
affected
you
er
said
Harry
yet
again
do
you
think
that
the
trauma
in
your
past
might
have
made
you
keen
to
prove
yourself
to
live
up
to
your
name
do
you
think
that
perhaps
you
were
tempted
to
enter
the
Triwizard
Tournament
because
i
didn't
enter
said
Harry
starting
to
feel
irritated
can
you
remember
your
parents
at
all
said
Rita
Skeeter
talking
over
him
no
said
Harry
how
do
you
think
they'd
feel
if
they
knew
you
were
competing
in
the
Triwizard
Tournament
proud
worried
angry
harry
was
feeling
really
annoyed
now
how
on
earth
was
he
to
know
how
his
parents
would
feel
if
they
were
alive
he
could
feel
Rita
Skeeter
watching
him
very
intently
frowning
he
avoided
her
gaze
and
hooked
down
at
words
the
quill
had
just
written
Tears
fill
those
startlingly
green
eyes
as
our
conversation
turns
to
the
parents
he
can
barely
remember
i
have
not
got
tears
in
my
eyes
said
Harry
loudly
before
Rita
Skeeter
could
say
a
word
the
door
of
the
broom
cupboard
was
pulled
open
harry
looked
around
blinking
in
the
bright
light
albus
Dumbledore
stood
there
looking
down
at
both
of
them
squashed
into
the
cupboard
dumbledore
cried
Rita
Skeeter
with
every
appearance
of
delight
but
Harry
noticed
that
her
quill
and
the
parchment
had
suddenly
vanished
from
the
box
of
Magical
Mess
Remover
and
rita's
clawed
fingers
were
hastily
snapping
shut
the
clasp
of
her
crocodileskin
bag
how
are
you
she
said
standing
up
and
holding
out
one
of
her
large
mannish
hands
to
Dumbledore
i
hope
you
saw
my
piece
over
the
summer
about
the
International
Confederation
of
Wizards
Conference
enchantingly
nasty
said
Dumbledore
his
eyes
twinkling
i
particularly
enjoyed
your
description
of
me
as
an
obsolete
dingbat
rita
Skeeter
didn't
look
remotely
abashed
i
was
just
making
the
point
that
some
of
your
ideas
are
a
little
oldfashioned
Dumbhedore
and
that
many
wizards
in
the
street
i
will
be
delighted
to
hear
the
reasoning
behind
the
rudeness
Rita
said
Dumbledore
with
a
courteous
bow
and
a
smile
but
i'm
afraid
we
will
have
to
discuss
the
matter
later
the
Weighing
of
the
Wands
is
about
to
start
and
it
cannot
take
place
if
one
of
our
champions
is
hidden
in
a
broom
cupboard
very
glad
to
get
away
from
Rita
Skeeter
Harry
hurried
back
into
the
room
the
other
champions
were
now
sitting
in
chairs
near
the
door
and
he
sat
down
quickly
next
to
Cedric
hooking
up
at
the
velvetcovered
table
where
four
of
the
five
judges
were
now
sitting
Professor
Karkaroff
Madame
Maxime
mr.
Crouch
and
Ludo
Bagman
rita
Skeeter
settled
herself
down
in
a
corner
Harry
saw
her
slip
the
parchment
out
of
her
bag
again
spread
it
on
her
knee
suck
the
end
of
the
QuickQuotes
Quill
and
place
it
once
more
on
the
parchment
may
I
introduce
mr.
Ollivander
said
Dumbledore
taking
his
place
at
the
judges
table
and
talking
to
the
champions
he
will
be
checking
your
wands
to
ensure
that
they
are
in
good
condition
before
the
tournament
harry
hooked
around
and
with
a
jolt
of
surprise
saw
an
old
wizard
with
large
pale
eyes
standing
quietly
by
the
window
harry
had
met
mr.
Ollivander
before
he
was
the
wandmaker
from
whom
Harry
had
bought
his
own
wand
over
three
years
ago
in
Diagon
Alley
mademoiselle
Delacour
could
we
have
you
first
please
said
mr.
Ollivander
stepping
into
the
empty
space
in
the
middle
of
the
room
fleur
Delacour
swept
over
to
mr.
Olhivander
and
handed
him
her
wand
hmm
he
said
he
twirled
the
wand
between
his
long
fingers
like
a
baton
and
it
emitted
a
number
of
pink
and
gold
sparks
then
he
held
it
chose
to
his
eyes
and
examined
it
carefully
yes
he
said
quietly
nine
and
a
half
inches
inflexible
rosewood
and
containing
dear
me
an
air
from
ze
ead
of
a
veela
said
Fleur
one
of
my
grandmuzzer's
so
Fleur
was
part
veela
thought
Harry
making
a
mental
note
to
tell
Ron
then
he
remembered
that
Ron
wasn't
speaking
to
him
yes
said
mr.
Ollivander
yes
i've
never
used
veela
hair
myself
of
course
i
find
it
makes
for
rather
temperamental
wands
however
to
each
his
own
and
if
this
suits
you
mr.
Ollivander
ran
his
fingers
along
the
wand
apparently
checking
for
scratches
or
bumps
then
he
muttered
Orchideous
and
a
bunch
of
flowers
burst
from
the
wand
tip
very
well
very
well
it's
in
fine
working
order
said
mr.
Ollivander
scooping
up
the
flowers
and
handing
them
to
Fleur
with
her
wand
mr.
Diggory
you
next
fleur
glided
back
to
her
seat
smiling
at
Cedric
as
he
passed
her
ah
now
this
is
one
of
mine
isn't
it
said
mr.
Ollivander
with
much
more
enthusiasm
as
Cedric
handed
over
his
wand
yes
I
remember
it
well
containing
a
single
hair
from
the
tail
of
a
particularly
fine
male
unicorn
must
have
been
seventeen
hands
nearly
gored
me
with
his
horn
after
I
plucked
his
tail
twelve
and
a
quarter
inches
ash
pleasantly
springy
it's
in
fine
condition
you
treat
it
regularly
polished
it
last
night
said
Cedric
grinning
harry
hooked
down
at
his
own
wand
he
could
see
finger
marks
all
over
it
he
gathered
a
fistful
of
robe
from
his
knee
and
tried
to
rub
it
clean
surreptitiously
several
gold
sparks
shot
out
of
the
end
of
it
fleur
Delacour
gave
him
a
very
patronizing
look
and
he
desisted
mr.
Ollivander
sent
a
stream
of
silver
smoke
rings
across
the
room
from
the
tip
of
cedric's
wand
pronounced
himself
satisfied
and
then
said
mr.
Krum
if
you
please
viktor
Krum
got
up
and
slouched
roundshouldered
and
duckfooted
toward
Mr
ollivander
he
thrust
out
his
wand
and
stood
scowling
with
his
hands
in
the
pockets
of
his
robes
hmm
said
mr.
Olhivander
this
is
a
Gregorovitch
creation
unless
i'm
much
mistaken
a
fine
wandmaker
though
the
styling
is
never
quite
what
I
however
he
lifted
the
wand
and
examined
it
minutely
turning
it
over
and
over
before
his
eyes
yes
hornbeam
and
dragon
heartstring
he
shot
at
Krum
who
nodded
rather
thicker
than
one
usually
sees
quite
rigid
ten
and
a
quarter
inches
avis
the
hornbeam
wand
let
off
a
blast
hike
a
gun
and
a
number
of
small
twittering
birds
flew
out
of
the
end
and
through
the
open
window
into
the
watery
sunlight
good
said
mr.
Ollivander
handing
Krum
back
his
wand
which
leaves
mr
potter
harry
got
to
his
feet
and
walked
past
Krum
to
mr.
Ollivander
he
handed
over
his
wand
aaaah
yes
said
mr.
Ohlivander
his
pale
eyes
suddenly
gleaming
yes
yes
yes
how
well
I
remember
harry
could
remember
too
he
could
remember
it
as
though
it
had
happened
yesterday
four
summers
ago
on
his
eleventh
birthday
he
had
entered
mr.
ollivander's
shop
with
Hagrid
to
buy
a
wand
mr.
Ollivander
had
taken
his
measurements
and
then
started
handing
him
wands
to
try
harry
had
waved
what
felt
like
every
wand
in
the
shop
until
at
last
he
had
found
the
one
that
suited
him
this
one
which
was
made
of
holly
eleven
inches
long
and
contained
a
single
feather
from
the
tail
of
a
phoenix
mr.
Ollivander
had
been
very
surprised
that
Harry
had
been
so
compatible
with
this
wand
curious
he
had
said
curious
and
not
until
Harry
asked
what
was
curious
had
mr.
Olhivander
explained
that
the
phoenix
feather
in
harry's
wand
had
come
from
the
same
bird
that
had
supplied
the
core
of
Lord
voldemort's
harry
had
never
shared
this
piece
of
information
with
anybody
he
was
very
fond
of
his
wand
and
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
its
relation
to
voldemort's
wand
was
something
it
couldn't
help
rather
as
he
couldn't
help
being
related
to
Aunt
Petunia
however
he
really
hoped
that
mr.
Ollivander
wasn't
about
to
tell
the
room
about
it
he
had
a
funny
feeling
Rita
skeeter's
QuickQuotes
Quill
might
just
explode
with
excitement
if
he
did
mr.
Ollivander
spent
much
longer
examining
harry's
wand
than
anyone
else's
eventually
however
he
made
a
fountain
of
wine
shoot
out
of
it
and
handed
it
back
to
Harry
announcing
that
it
was
still
in
perfect
condition
thank
you
all
said
Dumbledore
standing
up
at
the
judges
table
you
may
go
back
to
your
lessons
now
or
perhaps
it
would
be
quicker
just
to
go
down
to
dinner
as
they
are
about
to
end
feeling
that
at
last
something
had
gone
right
today
Harry
got
up
to
leave
but
the
man
with
the
black
camera
jumped
up
and
cleared
his
throat
photos
Dumbledore
photos
cried
Bagman
excitedly
all
the
judges
and
champions
what
do
you
think
Rita
er
yes
let's
do
those
first
said
Rita
Skeeter
whose
eyes
were
upon
Harry
again
and
then
perhaps
some
individual
shots
the
photographs
took
a
long
time
madame
Maxime
cast
everyone
else
into
shadow
wherever
she
stood
and
the
photographer
couldn't
stand
far
enough
back
to
get
her
into
the
frame
eventually
she
had
to
sit
while
everyone
else
stood
around
her
karkaroff
kept
twirling
his
goatee
around
his
finger
to
give
it
an
extra
curl
Krum
whom
Harry
would
have
thought
would
have
been
used
to
this
sort
of
thing
skulked
halfhidden
at
the
back
of
the
group
the
photographer
seemed
keenest
to
get
Fleur
at
the
front
but
Rita
Skeeter
kept
hurrying
forward
and
dragging
Harry
into
greater
prominence
then
she
insisted
on
separate
shots
of
all
the
champions
at
last
they
were
free
to
go
harry
went
down
to
dinner
hermione
wasn't
there
he
supposed
she
was
still
in
the
hospital
wing
having
her
teeth
fixed
he
ate
alone
at
the
end
of
the
table
then
returned
to
Gryffindor
Tower
thinking
of
all
the
extra
work
on
Summoning
Charms
that
he
had
to
do
up
in
the
dormitory
he
came
across
Ron
you've
had
an
owl
said
Ron
brusquely
the
moment
he
walked
in
he
was
pointing
at
harry's
pillow
the
school
barn
owl
was
waiting
for
him
there
oh
right
said
Harry
and
we've
got
to
do
our
detentions
tomorrow
night
snape's
dungeon
said
Ron
he
then
walked
straight
out
of
the
room
not
looking
at
Harry
for
a
moment
Harry
considered
going
after
him
he
wasn't
sure
whether
he
wanted
to
talk
to
him
or
hit
him
both
seemed
quite
appealing
but
the
lure
of
sirius's
answer
was
too
strong
harry
strode
over
to
the
barn
owl
took
the
letter
off
its
leg
and
unrolled
it
harry
I
can't
say
everything
I
would
like
to
in
a
letter
it's
too
risky
in
case
the
owl
is
intercepted
we
need
to
talk
facetoface
can
you
ensure
that
you
are
alone
by
the
fire
in
Gryffindor
Tower
at
one
o'clock
in
the
morning
on
the
nd
ofNovember
i
know
better
than
anyone
that
you
can
look
after
yourself
and
while
you're
around
Dumbledore
and
Moody
I
don't
think
anyone
will
be
able
to
hurt
you
however
someone
seems
to
be
having
a
good
try
entering
you
in
that
tournament
would
have
been
very
risky
especially
right
under
dumbkdore's
nose
be
on
the
watch
Harry
i
still
want
to
hear
about
anything
unusual
let
me
know
about
the
nd
ofNovember
as
quickly
as
you
can
sirius
chapter
nineteen
the
hungarian
horntail
the
prospect
of
talking
facetoface
with
Sirius
was
all
that
sustained
Harry
over
the
next
fortnight
the
only
bright
spot
on
a
horizon
that
had
never
looked
darker
the
shock
of
finding
himself
school
champion
had
worn
off
slightly
now
and
the
fear
of
what
was
facing
him
had
started
to
sink
in
the
first
task
was
drawing
steadily
nearer
he
felt
as
though
it
were
crouching
ahead
of
him
hike
some
horrific
monster
barring
his
path
he
had
never
suffered
nerves
like
these
they
were
way
beyond
anything
he
had
experienced
before
a
Quidditch
match
not
even
his
last
one
against
Slytherin
which
had
decided
who
would
win
the
Quidditch
Cup
harry
was
finding
it
hard
to
think
about
the
future
at
all
he
felt
as
though
his
whole
life
had
been
heading
up
to
and
would
finish
with
the
first
task
admittedly
he
didn't
see
how
Sirius
was
going
to
make
him
feel
any
better
about
having
to
perform
an
unknown
piece
of
difficult
and
dangerous
magic
in
front
of
hundreds
of
people
but
the
mere
sight
of
a
friendly
face
would
be
something
at
the
moment
harry
wrote
back
to
Sirius
saying
that
he
would
be
beside
the
common
room
fire
at
the
time
Sirius
had
suggested
and
he
and
Hermione
spent
a
long
time
going
over
plans
for
forcing
any
stragglers
out
of
the
common
room
on
the
night
in
question
if
the
worst
came
to
the
worst
they
were
going
to
drop
a
bag
of
Dungbombs
but
they
hoped
they
wouldn't
have
to
resort
to
that
Filch
would
skin
them
alive
in
the
meantime
life
became
even
worse
for
Harry
within
the
confines
of
the
castle
for
Rita
Skeeter
had
published
her
piece
about
the
Triwizard
Tournament
and
it
had
turned
out
to
be
not
so
much
a
report
on
the
tournament
as
a
highly
colored
life
story
of
Harry
much
of
the
front
page
had
been
given
over
to
a
picture
of
Harry
the
article
continuing
on
pages
two
six
and
seven
had
been
all
about
Harry
the
names
of
the
Beauxbatons
and
Durmstrang
champions
misspelled
had
been
squashed
into
the
last
line
of
the
article
and
Cedric
hadn't
been
mentioned
at
all
the
article
had
appeared
ten
days
ago
and
Harry
still
got
a
sick
burning
feeling
of
shame
in
his
stomach
every
time
he
thought
about
it
rita
Skeeter
had
reported
him
saying
an
awful
lot
of
things
that
he
couldn't
remember
ever
saying
in
his
life
let
alone
in
that
broom
cupboard
i
suppose
I
get
my
strength
from
my
parents
i
know
they'd
be
very
proud
of
me
if
they
could
see
me
now
yes
sometimes
at
night
I
still
cry
about
them
i'm
not
ashamed
to
admit
it
i
know
nothing
will
hurt
me
during
the
tournament
because
they're
watching
over
me
but
Rita
Skeeter
had
gone
even
further
than
transforming
his
er's
into
long
sickly
sentences
She
had
interviewed
other
people
about
him
too
harry
has
at
last
found
love
at
Hogwarts
his
close
friend
Colin
Creevey
says
that
Harry
is
rarely
seen
out
of
the
company
of
one
Hermione
Granger
a
stunningly
pretty
Muggleborn
girl
who
like
Harry
is
one
of
the
top
students
in
the
school
from
the
moment
the
article
had
appeared
Harry
had
had
to
endure
people
Slytherins
mainly
quoting
it
at
him
as
he
passed
and
making
sneering
comments
want
a
hanky
Potter
in
case
you
start
crying
in
Transfiguration
since
when
have
you
been
one
of
the
top
students
in
the
school
Potter
or
is
this
a
school
you
and
Longbottom
have
set
up
together
hey
Harry
yeah
that's
right
harry
found
himself
shouting
as
he
wheeled
around
in
the
corridor
having
had
just
about
enough
i've
just
been
crying
my
eyes
out
over
my
dead
mum
and
i'm
just
off
to
do
a
bit
more
no
it
was
just
you
dropped
your
quill
it
was
Cho
harry
felt
the
color
rising
in
his
face
oh
right
sorry
he
muttered
taking
the
quill
back
er
good
luck
on
Tuesday
she
said
i
really
hope
you
do
well
which
left
Harry
feeling
extremely
stupid
hermione
had
come
in
for
her
fair
share
of
unpleasantness
too
but
she
hadn't
yet
started
yelling
at
innocent
bystanders
in
fact
Harry
was
full
of
admiration
for
the
way
she
was
handling
the
situation
stunningly
pretty
her
pansy
Parkinson
had
shrieked
the
first
time
she
had
come
facetoface
with
Hermione
after
rita's
article
had
appeared
what
was
she
judging
against
a
chipmunk
ignore
it
Hermione
said
in
a
dignified
voice
holding
her
head
in
the
air
and
stalking
past
the
sniggering
Slytherin
girls
as
though
she
couldn't
hear
them
just
ignore
it
Harry
but
Harry
couldn't
ignore
it
ron
hadn't
spoken
to
him
at
all
since
he
had
told
him
about
snape's
detentions
harry
had
half
hoped
they
would
make
things
up
during
the
two
hours
they
were
forced
to
pickle
rats
brains
in
snape's
dungeon
but
that
had
been
the
day
rita's
article
had
appeared
which
seemed
to
have
confirmed
ron's
belief
that
Harry
was
really
enjoying
all
the
attention
hermione
was
furious
with
the
pair
of
them
she
went
from
one
to
the
other
trying
to
force
them
to
talk
to
each
other
but
Harry
was
adamant
He
would
talk
to
Ron
again
only
if
Ron
admitted
that
Harry
hadn't
put
his
name
in
the
Goblet
of
Fire
and
apologized
for
calling
him
a
liar
i
didn't
start
this
Harry
said
stubbornly
it's
his
problem
you
miss
him
hermione
said
impatiently
and
I
know
he
misses
you
miss
him
said
Harry
i
don't
miss
him
but
this
was
a
downright
lie
harry
liked
Hermione
very
much
but
she
just
wasn't
the
same
as
Ron
there
was
much
hess
laughter
and
a
lot
more
hanging
around
in
the
library
when
Hermione
was
your
best
friend
harry
still
hadn't
mastered
Summoning
Charms
he
seemed
to
have
developed
something
of
a
block
about
them
and
Hermione
insisted
that
learning
the
theory
would
help
they
consequently
spent
a
lot
of
time
poring
over
books
during
their
lunchtimes
viktor
Krum
was
in
the
library
an
awful
lot
too
and
Harry
wondered
what
he
was
up
to
was
he
studying
or
was
he
looking
for
things
to
help
him
through
the
first
task
hermione
often
complained
about
Krum
being
there
not
that
he
ever
bothered
them
but
because
groups
of
giggling
girls
often
turned
up
to
spy
on
him
from
behind
bookshelves
and
Hermione
found
the
noise
distracting
he's
not
even
goodlooking
she
muttered
angrily
glaring
at
krum's
sharp
profile
they
only
like
him
because
he's
famous
they
wouldn't
look
twice
at
him
if
he
couldn't
do
that
WonkyFaint
thing
wronski
Feint
said
Harry
through
gritted
teeth
quite
apart
from
liking
to
get
Quidditch
terms
correct
it
caused
him
another
pang
to
imagine
ron's
expression
if
he
could
have
heard
Hermione
talking
about
WonkyFaints
it
is
a
strange
thing
but
when
you
are
dreading
something
and
would
give
anything
to
slow
down
time
it
has
a
disobliging
habit
of
speeding
up
the
days
until
the
first
task
seemed
to
slip
by
as
though
someone
had
fixed
the
clocks
to
work
at
double
speed
harry's
feeling
of
barely
controlled
panic
was
with
him
wherever
he
went
as
everpresent
as
the
snide
comments
about
the
Daily
Prophet
article
on
the
Saturday
before
the
first
task
all
students
in
the
third
year
and
above
were
permitted
to
visit
the
village
of
Hogsmeade
hermione
told
Harry
that
it
would
do
him
good
to
get
away
from
the
castle
for
a
bit
and
Harry
didn't
need
much
persuasion
what
about
Ron
though
he
said
don't
you
want
to
go
with
him
oh
well
hermione
went
slightly
pink
i
thought
we
might
meet
up
with
him
in
the
Three
Broomsticks
no
said
Harry
flatly
oh
Harry
this
is
so
stupid
i'll
come
but
i'm
not
meeting
Ron
and
i'm
wearing
my
Invisibility
Cloak
oh
all
right
then
hermione
snapped
but
I
hate
talking
to
you
in
that
cloak
I
never
know
if
i'm
looking
at
you
or
not
so
Harry
put
on
his
Invisibility
Cloak
in
the
dormitory
went
back
downstairs
and
together
he
and
Hermione
set
off
for
Hogsmeade
harry
felt
wonderfully
free
under
the
cloak
he
watched
other
students
walking
past
them
as
they
entered
the
village
most
of
them
sporting
Support
Cedric
Diggory
badges
but
no
horrible
remarks
came
his
way
for
a
change
and
nobody
was
quoting
that
stupid
article
people
keep
looking
at
me
now
said
Hermione
grumpily
as
they
came
out
of
Honeydukes
Sweetshop
later
eating
large
creamfilled
chocolates
they
think
i'm
talking
to
myself
don't
move
your
lips
so
much
then
come
on
please
just
take
off
your
cloak
for
a
bit
no
one's
going
to
bother
you
here
oh
yeah
said
Harry
look
behind
you
rita
Skeeter
and
her
photographer
friend
had
just
emerged
from
the
Three
Broomsticks
pub
talking
in
low
voices
they
passed
right
by
Hermione
without
hooking
at
her
harry
backed
into
the
wall
of
Honeydukes
to
stop
Rita
Skeeter
from
hitting
him
with
her
crocodileskin
handbag
when
they
were
gone
Harry
said
she's
staying
in
the
village
i
bet
she's
coming
to
watch
the
first
task
as
he
said
it
his
stomach
flooded
with
a
wave
of
molten
panic
he
didn't
mention
this
he
and
Hermione
hadn't
discussed
what
was
coming
in
the
first
task
much
he
had
the
feeling
she
didn't
want
to
think
about
it
she's
gone
said
Hermione
looking
right
through
Harry
toward
the
end
of
the
street
why
don't
we
go
and
have
a
butterbeer
in
the
Three
Broomsticks
it's
a
bit
cold
isn't
it
you
don't
have
to
talk
to
Ron
she
added
irritably
correctly
interpreting
his
silence
the
Three
Broomsticks
was
packed
mainly
with
Hogwarts
students
enjoying
their
free
afternoon
but
also
with
a
variety
of
magical
people
Harry
rarely
saw
anywhere
else
harry
supposed
that
as
Hogsmeade
was
the
only
allwizard
village
in
Britain
it
was
a
bit
of
a
haven
for
creatures
like
hags
who
were
not
as
adept
as
wizards
at
disguising
themselves
it
was
very
hard
to
move
through
crowds
in
the
Invisibility
Cloak
in
case
you
accidentally
trod
on
someone
which
tended
to
lead
to
awkward
questions
harry
edged
slowly
toward
a
spare
table
in
the
corner
while
Hermione
went
to
buy
drinks
on
his
way
through
the
pub
Harry
spotted
Ron
who
was
sitting
with
Fred
George
and
Lee
Jordan
resisting
the
urge
to
give
Ron
a
good
hard
poke
in
the
back
of
the
head
he
finally
reached
the
table
and
sat
down
at
it
hermione
joined
him
a
moment
later
and
slipped
him
a
butterbeer
under
his
cloak
i
look
like
such
an
idiot
sitting
here
on
my
own
she
muttered
lucky
I
brought
something
to
do
and
she
pulled
out
a
notebook
in
which
she
had
been
keeping
a
record
of
S
p.e.w.
members
harry
saw
his
and
ron's
names
at
the
top
of
the
very
short
list
it
seemed
a
long
time
ago
that
they
had
sat
making
up
those
predictions
together
and
Hermione
had
turned
up
and
appointed
them
secretary
and
treasurer
you
know
maybe
I
should
try
and
get
some
of
the
villagers
involved
in
S
p.e.w.
Hermione
said
thoughtfully
looking
around
the
pub
yeah
right
said
Harry
he
took
a
swig
of
butterbeer
under
his
cloak
hermione
when
are
you
going
to
give
up
on
this
spew
stuff
when
houseelves
have
decent
wages
and
working
conditions
she
hissed
back
you
know
i'm
starting
to
think
it's
time
for
more
direct
action
i
wonder
how
you
get
into
the
school
kitchens
no
idea
ask
Fred
and
George
said
Harry
hermione
lapsed
into
thoughtful
silence
while
Harry
drank
his
butterbeer
watching
the
people
in
the
pub
all
of
them
looked
cheerful
and
relaxed
ernie
Macmillan
and
Hannah
Abbot
were
swapping
Chocolate
Frog
cards
at
a
nearby
table
both
of
them
sporting
Support
Cedric
Diggory
badges
on
their
cloaks
right
over
by
the
door
he
saw
Cho
and
a
large
group
of
her
Ravenclaw
friends
she
wasn't
wearing
a
Cedric
badge
though
this
cheered
up
Harry
very
slightly
what
wouldn't
he
have
given
to
be
one
of
these
peophe
sitting
around
laughing
and
talking
with
nothing
to
worry
about
but
homework
he
imagined
how
it
would
have
felt
to
be
here
if
his
name
hadn't
come
out
of
the
Goblet
of
Fire
he
wouldn't
be
wearing
the
Invisibility
Cloak
for
one
thing
ron
would
be
sitting
with
him
the
three
of
them
would
probably
be
happily
imagining
what
deadly
dangerous
task
the
school
champions
would
be
facing
on
Tuesday
he'd
have
been
really
hooking
forward
to
it
watching
them
do
whatever
it
was
cheering
on
Cedric
with
everyone
else
safe
in
a
seat
at
the
back
of
the
stands
he
wondered
how
the
other
champions
were
feeling
every
time
he
had
seen
Cedric
lately
he
had
been
surrounded
by
admirers
and
looking
nervous
but
excited
harry
glimpsed
Fleur
Delacour
from
time
to
time
in
the
corridors
she
looked
exactly
as
she
always
did
haughty
and
unruffled
and
Krum
just
sat
in
the
library
poring
over
books
harry
thought
of
Sirius
and
the
tight
tense
knot
in
his
chest
seemed
to
ease
slightly
he
would
be
speaking
to
him
in
just
over
twelve
hours
for
tonight
was
the
night
they
were
meeting
at
the
common
room
fire
assuming
nothing
went
wrong
as
everything
else
had
done
lately
look
it's
Hagrid
said
Hermione
the
back
of
hagrid's
enormous
shaggy
head
he
had
mercifully
abandoned
his
bunches
emerged
over
the
crowd
harry
wondered
why
he
hadn't
spotted
him
at
once
as
Hagrid
was
so
large
but
standing
up
carefully
he
saw
that
Hagrid
had
been
leaning
low
talking
to
Professor
Moody
hagrid
had
his
usual
enormous
tankard
in
front
of
him
but
Moody
was
drinking
from
his
hip
flask
madam
Rosmerta
the
pretty
landlady
didn't
seem
to
think
much
of
this
she
was
looking
askance
at
Moody
as
she
collected
glasses
from
tables
around
them
perhaps
she
thought
it
was
an
insult
to
her
mulled
mead
but
Harry
knew
better
moody
had
told
them
all
during
their
last
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
lesson
that
he
preferred
to
prepare
his
own
food
and
drink
at
all
times
as
it
was
so
easy
for
Dark
wizards
to
poison
an
unattended
cup
as
Harry
watched
he
saw
Hagrid
and
Moody
get
up
to
leave
he
waved
then
remembered
that
Hagrid
couldn't
see
him
moody
however
paused
his
magical
eye
on
the
corner
where
Harry
was
standing
he
tapped
Hagrid
in
the
small
of
the
back
being
unable
to
reach
his
shoulder
muttered
something
to
him
and
then
the
pair
of
them
made
their
way
back
across
the
pub
toward
Harry
and
hermione's
table
all
right
Hermione
said
Hagrid
loudly
hello
said
Hermione
smiling
back
moody
limped
around
the
table
and
bent
down
Harry
thought
he
was
reading
the
S
p.e.w.
notebook
until
he
muttered
Nice
cloak
Potter
harry
stared
at
him
in
amazement
the
large
chunk
missing
from
moody's
nose
was
particularly
obvious
at
a
few
inches
distance
moody
grinned
can
your
eye
I
mean
can
you
yeah
it
can
see
through
Invisibility
Cloaks
Moody
said
quietly
and
it's
come
in
useful
at
times
I
can
tell
you
hagrid
was
beaming
down
at
Harry
too
harry
knew
Hagrid
couldn't
see
him
but
Moody
had
obviously
told
Hagrid
he
was
there
hagrid
now
bent
down
on
the
pretext
of
reading
the
S
p.e.w.
notebook
as
well
and
said
in
a
whisper
so
low
that
only
Harry
could
hear
it
Harry
meet
me
tonight
at
midnight
at
me
cabin
wear
that
cloak
straightening
up
Hagrid
said
loudly
Nice
ter
see
yeh
Hermione
winked
and
departed
moody
followed
him
why
does
Hagrid
want
me
to
meet
him
at
midnight
harry
said
very
surprised
does
he
said
Hermione
looking
startled
i
wonder
what
he's
up
to
i
don't
know
whether
you
should
go
Harry
she
looked
nervously
around
and
hissed
It
might
make
you
late
for
Sirius
it
was
true
that
going
down
to
hagrid's
at
midnight
would
mean
cutting
his
meeting
with
Sirius
very
fine
indeed
Hermione
suggested
sending
Hedwig
down
to
hagrid's
to
tell
him
he
couldn't
go
always
assuming
she
would
consent
to
take
the
note
of
course
Harry
however
thought
it
better
just
to
be
quick
at
whatever
Hagrid
wanted
him
for
he
was
very
curious
to
know
what
this
might
be
Hagrid
had
never
asked
Harry
to
visit
him
so
late
at
night
at
half
past
eleven
that
evening
Harry
who
had
pretended
to
go
up
to
bed
early
pulled
the
Invisibility
Cloak
back
over
himself
and
crept
back
downstairs
through
the
common
room
quite
a
few
people
were
still
in
there
the
Creevey
brothers
had
managed
to
get
hold
of
a
stack
of
Support
Cedric
Diggory
badges
and
were
trying
to
bewitch
them
to
make
them
say
Support
Harry
Potter
instead
so
far
however
all
they
had
managed
to
do
was
get
the
badges
stuck
on
potter
stinks
harry
crept
past
them
to
the
portrait
hole
and
waited
for
a
minute
or
so
keeping
an
eye
on
his
watch
then
Hermione
opened
the
Fat
Lady
for
him
from
outside
as
they
had
planned
he
slipped
past
her
with
a
whispered
Thanks
and
set
off
through
the
castle
the
grounds
were
very
dark
harry
walked
down
the
lawn
toward
the
lights
shining
in
hagrid's
cabin
the
inside
of
the
enormous
Beauxbatons
carriage
was
also
lit
up
Harry
could
hear
Madame
Maxime
talking
inside
it
as
he
knocked
on
hagrid's
front
door
you
there
Harry
hagrid
whispered
opening
the
door
and
looking
around
yeah
said
Harry
slipping
inside
the
cabin
and
pulling
the
cloak
down
off
his
head
what's
up
got
summat
ter
show
yeh
said
Hagrid
there
was
an
air
of
enormous
excitement
about
Hagrid
he
was
wearing
a
flower
that
resembled
an
oversized
artichoke
in
his
buttonhole
it
looked
as
though
he
had
abandoned
the
use
of
axle
grease
but
he
had
certainly
attempted
to
comb
his
hair
Harry
could
see
the
comb's
broken
teeth
tangled
in
it
what're
you
showing
me
harry
said
warily
wondering
if
the
skrewts
had
laid
eggs
or
Hagrid
had
managed
to
buy
another
giant
threeheaded
dog
off
a
stranger
in
a
pub
come
with
me
keep
quiet
an
keep
yerself
covered
with
that
cloak
said
Hagrid
we
won
take
Fang
he
won
like
it
listen
Hagrid
I
can't
stay
long
i've
got
to
be
back
up
at
the
castle
by
one
o'clock
but
Hagrid
wasn't
listening
he
was
opening
the
cabin
door
and
striding
off
into
the
night
harry
hurried
to
follow
and
found
to
his
great
surprise
that
Hagrid
was
leading
him
to
the
Beauxbatons
carriage
hagrid
what
shhh
said
Hagrid
and
he
knocked
three
times
on
the
door
bearing
the
crossed
golden
wands
madame
Maxime
opened
it
she
was
wearing
a
silk
shawl
wrapped
around
her
massive
shoulders
she
smiled
when
she
saw
Hagrid
ah
Agrid
it
is
time
bongsewer
said
Hagrid
beaming
at
her
and
holding
out
a
hand
to
help
her
down
the
golden
steps
madame
Maxime
closed
the
door
behind
her
Hagrid
offered
her
his
arm
and
they
set
off
around
the
edge
of
the
paddock
containing
Madame
maxime's
giant
winged
horses
with
Harry
totally
bewildered
running
to
keep
up
with
them
had
Hagrid
wanted
to
show
him
Madame
Maxime
he
could
see
her
any
old
time
he
wanted
she
wasn't
exactly
hard
to
miss
but
it
seemed
that
Madame
Maxime
was
in
for
the
same
treat
as
Harry
because
after
a
while
she
said
playfully
Wair
is
it
you
are
taking
me
Agrid
yeh'll
enjoy
this
said
Hagrid
gruffly
worth
seein
trust
me
on'y
don
go
tellin
anyone
I
showed
yeh
right
yeh're
not
s'posed
ter
know
of
course
not
said
Madame
Maxime
fluttering
her
long
black
eyelashes
and
still
they
walked
Harry
getting
more
and
more
irritated
as
he
jogged
along
in
their
wake
checking
his
watch
every
now
and
then
hagrid
had
some
harebrained
scheme
in
hand
which
might
make
him
miss
Sirius
if
they
didn't
get
there
soon
he
was
going
to
turn
around
go
straight
back
to
the
castle
and
leave
Hagrid
to
enjoy
his
moonlit
stroll
with
Madame
Maxime
but
then
when
they
had
walked
so
far
around
the
perimeter
of
the
forest
that
the
castle
and
the
lake
were
out
of
sight
Harry
heard
something
men
were
shouting
up
ahead
then
came
a
deafening
earsplitting
roar
hagrid
led
Madame
Maxime
around
a
clump
of
trees
and
came
to
a
halt
harry
hurried
up
alongside
them
for
a
split
second
he
thought
he
was
seeing
bonfires
and
men
darting
around
them
and
then
his
mouth
fell
open
dragons
four
fully
grown
enormous
viciouslooking
dragons
were
rearing
onto
their
hind
legs
inside
an
enclosure
fenced
with
thick
planks
of
wood
roaring
and
snorting
torrents
of
fire
were
shooting
into
the
dark
sky
from
their
open
fanged
mouths
fifty
feet
above
the
ground
on
their
outstretched
necks
there
was
a
silveryblue
one
with
long
pointed
horns
snapping
and
snarling
at
the
wizards
on
the
ground
a
smoothscaled
green
one
which
was
writhing
and
stamping
with
all
its
might
a
red
one
with
an
odd
fringe
of
fine
gold
spikes
around
its
face
which
was
shooting
mushroomshaped
fire
clouds
into
the
air
and
a
gigantic
black
one
more
lizard
hike
than
the
others
which
was
nearest
to
them
at
least
thirty
wizards
seven
or
eight
to
each
dragon
were
attempting
to
control
them
pulling
on
the
chains
connected
to
heavy
leather
straps
around
their
necks
and
legs
mesmerized
Harry
looked
up
high
above
him
and
saw
the
eyes
of
the
black
dragon
with
vertical
pupils
like
a
cat's
bulging
with
either
fear
or
rage
he
couldn't
tell
which
it
was
making
a
horrible
noise
a
yowling
screeching
scream
keep
back
there
Hagrid
yelled
a
wizard
near
the
fence
straining
on
the
chain
he
was
holding
they
can
shoot
fire
at
a
range
of
twenty
feet
you
know
i've
seen
this
Horntail
do
forty
is'n
it
beautiful
said
Hagrid
softly
it's
no
good
yelled
another
wizard
stunning
Spells
on
the
count
of
three
harry
saw
each
of
the
dragon
keepers
pull
out
his
wand
stupefy
they
shouted
in
unison
and
the
Stunning
Spells
shot
into
the
darkness
like
fiery
rockets
bursting
in
showers
of
stars
on
the
dragons
scaly
hides
Harry
watched
the
dragon
nearest
to
them
teeter
dangerously
on
its
back
legs
its
jaws
stretched
wide
in
a
silent
howl
its
nostrils
were
suddenly
devoid
of
flame
though
still
smoking
then
very
slowly
it
fell
several
tons
of
sinewy
scaly
black
dragon
hit
the
ground
with
a
thud
that
Harry
could
have
sworn
made
the
trees
behind
him
quake
the
dragon
keepers
lowered
their
wands
and
walked
forward
to
their
fallen
charges
each
of
which
was
the
size
of
a
small
hill
they
hurried
to
tighten
the
chains
and
fasten
them
securely
to
iron
pegs
which
they
forced
deep
into
the
ground
with
their
wands
wan
a
closer
look
hagrid
asked
Madame
Maxime
excitedly
the
pair
of
them
moved
right
up
to
the
fence
and
Harry
followed
the
wizard
who
had
warned
Hagrid
not
to
come
any
closer
turned
and
Harry
realized
who
it
was
Charlie
Weasley
all
right
Hagrid
he
panted
coming
over
to
talk
they
should
be
okay
now
we
put
them
out
with
a
Sleeping
Draft
on
the
way
here
thought
it
might
be
better
for
them
to
wake
up
in
the
dark
and
the
quiet
but
like
you
saw
they
weren't
happy
not
happy
at
all
what
breeds
you
got
here
Charlie
said
Hagrid
gazing
at
the
closest
dragon
the
black
one
with
something
chose
to
reverence
its
eyes
were
still
just
open
harry
could
see
a
strip
of
gleaming
yellow
beneath
its
wrinkled
black
eyelid
this
is
a
Hungarian
Horntail
said
Charlie
there's
a
Common
Welsh
Green
over
there
the
smaller
one
a
Swedish
ShortSnout
that
bluegray
and
a
Chinese
Fireball
that's
the
red
charlie
looked
around
Madame
Maxime
was
strolling
away
around
the
edge
of
the
enclosure
gazing
at
the
stunned
dragons
i
didn't
know
you
were
bringing
her
Hagrid
Charlie
said
frowning
the
champions
aren't
supposed
to
know
what's
coming
she's
bound
to
tell
her
student
isn't
she
jus
thought
she'd
like
ter
see
em
shrugged
Hagrid
still
gazing
enraptured
at
the
dragons
really
romantic
date
Hagrid
said
Charlie
shaking
his
head
four
said
Hagrid
so
it's
one
fer
each
o
the
champions
is
it
what've
they
gotta
do
fight
em
just
get
past
them
I
think
said
Charlie
we'll
be
on
hand
if
it
gets
nasty
Extinguishing
Spells
at
the
ready
they
wanted
nesting
mothers
I
don't
know
why
but
I
tell
you
this
I
don't
envy
the
one
who
gets
the
Horntail
vicious
thing
its
back
end's
as
dangerous
as
its
front
look
charlie
pointed
toward
the
horntail's
tail
and
Harry
saw
long
bronzecolored
spikes
protruding
along
it
every
few
inches
five
of
charlie's
fellow
keepers
staggered
up
to
the
Horntail
at
that
moment
carrying
a
clutch
of
huge
granitegray
eggs
between
them
in
a
blanket
they
placed
them
carefully
at
the
horntail's
side
hagrid
let
out
a
moan
of
longing
i've
got
them
counted
Hagrid
said
Charlie
sternly
then
he
said
how's
Harry
fine
said
Hagrid
he
was
still
gazing
at
the
eggs
just
hope
he's
still
fine
after
he's
faced
this
lot
said
Charlie
grimly
looking
out
over
the
dragons
enclosure
i
didn't
dare
tell
Mum
what
he's
got
to
do
for
the
first
task
she's
already
having
kittens
about
him
charlie
imitated
his
mother's
anxious
voice
how
could
they
let
him
enter
that
tournament
he's
much
too
young
i
thought
they
were
all
safe
I
thought
there
was
going
to
be
an
age
limit
she
was
in
floods
after
that
Daily
Prophet
article
about
him
he
still
cries
about
his
parents
oh
bless
him
I
never
knew
harry
had
had
enough
trusting
to
the
fact
that
Hagrid
wouldn't
miss
him
with
the
attractions
of
four
dragons
and
Madame
Maxime
to
occupy
him
he
turned
silently
and
began
to
walk
away
back
to
the
castle
he
didn't
know
whether
he
was
glad
he'd
seen
what
was
coming
or
not
perhaps
this
way
was
better
the
first
shock
was
over
now
maybe
if
he'd
seen
the
dragons
for
the
first
time
on
Tuesday
he
would
have
passed
out
cold
in
front
of
the
whole
school
but
maybe
he
would
anyway
he
was
going
to
be
armed
with
his
wand
which
just
now
felt
like
nothing
more
than
a
narrow
strip
of
wood
against
a
fiftyfoothigh
scaly
spikeridden
firebreathing
dragon
and
he
had
to
get
past
it
with
everyone
watching
how
harry
sped
up
skirting
the
edge
of
the
forest
he
had
just
under
fifteen
minutes
to
get
back
to
the
fireside
and
talk
to
Sirius
and
he
couldn't
remember
ever
wanting
to
talk
to
someone
more
than
he
did
right
now
when
without
warning
he
ran
into
something
very
solid
harry
fell
backward
his
glasses
askew
clutching
the
cloak
around
him
a
voice
nearby
said
Ouch
who's
there
harry
hastily
checked
that
the
cloak
was
covering
him
and
hay
very
still
staring
up
at
the
dark
outline
of
the
wizard
he
had
hit
he
recognized
the
goatee
it
was
Karkaroff
who's
there
said
Karkaroff
again
very
suspiciously
looking
around
in
the
darkness
harry
remained
still
and
silent
after
a
minute
or
so
Karkaroff
seemed
to
decide
that
he
had
hit
some
sort
of
animal
he
was
looking
around
at
waist
height
as
though
expecting
to
see
a
dog
then
he
crept
back
under
the
cover
of
the
trees
and
started
to
edge
forward
toward
the
place
where
the
dragons
were
very
slowly
and
very
carefully
Harry
got
to
his
feet
and
set
off
again
as
fast
as
he
could
without
making
too
much
noise
hurrying
through
the
darkness
back
toward
Hogwarts
he
had
no
doubt
whatsoever
what
Karkaroff
was
up
to
he
had
sneaked
off
his
ship
to
try
and
find
out
what
the
first
task
was
going
to
be
he
might
even
have
spotted
Hagrid
and
Madame
Maxime
heading
off
around
the
forest
together
they
were
hardly
difficult
to
spot
at
a
distance
and
now
all
Karkaroff
had
to
do
was
follow
the
sound
of
voices
and
he
like
Madame
Maxime
would
know
what
was
in
store
for
the
champions
by
the
looks
of
it
the
only
champion
who
would
be
facing
the
unknown
on
Tuesday
was
Cedric
harry
reached
the
castle
slipped
in
through
the
front
doors
and
began
to
climb
the
marble
stairs
he
was
very
out
of
breath
but
he
didn't
dare
slow
down
he
had
less
than
five
minutes
to
get
up
to
the
fire
balderdash
he
gasped
at
the
Fat
Lady
who
was
snoozing
in
her
frame
in
front
of
the
portrait
hole
if
you
say
so
she
muttered
sleepily
without
opening
her
eyes
and
the
picture
swung
forward
to
admit
him
harry
climbed
inside
the
common
room
was
deserted
and
judging
by
the
fact
that
it
smelled
quite
normal
Hermione
had
not
needed
to
set
off
any
Dungbombs
to
ensure
that
he
and
Sirius
got
privacy
harry
pulled
off
the
Invisibility
Cloak
and
threw
himself
into
an
armchair
in
front
of
the
fire
the
room
was
in
semidarkness
the
flames
were
the
only
source
of
light
nearby
on
a
table
the
Support
Cedric
Diggory
badges
the
Creeveys
had
been
trying
to
improve
were
glinting
in
the
firelight
they
now
read
potter
really
stinks
harry
looked
back
into
the
flames
and
jumped
sirius's
head
was
sitting
in
the
fire
if
Harry
hadn't
seen
mr.
Diggory
do
exactly
this
back
in
the
Weasleys
kitchen
it
would
have
scared
him
out
of
his
wits
instead
his
face
breaking
into
the
first
smile
he
had
worn
for
days
he
scrambled
out
of
his
chair
crouched
down
by
the
hearth
and
said
Sirius
how're
you
doing
sirius
looked
different
from
harry's
memory
of
him
when
they
had
said
good
bye
sirius's
face
had
been
gaunt
and
sunken
surrounded
by
a
quantity
of
long
black
matted
hair
but
the
hair
was
short
and
clean
now
sirius's
face
was
fuller
and
he
looked
younger
much
more
like
the
only
photograph
Harry
had
of
him
which
had
been
taken
at
the
Potters
wedding
never
mind
me
how
are
you
said
Sirius
seriously
i'm
For
a
second
Harry
tried
to
say
fine
but
he
couldn't
do
it
before
he
could
stop
himself
he
was
talking
more
than
he'd
talked
in
days
about
how
no
one
believed
he
hadn't
entered
the
tournament
of
his
own
free
will
how
Rita
Skeeter
had
lied
about
him
in
the
Daily
Prophet
how
he
couldn't
walk
down
a
corridor
without
being
sneered
at
and
about
Ron
Ron
not
believing
him
ron's
jealousy
and
now
hagrid's
just
shown
me
what's
coming
in
the
first
task
and
it's
dragons
Sirius
and
i'm
a
goner
he
finished
desperately
sirius
looked
at
him
eyes
full
of
concern
eyes
that
had
not
yet
lost
the
look
that
Azkaban
had
given
them
that
deadened
haunted
look
He
had
let
Harry
talk
himself
into
silence
without
interruption
but
now
he
said
Dragons
we
can
deal
with
Harry
but
we'll
get
to
that
in
a
minute
I
haven't
got
long
here
i've
broken
into
a
wizarding
house
to
use
the
fire
but
they
could
be
back
at
any
time
there
are
things
I
need
to
warn
you
about
what
said
Harry
feeling
his
spirits
slip
a
further
few
notches
surely
there
could
be
nothing
worse
than
dragons
coming
karkaroff
said
Sirius
harry
he
was
a
Death
Eater
you
know
what
Death
Eaters
are
don't
you
yes
he
what
he
was
caught
he
was
in
Azkaban
with
me
but
he
got
released
i'd
bet
everything
that's
why
Dumbledore
wanted
an
Auror
at
Hogwarts
this
year
to
keep
an
eye
on
him
moody
caught
Karkaroff
put
him
into
Azkaban
in
the
first
place
karkaroff
got
released
harry
said
slowly
his
brain
seemed
to
be
struggling
to
absorb
yet
another
piece
of
shocking
information
why
did
they
release
him
he
did
a
deal
with
the
Ministry
of
Magic
said
Sirius
bitterly
he
said
he'd
seen
the
error
of
his
ways
and
then
he
named
names
he
put
a
load
of
other
people
into
Azkaban
in
his
place
he's
not
very
popular
in
there
I
can
tell
you
and
since
he
got
out
from
what
I
can
tell
he's
been
teaching
the
Dark
Arts
to
every
student
who
passes
through
that
school
of
his
so
watch
out
for
the
Durmstrang
champion
as
well
okay
said
Harry
slowly
but
are
you
saying
Karkaroff
put
my
name
in
the
goblet
because
if
he
did
he's
a
really
good
actor
he
seemed
furious
about
it
he
wanted
to
stop
me
from
competing
we
know
he's
a
good
actor
said
Sirius
because
he
convinced
the
Ministry
of
Magic
to
set
him
free
didn't
he
now
i've
been
keeping
an
eye
on
the
Daily
Prophet
Harry
you
and
the
rest
of
the
world
said
Harry
bitterly
and
reading
between
the
lines
of
that
Skeeter
woman's
article
last
month
Moody
was
attacked
the
night
before
he
started
at
Hogwarts
yes
I
know
she
says
it
was
another
false
alarm
Sirius
said
hastily
seeing
Harry
about
to
speak
but
I
don't
think
so
somehow
i
think
someone
tried
to
stop
him
from
getting
to
Hogwarts
i
think
someone
knew
their
job
would
be
a
lot
more
difficult
with
him
around
and
no
one's
going
to
look
into
it
too
closely
madeye's
heard
intruders
a
bit
too
often
but
that
doesn't
mean
he
can't
still
spot
the
real
thing
moody
was
the
best
Auror
the
Ministry
ever
had
so
what
are
you
saying
said
Harry
slowly
karkaroff's
trying
to
kill
me
but
why
sirius
hesitated
i've
been
nearing
some
very
strange
things
he
said
slowly
the
Death
Eaters
seem
to
be
a
bit
more
active
than
usual
lately
they
showed
themselves
at
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
didn't
they
someone
set
off
the
Dark
Mark
and
then
did
you
hear
about
that
Ministry
of
Magic
witch
who's
gone
missing
bertha
Jorkins
said
Harry
exactly
she
disappeared
in
Albania
and
that's
definitely
where
Voldemort
was
rumored
to
be
last
and
she
would
have
known
the
Triwizard
Tournament
was
coming
up
wouldn't
she
yeah
but
it's
not
very
likely
she'd
have
walked
straight
into
Voldemort
is
it
said
Harry
listen
I
knew
Bertha
Jorkins
said
Sirius
grimly
she
was
at
Hogwarts
when
I
was
a
few
years
above
your
dad
and
me
and
she
was
an
idiot
very
nosy
but
no
brains
none
at
all
it's
not
a
good
combination
Harry
i'd
say
she'd
be
very
easy
to
lure
into
a
trap
so
so
Voldemort
could
have
found
out
about
the
tournament
said
Harry
is
that
what
you
mean
you
think
Karkaroff
might
be
here
on
his
orders
i
don't
know
said
Sirius
slowly
I
just
don't
know
karkaroff
doesn't
strike
me
as
the
type
who'd
go
back
to
Voldemort
unless
he
knew
Voldemort
was
powerful
enough
to
protect
him
but
whoever
put
your
name
in
that
goblet
did
it
for
a
reason
and
I
can't
help
thinking
the
tournament
would
be
a
very
good
way
to
attack
you
and
make
it
hook
like
an
accident
looks
hike
a
really
good
plan
from
where
i'm
standing
said
Harry
grinning
bleaky
they'll
just
have
to
stand
back
and
let
the
dragons
do
their
stuff
right
these
dragons
said
Sirius
speaking
very
quickly
now
there's
a
way
Harry
don't
be
tempted
to
try
a
Stunning
Spell
dragons
are
strong
and
too
powerfully
magical
to
be
knocked
out
by
a
single
Stunner
you
need
about
half
a
dozen
wizards
at
a
time
to
overcome
a
dragon
yeah
I
know
I
just
saw
said
Harry
but
you
can
do
it
alone
said
Sirius
there
is
away
and
a
simple
spell's
all
you
need
just
but
Harry
held
up
a
hand
to
silence
him
his
heart
suddenly
pounding
as
though
it
would
burst
he
could
hear
footsteps
coming
down
the
spiral
staircase
behind
him
go
he
hissed
at
Sirius
go
there's
someone
coming
harry
scrambled
to
his
feet
hiding
the
fire
if
someone
saw
sirius's
face
within
the
walls
of
Hogwarts
they
would
raise
an
almighty
uproar
the
Ministry
would
get
dragged
in
he
Harry
would
be
questioned
about
sirius's
whereabouts
Harry
heard
a
tiny
pop
in
the
fire
behind
him
and
knew
Sirius
had
gone
he
watched
the
bottom
of
the
spiral
staircase
who
had
decided
to
go
for
a
stroll
at
one
o'clock
in
the
morning
and
stopped
Sirius
from
telling
him
how
to
get
past
a
dragon
it
was
Ron
dressed
in
his
maroon
paisley
pajamas
Ron
stopped
dead
facing
Harry
across
the
room
and
looked
around
who
were
you
talking
to
he
said
what's
that
got
to
do
with
you
harry
snarled
what
are
you
doing
down
here
at
this
time
of
night
i
just
wondered
where
you
Ron
broke
off
shrugging
nothing
i'm
going
back
to
bed
just
thought
you'd
come
nosing
around
did
you
harry
shouted
he
knew
that
Ron
had
no
idea
what
he'd
walked
in
on
knew
he
hadn't
done
it
on
purpose
but
he
didn't
care
at
this
moment
he
hated
everything
about
Ron
right
down
to
the
several
inches
of
bare
ankle
showing
beneath
his
pajama
trousers
sorry
about
that
said
Ron
his
face
reddening
with
anger
should've
realized
you
didn't
want
to
be
disturbed
i'll
let
you
get
on
with
practicing
for
your
next
interview
in
peace
harry
seized
one
of
the
potter
really
stinks
badges
off
the
table
and
chucked
it
as
hard
as
he
could
across
the
room
it
hit
Ron
on
the
forehead
and
bounced
off
there
you
go
Harry
said
something
for
you
to
wear
on
Tuesday
you
might
even
have
a
scar
now
if
yon're
lucky
that's
what
you
want
isn't
it
he
strode
across
the
room
toward
the
stairs
he
half
expected
Ron
to
stop
him
he
would
even
have
liked
Ron
to
throw
a
punch
at
him
but
Ron
just
stood
there
in
his
toosmall
pajamas
and
Harry
having
stormed
upstairs
lay
awake
in
bed
fuming
for
a
long
time
afterward
and
didn't
hear
him
come
up
to
bed
chapter
twenty
the
first
task
harry
got
up
on
Sunday
morning
and
dressed
so
inattentively
that
it
was
a
while
before
he
realized
he
was
trying
to
pull
his
hat
onto
his
foot
instead
of
his
sock
when
he'd
finally
got
all
his
clothes
on
the
right
parts
of
his
body
he
hurried
off
to
find
Hermione
locating
her
at
the
Gryffindor
table
in
the
Great
Hall
where
she
was
eating
breakfast
with
Ginny
feeling
too
queasy
to
eat
Harry
waited
until
Hermione
had
swallowed
her
last
spoonful
of
porridge
then
dragged
her
out
onto
the
grounds
there
he
told
her
all
about
the
dragons
and
about
everything
Sirius
had
said
while
they
took
another
long
walk
around
the
lake
alarmed
as
she
was
by
sirius's
warnings
about
Karkaroff
Hermione
still
thought
that
the
dragons
were
the
more
pressing
problem
let's
just
try
and
keep
you
alive
until
Tuesday
evening
she
said
desperately
and
then
we
can
worry
about
Karkaroff
they
walked
three
times
around
the
lake
trying
all
the
way
to
think
of
a
simple
spell
that
would
subdue
a
dragon
nothing
whatsoever
occurred
to
them
so
they
retired
to
the
library
instead
here
Harry
pulled
down
every
book
he
could
find
on
dragons
and
both
of
them
set
to
work
searching
through
the
large
pile
talonclipping
by
charms
treating
scalerot
this
is
no
good
this
is
for
nutters
like
Hagrid
who
want
to
keep
them
healthy
dragons
are
extremely
difficult
to
slay
owing
to
the
ancient
magic
that
imbues
their
thick
hides
which
none
but
the
most
powerful
spells
can
penetrate
but
Sirius
said
a
simple
one
would
do
it
let's
try
some
simple
spellbooks
then
said
Harry
throwing
aside
Men
Who
Love
Dragons
Too
Much
he
returned
to
the
table
with
a
pile
of
spellbooks
set
them
down
and
began
to
flick
through
each
in
turn
Hermione
whispering
nonstop
at
his
elbow
well
there
are
Switching
Spells
but
what's
the
point
of
Switching
it
unless
you
swapped
its
fangs
for
winegums
or
something
that
would
make
it
less
dangerous
the
trouble
is
like
that
book
said
not
much
is
going
to
get
through
a
dragon's
hide
i'd
say
Transfigure
it
but
something
that
big
you
really
haven't
got
a
hope
I
doubt
even
Professor
McGonagall
unless
you're
supposed
to
put
the
spell
on
yourself
maybe
to
give
yourself
extra
powers
but
they're
not
simple
spells
I
mean
we
haven't
done
any
of
those
in
class
I
only
know
about
them
because
i've
been
doing
O
w.l.
practice
papers
hermione
Harry
said
through
gritted
teeth
will
you
shut
up
for
a
bit
please
i
m
trying
to
concentrate
but
all
that
happened
when
Hermione
fell
silent
was
that
harry's
brain
filled
with
a
sort
of
blank
buzzing
which
didn't
seem
to
allow
room
for
concentration
he
stared
hopelessly
down
the
index
of
Basic
Hexes
for
the
Busy
and
Vexed
instant
scalping
but
dragons
had
no
hair
pepper
breath
that
would
probably
increase
a
dragon's
firepower
horn
tongue
just
what
he
needed
to
give
it
an
extra
weapon
oh
no
he's
back
again
why
can't
he
read
on
his
stupid
ship
said
Hermione
irritably
as
Viktor
Krum
slouched
in
cast
a
surly
look
over
at
the
pair
of
them
and
settled
himself
in
a
distant
corner
with
a
pile
of
books
come
on
Harry
we'll
go
back
to
the
common
room
his
fan
club'll
be
here
in
a
moment
twittering
away
and
sure
enough
as
they
left
the
library
a
gang
of
girls
tiptoed
past
them
one
of
them
wearing
a
Bulgaria
scarf
tied
around
her
waist
harry
barely
slept
that
night
when
he
awoke
on
Monday
morning
he
seriously
considered
for
the
first
time
ever
just
running
away
from
Hogwarts
but
as
he
looked
around
the
Great
Hall
at
breakfast
time
and
thought
about
what
leaving
the
castle
would
mean
he
knew
he
couldn't
do
it
it
was
the
only
place
he
had
ever
been
happy
well
he
supposed
he
must
have
been
happy
with
his
parents
too
but
he
couldn't
remember
that
somehow
the
knowledge
that
he
would
rather
be
here
and
facing
a
dragon
than
back
on
Privet
Drive
with
Dudley
was
good
to
know
it
made
him
feel
slightly
calmer
he
finished
his
bacon
with
difficulty
his
throat
wasn't
working
too
well
and
as
he
and
Hermione
got
up
he
saw
Cedric
Diggory
leaving
the
Hufflepuff
table
cedric
still
didn't
know
about
the
dragons
the
only
champion
who
didn't
if
Harry
was
right
in
thinking
that
Maxime
and
Karkaroff
would
have
told
Fleur
and
Krum
hermione
i'll
see
you
in
the
greenhouses
Harry
said
coming
to
his
decision
as
he
watched
Cedric
leaving
the
Hall
go
on
i'll
catch
you
up
harry
you'll
be
late
the
bell's
about
to
ring
i'll
catch
you
up
okay
by
the
time
Harry
reached
the
bottom
of
the
marble
staircase
Cedric
was
at
the
top
he
was
with
a
load
of
sixthyear
friends
harry
didn't
want
to
talk
to
Cedric
in
front
of
them
they
were
among
those
who
had
been
quoting
Rita
skeeter's
article
at
him
every
time
he
went
near
them
he
followed
Cedric
at
a
distance
and
saw
that
he
was
heading
toward
the
Charms
corridor
this
gave
Harry
an
idea
pausing
at
a
distance
from
them
he
pulled
out
his
wand
and
took
careful
aim
diffindo
cedric's
bag
split
parchment
quills
and
books
spilled
out
of
it
onto
the
floor
several
bottles
of
ink
smashed
don't
bother
said
Cedric
in
an
exasperated
voice
as
his
friends
bent
down
to
help
him
tell
Flitwick
i'm
coming
go
on
this
was
exactly
what
Harry
had
been
hoping
for
he
slipped
his
wand
back
into
his
robes
waited
until
cedric's
friends
had
disappeared
into
their
classroom
and
hurried
up
the
corridor
which
was
now
empty
of
everyone
but
himself
and
Cedric
hi
said
Cedric
picking
up
a
copy
of
A
Guide
to
Advanced
Transfiguration
that
was
now
splattered
with
ink
my
bag
just
split
brandnew
and
all
cedric
said
Harry
the
first
task
is
dragons
what
said
Cedric
looking
up
dragons
said
Harry
speaking
quickly
in
case
Professor
Flitwick
came
out
to
see
where
Cedric
had
got
to
they've
got
four
one
for
each
of
us
and
we've
got
to
get
past
them
cedric
stared
at
him
harry
saw
some
of
the
panic
he'd
been
feeling
since
Saturday
night
flickering
in
cedric's
gray
eyes
are
you
sure
cedric
said
in
a
hushed
voice
dead
sure
said
Harry
i've
seen
them
but
how
did
you
find
out
we're
not
supposed
to
know
never
mind
said
Harry
quickly
he
knew
Hagrid
would
be
in
trouble
if
he
told
the
truth
but
i'm
not
the
only
one
who
knows
fleur
and
Krum
will
know
by
now
Maxime
and
Karkaroff
both
saw
the
dragons
too
cedric
straightened
up
his
arms
full
of
inky
quills
parchment
and
books
his
ripped
bag
dangling
off
one
shoulder
he
stared
at
Harry
and
there
was
a
puzzled
almost
suspicious
look
in
his
eyes
why
are
you
telling
me
he
asked
harry
looked
at
him
in
disbelief
he
was
sure
Cedric
wouldn't
have
asked
that
if
he
had
seen
the
dragons
himself
harry
wouldn't
have
let
his
worst
enemy
face
those
monsters
unprepared
well
perhaps
Malfoy
or
Snape
it's
just
fair
isn't
it
he
said
to
Cedric
we
all
know
now
we're
on
an
even
footing
aren't
we
cedric
was
still
hooking
at
him
in
a
slightly
suspicious
way
when
Harry
heard
a
familiar
clunking
noise
behind
him
he
turned
around
and
saw
MadEye
Moody
emerging
from
a
nearby
classroom
come
with
me
Potter
he
growled
diggory
off
you
go
harry
stared
apprehensively
at
Moody
had
he
overheard
them
er
Professor
i'm
supposed
to
be
in
Herbology
never
mind
that
Potter
in
my
office
please
harry
followed
him
wondering
what
was
going
to
happen
to
him
now
what
if
Moody
wanted
to
know
how
he'd
found
out
about
the
dragons
would
Moody
go
to
Dumbledore
and
tell
on
Hagrid
or
just
turn
Harry
into
a
ferret
well
it
might
be
easier
to
get
past
a
dragon
if
he
were
a
ferret
Harry
thought
dully
he'd
be
smaller
much
less
easy
to
see
from
a
height
of
fifty
feet
he
followed
Moody
into
his
office
moody
closed
the
door
behind
them
and
turned
to
look
at
Harry
his
magical
eye
fixed
upon
him
as
well
as
the
normal
one
that
was
a
very
decent
thing
you
just
did
Potter
Moody
said
quietly
harry
didn't
know
what
to
say
this
wasn't
the
reaction
he
had
expected
at
all
sit
down
said
Moody
and
Harry
sat
looking
around
he
had
visited
this
office
under
two
of
its
previous
occupants
in
Professor
lockhart's
day
the
walls
had
been
plastered
with
beaming
winking
pictures
of
Professor
Lockhart
himself
when
Lupin
had
lived
here
you
were
more
likely
to
come
across
a
specimen
of
some
fascinating
new
Dark
creature
he
had
procured
for
them
to
study
in
class
now
however
the
office
was
full
of
a
number
of
exceptionally
odd
objects
that
Harry
supposed
Moody
had
used
in
the
days
when
he
had
been
an
Auror
on
his
desk
stood
what
looked
hike
a
large
cracked
glass
spinning
top
Harry
recognized
it
at
once
as
a
Sneakoscope
because
he
owned
one
himself
though
it
was
much
smaller
than
moody's
in
the
corner
on
a
small
table
stood
an
object
that
looked
something
like
an
extrasquiggly
golden
television
aerial
it
was
humming
slightly
what
appeared
to
be
a
mirror
hung
opposite
Harry
on
the
wall
but
it
was
not
reflecting
the
room
shadowy
figures
were
moving
around
inside
it
none
of
them
clearly
in
focus
like
my
Dark
Detectors
do
you
s
aid
Moody
who
was
watching
Harry
closely
what's
that
harry
asked
pointing
at
the
squiggly
golden
aerial
secrecy
Sensor
vibrates
when
it
detects
concealment
and
lies
no
use
here
of
course
too
much
interference
students
in
every
direction
lying
about
why
they
haven't
done
their
homework
Been
humming
ever
since
I
got
here
i
had
to
disable
my
Sneakoscope
because
it
wouldn't
stop
whistling
it's
extrasensitive
picks
up
stuff
about
a
mile
around
of
course
it
could
be
picking
up
more
than
kid
stuff
he
added
in
a
growl
and
what's
the
mirror
for
oh
that's
my
FoeGlass
see
them
out
there
skulking
around
i'm
not
really
in
trouble
until
I
see
the
whites
of
their
eyes
that's
when
I
open
my
trunk
he
let
out
a
short
harsh
laugh
and
pointed
to
the
large
trunk
under
the
window
it
had
seven
keyholes
in
a
row
harry
wondered
what
was
in
there
until
moody's
next
question
brought
him
sharply
back
to
earth
so
found
out
about
the
dragons
have
you
harry
hesitated
he'd
been
afraid
of
this
but
he
hadn't
told
Cedric
and
he
certainly
wasn't
going
to
tell
Moody
that
Hagrid
had
broken
the
rules
it's
all
right
said
Moody
sitting
down
and
stretching
out
his
wooden
leg
with
a
groan
cheating's
a
traditional
part
of
the
Triwizard
Tournament
and
always
has
been
i
didn't
cheat
said
Harry
sharply
it
was
a
sort
of
accident
that
I
found
out
moody
grinned
i
wasn't
accusing
you
laddie
i've
been
telling
Dumbledore
from
the
start
he
can
be
as
highminded
as
he
likes
but
you
can
bet
old
Karkaroff
and
Maxime
won't
be
they'll
have
told
their
champions
everything
they
can
they
want
to
win
they
want
to
beat
Dumbledore
they'd
like
to
prove
he's
only
human
moody
gave
another
harsh
laugh
and
his
magical
eye
swiveled
around
so
fast
it
made
Harry
feel
queasy
to
watch
it
so
got
any
ideas
how
you're
going
to
get
past
your
dragon
yet
said
Moody
no
said
Harry
well
i'm
not
going
to
tell
you
said
Moody
gruffly
i
don't
show
favoritism
me
i'm
just
going
to
give
you
some
good
general
advice
and
the
first
bit
is
play
to
your
strengths
i
haven't
got
any
said
Harry
before
he
could
stop
himself
excuse
me
growled
Moody
you've
got
strengths
if
I
say
you've
got
them
think
now
what
are
you
best
at
harry
tried
to
concentrate
what
was
he
best
at
well
that
was
easy
really
Quidditch
he
said
dully
and
a
fat
lot
of
help
that's
right
said
Moody
staring
at
him
very
hard
his
magical
eye
barely
moving
at
all
you're
a
damn
good
flier
from
what
i've
heard
yeah
but
harry
stared
at
him
i'm
not
allowed
a
broom
i've
only
got
my
wand
my
second
piece
of
general
advice
said
Moody
loudly
interrupting
him
is
to
use
a
nice
simple
spell
that
will
enable
you
to
get
what
you
need
harry
looked
at
him
blankly
what
did
he
need
come
on
boy
whispered
Moody
put
them
together
it's
not
that
difficult
and
it
clicked
he
was
best
at
flying
he
needed
to
pass
the
dragon
in
the
air
for
that
he
needed
his
Firebolt
and
for
his
Firebolt
he
needed
Hermione
Harry
whispered
when
he
had
sped
into
greenhouse
three
minutes
later
uttering
a
hurried
apology
to
Professor
Sprout
as
he
passed
her
hermione
I
need
you
to
help
me
what
d'you
think
i've
been
trying
to
do
Harry
she
whispered
back
her
eyes
round
with
anxiety
over
the
top
of
the
quivering
Flutterby
Bush
she
was
pruning
hermione
I
need
to
learn
how
to
do
a
Summoning
Charm
properly
by
tomorrow
afternoon
and
so
they
practiced
they
didn't
have
lunch
but
headed
for
a
free
classroom
where
Harry
tried
with
all
his
might
to
make
various
objects
fly
across
the
room
toward
him
he
was
still
having
problems
the
books
and
quills
kept
losing
heart
halfway
across
the
room
and
dropping
hike
stones
to
the
floor
concentrate
Harry
concentrate
what
d'you
think
i'm
trying
to
do
said
Harry
angrily
a
great
big
dragon
keeps
popping
up
in
my
head
for
some
reason
okay
try
again
he
wanted
to
skip
Divination
to
keep
practicing
but
Hermione
refused
point
blank
to
skive
off
Arithmancy
and
there
was
no
point
in
staying
without
her
he
therefore
had
to
endure
over
an
hour
of
Professor
Trelawney
who
spent
half
the
lesson
telling
everyone
that
the
position
of
Mars
with
relation
to
Saturn
at
that
moment
meant
that
people
born
in
July
were
in
great
danger
of
sudden
violent
deaths
well
that's
good
said
Harry
loudly
his
temper
getting
the
better
of
him
just
as
long
as
it's
not
drawnout
i
don't
want
to
suffer
ron
looked
for
a
moment
as
though
he
was
going
to
laugh
he
certainly
caught
harry's
eye
for
the
first
time
in
days
but
Harry
was
still
feeling
too
resentful
toward
Ron
to
care
he
spent
the
rest
of
the
lesson
trying
to
attract
small
objects
toward
him
under
the
table
with
his
wand
he
managed
to
make
a
fly
zoom
straight
into
his
hand
though
he
wasn't
entirely
sure
that
was
his
prowess
at
Summoning
Charms
perhaps
the
fly
was
just
stupid
he
forced
down
some
dinner
after
Divination
then
returned
to
the
empty
classroom
with
Hermione
using
the
Invisibility
Cloak
to
avoid
the
teachers
they
kept
practicing
until
past
midnight
they
would
have
stayed
longer
but
Peeves
turned
up
and
pretending
to
think
that
Harry
wanted
things
thrown
at
him
started
chucking
chairs
across
the
room
harry
and
Hermione
left
in
a
hurry
before
the
noise
attracted
Filch
and
went
back
to
the
Gryffindor
common
room
which
was
now
mercifully
empty
at
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
Harry
stood
near
the
fireplace
surrounded
by
heaps
of
objects
books
quills
several
upturned
chairs
an
old
set
of
Gobstones
and
neville's
toad
Trevor
only
in
the
last
hour
had
Harry
really
got
the
hang
of
the
Summoning
Charm
that's
better
Harry
that's
loads
better
Hermione
said
looking
exhausted
but
very
pleased
well
now
we
know
what
to
do
next
time
I
can't
manage
a
spell
Harry
said
throwing
a
rune
dictionary
back
to
Hermione
so
he
could
try
again
threaten
me
with
a
dragon
right
he
raised
his
wand
once
more
accio
Dictionary
the
heavy
book
soared
out
of
hermione's
hand
flew
across
the
room
and
Harry
caught
it
harry
I
really
think
you've
got
it
said
Hermione
delightedly
just
as
long
as
it
works
tomorrow
Harry
said
the
firebolt's
going
to
be
much
farther
away
than
the
stuff
in
here
it's
going
to
be
in
the
castle
and
i'm
going
to
be
out
there
on
the
grounds
that
doesn't
matter
said
Hermione
firmly
just
as
long
as
you're
concentrating
really
really
hard
on
it
it'll
come
harry
we'd
better
get
some
sleep
you're
going
to
need
it
harry
had
been
focusing
so
hard
on
learning
the
Summoning
Charm
that
evening
that
some
of
his
blind
panic
had
heft
him
it
returned
in
full
measure
however
on
the
following
morning
the
atmosphere
in
the
school
was
one
of
great
tension
and
excitement
lessons
were
to
stop
at
midday
giving
all
the
students
time
to
get
down
to
the
dragons
enclosure
though
of
course
they
didn't
yet
know
what
they
would
find
there
harry
felt
oddly
separate
from
everyone
around
him
whether
they
were
wishing
him
good
luck
or
hissing
we'll
have
a
box
of
tissues
ready
Potter
as
he
passed
it
was
a
state
of
nervousness
so
advanced
that
he
wondered
whether
he
mightn't
just
lose
his
head
when
they
tried
to
lead
him
out
to
his
dragon
and
start
trying
to
curse
everyone
in
sight
time
was
behaving
in
a
more
peculiar
fashion
than
ever
rushing
past
in
great
dollops
so
that
one
moment
he
seemed
to
be
sitting
down
in
his
first
lesson
History
of
Magic
and
the
next
walking
into
lunch
and
then
where
had
the
morning
gone
the
last
of
the
dragonfree
hours
Professor
McGonagall
was
hurrying
over
to
him
in
the
Great
Hall
lots
of
people
were
watching
potter
the
champions
have
to
come
down
onto
the
grounds
now
you
have
to
get
ready
for
your
first
task
okay
said
Harry
standing
up
his
fork
falling
onto
his
plate
with
a
clatter
good
luck
Harry
Hermione
whispered
you'll
be
fine
yeah
said
Harry
in
a
voice
that
was
most
unlike
his
own
he
heft
the
Great
Hall
with
Professor
McGonagall
she
didn't
seem
herself
either
in
fact
she
looked
nearly
as
anxious
as
Hermione
as
she
walked
him
down
the
stone
steps
and
out
into
the
cold
November
afternoon
she
put
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
now
don't
panic
she
said
just
keep
a
cool
head
we've
got
wizards
standing
by
to
control
the
situation
if
it
gets
out
of
hand
the
main
thing
is
just
to
do
your
best
and
nobody
will
think
any
the
worse
of
you
are
you
all
right
yes
Harry
heard
himself
say
yes
i'm
fine
she
was
leading
him
toward
the
place
where
the
dragons
were
around
the
edge
of
the
forest
but
when
they
approached
the
clump
of
trees
behind
which
the
enclosure
would
be
clearly
visible
Harry
saw
that
a
tent
had
been
erected
its
entrance
facing
them
screening
the
dragons
from
view
you're
to
go
in
here
with
the
other
champions
said
Professor
McGonagall
in
a
rather
shaky
sort
of
voice
and
wait
for
your
turn
Potter
mr.
Bagman
is
in
there
he'll
be
telling
you
the
the
procedure
good
luck
thanks
said
Harry
in
a
flat
distant
voice
she
left
him
at
the
entrance
of
the
tent
harry
went
inside
fleur
Delacour
was
sitting
in
a
corner
on
a
how
wooden
stool
she
didn't
look
nearly
as
composed
as
usual
but
rather
pale
and
clammy
viktor
Krum
looked
even
surlier
than
usual
which
Harry
supposed
was
his
way
of
showing
nerves
cedric
was
pacing
up
and
down
when
Harry
entered
Cedric
gave
him
a
small
smile
which
Harry
returned
feeling
the
muscles
in
his
face
working
rather
hard
as
though
they
had
forgotten
how
to
do
it
harry
goodo
said
Bagman
happily
looking
around
at
him
come
in
come
in
make
yourself
at
home
bagman
looked
somehow
like
a
slightly
overblown
cartoon
figure
standing
amid
all
the
palefaced
champions
he
was
wearing
his
old
Wasp
robes
again
well
now
we're
all
here
time
to
fill
you
in
said
Bagman
brightly
when
the
audience
has
assembled
i'm
going
to
be
offering
each
of
you
this
bag
he
held
up
a
small
sack
of
purple
silk
and
shook
it
at
them
from
which
you
will
each
select
a
small
model
of
the
thing
you
are
about
to
face
there
are
different
er
varieties
you
see
and
I
have
to
tell
you
something
else
too
ah
yes
your
task
is
to
collect
the
golden
egg
harry
glanced
around
cedric
had
nodded
once
to
show
that
he
understood
bagman's
words
and
then
started
pacing
around
the
tent
again
he
looked
slightly
green
fleur
Delacour
and
Krum
hadn't
reacted
at
all
perhaps
they
thought
they
might
be
sick
if
they
opened
their
mouths
that
was
certainly
how
Harry
felt
but
they
at
least
had
volunteered
for
this
and
in
no
time
at
all
hundreds
upon
hundreds
of
pairs
of
feet
could
be
heard
passing
the
tent
their
owners
talking
excitedly
laughing
joking
harry
felt
as
separate
from
the
crowd
as
though
they
were
a
different
species
and
then
it
seemed
like
about
a
second
later
to
Harry
Bagman
was
opening
the
neck
of
the
purple
silk
sack
ladies
first
he
said
offering
it
to
Fleur
Delacour
she
put
a
shaking
hand
inside
the
bag
and
drew
out
a
tiny
perfect
model
of
a
dragon
a
Welsh
Green
it
had
the
number
two
around
its
neck
And
Harry
knew
by
the
fact
that
Fleur
showed
no
sign
of
surprise
but
rather
a
determined
resignation
that
he
had
been
right
Madame
Maxime
had
told
her
what
was
coming
the
same
held
true
for
Krum
he
pulled
out
the
scarlet
Chinese
Fireball
it
had
a
number
three
around
its
neck
he
didn't
even
blink
just
sat
back
down
and
stared
at
the
ground
cedric
put
his
hand
into
the
bag
and
out
came
the
blueishgray
Swedish
Short
Snout
the
number
one
tied
around
its
neck
knowing
what
was
left
Harry
put
his
hand
into
the
silk
bag
and
pulled
out
the
Hungarian
Horntail
and
the
number
four
it
stretched
its
wings
as
he
looked
down
at
it
and
bared
its
minuscule
fangs
well
there
you
are
said
Bagman
you
have
each
pulled
out
the
dragon
you
will
face
and
the
numbers
refer
to
the
order
in
which
you
are
to
take
on
the
dragons
do
you
see
now
i'm
going
to
have
to
leave
you
in
a
moment
because
i'm
commentating
mr.
Diggory
you're
first
just
go
out
into
the
enclosure
when
you
hear
a
whistle
all
right
now
harry
could
I
have
a
quick
word
outside
er
yes
said
Harry
blankly
and
he
got
up
and
went
out
of
the
tent
with
Bagman
who
walked
him
a
short
distance
away
into
the
trees
and
then
turned
to
him
with
a
fatherly
expression
on
his
face
feeling
all
right
Harry
anything
I
can
get
you
what
said
Harry
i
no
nothing
got
a
plan
said
Bagman
lowering
his
voice
conspiratorially
because
I
don't
mind
sharing
a
few
pointers
if
you'd
like
them
you
know
i
mean
Bagman
continued
lowering
his
voice
still
further
you're
the
underdog
here
Harry
anything
I
can
do
to
help
no
said
Harry
so
quickly
he
knew
he
had
sounded
rude
no
I
I
know
what
i'm
going
to
do
thanks
nobody
would
know
Harry
said
Bagman
winking
at
him
no
i'm
fine
said
Harry
wondering
why
he
kept
telling
people
this
and
wondering
whether
he
had
ever
been
less
fine
i've
got
a
plan
worked
out
I
a
whistle
had
blown
somewhere
good
lord
i've
got
to
run
said
Bagman
in
alarm
and
he
hurried
off
harry
walked
back
to
the
tent
and
saw
Cedric
emerging
from
it
greener
than
ever
harry
tried
to
wish
him
luck
as
he
walked
past
but
all
that
came
out
of
his
mouth
was
a
sort
of
hoarse
grunt
harry
went
back
inside
to
Fleur
and
Krum
seconds
hater
they
heard
the
roar
of
the
crowd
which
meant
Cedric
had
entered
the
enclosure
and
was
now
faceto
face
with
the
living
counterpart
of
his
model
it
was
worse
than
Harry
could
ever
have
imagined
sitting
there
and
listening
the
crowd
screamed
yelled
gasped
like
a
single
manyheaded
entity
as
Cedric
did
whatever
he
was
doing
to
get
past
the
Swedish
ShortSnout
krum
was
still
staring
at
the
ground
fleur
had
now
taken
to
retracing
cedric's
steps
around
and
around
the
tent
and
bagman's
commentary
made
everything
much
much
worse
horrible
pictures
formed
in
harry's
mind
as
he
heard
Oooh
narrow
miss
there
very
narrow
he's
taking
risks
this
one
clever
move
pity
it
didn't
work
and
then
after
about
fifteen
minutes
Harry
heard
the
deafening
roar
that
could
mean
only
one
thing
Cedric
had
gotten
past
his
dragon
and
captured
the
golden
egg
very
good
indeed
bagman
was
shouting
and
now
the
marks
from
the
judges
but
he
didn't
shout
out
the
marks
Harry
supposed
the
judges
were
holding
them
up
and
showing
them
to
the
crowd
one
down
three
to
go
bagman
yelled
as
the
whistle
blew
again
miss
Delacour
if
you
please
fleur
was
trembling
from
head
to
foot
Harry
felt
more
warmly
toward
her
than
he
had
done
so
far
as
she
heft
the
tent
with
her
head
held
high
and
her
hand
clutching
her
wand
he
and
Krum
were
left
alone
at
opposite
sides
of
the
tent
avoiding
each
other's
gaze
the
same
process
started
again
oh
i'm
not
sure
that
was
wise
they
could
hear
Bagman
shouting
gleefully
oh
nearly
careful
now
good
lord
I
thought
she'd
had
it
then
ten
minutes
later
Harry
heard
the
crowd
erupt
into
applause
once
more
fleur
must
have
been
successful
too
a
pause
while
fleur's
marks
were
being
shown
more
clapping
then
for
the
third
time
the
whistle
and
here
comes
mr.
Krum
cried
Bagman
and
Krum
slouched
out
leaving
Harry
quite
alone
he
felt
much
more
aware
of
his
body
than
usual
very
aware
of
the
way
his
heart
was
pumping
fast
and
his
fingers
tingling
with
fear
yet
at
the
same
time
he
seemed
to
be
outside
himself
seeing
the
walls
of
the
tent
and
hearing
the
crowd
as
though
from
far
away
very
daring
bagman
was
yelling
and
Harry
heard
the
Chinese
Fireball
emit
a
horrible
roaring
shriek
while
the
crowd
drew
its
collective
breath
that's
some
nerve
he's
showing
and
yes
he's
got
the
egg
applause
shattered
the
wintery
air
like
breaking
glass
Krum
had
finished
it
would
be
harry's
turn
any
moment
he
stood
up
noticing
dimly
that
his
legs
seemed
to
be
made
of
marshmallow
he
waited
and
then
he
heard
the
whistle
blow
he
walked
out
through
the
entrance
of
the
tent
the
panic
rising
into
a
crescendo
inside
him
and
now
he
was
walking
past
the
trees
through
a
gap
in
the
enclosure
fence
he
saw
everything
in
front
of
him
as
though
it
was
a
very
highly
colored
dream
there
were
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
faces
staring
down
at
him
from
stands
that
had
been
magicked
there
since
he'd
last
stood
on
this
spot
and
there
was
the
Horntail
at
the
other
end
of
the
enclosure
crouched
low
over
her
clutch
of
eggs
her
wings
halffurled
her
evil
yellow
eyes
upon
him
a
monstrous
scaly
black
lizard
thrashing
her
spiked
tail
heaving
yardlong
gouge
marks
in
the
hard
ground
the
crowd
was
making
a
great
deal
of
noise
but
whether
friendly
or
not
Harry
didn't
know
or
care
it
was
time
to
do
what
he
had
to
do
to
focus
his
mind
entirely
and
absolutely
upon
the
thing
that
was
his
only
chance
he
raised
his
wand
accio
Firebolt
he
shouted
harry
waited
every
fiber
of
him
hoping
praying
if
it
hadn't
worked
if
it
wasn't
coming
he
seemed
to
be
looking
at
everything
around
him
through
some
sort
of
shimmering
transparent
barrier
like
a
heat
haze
which
made
the
enclosure
and
the
hundreds
of
faces
around
him
swim
strangely
and
then
he
heard
it
speeding
through
the
air
behind
him
he
turned
and
saw
his
Firebolt
hurtling
toward
him
around
the
edge
of
the
woods
soaring
into
the
enclosure
and
stopping
dead
in
midair
beside
him
waiting
for
him
to
mount
the
crowd
was
making
even
more
noise
bagman
was
shouting
something
but
harry's
ears
were
not
working
properly
anymore
listening
wasn't
important
he
swung
his
leg
over
the
broom
and
kicked
off
from
the
ground
and
a
second
later
something
miraculous
happened
as
he
soared
upward
as
the
wind
rushed
through
his
hair
as
the
crowd's
faces
became
mere
fleshcolored
pinpnicks
below
and
the
Horntail
shrank
to
the
size
of
a
dog
he
realized
that
he
had
heft
not
only
the
ground
behind
but
also
his
fear
he
was
back
where
he
belonged
this
was
just
another
Quidditch
match
that
was
all
just
another
Quidditch
match
and
that
Horntail
was
just
another
ugly
opposing
team
he
looked
down
at
the
clutch
of
eggs
and
spotted
the
gold
one
gleaming
against
its
cementcolored
fellows
residing
safely
between
the
dragon's
front
legs
okay
Harry
told
himself
diversionary
tactics
let's
go
he
dived
the
horntail's
head
followed
him
he
knew
what
it
was
going
to
do
and
pulled
out
of
the
dive
just
in
time
a
jet
of
fire
had
been
released
exactly
where
he
would
have
been
had
he
not
swerved
away
but
Harry
didn't
care
that
was
no
more
than
dodging
a
Bludger
great
Scott
he
can
fly
yelled
Bagman
as
the
crowd
shrieked
and
gasped
are
you
watching
this
mr.
Krum
harry
soared
higher
in
a
circle
the
Horntail
was
still
following
his
progress
its
head
revolving
on
its
long
neck
if
he
kept
this
up
it
would
be
nicely
dizzy
but
better
not
push
it
too
long
or
it
would
be
breathing
fire
again
Harry
plummeted
just
as
the
Horntail
opened
its
mouth
but
this
time
he
was
less
lucky
he
missed
the
flames
but
the
tail
came
whipping
up
to
meet
him
instead
and
as
he
swerved
to
the
left
one
of
the
long
spikes
grazed
his
shoulder
ripping
his
robes
He
could
feel
it
stinging
he
could
hear
screaming
and
groans
from
the
crowd
but
the
cut
didn't
seem
to
be
deep
now
he
zoomed
around
the
back
of
the
Horntail
and
a
possibility
occurred
to
him
the
Horntail
didn't
seem
to
want
to
take
off
she
was
too
protective
of
her
eggs
though
she
writhed
and
twisted
furling
and
unfurling
her
wings
and
keeping
those
fearsome
yellow
eyes
on
Harry
she
was
afraid
to
move
too
far
from
them
but
he
had
to
persuade
her
to
do
it
or
he'd
never
get
near
them
the
trick
was
to
do
it
carefully
gradually
he
began
to
fly
first
this
way
then
the
other
not
near
enough
to
make
her
breathe
fire
to
stave
him
off
but
still
posing
a
sufficient
threat
to
ensure
she
kept
her
eyes
on
him
her
head
swayed
this
way
and
that
watching
him
out
of
those
vertical
pupils
her
fangs
bared
he
flew
higher
the
horntail's
head
rose
with
him
her
neck
now
stretched
to
its
fullest
extent
still
swaying
hike
a
snake
before
its
charmer
harry
rose
a
few
more
feet
and
she
let
out
a
roar
of
exasperation
he
was
like
a
fly
to
her
a
fly
she
was
longing
to
swat
her
tail
thrashed
again
but
he
was
too
high
to
reach
now
she
shot
fire
into
the
air
which
he
dodged
her
jaws
opened
wide
come
on
Harry
hissed
swerving
tantalizingly
above
her
come
on
come
and
get
me
up
you
get
now
and
then
she
reared
spreading
her
great
black
leathery
wings
at
last
as
wide
as
those
of
a
small
airplane
and
Harry
dived
before
the
dragon
knew
what
he
had
done
or
where
he
had
disappeared
to
he
was
speeding
toward
the
ground
as
fast
as
he
could
go
toward
the
eggs
now
unprotected
by
her
clawed
front
legs
he
had
taken
his
hands
off
his
Firebolt
he
had
seized
the
golden
egg
And
with
a
huge
spurt
of
speed
he
was
off
he
was
soaring
out
over
the
stands
the
heavy
egg
safely
under
his
uninjured
arm
and
it
was
as
though
somebody
had
just
turned
the
volume
back
up
for
the
first
time
he
became
properly
aware
of
the
noise
of
the
crowd
which
was
screaming
and
applauding
as
loudly
as
the
Irish
supporters
at
the
World
Cup
Look
at
that
bagman
was
yelling
will
you
look
at
that
our
youngest
champion
is
quickest
to
get
his
egg
well
this
is
going
to
shorten
the
odds
on
Mr
potter
harry
saw
the
dragon
keepers
rushing
forward
to
subdue
the
Horntail
and
over
at
the
entrance
to
the
enclosure
Professor
McGonagalh
Professor
Moody
and
Hagrid
hurrying
to
meet
him
all
of
them
waving
him
toward
them
their
smiles
evident
even
from
this
distance
he
flew
back
over
the
stands
the
noise
of
the
crowd
pounding
his
eardrums
and
came
in
smoothly
to
land
his
heart
lighter
than
it
had
been
in
weeks
he
had
got
through
the
first
task
he
had
survived
that
was
excellent
Potter
cried
Professor
McGonagall
as
he
got
off
the
Firebolt
which
from
her
was
extravagant
praise
he
noticed
that
her
hand
shook
as
she
pointed
at
his
shoulder
you'll
need
to
see
Madam
Pomfrey
before
the
judges
give
out
your
score
over
there
she's
had
to
mop
up
Diggory
already
yeh
did
it
Harry
said
Hagrid
hoarsely
yeh
did
it
an
agains
the
Horntail
an
all
an
yeh
know
Charlie
said
that
was
the
wors
thanks
Hagrid
said
Harry
loudly
so
that
Hagrid
wouldn't
blunder
on
and
reveal
that
he
had
shown
Harry
the
dragons
beforehand
professor
Moody
looked
very
pleased
too
his
magical
eye
was
dancing
in
its
socket
nice
and
easy
does
the
trick
Potter
he
growled
right
then
Potter
the
first
aid
tent
please
said
Professor
McGonagall
harry
walked
out
of
the
enclosure
still
panting
and
saw
Madam
Pomfrey
standing
at
the
mouth
of
a
second
tent
looking
worried
dragons
she
said
in
a
disgusted
tone
pulling
Harry
inside
the
tent
was
divided
into
cubicles
he
could
make
out
cedric's
shadow
through
the
canvas
but
Cedric
didn't
seem
to
be
badly
injured
he
was
sitting
up
at
least
madam
Pomfrey
examined
harry's
shoulder
talking
furiously
all
the
while
last
year
dementors
this
year
dragons
what
are
they
going
to
bring
into
this
school
next
you're
very
lucky
this
is
quite
shallow
it'll
need
cleaning
before
I
heal
it
up
though
she
cleaned
the
cut
with
a
dab
of
some
purple
liquid
that
smoked
and
stung
but
then
poked
his
shoulder
with
her
wand
and
he
felt
it
heal
instantly
now
just
sit
quietly
for
a
minute
sit
and
then
you
can
go
and
get
your
score
she
bustled
out
of
the
tent
and
he
heard
her
go
next
door
and
say
How
does
it
feel
now
Diggory
harry
didn't
want
to
sit
still
He
was
too
full
of
adrenaline
he
got
to
his
feet
wanting
to
see
what
was
going
on
outside
but
before
he'd
reached
the
mouth
of
the
tent
two
people
had
come
darting
inside
Hermione
followed
closely
by
Ron
harry
you
were
brilliant
hermione
said
squeakily
there
were
fingernail
marks
on
her
face
where
she
had
been
clutching
it
in
fear
you
were
amazing
you
really
were
but
Harry
was
looking
at
Ron
who
was
very
white
and
staring
at
Harry
as
though
he
were
a
ghost
harry
he
said
very
seriously
whoever
put
your
name
in
that
goblet
I
I
reckon
they're
trying
to
do
you
in
it
was
as
though
the
last
few
weeks
had
never
happened
as
though
Harry
were
meeting
Ron
for
the
first
time
right
after
he'd
been
made
champion
caught
on
have
you
said
Harry
coldly
took
you
long
enough
hermione
stood
nervously
between
them
looking
from
one
to
the
other
ron
opened
his
mouth
uncertainly
harry
knew
Ron
was
about
to
apologize
and
suddenly
he
found
he
didn't
need
to
hear
it
it's
okay
he
said
before
Ron
could
get
the
words
out
forget
it
no
said
Ron
I
shouldn't've
forget
it
Harry
said
ron
grinned
nervously
at
him
and
Harry
grinned
back
Hermione
burst
into
tears
there's
nothing
to
cry
about
harry
told
her
bewildered
you
two
are
so
stupid
she
shouted
stamping
her
foot
on
the
ground
tears
splashing
down
her
front
then
before
either
of
them
could
stop
her
she
had
given
both
of
them
a
hug
and
dashed
away
now
positively
howling
barking
mad
said
Ron
shaking
his
head
harry
c'mon
they'll
be
putting
up
your
scores
picking
up
the
golden
egg
and
his
Firebolt
feeling
more
elated
than
he
would
have
believed
possible
an
hour
ago
Harry
ducked
out
of
the
tent
Ron
by
his
side
talking
fast
you
were
the
best
you
know
no
competition
cedric
did
this
weird
thing
where
he
Transfigured
a
rock
on
the
ground
turned
it
into
a
dog
he
was
trying
to
make
the
dragon
go
for
the
dog
instead
of
him
well
it
was
a
pretty
cool
bit
of
Transfiguration
and
it
sort
of
worked
because
he
did
get
the
egg
but
he
got
burned
as
well
the
dragon
changed
its
mind
halfway
through
and
decided
it
would
rather
have
him
than
the
Labrador
he
only
just
got
away
and
that
Fleur
girl
tried
this
sort
of
charm
I
think
she
was
trying
to
put
it
into
a
trance
well
that
kind
of
worked
too
it
went
all
sleepy
but
then
it
snored
and
this
great
jet
of
flame
shot
out
and
her
skirt
caught
fire
she
put
it
out
with
a
bit
of
water
out
of
her
wand
and
Krum
you
won't
believe
this
but
he
didn't
even
think
of
flying
he
was
probably
the
best
after
you
though
hit
it
with
some
sort
of
spell
right
in
the
eye
only
thing
is
it
went
trampling
around
in
agony
and
squashed
half
the
real
eggs
they
took
marks
off
for
that
he
wasn't
supposed
to
do
any
damage
to
them
ron
drew
breath
as
he
and
Harry
reached
the
edge
of
the
enclosure
now
that
the
Horntail
had
been
taken
away
Harry
could
see
where
the
five
judges
were
sitting
right
at
the
other
end
in
raised
seats
draped
in
gold
it's
marks
out
of
ten
from
each
one
Ron
said
and
Harry
squinting
up
the
field
saw
the
first
judge
Madame
Maxime
raise
her
wand
in
the
air
what
hooked
like
a
long
silver
ribbon
shot
out
of
it
which
twisted
itself
into
a
large
figure
eight
not
bad
said
Ron
as
the
crowd
applauded
i
suppose
she
took
marks
off
for
your
shoulder
mr.
Crouch
came
next
he
shot
a
number
nine
into
the
air
looking
good
ron
yelled
thumping
Harry
on
the
back
next
Dumbledore
he
too
put
up
a
nine
the
crowd
was
cheering
harder
than
ever
ludo
Bagman
ten
ten
said
Harry
in
disbelief
but
i
got
hurt
what's
he
playing
at
harry
don't
complain
ron
yelled
excitedly
and
now
Karkaroff
raised
his
wand
he
paused
for
a
moment
and
then
a
number
shot
out
of
his
wand
too
four
what
ron
bellowed
furiously
four
you
lousy
biased
scumbag
you
gave
Krum
ten
but
Harry
didn't
care
he
wouldn't
have
cared
if
Karkaroff
had
given
him
zero
ron's
indignation
on
his
behalf
was
worth
about
a
hundred
points
to
him
he
didn't
tell
Ron
this
of
course
but
his
heart
felt
lighter
than
air
as
he
turned
to
leave
the
enclosure
and
it
wasn't
just
Ron
those
weren't
only
Gryffindors
cheering
in
the
crowd
when
it
had
come
to
it
when
they
had
seen
what
he
was
facing
most
of
the
school
had
been
on
his
side
as
well
as
cedric's
he
didn't
care
about
the
Slytherins
he
could
stand
whatever
they
threw
at
him
now
you're
tied
in
first
place
Harry
you
and
Krum
said
Charlie
Weasley
hurrying
to
meet
them
as
they
set
off
back
toward
the
school
listen
i've
got
to
run
i've
got
to
go
and
send
Mum
an
owl
I
swore
i'd
tell
her
what
happened
but
that
was
unbelievable
oh
yeah
and
they
told
me
to
tell
you
you've
got
to
hang
around
for
a
few
more
minutes
bagman
wants
a
word
back
in
the
champions
tent
ron
said
he
would
wait
so
Harry
reentered
the
tent
which
somehow
looked
quite
different
now
friendly
and
welcoming
he
thought
back
to
how
he'd
felt
while
dodging
the
Horntail
and
compared
it
to
the
long
wait
before
he'd
walked
out
to
face
it
there
was
no
comparison
the
wait
had
been
immeasurably
worse
fleur
Cedric
and
Krum
all
came
in
together
one
side
of
cedric's
face
was
covered
in
a
thick
orange
paste
which
was
presumably
mending
his
burn
he
grinned
at
Harry
when
he
saw
him
good
one
Harry
and
you
said
Harry
grinning
back
well
done
all
of
you
said
Ludo
Bagman
bouncing
into
the
tent
and
looking
as
pleased
as
though
he
personally
had
just
got
past
a
dragon
now
just
a
quick
few
words
you've
got
a
nice
long
break
before
the
second
task
which
will
take
place
at
half
past
nine
on
the
morning
of
February
the
twentyfourth
but
we're
giving
you
something
to
think
about
in
the
meantime
if
you
look
down
at
those
golden
eggs
you're
all
holding
you
will
see
that
they
open
see
the
hinges
there
you
need
to
solve
the
clue
inside
the
egg
because
it
will
tell
you
what
the
second
task
is
and
enable
you
to
prepare
for
it
all
clear
sure
well
off
you
go
then
harry
left
the
tent
rejoined
Ron
and
they
started
to
walk
back
around
the
edge
of
the
forest
talking
hard
Harry
wanted
to
hear
what
the
other
champions
had
done
in
more
detail
then
as
they
rounded
the
clump
of
trees
behind
which
Harry
had
first
heard
the
dragons
roar
a
witch
leapt
out
from
behind
them
it
was
Rita
Skeeter
she
was
wearing
acidgreen
robes
today
the
QuickQuotes
Quill
in
her
hand
blended
perfectly
against
them
congratulations
Harry
she
said
beaming
at
him
i
wonder
if
you
could
give
me
a
quick
word
how
you
felt
facing
that
dragon
how
you
feel
now
about
the
fairness
of
the
scoring
yeah
you
can
have
a
word
said
Harry
savagely
goodbye
and
he
set
off
back
to
the
castle
with
Ron
chapter
twentyone
the
houseelf
liberation
front
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
went
up
to
the
Owlery
that
evening
to
find
Pigwidgeon
so
that
Harry
could
send
Sirius
a
letter
telling
him
that
he
had
managed
to
get
past
his
dragon
unscathed
on
the
way
Harry
filled
Ron
in
on
everything
Sirius
had
told
him
about
Karkaroff
though
shocked
at
first
to
hear
that
Karkaroff
had
been
a
Death
Eater
by
the
time
they
entered
the
Owlery
Ron
was
saying
that
they
ought
to
have
suspected
it
all
along
fits
doesn't
it
he
said
remember
what
Malfoy
said
on
the
train
about
his
dad
being
friends
with
Karkaroff
now
we
know
where
they
knew
each
other
they
were
probably
running
around
in
masks
together
at
the
World
Cup
i'll
tell
you
one
thing
though
Harry
if
it
was
Karkaroff
who
put
your
name
in
the
goblet
he's
going
to
be
feeling
really
stupid
now
isn't
he
didn't
work
did
it
you
only
got
a
scratch
come
here
i'll
do
it
pigwidgeon
was
so
overexcited
at
the
idea
of
a
delivery
he
was
flying
around
and
around
harry's
head
hooting
incessantly
ron
snatched
Pigwidgeon
out
of
the
air
and
held
him
still
while
Harry
attached
the
letter
to
his
leg
there's
no
way
any
of
the
other
tasks
are
going
to
be
that
dangerous
how
could
they
be
ron
went
on
as
he
carried
Pigwidgeon
to
the
window
you
know
what
i
reckon
you
could
win
this
tournament
Harry
i'm
serious
harry
knew
that
Ron
was
only
saying
this
to
make
up
for
his
behavior
of
the
last
few
weeks
but
he
appreciated
it
all
the
same
hermione
however
leaned
against
the
Owlery
wall
folded
her
arms
and
frowned
at
Ron
harry's
got
a
long
way
to
go
before
he
finishes
this
tournament
she
said
seriously
if
that
was
the
first
task
I
hate
to
think
what's
coming
next
right
little
ray
of
sunshine
aren't
you
said
Ron
you
and
Professor
Trelawney
should
get
together
sometime
he
threw
Pigwidgeon
out
of
the
window
pigwidgeon
plummeted
twelve
feet
before
managing
to
pull
himself
back
up
again
the
letter
attached
to
his
leg
was
much
longer
and
heavier
than
usual
Harry
hadn't
been
able
to
resist
giving
Sirius
a
blowbyblow
account
of
exactly
how
he
had
swerved
circled
and
dodged
the
Horntail
they
watched
Pigwidgeon
disappear
into
the
darkness
and
then
Ron
said
Well
we'd
better
get
downstairs
for
your
surprise
party
Harry
Fred
and
George
should
have
nicked
enough
food
from
the
kitchens
by
now
sure
enough
when
they
entered
the
Gryffindor
common
room
it
exploded
with
cheers
and
yells
again
there
were
mountains
of
cakes
and
flagons
of
pumpkin
juice
and
butterbeer
on
every
surface
Lee
Jordan
had
let
off
some
filibuster's
Fireworks
so
that
the
air
was
thick
with
stars
and
sparks
and
Dean
Thomas
who
was
very
good
at
drawing
had
put
up
some
impressive
new
banners
most
of
which
depicted
Harry
zooming
around
the
horntail's
head
on
his
Firebolt
though
a
couple
showed
Cedric
with
his
head
on
fire
harry
helped
himself
to
food
he
had
almost
forgotten
what
it
was
like
to
feel
properly
hungry
and
sat
down
with
Ron
and
Hermione
he
couldn't
believe
how
happy
he
felt
he
had
Ron
back
on
his
side
he'd
gotten
through
the
first
task
and
he
wouldn't
have
to
face
the
second
one
for
three
months
blimey
this
is
heavy
said
Lee
Jordan
picking
up
the
golden
egg
which
Harry
had
left
on
a
table
and
weighing
it
in
his
hands
open
it
Harry
go
on
let's
just
see
what's
inside
it
he's
supposed
to
work
out
the
clue
on
his
own
Hermione
said
swiftly
it's
in
the
tournament
rules
i
was
supposed
to
work
out
how
to
get
past
the
dragon
on
my
own
too
Harry
muttered
so
only
Hermione
could
hear
him
and
she
grinned
rather
guiltily
yeah
go
on
Harry
open
it
several
people
echoed
lee
passed
Harry
the
egg
and
Harry
dug
his
fingernails
into
the
groove
that
ran
all
the
way
around
it
and
prised
it
open
it
was
hollow
and
completely
empty
but
the
moment
Harry
opened
it
the
most
horrible
noise
a
loud
and
screechy
wailing
filled
the
room
the
nearest
thing
to
it
Harry
had
ever
heard
was
the
ghost
orchestra
at
Nearly
Headless
nick's
deathday
party
who
had
all
been
playing
the
musical
saw
shut
it
fred
bellowed
his
hands
over
his
ears
what
was
that
said
Seamus
Finnigan
staring
at
the
egg
as
Harry
slammed
it
shut
again
sounded
like
a
banshee
maybe
you've
got
to
get
past
one
of
those
next
Harry
it
was
someone
being
tortured
said
Neville
who
had
gone
very
white
and
spilled
sausage
rolls
all
over
the
floor
you're
going
to
have
to
fight
the
Cruciatus
Curse
don't
be
a
prat
Neville
that's
illegal
said
George
they
wouldn't
use
the
Cruciatus
Curse
on
the
champions
i
thought
it
sounded
a
bit
like
Percy
singing
maybe
you've
got
to
attack
him
while
he's
in
the
shower
harry
want
a
jam
tart
Hermione
said
Fred
hermione
looked
doubtfully
at
the
plate
he
was
offering
her
fred
grinned
it's
all
right
he
said
i
haven't
done
anything
to
them
it's
the
custard
creams
you've
got
to
watch
neville
who
had
just
bitten
into
a
custard
cream
choked
and
spat
it
out
fred
laughed
just
my
little
joke
Neville
hermione
took
a
jam
tart
then
she
said
Did
you
get
all
this
from
the
kitchens
Fred
yep
said
Fred
grinning
at
her
he
put
on
a
highpitched
squeak
and
imitated
a
houseelf
anything
we
can
get
you
sir
anything
at
all
they're
dead
helpful
get
me
a
roast
ox
if
I
said
I
was
peckish
how
do
you
get
in
there
hermione
said
in
an
innocently
casual
sort
of
voice
easy
said
Fred
concealed
door
behind
a
painting
of
a
bowl
of
fruit
just
tickle
the
pear
and
it
giggles
and
He
stopped
and
looked
suspiciously
at
her
why
nothing
said
Hermione
quickly
going
to
try
and
lead
the
houseelves
out
on
strike
now
are
you
said
George
going
to
give
up
all
the
leaflet
stuff
and
try
and
stir
them
up
into
rebellion
several
people
chortled
hermione
didn't
answer
don't
you
go
upsetting
them
and
telling
them
they've
got
to
take
clothes
and
salaries
said
Fred
warningly
you'll
put
them
off
their
cooking
just
then
Neville
caused
a
slight
diversion
by
turning
into
a
large
canary
oh
sorry
Neville
fred
shouted
over
all
the
laughter
i
forgot
it
was
the
custard
creams
we
hexed
within
a
minute
however
Neville
had
molted
and
once
his
feathers
had
fallen
off
he
reappeared
looking
entirely
normal
he
even
joined
in
laughing
canary
Creams
fred
shouted
to
the
excitable
crowd
george
and
I
invented
them
seven
Sickles
each
a
bargain
it
was
nearly
one
in
the
morning
when
Harry
finally
went
up
to
the
dormitory
with
Ron
Neville
Seamus
and
Dean
before
he
pulled
the
curtains
of
his
fourposter
shut
harry
set
his
tiny
model
of
the
Hungarian
Horntail
on
the
table
next
to
his
bed
where
it
yawned
curled
up
and
closed
its
eyes
really
Harry
thought
as
he
pulled
the
hangings
on
his
fourposter
closed
Hagrid
had
a
point
they
were
all
right
really
dragons
the
start
of
December
brought
wind
and
sleet
to
Hogwarts
drafty
though
the
castle
always
was
in
winter
harry
was
glad
of
its
fires
and
thick
walls
every
time
he
passed
the
Durmstrang
ship
on
the
lake
which
was
pitching
in
the
high
winds
its
black
sails
billowing
against
the
dark
skies
he
thought
the
Beauxbatons
caravan
was
likely
to
be
pretty
chilly
too
hagrid
he
noticed
was
keeping
Madame
maxime's
horses
well
provided
with
their
preferred
drink
of
singlemalt
whiskey
the
fumes
wafting
from
the
trough
in
the
comer
of
their
paddock
was
enough
to
make
the
entire
Care
of
Magical
Creatures
class
lightheaded
this
was
unhelpful
as
they
were
still
tending
the
horrible
skrewts
and
needed
their
wits
about
them
i'm
not
sure
whether
they
hibernate
or
not
Hagrid
told
the
shivering
class
in
the
windy
pumpkin
patch
next
lesson
thought
we'd
jus
try
an
see
if
they
fancied
a
kip
we'll
jus
settle
em
down
in
these
boxes
there
were
now
only
ten
skrewts
left
apparently
their
desire
to
kill
one
another
had
not
been
exercised
out
of
them
each
of
them
was
now
approaching
six
feet
in
length
their
thick
gray
armor
their
powerful
scuttling
legs
their
fireblasting
ends
their
stings
and
their
suckers
combined
to
make
the
skrewts
the
most
repulsive
things
Harry
had
ever
seen
the
class
looked
dispiritedly
at
the
enormous
boxes
Hagrid
had
brought
out
all
lined
with
pillows
and
fluffy
blankets
we'll
jus
lead
em
in
here
Hagrid
said
an
put
the
lids
on
and
we'll
see
what
happens
but
the
skrewts
it
transpired
did
not
hibernate
and
did
not
appreciate
being
forced
into
pillowlined
boxes
and
nailed
in
hagrid
was
soon
yelling
Don
panic
now
don
panic
while
the
skrewts
rampaged
around
the
pumpkin
patch
now
strewn
with
the
smoldering
wreckage
of
the
boxes
most
of
the
class
Malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
in
the
lead
had
fled
into
hagrid's
cabin
through
the
back
door
and
barricaded
themselves
in
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
however
were
among
those
who
remained
outside
trying
to
help
Hagrid
together
they
managed
to
restrain
and
tie
up
nine
of
the
skrewts
though
at
the
cost
of
numerous
burns
and
cuts
finally
only
one
skrewt
was
left
don
frighten
him
now
hagrid
shouted
as
Ron
and
Harry
used
their
wands
to
shoot
jets
of
fiery
sparks
at
the
skrewt
which
was
advancing
menacingly
on
them
its
sting
arched
quivering
over
its
back
jus
try
an
slip
the
rope
round
his
sting
so
he
won
hurt
any
o
the
others
yeah
we
wouldn't
want
that
ron
shouted
angrily
as
he
and
Harry
backed
into
the
wall
of
hagrid's
cabin
still
holding
the
skrewt
off
with
their
sparks
well
well
well
this
does
look
like
fun
rita
Skeeter
was
leaning
on
hagrid's
garden
fence
looking
in
at
the
mayhem
she
was
wearing
a
thick
magenta
cloak
with
a
furry
purple
collar
today
and
her
crocodileskin
handbag
was
over
her
arm
hagrid
launched
himself
forward
on
top
of
the
skrewt
that
was
cornering
Harry
and
Ron
and
flattened
it
a
blast
of
fire
shot
out
of
its
end
withering
the
pumpkin
plants
nearby
who're
you
hagrid
asked
Rita
Skeeter
as
he
slipped
a
loop
of
rope
around
the
skrewt's
sting
and
tightened
it
rita
Skeeter
Daily
Prophet
reporter
Rita
replied
beaming
at
him
her
gold
teeth
glinted
thought
Dumbledore
said
you
weren
allowed
inside
the
school
anymore
said
Hagrid
frowning
slightly
as
he
got
off
the
slightly
squashed
skrewt
and
started
tugging
it
over
to
its
fellows
rita
acted
as
though
she
hadn't
heard
what
Hagrid
had
said
what
are
these
fascinating
creatures
called
she
asked
beaming
still
more
widely
blastEnded
Skrewts
grunted
Hagrid
really
said
Rita
apparently
full
of
lively
interest
i've
never
heard
of
them
before
where
do
they
come
from
harry
noticed
a
dull
red
flush
rising
up
out
of
hagrid's
wild
black
beard
and
his
heart
sank
where
had
Hagrid
got
the
skrewts
from
hermione
who
seemed
to
be
thinking
along
these
lines
said
quickly
they're
very
interesting
aren't
they
aren't
they
harry
what
oh
yeah
ouch
interesting
said
Harry
as
she
stepped
on
his
foot
ah
you're
here
harry
said
Rita
Skeeter
as
she
looked
around
so
you
like
Care
of
Magical
Creatures
do
you
one
of
your
favorite
lessons
yes
said
Harry
stoutly
hagrid
beamed
at
him
lovely
said
Rita
really
lovely
been
teaching
long
she
added
to
Hagrid
harry
noticed
her
eyes
travel
over
Dean
who
had
a
nasty
cut
across
one
cheek
lavender
whose
robes
were
badly
singed
Seamus
who
was
nursing
several
burnt
fingers
and
then
to
the
cabin
windows
where
most
of
the
class
stood
their
noses
pressed
against
the
glass
waiting
to
see
if
the
coast
was
clear
this
is
o'ny
me
second
year
said
Hagrid
lovely
i
don't
suppose
you'd
like
to
give
an
interview
would
you
share
some
of
your
experience
of
magical
creatures
the
Prophet
does
a
zoological
column
every
Wednesday
as
i'm
sure
you
know
we
could
feature
these
er
Bang
Ended
Scoots
blastEnded
Skrewts
Hagrid
said
eagerly
er
yeah
why
not
harry
had
a
very
bad
feeling
about
this
but
there
was
no
way
of
communicating
it
to
Hagrid
without
Rita
Skeeter
seeing
so
he
had
to
stand
and
watch
in
silence
as
Hagrid
and
Rita
Skeeter
made
arrangements
to
meet
in
the
Three
Broomsticks
for
a
good
long
interview
later
that
week
then
the
bell
rang
up
at
the
castle
signaling
the
end
of
the
lesson
well
goodbye
Harry
rita
Skeeter
called
merrily
to
him
as
he
set
off
with
Ron
and
Hermione
until
Friday
night
then
Hagrid
she'll
twist
everything
he
says
Harry
said
under
his
breath
just
as
long
as
he
didn't
import
those
skrewts
illegally
or
anything
said
Hermione
desperately
they
looked
at
one
another
it
was
exactly
the
sort
of
thing
Hagrid
might
do
hagrids
been
in
loads
of
trouble
before
and
Dumbledores
never
sacked
him
said
Ron
consolingly
worst
that
can
happen
is
hagrid'll
have
to
get
rid
of
the
skrewts
sorry
did
I
say
worst
i
meant
best
harry
and
Hermione
laughed
and
feeling
slightly
more
cheerful
went
off
to
lunch
harry
thoroughly
enjoyed
double
Divination
that
afternoon
they
were
still
doing
star
charts
and
predictions
but
now
that
he
and
Ron
were
friends
once
more
the
whole
thing
seemed
very
funny
again
professor
Trelawney
who
had
been
so
pleased
with
the
pair
of
them
when
they
had
been
predicting
their
own
horrific
deaths
quickly
became
irritated
as
they
sniggered
through
her
explanation
of
the
various
ways
in
which
Pluto
could
disrupt
everyday
life
i
would
think
she
said
in
a
mystical
whisper
that
did
not
conceal
her
obvious
annoyance
that
some
of
us
she
stared
very
meaningfully
at
Harry
might
be
a
little
less
frivolous
had
they
seen
what
I
have
seen
during
my
crystal
gazing
last
night
as
I
sat
here
absorbed
in
my
needlework
the
urge
to
consult
the
orb
overpowered
me
i
arose
I
settled
myself
before
it
and
I
gazed
into
its
crystalline
depths
and
what
do
you
think
I
saw
gazing
back
at
me
an
ugly
old
bat
in
outsize
specs
ron
muttered
under
his
breath
harry
fought
hard
to
keep
his
face
straight
death
my
dears
parvati
and
Lavender
both
put
their
hands
over
their
mouths
looking
horrified
yes
said
Professor
Trelawney
nodding
impressively
it
comes
ever
closer
it
circles
overhead
like
a
vulture
ever
lower
ever
lower
over
the
castle
she
stared
pointedly
at
Harry
who
yawned
very
widely
and
obviously
it'd
be
a
bit
more
impressive
if
she
hadn't
done
it
about
eighty
times
before
harry
said
as
they
finally
regained
the
fresh
air
of
the
staircase
beneath
Professor
trelawney's
room
but
if
i'd
dropped
dead
every
time
she's
told
me
i'm
going
to
i'd
be
a
medical
miracle
you'd
be
a
sort
of
extraconcentrated
ghost
said
Ron
chortling
as
they
passed
the
Bloody
Baron
going
in
the
opposite
direction
his
wide
eyes
staring
sinisterly
at
least
we
didn't
get
homework
i
hope
Hermione
got
loads
off
Professor
Vector
I
love
not
working
when
she
is
but
Hermione
wasn't
at
dinner
nor
was
she
in
the
library
when
they
went
to
look
for
her
afterward
the
only
person
in
there
was
Viktor
Krum
ron
hovered
behind
the
bookshelves
for
a
while
watching
Krum
debating
in
whispers
with
Harry
whether
he
should
ask
for
an
autograph
but
then
Ron
realized
that
six
or
seven
girls
were
lurking
in
the
next
row
of
books
debating
exactly
the
same
thing
and
he
lost
his
enthusiasm
for
the
idea
wonder
where
she's
got
to
ron
said
as
he
and
Harry
went
back
to
Gryffindor
Tower
dunno
balderdash
but
the
Fat
Lady
had
barely
begun
to
swing
forward
when
the
sound
of
racing
feet
behind
them
announced
hermione's
arrival
harry
she
panted
skidding
to
a
halt
beside
him
the
Fat
Lady
stared
down
at
her
eyebrows
raised
harry
you've
got
to
come
you've
got
to
come
the
most
amazing
thing's
happened
please
she
seized
harry's
arm
and
started
to
try
to
drag
him
back
along
the
corridor
what's
the
matter
harry
said
i'll
show
you
when
we
get
there
oh
come
on
quick
harry
looked
around
at
Ron
he
looked
back
at
Harry
intrigued
okay
Harry
said
starting
off
back
down
the
corridor
with
Hermione
Ron
hurrying
to
keep
up
oh
don't
mind
me
the
Fat
Lady
called
irritably
after
them
don't
apologize
for
bothering
me
i'll
just
hang
here
wide
open
until
you
get
back
shall
I
yeah
thanks
ron
shouted
over
his
shoulder
hermione
where
are
we
going
harry
asked
after
she
had
led
them
down
through
six
floors
and
started
down
the
marble
staircase
into
the
entrance
hall
you'll
see
you'll
see
in
a
minute
said
Hermione
excitedly
she
turned
left
at
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
and
hurried
toward
the
door
through
which
Cedric
Diggory
had
gone
the
night
after
the
Goblet
of
Fire
had
regurgitated
his
and
harry's
names
harry
had
never
been
through
here
before
he
and
Ron
followed
Hermione
down
a
flight
of
stone
steps
but
instead
of
ending
up
in
a
gloomy
underground
passage
like
the
one
that
led
to
snape's
dungeon
they
found
themselves
in
a
broad
stone
corridor
brightly
lit
with
torches
and
decorated
with
cheerful
paintings
that
were
mainly
of
food
oh
hang
on
said
Harry
slowly
halfway
down
the
corridor
wait
a
minute
Hermione
what
she
turned
around
to
look
at
him
anticipation
all
over
her
face
i
know
what
this
is
about
said
Harry
he
nudged
Ron
and
pointed
to
the
painting
just
behind
Hermione
it
showed
a
gigantic
silver
fruit
bowl
hermione
said
Ron
cottoning
on
you're
trying
to
rope
us
into
that
spew
stuff
again
no
no
i'm
not
she
said
hastily
and
it's
not
spew
Ron
changed
the
name
have
you
said
Ron
frowning
at
her
what
are
we
now
then
the
HouseElf
Liberation
Front
i'm
not
barging
into
that
kitchen
and
trying
to
make
them
stop
work
i'm
not
doing
it
i'm
not
asking
you
to
hermione
said
impatiently
i
came
down
here
just
now
to
talk
to
them
all
and
I
found
oh
come
on
Harry
I
want
to
show
you
she
seized
his
arm
again
pulled
him
in
front
of
the
picture
of
the
giant
fruit
bowl
stretched
out
her
forefinger
and
tickled
the
huge
green
pear
it
began
to
squirm
chuckling
and
suddenly
turned
into
a
large
green
door
handle
hermione
seized
it
pulled
the
door
open
and
pushed
Harry
hard
in
the
back
forcing
him
inside
he
had
one
brief
glimpse
of
an
enormous
highceilinged
room
large
as
the
Great
Hall
above
it
with
mounds
of
glittering
brass
pots
and
pans
heaped
around
the
stone
walls
and
a
great
brick
fireplace
at
the
other
end
when
something
small
hurtled
toward
him
from
the
middle
of
the
room
squealing
Harry
Potter
sir
harry
Potter
next
second
all
the
wind
had
been
knocked
out
of
him
as
the
squealing
elf
hit
him
hard
in
the
midriff
hugging
him
so
tightly
he
thought
his
ribs
would
break
dDobby
harry
gasped
it
is
Dobby
sir
it
is
squealed
the
voice
from
somewhere
around
his
navel
dobby
has
been
hoping
and
hoping
to
see
Harry
Potter
sir
and
Harry
Potter
has
come
to
see
him
sir
dobby
let
go
and
stepped
back
a
few
paces
beaming
up
at
Harry
his
enormous
green
tennisballshaped
eyes
brimming
with
tears
of
happiness
he
looked
almost
exactly
as
Harry
remembered
him
the
pencilshaped
nose
the
batlike
ears
the
long
fingers
and
feet
all
except
the
clothes
which
were
very
different
when
Dobby
had
worked
for
the
Malfoys
he
had
always
worn
the
same
filthy
old
pillowcase
now
however
he
was
wearing
the
strangest
assortment
of
garments
Harry
had
ever
seen
he
had
done
an
even
worse
job
of
dressing
himself
than
the
wizards
at
the
World
Cup
he
was
wearing
a
tea
cozy
for
a
hat
on
which
he
had
pinned
a
number
of
bright
badges
a
tie
patterned
with
horseshoes
over
a
bare
chest
a
pair
of
what
looked
like
children's
soccer
shorts
and
odd
socks
one
of
these
Harry
saw
was
the
black
one
Harry
had
removed
from
his
own
foot
and
tricked
mr.
Malfoy
into
giving
Dobby
thereby
setting
Dobby
free
the
other
was
covered
in
pink
and
orange
stripes
dobby
what're
you
doing
here
harry
said
in
amazement
dobby
has
come
to
work
at
Hogwarts
sir
dobby
squealed
excitedly
professor
Dumbledore
gave
Dobby
and
Winky
jobs
sir
winky
said
Harry
she's
here
too
yes
sir
yes
said
Dobby
and
he
seized
harry's
hand
and
pulled
him
off
into
the
kitchen
between
the
four
long
wooden
tables
that
stood
there
each
of
these
tables
Harry
noticed
as
he
passed
them
was
positioned
exactly
beneath
the
four
House
tables
above
in
the
Great
Hall
at
the
moment
they
were
clear
of
food
dinner
having
finished
but
he
supposed
that
an
hour
ago
they
had
been
laden
with
dishes
that
were
then
sent
up
through
the
ceiling
to
their
counterparts
above
at
least
a
hundred
little
elves
were
standing
around
the
kitchen
beaming
bowing
and
curtsying
as
Dobby
led
Harry
past
them
they
were
all
wearing
the
same
uniform
a
tea
towel
stamped
with
the
Hogwarts
crest
and
tied
as
winky's
had
been
like
a
toga
dobby
stopped
in
front
of
the
brick
fireplace
and
pointed
winky
sir
he
said
winky
was
sitting
on
a
stool
by
the
fire
unlike
Dobby
she
had
obviously
not
foraged
for
clothes
she
was
wearing
a
neat
little
skirt
and
blouse
with
a
matching
blue
hat
which
had
holes
in
it
for
her
large
ears
however
while
every
one
of
dobby's
strange
collection
of
garments
was
so
clean
and
well
cared
for
that
it
looked
brandnew
Winky
was
plainly
not
taking
care
other
clothes
at
all
there
were
soup
stains
all
down
her
blouse
and
a
burn
in
her
skirt
hello
Winky
said
Harry
winky's
lip
quivered
then
she
burst
into
tears
which
spilled
out
of
her
great
brown
eyes
and
splashed
down
her
front
just
as
they
had
done
at
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
oh
dear
said
Hermione
she
and
Ron
had
followed
Harry
and
Dobby
to
the
end
of
the
kitchen
winky
don't
cry
please
don't
but
Winky
cried
harder
than
ever
dobby
on
the
other
hand
beamed
up
at
Harry
would
Harry
Potter
like
a
cup
of
tea
he
squeaked
loudly
over
winky's
sobs
er
yeah
okay
said
Harry
instantly
about
six
houseelves
came
trotting
up
behind
him
bearing
a
large
silver
tray
laden
with
a
teapot
cups
for
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
a
milk
jug
and
a
large
plate
of
biscuits
good
service
ron
said
in
an
impressed
voice
hermione
frowned
at
him
but
the
elves
all
looked
delighted
they
bowed
very
low
and
retreated
how
long
have
you
been
here
Dobby
harry
asked
as
Dobby
handed
around
the
tea
only
a
week
harry
Potter
sir
said
Dobby
happily
dobby
came
to
see
Professor
Dumbledore
sir
you
see
sir
it
is
very
difficult
for
a
houseelf
who
has
been
dismissed
to
get
a
new
position
sir
very
difficult
indeed
at
this
Winky
howled
even
harder
her
squashedtomato
of
a
nose
dribbling
all
down
her
front
though
she
made
no
effort
to
stem
the
flow
dobby
has
traveled
the
country
for
two
whole
years
sir
trying
to
find
work
dobby
squeaked
but
Dobby
hasn't
found
work
sir
because
Dobby
wants
paying
now
the
houseelves
all
around
the
kitchen
who
had
been
listening
and
watching
with
interest
all
looked
away
at
these
words
as
though
Dobby
had
said
something
rude
and
embarrassing
hermione
however
said
Good
for
you
Dobby
thank
you
miss
said
Dobby
grinning
toothily
at
her
but
most
wizards
doesn't
want
a
houseelf
who
wants
paying
miss
that's
not
the
point
of
a
house
elf
they
says
and
they
slammed
the
door
in
dobby's
face
dobby
likes
work
but
he
wants
to
wear
clothes
and
he
wants
to
be
paid
harry
Potter
dobby
likes
being
free
the
Hogwarts
houseelves
had
now
started
edging
away
from
Dobby
as
though
he
were
carrying
something
contagious
winky
however
remained
where
she
was
though
there
was
a
definite
increase
in
the
volume
other
crying
and
then
Harry
Potter
Dobby
goes
to
visit
Winky
and
finds
out
Winky
has
been
freed
too
sir
said
Dobby
delightedly
at
this
Winky
flung
herself
forward
off
her
stool
and
lay
facedown
on
the
flagged
stone
floor
beating
her
tiny
fists
upon
it
and
positively
screaming
with
misery
hermione
hastily
dropped
down
to
her
knees
beside
her
and
tried
to
comfort
her
but
nothing
she
said
made
the
slightest
difference
dobby
continued
with
his
story
shouting
shrilly
over
winky's
screeches
and
then
Dobby
had
the
idea
harry
Potter
sir
why
doesn't
Dobby
and
Winky
find
work
together
dobby
says
where
is
there
enough
work
for
two
house
elves
says
Winky
and
Dobby
thinks
and
it
comes
to
him
sir
hogwarts
so
Dobby
and
Winky
came
to
see
Professor
Dumbledore
sir
and
Professor
Dumbledore
took
us
on
dobby
beamed
very
brightly
and
happy
tears
welled
in
his
eyes
again
and
Professor
Dumbledore
says
he
will
pay
Dobby
sir
if
Dobby
wants
paying
and
so
Dobby
is
a
free
elf
sir
and
Dobby
gets
a
Galleon
a
week
and
one
day
off
a
month
that's
not
very
much
hermione
shouted
indignantly
from
the
floor
over
winky's
continued
screaming
and
fistbeating
professor
Dumbledore
offered
Dobby
ten
Galleons
a
week
and
weekends
off
said
Dobby
suddenly
giving
a
little
shiver
as
though
the
prospect
of
so
much
leisure
and
riches
were
frightening
but
Dobby
beat
him
down
miss
dobby
likes
freedom
miss
but
he
isn't
wanting
too
much
miss
he
likes
work
better
and
how
much
is
Professor
Dumbledore
paying
you
Winky
hermione
asked
kindly
if
she
had
thought
this
would
cheer
up
Winky
she
was
wildly
mistaken
winky
did
stop
crying
but
when
she
sat
up
she
was
glaring
at
Hermione
through
her
massive
brown
eyes
her
whole
face
sopping
wet
and
suddenly
furious
winky
is
a
disgraced
elf
but
Winky
is
not
yet
getting
paid
she
squeaked
winky
is
not
sunk
so
low
as
that
winky
is
properly
ashamed
of
being
freed
ashamed
said
Hermione
blankly
but
Winky
come
on
it's
mr.
Crouch
who
should
be
ashamed
not
you
you
didn't
do
anything
wrong
he
was
really
horrible
to
you
but
at
these
words
Winky
clapped
her
hands
over
the
holes
in
her
hat
flattening
her
ears
so
that
she
couldn't
hear
a
word
and
screeched
You
is
not
insulting
my
master
miss
you
is
not
insulting
mr.
Crouch
mr.
Crouch
is
a
good
wizard
miss
mr.
Crouch
is
right
to
sack
bad
Winky
winky
is
having
trouble
adjusting
Harry
Potter
squeaked
Dobby
confidentially
winky
forgets
she
is
not
bound
to
mr.
Crouch
anymore
she
is
allowed
to
speak
her
mind
now
but
she
won't
do
it
can't
houseelves
speak
their
minds
about
their
masters
then
harry
asked
oh
no
sir
no
said
Dobby
looking
suddenly
serious
tis
part
of
the
houseelf's
enslavement
sir
we
keeps
their
secrets
and
our
silence
sir
we
upholds
the
family's
honor
and
we
never
speaks
ill
of
them
though
Professor
Dumbledore
told
Dobby
he
does
not
insist
upon
this
professor
Dumbledore
said
we
is
free
to
to
dobby
looked
suddenly
nervous
and
beckoned
Harry
closer
harry
bent
forward
dobby
whispered
He
said
we
is
free
to
call
him
a
a
barmy
old
codger
if
we
likes
sir
dobby
gave
a
frightened
sort
of
giggle
but
Dobby
is
not
wanting
to
Harry
Potter
he
said
talking
normally
again
and
shaking
his
head
so
that
his
ears
flapped
dobby
likes
Professor
Dumbledore
very
much
sir
and
is
proud
to
keep
his
secrets
and
our
silence
for
him
but
you
can
say
what
you
like
about
the
Malfoys
now
harry
asked
him
grinning
a
slightly
fearful
look
came
into
dobby's
immense
eyes
dobby
Dobby
could
he
said
doubtfully
he
squared
his
small
shoulders
dobby
could
tell
Harry
Potter
that
his
old
masters
were
were
bad
Dark
wizards
dobby
stood
for
a
moment
quivering
all
over
horrorstruck
by
his
own
daring
then
he
rushed
over
to
the
nearest
table
and
began
banging
his
head
on
it
very
hard
squealing
Bad
Dobby
bad
Dobby
harry
seized
Dobby
by
the
back
of
his
tie
and
pulled
him
away
from
the
table
thank
you
harry
Potter
thank
you
said
Dobby
breathlessly
rubbing
his
head
you
just
need
a
bit
of
practice
Harry
said
practice
squealed
Winky
furiously
you
is
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
Dobby
talking
that
way
about
your
masters
they
isn't
my
masters
anymore
Winky
said
Dobby
defiantly
dobby
doesn't
care
what
they
think
anymore
oh

is
a
bad
elf
Dobby
moaned
Winky
tears
leaking
down
her
face
once
more
my
poor
mr.
Crouch
what

he
doing
without
Winky
he
is
needing

shame
she
buried
her
face
in
her
skirt
again
and
bawled
winky
said
Hermione
firmly

sure

Crouch
is
getting
along
perfectly
well
without
you
we've
seen
him

master
said
Winky
breathlessly
raising
her
tearstained
face
out
of
her
skirt
once
more
and
goggling
at
Hermione

is
seeing
him

at
Hogwarts

said
Hermione

mr.
Bagman

Triwizard
Tournament

squeaked
Winky
and
to
Harry
s
great
surprise
and
ron's
and
hermione's
too
by
the
looks
on
their
faces
she
looked
angry
again
mr.
Bagman

a
bad
wizard

very
bad
wizard
my
master
isn't
liking
him
oh

said
Harry

Winky
said
nodding
her
head
furiously
My
master

Winky
some
things
but
Winky
is
not
saying
winky
Winky
keeps
her
master's
secrets
she
dissolved
yet
again
in
tears
they
could
hear
her
sobbing
into
her
skirt
Poor

poor
master
no
Winky
to
help
him
no
more
they
couldn't
get
another
sensible
word
out
of
Winky
they
left
her
to
her
crying
and
finished
their
tea
while
Dobby
chatted
happily
about
his
life
as
a
free
elf
and
his
plans
for
his
wages
dobby
is
going
to
buy
a
sweater
next
Harry
Potter
he
said
happily
pointing
at
his
bare
chest
Tell
you
what
Dobby
said
Ron
who
seemed
to
have
taken
a
great
liking
to
the
elf
i'll
give
you
the
one
my
mum
knits
me
this
Christmas
I
always
get
one
from
her
you
don't
mind
maroon
do
you
dobby
was
delighted
we
might
have
to
shrink
it
a
bit
to
fit
you
Ron
told
him
but
it'll
go
well
with
your
tea
cozy
as
they
prepared
to
take
their
leave
many
of
the
surrounding
elves
pressed
in
upon
them
offering
snacks
to
take
back
upstairs
hermione
refused
with
a
pained
look
at
the
way
the
elves
kept
bowing
and
curtsying
but
Harry
and
Ron
loaded
their
pockets
with
cream
cakes
and
pies
thanks
a
lot
harry
said
to
the
elves
who
had
all
clustered
around
the
door
to
say
good
night
see
you
Dobby
harry
Potter
can
Dobby
come
and
see
you
sometimes
sir
dobby
asked
tentatively
course
you
can
said
Harry
and
Dobby
beamed
you
know
what
said
Ron
once
he
Hermione
and
Harry
had
left
the
kitchens
behind
and
were
climbing
the
steps
into
the
entrance
hall
again
all
these
years
i've
been
really
impressed
with
Fred
and
George
nicking
food
from
the
kitchens
well
it's
not
exactly
difficult
is
it
they
can't
wait
to
give
it
away
i
think
this
is
the
best
thing
that
could
have
happened
to
those
elves
you
know
said
Hermione
leading
the
way
back
up
the
marble
staircase
dobby
coming
to
work
here
I
mean
the
other
elves
will
see
how
happy
he
is
being
free
and
slowly
it'll
dawn
on
them
that
they
want
that
too
let's
hope
they
don't
look
too
closely
at
Winky
said
Harry
oh
she'll
cheer
up
said
Hermione
though
she
sounded
a
bit
doubtful
once
the
shock's
worn
off
and
she's
got
used
to
Hogwarts
she'll
see
how
much
better
off
she
is
without
that
Crouch
man
she
seems
to
love
him
said
Ron
thickly
he
had
just
started
on
a
cream
cake
doesn't
think
much
of
Bagman
though
does
she
said
Harry
wonder
what
Crouch
says
at
home
about
him
probably
says
he's
not
a
very
good
Head
of
Department
said
Hermione
and
let's
face
it
he's
got
a
point
hasn't
he
i'd
still
rather
work
for
him
than
old
Crouch
said
Ron
at
least
bagman's
got
a
sense
of
humor
don't
let
Percy
hear
you
saying
that
Hermione
said
smiling
slightly
yeah
well
Percy
wouldn't
want
to
work
for
anyone
with
a
sense
of
humor
would
he
said
Ron
now
starting
on
a
chocolate
eclair
percy
wouldn't
recognize
a
joke
if
it
danced
naked
in
front
of
him
wearing
dobby's
tea
cozy
chapter
twentytwo
the
unexpected
task
potter
weasley
will
you
pay
attention
professor
mcgonagall's
irritated
voice
cracked
like
a
whip
through
the
Transfiguration
class
on
Thursday
and
Harry
and
Ron
both
jumped
and
looked
up
it
was
the
end
of
the
lesson
they
had
finished
their
work
the
guinea
fowl
they
had
been
changing
into
guinea
pigs
had
been
shut
away
in
a
large
cage
on
Professor
mcgonagall's
desk
neville's
still
had
feathers
they
had
copied
down
their
homework
from
the
blackboard
Describe
with
examples
the
ways
in
which
Transforming
Spells
must
be
adapted
when
performing
CrossSpecies
Switches
the
bell
was
due
to
ring
at
any
moment
and
Harry
and
Ron
who
had
been
having
a
sword
fight
with
a
couple
of
Fred
and
george's
fake
wands
at
the
back
of
the
class
looked
up
Ron
holding
a
tin
parrot
and
Harry
a
rubber
haddock
now
that
Potter
and
Weasley
have
been
kind
enough
to
act
their
age
said
Professor
McGonagall
with
an
angry
look
at
the
pair
of
them
as
the
head
of
harry's
haddock
drooped
and
fell
silently
to
the
floor
ron's
parrot's
beak
had
severed
it
moments
before
I
have
something
to
say
to
you
all
the
Yule
Ball
is
approaching
a
traditional
part
of
the
Triwizard
Tournament
and
an
opportunity
for
us
to
socialize
with
our
foreign
guests
now
the
ball
will
be
open
only
to
fourth
years
and
above
although
you
may
invite
a
younger
student
if
you
wish
lavender
Brown
let
out
a
shrill
giggle
parvati
Patil
nudged
her
hard
in
the
ribs
her
face
working
furiously
as
she
too
fought
not
to
giggle
they
both
looked
around
at
Harry
Professor
McGonagall
ignored
them
which
Harry
thought
was
distinctly
unfair
as
she
had
just
told
off
him
and
Ron
dress
robes
will
be
worn
Professor
McGonagall
continued
and
the
ball
will
start
at
eight
o'clock
on
Christmas
Day
finishing
at
midnight
in
the
Great
Hall
now
then
professor
McGonagall
stared
deliberately
around
the
class
the
Yule
Ball
is
of
course
a
chance
for
us
all
to
er
let
our
hair
down
she
said
in
a
disapproving
voice
lavender
giggled
harder
than
ever
with
her
hand
pressed
hard
against
her
mouth
to
stifle
the
sound
harry
could
see
what
was
funny
this
time
Professor
McGonagall
with
her
hair
in
a
tight
bun
looked
as
though
she
had
never
let
her
hair
down
in
any
sense
but
that
does
not
mean
Professor
McGonagall
went
on
that
we
will
be
relaxing
the
standards
of
behavior
we
expect
from
Hogwarts
students
i
will
be
most
seriously
displeased
if
a
Gryffindor
student
embarrasses
the
school
in
any
way
the
bell
rang
and
there
was
the
usual
scuffle
of
activity
as
everyone
packed
their
bags
and
swung
them
onto
their
shoulders
professor
McGonagall
called
above
the
noise
Potter
a
word
if
you
please
assuming
this
had
something
to
do
with
his
headless
rubber
haddock
Harry
proceeded
gloomily
to
the
teacher's
desk
professor
McGonagall
waited
until
the
rest
of
the
class
had
gone
and
then
said
Potter
the
champions
and
their
partners
what
partners
said
Harry
profesor
McGonagall
looked
suspiciously
at
him
as
though
she
thought
he
was
trying
to
be
funny
your
partners
for
the
Yule
Ball
Potter
she
said
coldly
your
dance
partners
harry's
insides
seemed
to
curl
up
and
shrivel
dance
partners
he
felt
himself
going
red
i
don't
dance
he
said
quickly
oh
yes
you
do
said
Professor
McGonagall
irritably
that's
what
i'm
telling
you
traditionally
the
champions
and
their
partners
open
the
ball
harry
had
a
sudden
mental
image
of
himself
in
a
top
hat
and
tails
accompanied
by
a
girl
in
the
sort
of
frilly
dress
Aunt
Petunia
always
wore
to
Uncle
vernon's
work
parties
i'm
not
dancing
he
said
it
is
traditional
said
Professor
McGonagall
firmly
you
are
a
Hogwarts
champion
and
you
will
do
what
is
expected
of
you
as
a
representative
of
the
school
so
make
sure
you
get
yourself
a
partner
Potter
buti
don't
you
heard
me
Potter
said
Professor
McGonagall
in
a
very
final
sort
of
way
a
week
ago
harry
would
have
said
finding
a
partner
for
a
dance
would
be
a
cinch
compared
to
taking
on
a
Hungarian
Horntail
but
now
that
he
had
done
the
latter
and
was
facing
the
prospect
of
asking
a
girl
to
the
ball
he
thought
he'd
rather
have
another
round
with
the
dragon
harry
had
never
known
so
many
people
to
put
their
names
down
to
stay
at
Hogwarts
for
Christmas
he
always
did
of
course
because
the
alternative
was
usually
going
back
to
Privet
Drive
but
he
had
always
been
very
much
in
the
minority
before
now
this
year
however
everyone
in
the
fourth
year
and
above
seemed
to
be
staying
and
they
all
seemed
to
Harry
to
be
obsessed
with
the
coming
ball
or
at
least
all
the
girls
were
and
it
was
amazing
how
many
girls
Hogwarts
suddenly
seemed
to
hold
he
had
never
quite
noticed
that
before
girls
giggling
and
whispering
in
the
corridors
girls
shrieking
with
laughter
as
boys
passed
them
girls
excitedly
comparing
notes
on
what
they
were
going
to
wear
on
Christmas
night
why
do
they
have
to
move
in
packs
harry
asked
Ron
as
a
dozen
or
so
girls
walked
past
them
sniggering
and
staring
at
Harry
how're
you
supposed
to
get
one
on
their
own
to
ask
them
lasso
one
ron
suggested
got
any
idea
who
you're
going
to
try
harry
didn't
answer
he
knew
perfectly
well
whom
he'd
like
to
ask
but
working
up
the
nerve
was
something
else
cho
was
a
year
older
than
he
was
she
was
very
pretty
she
was
a
very
good
Quidditch
player
and
she
was
also
very
popular
ron
seemed
to
know
what
was
going
on
inside
harry's
head
listen
you're
not
going
to
have
any
trouble
you're
a
champion
you've
just
beaten
a
Hungarian
Horntail
i
bet
they'll
be
queuing
up
to
go
with
you
in
tribute
to
their
recently
repaired
friendship
Ron
had
kept
the
bitterness
in
his
voice
to
a
bare
minimum
moreover
to
harry's
amazement
he
turned
out
to
be
quite
right
a
curlyhaired
thirdyear
Hufflepuff
girl
to
whom
Harry
had
never
spoken
in
his
life
asked
him
to
go
to
the
ball
with
her
the
very
next
day
harry
was
so
taken
aback
he
said
no
before
he'd
even
stopped
to
consider
the
matter
the
girl
walked
off
looking
rather
hurt
and
Harry
had
to
endure
dean's
seamus's
and
ron's
taunts
about
her
all
through
History
of
Magic
the
following
day
two
more
girls
asked
him
a
second
year
and
to
his
horror
a
fifth
year
who
looked
as
though
she
might
knock
him
out
if
he
refused
she
was
quite
goodlooking
said
Ron
fairly
after
he'd
stopped
laughing
she
was
a
foot
taller
than
me
said
Harry
still
unnerved
imagine
what
i'd
look
like
trying
to
dance
with
her
hermione's
words
about
Krum
kept
coming
back
to
him
they
only
like
him
because
he's
famous
harry
doubted
very
much
if
any
of
the
girls
who
had
asked
to
be
his
partner
so
far
would
have
wanted
to
go
to
the
ball
with
him
if
he
hadn't
been
a
school
champion
then
he
wondered
if
this
would
bother
him
if
Cho
asked
him
on
the
whole
harry
had
to
admit
that
even
with
the
embarrassing
prospect
of
opening
the
ball
before
him
life
had
definitely
improved
since
he
had
got
through
the
first
task
he
wasn't
attracting
nearly
as
much
unpleasantness
in
the
corridors
anymore
which
he
suspected
had
a
lot
to
do
with
Cedric
he
had
an
idea
Cedric
might
have
told
the
Hufflepuffs
to
leave
Harry
alone
in
gratitude
for
harry's
tip
off
about
the
dragons
there
seemed
to
be
fewer
Support
Cedric
Diggory
badges
around
too
draco
Malfoy
of
course
was
still
quoting
Rita
skeeter's
article
to
him
at
every
possible
opportunity
but
he
was
getting
fewer
and
fewer
laughs
out
of
it
and
just
to
heighten
harry's
feeling
of
wellbeing
no
story
about
Hagrid
had
appeared
in
the
Daily
Prophet
she
didn
seem
very
int'rested
in
magical
creatures
ter
tell
yeh
the
truth
Hagrid
said
when
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
asked
him
how
his
interview
with
Rita
Skeeter
had
gone
during
the
last
Care
of
Magical
Creatures
lesson
of
the
term
to
their
very
great
relief
Hagrid
had
given
up
on
direct
contact
with
the
skrewts
now
and
they
were
merely
sheltering
behind
his
cabin
today
sitting
at
a
trestle
table
and
preparing
a
fresh
selection
of
food
with
which
to
tempt
the
skrewts
she
jus
wanted
me
ter
talk
about
you
Harry
Hagrid
continued
in
a
low
voice
well
I
told
her
we'd
been
friends
since
I
went
ter
fetch
yeh
from
the
Dursleys
never
had
to
tell
him
off
in
four
years
she
said
never
played
you
up
in
lessons
has
he
i
told
her
no
an
she
didn
seem
happy
at
all
yeh'd
think
she
wanted
me
to
say
yeh
were
horrible
Harry
course
she
did
said
Harry
throwing
lumps
of
dragon
liver
into
a
large
metal
bowl
and
picking
up
his
knife
to
cut
some
more
she
can't
keep
writing
about
what
a
tragic
little
hero
I
am
it'll
get
boring
she
wants
a
new
angle
Hagrid
said
Ron
wisely
as
he
shelled
salamander
eggs
you
were
supposed
to
say
harry's
a
mad
delinquent
but
he's
not
said
Hagrid
looking
genuinely
shocked
she
should've
interviewed
Snape
said
Harry
grimly
he'd
give
her
the
goods
on
me
any
day
potter
has
been
crossing
lines
ever
since
he
first
arrived
at
this
school
said
that
did
he
said
Hagrid
while
Ron
and
Hermione
laughed
well
yeh
might've
bent
a
few
rules
harry
bu
yeh're
all
righ
really
aren
you
cheers
Hagrid
said
Harry
grinning
you
coming
to
this
ball
thing
on
Christmas
Day
Hagrid
said
Ron
though
I
might
look
in
on
it
yeah
said
Hagrid
gruffly
should
be
a
good
do
I
reckon
you'll
be
openin
the
dancin
won
yeh
Harry
who're
you
takin
no
one
yet
said
Harry
feeling
himself
going
red
again
hagrid
didn't
pursue
the
subject
the
last
week
of
term
became
increasingly
boisterous
as
it
progressed
rumors
about
the
Yule
Ball
were
flying
everywhere
though
Harry
didn't
believe
half
of
them
for
instance
that
Dumbledore
had
bought
eight
hundred
barrels
of
mulled
mead
from
Madam
Rosmerta
it
seemed
to
be
fact
however
that
he
had
booked
the
Weird
Sisters
exactly
who
or
what
the
Weird
Sisters
were
Harry
didn't
know
never
having
had
access
to
a
wizard's
wireless
but
he
deduced
from
the
wild
excitement
of
those
who
had
grown
up
listening
to
the
wwn
Wizarding
Wireless
Network
that
they
were
a
very
famous
musical
group
some
of
the
teachers
like
little
Professor
Flitwick
gave
up
trying
to
teach
them
much
when
their
minds
were
so
clearly
elsewhere
he
allowed
them
to
play
games
in
his
lesson
on
Wednesday
and
spent
most
of
it
talking
to
Harry
about
the
perfect
Summoning
Charm
Harry
had
used
during
the
first
task
of
the
Triwizard
Tournament
other
teachers
were
not
so
generous
nothing
would
ever
deflect
Professor
Binns
for
example
from
plowing
on
through
his
notes
on
goblin
rebellions
as
Binns
hadn't
let
his
own
death
stand
in
the
way
of
continuing
to
teach
they
supposed
a
small
thing
like
Christmas
wasn't
going
to
put
him
off
it
was
amazing
how
he
could
make
even
bloody
and
vicious
goblin
riots
sound
as
boring
as
Percys
cauldronbottom
report
professors
McGonagall
and
Moody
kept
them
working
until
the
very
last
second
of
their
classes
too
and
Snape
of
course
would
no
sooner
let
them
play
games
in
class
than
adopt
Harry
staring
nastily
around
at
them
all
he
informed
them
that
he
would
be
testing
them
on
poison
antidotes
during
the
last
lesson
of
the
term
evil
he
is
Ron
said
bitterly
that
night
in
the
Gryffindor
common
room
springing
a
test
on
us
on
the
last
day
ruining
the
last
bit
of
term
with
a
whole
load
of
studying
mmm
you're
not
exactly
straining
yourself
though
are
you
said
Hermione
looking
at
him
over
the
top
of
her
Potions
notes
ron
was
busy
building
a
card
castle
out
of
his
Exploding
Snap
pack
a
much
more
interesting
pastime
than
with
Muggle
cards
because
of
the
chance
that
the
whole
thing
would
blow
up
at
any
second
it's
Christmas
Hermione
said
Harry
lazily
he
was
rereading
Flying
with
the
Cannons
for
the
tenth
time
in
an
armchair
near
the
fire
hermione
looked
severely
over
at
him
too
i'd
have
thought
you'd
be
doing
something
constructive
Harry
even
if
you
don't
want
to
learn
your
antidotes
like
what
harry
said
as
he
watched
Joey
Jenkins
of
the
Cannons
belt
a
Bludger
toward
a
Ballycastle
Bats
Chaser
that
egg
hermione
hissed
come
on
Hermione
i've
got
till
February
the
twentyfourth
Harry
said
he
had
put
the
golden
egg
upstairs
in
his
trunk
and
hadn't
opened
it
since
the
celebration
party
after
the
first
task
there
were
still
two
and
a
half
months
to
go
until
he
needed
to
know
what
all
the
screechy
wailing
meant
after
all
but
it
might
take
weeks
to
work
it
out
said
Hermione
you're
going
to
look
a
real
idiot
if
everyone
else
knows
what
the
next
task
is
and
you
don't
leave
him
alone
Hermione
he's
earned
a
bit
of
a
break
said
Ron
and
he
placed
the
last
two
cards
on
top
of
the
castle
and
the
whole
lot
blew
up
singeing
his
eyebrows
nice
look
Ron
go
well
with
your
dress
robes
that
will
it
was
Fred
and
George
they
sat
down
at
the
table
with
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
as
Ron
felt
how
much
damage
had
been
done
ron
can
we
borrow
Pigwidgeon
george
asked
no
he's
off
delivering
a
letter
said
Ron
why
because
George
wants
to
invite
him
to
the
ball
said
Fred
sarcastically
because
we
want
to
send
a
letter
you
stupid
great
prat
said
George
who
d'you
two
keep
writing
to
eh
said
Ron
nose
out
Ron
or
i'll
burn
that
for
you
too
said
Fred
waving
his
wand
threateningly
so
you
lot
got
dates
for
the
ball
yet
nope
said
Ron
well
you'd
better
hurry
up
mate
or
all
the
good
ones
will
be
gone
said
Fred
who're
you
going
with
then
said
Ron
angelina
said
Fred
promptly
without
a
trace
of
embarrassment
what
said
Ron
taken
aback
you've
already
asked
her
good
point
said
Fred
he
turned
his
head
and
called
across
the
common
room
Oi
angelina
angelina
who
had
been
chatting
with
Alicia
Spinnet
near
the
fire
looked
over
at
him
what
she
called
back
want
to
come
to
the
ball
with
me
angelina
gave
Fred
an
appraising
sort
of
look
all
right
then
she
said
and
she
turned
back
to
Alicia
and
carried
on
chatting
with
a
bit
of
a
grin
on
her
face
there
you
go
said
Fred
to
Harry
and
Ron
piece
of
cake
he
got
to
his
feet
yawning
and
said
we'd
better
use
a
school
owl
then
George
come
on
they
left
ron
stopped
feeling
his
eyebrows
and
looked
across
the
smoldering
wreck
of
his
card
castle
at
Harry
we
should
get
a
move
on
you
know
ask
someone
he's
right
we
don't
want
to
end
up
with
a
pair
of
trolls
hermione
let
out
a
sputter
of
indignation
a
pair
of
what
excuse
me
well
you
know
said
Ron
shrugging
i'd
rather
go
alone
than
with
with
Eloise
Midgen
say
her
acne's
loads
better
lately
and
she's
really
nice
her
nose
is
offcenter
said
Ron
oh
I
see
Hermione
said
bristling
so
basically
you're
going
to
take
the
best
looking
girl
who'll
have
you
even
if
she's
completely
horrible
er
yeah
that
sounds
about
right
said
Ron
i'm
going
to
bed
Hermione
snapped
and
she
swept
off
toward
the
girls
staircase
without
another
word
the
Hogwarts
staff
demonstrating
a
continued
desire
to
impress
the
visitors
from
Beauxbatons
and
Durmstrang
seemed
determined
to
show
the
castle
at
its
best
this
Christmas
when
the
decorations
went
up
harry
noticed
that
they
were
the
most
stunning
he
had
yet
seen
inside
the
school
everlasting
icicles
had
been
attached
to
the
banisters
of
the
marble
staircase
the
usual
twelve
Christmas
trees
in
the
Great
Hall
were
bedecked
with
everything
from
luminous
holly
berries
to
real
hooting
golden
owls
and
the
suits
of
armor
had
all
been
bewitched
to
sing
carols
whenever
anyone
passed
them
it
was
quite
something
to
hear
Come
All
Ye
Faithful
sung
by
an
empty
helmet
that
only
knew
half
the
words
several
times
Filch
the
caretaker
had
to
extract
Peeves
from
inside
the
armor
where
he
had
taken
to
hiding
filling
in
the
gaps
in
the
songs
with
lyrics
of
his
own
invention
all
of
which
were
very
rude
and
still
harry
hadn't
asked
Cho
to
the
ball
he
and
Ron
were
getting
very
nervous
now
though
as
Harry
pointed
out
Ron
would
look
much
less
stupid
than
he
would
without
a
partner
Harry
was
supposed
to
be
starting
the
dancing
with
the
other
champions
i
suppose
there's
always
Moaning
Myrtle
he
said
gloomily
referring
to
the
ghost
who
haunted
the
girls
toilets
on
the
second
floor
harry
we've
just
got
to
grit
our
teeth
and
do
it
said
Ron
on
Friday
morning
in
a
tone
that
suggested
they
were
planning
the
storming
of
an
impregnable
fortress
when
we
get
back
to
the
common
room
tonight
we'll
both
have
partners
agreed
er
okay
said
Harry
but
every
time
he
glimpsed
Cho
that
day
during
break
and
then
lunchtime
and
once
on
the
way
to
History
of
Magic
she
was
surrounded
by
friends
didn't
she
ever
go
anywhere
alone
could
he
perhaps
ambush
her
as
she
was
going
into
a
bathroom
but
no
she
even
seemed
to
go
there
with
an
escort
of
four
or
five
girls
yet
if
he
didn't
do
it
soon
she
was
bound
to
have
been
asked
by
somebody
else
he
found
it
hard
to
concentrate
on
snape's
Potions
test
and
consequently
forgot
to
add
the
key
ingredient
a
bezoar
meaning
that
he
received
bottom
marks
he
didn't
care
though
he
was
too
busy
screwing
up
his
courage
for
what
he
was
about
to
do
when
the
bell
rang
he
grabbed
his
bag
and
hurried
to
the
dungeon
door
i'll
meet
you
at
dinner
he
said
to
Ron
and
Hermione
and
he
dashed
off
upstairs
he'd
just
have
to
ask
Cho
for
a
private
word
that
was
all
he
hurried
off
through
the
packed
corridors
looking
for
her
and
rather
sooner
than
he
had
expected
he
found
her
emerging
from
a
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
lesson
er
Cho
could
I
have
a
word
with
you
giggling
should
be
made
illegal
harry
thought
furiously
as
all
the
girls
around
Cho
started
doing
it
she
didn't
though
she
said
Okay
and
followed
him
out
of
earshot
other
classmates
harry
turned
to
look
at
her
and
his
stomach
gave
a
weird
lurch
as
though
he
had
missed
a
step
going
downstairs
er
he
said
he
couldn't
ask
her
he
couldn't
but
he
had
to
cho
stood
there
looking
puzzled
watching
him
the
words
came
out
before
Harry
had
quite
got
his
tongue
around
them
wangoballwime
sorry
said
Cho
d'you
d'you
want
to
go
to
the
ball
with
me
said
Harry
why
did
he
have
to
go
red
now
why
oh
s
aid
Cho
and
she
went
red
too
oh
Harry
i'm
really
sorry
and
she
truly
looked
it
i've
already
said
i'll
go
with
someone
else
oh
said
Harry
it
was
odd
a
moment
before
his
insides
had
been
writhing
like
snakes
but
suddenly
he
didn't
seem
to
have
any
insides
at
all
oh
okay
he
said
no
problem
i'm
really
sorry
she
said
again
that's
okay
said
Harry
they
stood
there
looking
at
each
other
and
then
Cho
said
Well
yeah
said
Harry
well
bye
said
Cho
still
very
red
she
walked
away
harry
called
after
her
before
he
could
stop
himself
who're
you
going
with
oh
Cedric
she
said
cedric
Diggory
oh
right
said
Harry
his
insides
had
come
back
again
it
felt
as
though
they
had
been
filled
with
lead
in
their
absence
completely
forgetting
about
dinner
he
walked
slowly
back
up
to
Gryffindor
Tower
cho's
voice
echoing
in
his
ears
with
every
step
he
took
cedric
Cedric
Diggory
he
had
been
starting
to
quite
like
Cedric
prepared
to
overlook
the
fact
that
he
had
once
beaten
him
at
Quidditch
and
was
handsome
and
popular
and
nearly
everyone's
favorite
champion
now
he
suddenly
realized
that
Cedric
was
in
fact
a
useless
pretty
boy
who
didn't
have
enough
brains
to
fill
an
eggcup
fairy
lights
he
said
dully
to
the
Fat
Lady
the
password
had
been
changed
the
previous
day
yes
indeed
dear
she
trilled
straightening
her
new
tinsel
hair
band
as
she
swung
forward
to
admit
him
entering
the
common
room
Harry
looked
around
and
to
his
surprise
he
saw
Ron
sitting
ashenfaced
in
a
distant
corner
ginny
was
sitting
with
him
talking
to
him
in
what
seemed
to
be
a
low
soothing
voice
what's
up
Ron
said
Harry
joining
them
ron
looked
up
at
Harry
a
sort
of
blind
horror
in
his
face
why
did
I
do
it
he
said
wildly
i
don't
know
what
made
me
do
it
what
said
Harry
he
er
just
asked
Fleur
Delacour
to
go
to
the
ball
with
him
said
Ginny
she
looked
as
though
she
was
fighting
back
a
smile
but
she
kept
patting
ron's
arm
sympathetically
you
what
said
Harry
i
don't
know
what
made
me
do
it
ron
gasped
again
what
was
I
playing
at
there
were
people
all
around
i've
gone
mad
everyone
watching
i
was
just
walking
past
her
in
the
entrance
hall
she
was
standing
there
talking
to
Diggory
and
it
sort
of
came
over
me
and
I
asked
her
ron
moaned
and
put
his
face
in
his
hands
he
kept
talking
though
the
words
were
barely
distinguishable
she
looked
at
me
like
I
was
a
sea
slug
or
something
didn't
even
answer
and
then
I
dunno
I
just
sort
of
came
to
my
senses
and
ran
for
it
she's
part
veela
said
Harry
you
were
right
her
grandmother
was
one
it
wasn't
your
fault
I
bet
you
just
walked
past
when
she
was
turning
on
the
old
charm
for
Diggory
and
got
a
blast
of
it
but
she
was
wasting
her
time
he's
going
with
Cho
Chang
ron
looked
up
i
asked
her
to
go
with
me
just
now
Harry
said
dully
and
she
told
me
ginny
had
suddenly
stopped
smiling
this
is
mad
said
Ron
we're
the
only
ones
left
who
haven't
got
anyone
well
except
Neville
hey
guess
who
he
asked
hermione
what
said
Harry
completely
distracted
by
this
startling
news
yeah
I
know
said
Ron
some
of
the
color
coming
back
into
his
face
as
he
started
to
laugh
he
told
me
after
Potions
said
she's
always
been
really
nice
helping
him
out
with
work
and
stuff
but
she
told
him
she
was
already
going
with
someone
ha
as
if
she
just
didn't
want
to
go
with
Neville
i
mean
who
would
don't
said
Ginny
annoyed
don't
laugh
just
then
Hermione
climbed
in
through
the
portrait
hole
why
weren't
you
two
at
dinner
she
said
coming
over
to
join
them
because
oh
shut
up
laughing
you
two
because
they've
both
just
been
turned
down
by
girls
they
asked
to
the
ball
said
Ginny
that
shut
Harry
and
Ron
up
thanks
a
bunch
Ginny
said
Ron
sourly
all
the
goodlooking
ones
taken
Ron
said
Hermione
loftily
eloise
Midgen
starting
to
look
quite
pretty
now
is
she
well
i'm
sure
you'll
find
someone
somewhere
who'll
have
you
but
Ron
was
staring
at
Hermione
as
though
suddenly
seeing
her
in
a
whole
new
light
hermione
neville's
right
you
are
a
girl
oh
well
spotted
she
said
acidly
well
you
can
come
with
one
of
us
no
I
can't
snapped
Hermione
oh
come
on
he
said
impatiently
we
need
partners
we're
going
to
look
really
stupid
if
we
haven't
got
any
everyone
else
has
i
can't
come
with
you
said
Hermione
now
blushing
because
i'm
already
going
with
someone
no
you're
not
said
Ron
you
just
said
that
to
get
rid
of
Neville
oh
did
I
said
Hermione
and
her
eyes
flashed
dangerously
just
because
it's
taken
you
three
years
to
notice
Ron
doesn't
mean
no
one
else
has
spotted
i'm
a
girl
ron
stared
at
her
then
he
grinned
again
okay
okay
we
know
you're
a
girl
he
said
that
do
will
you
come
now
i've
already
told
you
hermione
said
very
angrily
i'm
going
with
someone
else
and
she
stormed
off
toward
the
girls
dormitories
again
she's
lying
said
Ron
flatly
watching
her
go
she's
not
said
Ginny
quietly
who
is
it
then
said
Ron
sharply
i'm
not
telling
you
it's
her
business
said
Ginny
right
said
Ron
who
looked
extremely
put
out
this
is
getting
stupid
ginny
you
can
go
with
Harry
and
i'll
just
i
can't
said
Ginny
and
she
went
scarlet
too
i'm
going
with
with
Neville
he
asked
me
when
Hermione
said
no
and
I
thought
well
i'm
not
going
to
be
able
to
go
otherwise
i'm
not
in
fourth
year
she
looked
extremely
miserable
i
think
i'll
go
and
have
dinner
she
said
and
she
got
up
and
walked
off
to
the
portrait
hole
her
head
bowed
ron
goggled
at
Harry
what's
got
into
them
he
demanded
but
Harry
had
just
seen
Parvati
and
Lavender
come
in
through
the
portrait
hole
the
time
had
come
for
drastic
action
wait
here
he
said
to
Ron
and
he
stood
up
walked
straight
up
to
Parvati
and
said
Parvati
will
you
go
to
the
ball
with
me
parvati
went
into
a
fit
of
giggles
harry
waited
for
them
to
subside
his
fingers
crossed
in
the
pocket
of
his
robes
yes
all
right
then
she
said
finally
blushing
furiously
thanks
said
Harry
in
relief
lavender
will
you
go
with
Ron
she's
going
with
Seamus
said
Parvati
and
the
pair
of
them
giggled
harder
than
ever
harry
sighed
can't
you
think
of
anyone
who'd
go
with
Ron
he
said
lowering
his
voice
so
that
Ron
wouldn't
hear
what
about
Hermione
Granger
said
Parvati
she's
going
with
someone
else
parvati
looked
astonished
ooooh
who
she
said
keenly
harry
shrugged
no
idea
he
said
so
what
about
Ron
well
said
Parvati
slowly
I
suppose
my
sister
might
padma
you
know
in
Ravenclaw
i'll
ask
her
if
you
like
yeah
that
would
be
great
said
Harry
let
me
know
will
you
and
he
went
back
over
to
Ron
feeling
that
this
ball
was
a
lot
more
trouble
than
it
was
worth
and
hoping
very
much
that
Padma
patil's
nose
was
dead
center
chapter
twentythree
the
yule
ball
despite
the
very
heavy
load
of
homework
that
the
fourth
years
had
been
given
for
the
holidays
harry
was
in
no
mood
to
work
when
term
ended
and
spent
the
week
leading
up
to
Christmas
enjoying
himself
as
fully
as
possible
along
with
everyone
else
gryffindor
Tower
was
hardly
less
crowded
now
than
during
termtime
it
seemed
to
have
shrunk
slightly
too
as
its
inhabitants
were
being
so
much
rowdier
than
usual
fred
and
George
had
had
a
great
success
with
their
Canary
Creams
and
for
the
first
couple
of
days
of
the
holidays
people
kept
bursting
into
feather
all
over
the
place
before
long
however
all
the
Gryffindors
had
learned
to
treat
food
anybody
else
offered
them
with
extreme
caution
in
case
it
had
a
Canary
Cream
concealed
in
the
center
and
George
confided
to
Harry
that
he
and
Fred
were
now
working
on
developing
something
else
harry
made
a
mental
note
never
to
accept
so
much
as
a
crisp
from
Fred
and
George
in
future
he
still
hadn't
forgotten
Dudley
and
the
TonTongue
Toffee
snow
was
falling
thickly
upon
the
castle
and
its
grounds
now
the
pale
blue
Beauxbatons
carriage
looked
like
a
large
chilly
frosted
pumpkin
next
to
the
iced
gingerbread
house
that
was
hagrid's
cabin
while
the
Durmstrang
ship's
portholes
were
glazed
with
ice
the
rigging
white
with
frost
the
houseelves
down
in
the
kitchen
were
outdoing
themselves
with
a
series
of
rich
warming
stews
and
savory
puddings
and
only
Fleur
Delacour
seemed
to
be
able
to
find
anything
to
complain
about
it
is
too
eavy
all
zis
Ogwarts
food
they
heard
her
saying
grumpily
as
they
left
the
Great
Hall
behind
her
one
evening
Ron
skulking
behind
Harry
keen
not
to
be
spotted
by
Fleur
i
will
not
fit
into
my
dress
robes
oooh
there's
a
tragedy
Hermione
snapped
as
Fleur
went
out
into
the
entrance
hall
she
really
thinks
a
lot
of
herself
that
one
doesn't
she
hermione
who
are
you
going
to
the
ball
with
said
Ron
he
kept
springing
this
question
on
her
hoping
to
startle
her
into
a
response
by
asking
it
when
she
least
expected
it
however
Hermione
merely
frowned
and
said
i'm
not
telling
you
you'll
just
make
fun
of
me
you're
joking
Weasley
said
Malfoy
behind
them
you're
not
telling
me
someone's
asked
that
to
the
ball
not
the
longmolared
Mudblood
Harry
and
Ron
both
whipped
around
but
Hermione
said
loudly
waving
to
somebody
over
Malfoys
shoulder
Hello
Professor
Moody
malfoy
went
pale
and
jumped
backward
looking
wildly
around
for
Moody
but
he
was
still
up
at
the
staff
table
finishing
his
stew
twitchy
little
ferret
aren't
you
Malfoy
said
Hermione
scathingly
and
she
Harry
and
Ron
went
up
the
marble
staircase
laughing
heartily
hermione
said
Ron
looking
sideways
at
her
suddenly
frowning
your
teeth
what
about
them
she
said
well
they're
different
i've
just
noticed
of
course
they
are
did
you
expect
me
to
keep
those
fangs
Malfoy
gave
me
no
I
mean
they're
different
to
how
they
were
before
he
put
that
hex
on
you
they're
all
straight
and
and
normalsized
hermione
suddenly
smiled
very
mischievously
and
Harry
noticed
it
too
It
was
a
very
different
smile
from
the
one
he
remembered
well
when
I
went
up
to
Madam
Pomfrey
to
get
them
shrunk
she
held
up
a
mirror
and
told
me
to
stop
her
when
they
were
back
to
how
they
normally
were
she
said
and
I
just
let
her
carry
on
a
bit
she
smiled
even
more
widely
mum
and
Dad
won't
be
too
pleased
i've
been
trying
to
persuade
them
to
let
me
shrink
them
for
ages
but
they
wanted
me
to
carry
on
with
my
braces
you
know
they're
dentists
they
just
don't
think
teeth
and
magic
should
look
pigwidgeons
back
ron's
tiny
owl
was
twittering
madly
on
the
top
of
the
icicleladen
banisters
a
scroll
of
parchment
tied
to
his
leg
people
passing
him
were
pointing
and
laughing
and
a
group
of
thirdyear
girls
paused
and
said
Oh
look
at
the
weeny
owl
isn't
he
cute
stupid
little
feathery
git
ron
hissed
hurrying
up
the
stairs
and
snatching
up
Pigwidgeon
you
bring
letters
to
the
addressee
you
don't
hang
around
showing
off
pigwidgeon
hooted
happily
his
head
protruding
over
ron's
fist
the
thirdyear
girls
all
looked
very
shocked
clear
off
ron
snapped
at
them
waving
the
fist
holding
Pigwidgeon
who
hooted
more
happily
than
ever
as
he
soared
through
the
air
here
take
it
Harry
ron
added
in
an
undertone
as
the
thirdyear
girls
scuttled
away
looking
scandalized
he
pulled
sirius's
reply
off
Pigwidgeons
leg
harry
pocketed
it
and
they
hurried
back
to
Gryffindor
Tower
to
read
it
everyone
in
the
common
room
was
much
too
busy
in
letting
off
more
holiday
steam
to
observe
what
anyone
else
was
up
to
ron
Harry
and
Hermione
sat
apart
from
everyone
else
by
a
dark
window
that
was
gradually
filling
up
with
snow
and
Harry
read
out
Dear
Harry
congratulations
on
getting
past
the
Horntail
whoever
put
your
name
in
that
goblet
shouldn't
be
feeling
too
happy
right
now
i
was
going
to
suggest
a
Conjunctivitus
Curse
as
a
dragon's
eyes
are
its
weakest
point
that's
what
Krum
did
hermione
whispered
but
your
way
was
better
i'm
impressed
don't
get
complacent
though
harry
you've
only
done
one
task
whoever
put
you
in
for
the
tournament's
got
plenty
more
opportunity
if
they're
trying
to
hurt
you
keep
your
eyes
open
particularly
when
the
person
we
discussed
is
around
and
concentrate
on
keeping
yourself
out
of
trouble
keep
in
touch
I
still
want
to
hear
about
anything
unusual
sirius
He
sounds
exactly
like
Moody
said
Harry
quietly
tucking
the
letter
away
again
inside
his
robes
constant
vigilance
you'd
think
I
walk
around
with
my
eyes
shut
banging
off
the
walls
but
he's
right
Harry
said
Hermione
you
have
still
got
two
tasks
to
do
you
really
ought
to
have
a
look
at
that
egg
you
know
and
start
working
out
what
it
means
hermione
he's
got
ages
snapped
Ron
want
a
game
of
chess
Harry
yeah
okay
said
Harry
then
spotting
the
look
on
hermione's
face
he
said
Come
on
how'm
I
supposed
to
concentrate
with
all
this
noise
going
on
i
won't
even
be
able
to
hear
the
egg
over
this
lot
oh
I
suppose
not
she
sighed
and
she
sat
down
to
watch
their
chess
match
which
culminated
in
an
exciting
checkmate
of
ron's
involving
a
couple
of
recklessly
brave
pawns
and
a
very
violent
bishop
harry
awoke
very
suddenly
on
Christmas
Day
wondering
what
had
caused
his
abrupt
return
to
consciousness
he
opened
his
eyes
and
saw
something
with
very
large
round
green
eyes
staring
back
at
him
in
the
darkness
so
close
they
were
almost
nose
to
nose
dobby
harry
yelled
scrambling
away
from
the
elf
so
fast
he
almost
fell
out
of
bed
don't
do
that
dobby
is
sorry
sir
squeaked
Dobby
anxiously
jumping
backward
with
his
long
fingers
over
his
mouth
dobby
is
only
wanting
to
wish
Harry
Potter
Merry
Christmas
and
bring
him
a
present
Sir
harry
Potter
did
say
Dobby
could
come
and
see
him
sometimes
sir
it's
okay
said
Harry
still
breathing
rather
faster
than
usual
while
his
heart
rate
returned
to
normal
just
just
prod
me
or
something
in
future
all
right
don't
bend
over
me
like
that
harry
pulled
back
the
curtains
around
his
fourposter
took
his
glasses
from
his
bedside
table
and
put
them
on
his
yell
had
awoken
Ron
Seamus
Dean
and
Neville
all
of
them
were
peering
through
the
gaps
in
their
own
hangings
heavy
eyed
and
touslehaired
someone
attacking
you
Harry
seamus
asked
sleepily
no
it's
just
Dobby
Harry
muttered
go
back
to
sleep
nah
presents
said
Seamus
spotting
the
large
pile
at
the
foot
of
his
bed
ron
Dean
and
Neville
decided
that
now
they
were
awake
they
might
as
well
get
down
to
some
presentopening
too
harry
turned
back
to
Dobby
who
was
now
standing
nervously
next
to
Harrys
bed
still
looking
worried
that
he
had
upset
Harry
there
was
a
Christmas
bauble
tied
to
the
loop
on
top
of
his
tea
cozy
can
Dobby
give
Harry
Potter
his
present
he
squeaked
tentatively
course
you
can
said
Harry
er
i've
got
something
for
you
too
it
was
a
lie
he
hadn't
bought
anything
for
Dobby
at
all
but
he
quickly
opened
his
trunk
and
pulled
out
a
particularly
knobbly
rolledup
pair
of
socks
they
were
his
oldest
and
foulest
mustard
yellow
and
had
once
belonged
to
Uncle
Vernon
the
reason
they
were
extraknobbly
was
that
Harry
had
been
using
them
to
cushion
his
Sneakoscope
for
over
a
year
now
he
pulled
out
the
Sneakoscope
and
handed
the
socks
to
Dobby
saying
Sorry
I
forgot
to
wrap
them
but
Dobby
was
utterly
delighted
socks
are
dobby's
favorite
favorite
clothes
sir
he
said
ripping
off
his
odd
ones
and
pulling
on
Uncle
vernon's
i
has
seven
now
sir
but
sir
he
said
his
eyes
widening
having
pulled
both
socks
up
to
their
highest
extent
so
that
they
reached
to
the
bottom
of
his
shorts
they
has
made
a
mistake
in
the
shop
Harry
Potter
they
is
giving
you
two
the
same
ah
no
Harry
how
come
you
didn't
spot
that
said
Ron
grinning
over
from
his
own
bed
which
was
now
strewn
with
wrapping
paper
tell
you
what
Dobby
here
you
go
take
these
two
and
you
can
mix
them
up
properly
and
here's
your
sweater
he
threw
Dobby
a
pair
of
violet
socks
he
had
just
unwrapped
and
the
hand
knitted
sweater
Mrs
weasley
had
sent
Dobby
looked
quite
overwhelmed
sir
is
very
kind
he
squeaked
his
eyes
brimming
with
tears
again
bowing
deeply
to
Ron
dobby
knew
sir
must
be
a
great
wizard
for
he
is
Harry
potter's
greatest
friend
but
Dobby
did
not
know
that
he
was
also
as
generous
of
spirit
as
noble
as
selfless
they're
only
socks
said
Ron
who
had
gone
slightly
pink
around
the
ears
though
he
looked
rather
pleased
all
the
same
wow
Harry
He
had
just
opened
harry's
present
a
Chudley
Cannon
hat
cool
he
jammed
it
onto
his
head
where
it
clashed
horribly
with
his
hair
dobby
now
handed
Harry
a
small
package
which
turned
out
to
be
socks
dobby
is
making
them
himself
sir
the
elf
said
happily
he
is
buying
the
wool
out
of
his
wages
sir
the
left
sock
was
bright
red
and
had
a
pattern
of
broomsticks
upon
it
the
right
sock
was
green
with
a
pattern
of
Snitches
they're
they're
really
well
thanks
Dobby
said
Harry
and
he
pulled
them
on
causing
dobby's
eyes
to
leak
with
happiness
again
dobby
must
go
now
sir
we
is
already
making
Christmas
dinner
in
the
kitchens
said
Dobby
and
he
hurried
out
of
the
dormitory
waving
goodbye
to
Ron
and
the
others
as
he
passed
harry's
other
presents
were
much
more
satisfactory
than
dobby's
odd
socks
with
the
obvious
exception
of
the
Dursleys
which
consisted
of
a
single
tissue
an
all
time
low
Harry
supposed
they
too
were
remember
ing
the
TonTongue
Toffee
hermione
had
given
Harry
a
book
called
Quidditch
Teams
of
Britain
and
Ireland
Ron
a
bulging
bag
of
Dungbombs
Sirius
a
handy
penknife
with
attachments
to
unlock
any
lock
and
undo
any
knot
and
Hagrid
a
vast
box
of
sweets
including
all
Harrys
favorites
Bertie
bott's
Every
Flavor
Beans
Chocolate
Frogs
drooble's
Best
Blowing
Gum
and
Fizzing
Whizbees
there
was
also
of
course
Mrs
weasley's
usual
package
including
a
new
sweater
green
with
a
picture
of
a
dragon
on
it
Harry
supposed
Charlie
had
told
her
all
about
the
Horntail
and
a
large
quantity
of
homemade
mince
pies
harry
and
Ron
met
up
with
Hermione
in
the
common
room
and
they
went
down
to
breakfast
together
they
spent
most
of
the
morning
in
Gryffindor
Tower
where
everyone
was
enjoying
their
presents
then
returned
to
the
Great
Hall
for
a
magnificent
lunch
which
included
at
least
a
hundred
turkeys
and
Christmas
puddings
and
large
piles
of
cribbage's
Wizarding
Crackers
they
went
out
onto
the
grounds
in
the
afternoon
the
snow
was
untouched
except
for
the
deep
channels
made
by
the
Durmstrang
and
Beauxbatons
students
on
their
way
up
to
the
castle
hermione
chose
to
watch
Harry
and
the
Weasleys
snowball
fight
rather
than
join
in
and
at
five
o'clock
said
she
was
going
back
upstairs
to
get
ready
for
the
ball
what
you
need
three
hours
said
Ron
looking
at
her
incredulously
and
paying
for
his
lapse
in
concentration
when
a
large
snowball
thrown
by
George
hit
him
hard
on
the
side
of
the
head
who're
you
going
with
he
yelled
after
Hermione
but
she
just
waved
and
disappeared
up
the
stone
steps
into
the
castle
there
was
no
Christmas
tea
today
as
the
ball
included
a
feast
so
at
seven
o'clock
when
it
had
become
hard
to
aim
properly
the
others
abandoned
their
snowball
fight
and
trooped
back
to
the
common
room
the
Fat
Lady
was
sitting
in
her
frame
with
her
friend
Violet
from
downstairs
both
of
them
extremely
tipsy
empty
boxes
of
chocolate
liqueurs
littering
the
bottom
other
picture
lairy
fights
that's
the
one
she
giggled
when
they
gave
the
password
and
she
swung
forward
to
let
them
inside
harry
Ron
Seamus
Dean
and
Neville
changed
into
their
dress
robes
up
in
their
dormitory
all
of
them
looking
very
selfconscious
but
none
as
much
as
Ron
who
surveyed
himself
in
the
long
mirror
in
the
corner
with
an
appalled
look
on
his
face
there
was
just
no
getting
around
the
fact
that
his
robes
looked
more
like
a
dress
than
anything
else
in
a
desperate
attempt
to
make
them
look
more
manly
he
used
a
Severing
Charm
on
the
ruff
and
cuffs
it
worked
fairly
well
at
least
he
was
now
lacefree
although
he
hadn't
done
a
very
neat
job
and
the
edges
still
looked
depressingly
frayed
as
the
boys
set
off
downstairs
i
still
can't
work
out
how
you
two
got
the
bestlooking
girls
in
the
year
muttered
Dean
animal
magnetism
said
Ron
gloomily
pulling
stray
threads
out
of
his
cuffs
the
common
room
looked
strange
full
of
people
wearing
different
colors
instead
of
the
usual
mass
of
black
parvati
was
waiting
for
Harry
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
she
looked
very
pretty
indeed
in
robes
of
shocking
pink
with
her
long
dark
plait
braided
with
gold
and
gold
bracelets
glimmering
at
her
wrists
harry
was
relieved
to
see
that
she
wasn't
giggling
you
er
look
nice
he
said
awkwardly
thanks
she
said
padma's
going
to
meet
you
in
the
entrance
hall
she
added
to
Ron
right
said
Ron
looking
around
where's
Hermione
parvati
shrugged
shall
we
go
down
then
Harry
okay
said
Harry
wishing
he
could
just
stay
in
the
common
room
fred
winked
at
Harry
as
he
passed
him
on
the
way
out
of
the
portrait
hole
the
entrance
hall
was
packed
with
students
too
all
milling
around
waiting
for
eight
o'clock
when
the
doors
to
the
Great
Hall
would
be
thrown
open
those
people
who
were
meeting
partners
from
different
Houses
were
edging
through
the
crowd
trying
to
find
one
another
parvati
found
her
sister
Padma
and
led
her
over
to
Harry
and
Ron
hi
said
Padma
who
was
looking
just
as
pretty
as
Parvati
in
robes
of
bright
turquoise
she
didn't
look
too
enthusiastic
about
having
Ron
as
a
partner
though
her
dark
eyes
lingered
on
the
frayed
neck
and
sleeves
of
his
dress
robes
as
she
looked
him
up
and
down
hi
said
Ron
not
looking
at
her
but
staring
around
at
the
crowd
oh
no
he
bent
his
knees
slightly
to
hide
behind
Harry
because
Fleur
Delacour
was
passing
looking
stunning
in
robes
of
silvergray
satin
and
accompanied
by
the
ravenclaw
Quidditch
captain
Roger
Davies
when
they
had
disappeared
Ron
stood
straight
again
and
stared
over
the
heads
of
the
crowd
where
is
Hermione
he
said
again
a
group
of
Slytherins
came
up
the
steps
from
their
dungeon
common
room
malfoy
was
in
front
he
was
wearing
dress
robes
of
black
velvet
with
a
high
collar
which
in
harry's
opinion
made
him
look
like
a
vicar
pansy
Parkinson
in
very
frilly
robes
of
pale
pink
was
clutching
malfoy's
arm
crabbe
and
Goyle
were
both
wearing
green
they
resembled
mosscolored
boulders
and
neither
of
them
Harry
was
pleased
to
see
had
managed
to
find
a
partner
the
oak
front
doors
opened
and
everyone
turned
to
look
as
the
Durmstrang
students
entered
with
Professor
Karkaroff
krum
was
at
the
front
of
the
party
accompanied
by
a
pretty
girl
in
blue
robes
Harry
didn't
know
over
their
heads
he
saw
that
an
area
of
lawn
right
in
front
of
the
castle
had
been
transformed
into
a
sort
of
grotto
full
of
fairy
lights
meaning
hundreds
of
actual
living
fairies
were
sitting
in
the
rosebushes
that
had
been
conjured
there
and
fluttering
over
the
statues
of
what
seemed
to
be
Father
Christmas
and
his
reindeer
then
Professor
mcgonagall's
voice
called
Champions
over
here
please
parvati
readjusted
her
bangles
beaming
she
and
Harry
said
See
you
in
a
minute
to
Ron
and
Padma
and
walked
forward
the
chattering
crowd
parting
to
let
them
through
professor
McGonagall
who
was
wearing
dress
robes
of
red
tartan
and
had
arranged
a
rather
ugly
wreath
of
thistles
around
the
brim
other
hat
told
them
to
wait
on
one
side
of
the
doors
while
everyone
else
went
inside
they
were
to
enter
the
Great
Hall
in
procession
when
the
rest
of
the
students
had
sat
down
fleur
Delacour
and
Roger
Davies
stationed
themselves
nearest
the
doors
Davies
looked
so
stunned
by
his
good
fortune
in
having
Fleur
for
a
partner
that
he
could
hardly
take
his
eyes
off
her
cedric
and
Cho
were
close
to
Harry
too
he
looked
away
from
them
so
he
wouldn't
have
to
talk
to
them
his
eyes
fell
instead
on
the
girl
next
to
Krum
his
jaw
dropped
it
was
Hermione
but
she
didn't
look
like
Hermione
at
all
she
had
done
something
with
her
hair
it
was
no
longer
bushy
but
sleek
and
shiny
and
twisted
up
into
an
elegant
knot
at
the
back
of
her
head
she
was
wearing
robes
made
of
a
floaty
periwinkleblue
material
and
she
was
holding
herself
differently
somehow
or
maybe
it
was
merely
the
absence
of
the
twenty
or
so
books
she
usually
had
slung
over
her
back
she
was
also
smiling
rather
nervously
it
was
true
but
the
reduction
in
the
size
of
her
front
teeth
was
more
noticeable
than
ever
Harry
couldn't
understand
how
he
hadn't
spotted
it
before
hi
Harry
she
said
hi
Parvati
parvati
was
gazing
at
Hermione
in
unflattering
disbelief
she
wasn't
the
only
one
either
when
the
doors
to
the
Great
Hall
opened
krum's
fan
club
from
the
library
stalked
past
throwing
Hermione
looks
of
deepest
loathing
pansy
Parkinson
gaped
at
her
as
she
walked
by
with
Malfoy
and
even
he
didn't
seem
to
be
able
to
find
an
insult
to
throw
at
her
ron
however
walked
right
past
Hermione
without
looking
at
her
once
everyone
else
was
settled
in
the
Hall
Professor
McGonagall
told
the
champions
and
their
partners
to
get
in
line
in
pairs
and
to
follow
her
they
did
so
and
everyone
in
the
Great
Hall
applauded
as
they
entered
and
started
walking
up
toward
a
large
round
table
at
the
top
of
the
Hall
where
the
judges
were
sitting
the
walls
of
the
Hall
had
all
been
covered
in
sparkling
silver
frost
with
hundreds
of
garlands
of
mistletoe
and
ivy
crossing
the
starry
black
ceiling
the
House
tables
had
vanished
instead
there
were
about
a
hundred
smaller
lanternlit
ones
each
seating
about
a
dozen
people
harry
concentrated
on
not
tripping
over
his
feet
parvati
seemed
to
be
enjoying
herself
she
was
beaming
around
at
everybody
steering
Harry
so
forcefully
that
he
felt
as
though
he
were
a
show
dog
she
was
putting
through
its
paces
he
caught
sight
of
Ron
and
Padma
as
he
neared
the
top
table
ron
was
watching
Hermione
pass
with
narrowed
eyes
padma
was
looking
sulky
dumbledore
smiled
happily
as
the
champions
approached
the
top
table
but
Karkaroff
wore
an
expression
remarkably
like
ron's
as
he
watched
Krum
and
Hermione
draw
nearer
ludo
Bagman
tonight
in
robes
of
bright
purple
with
large
yellow
stars
was
clapping
as
enthusiastically
as
any
of
the
students
and
Madame
Maxime
who
had
changed
her
usual
uniform
of
black
satin
for
a
flowing
gown
of
lavender
silk
was
applauding
them
politely
but
mr.
Crouch
Harry
suddenly
realized
was
not
there
the
fifth
seat
at
the
table
was
occupied
by
Percy
Weasley
when
the
champions
and
their
partners
reached
the
table
Percy
drew
out
the
empty
chair
beside
him
staring
pointedly
at
Harry
harry
took
the
hint
and
sat
down
next
to
Percy
who
was
wearing
brandnew
navyblue
dress
robes
and
an
expression
of
such
smugness
that
Harry
thought
it
ought
to
be
fined
i've
been
promoted
Percy
said
before
Harry
could
even
ask
and
from
his
tone
he
might
have
been
announcing
his
election
as
supreme
ruler
of
the
universe
i'm
now
mr.
crouch's
personal
assistant
and
i'm
here
representing
him
why
didn't
he
come
harry
asked
he
wasn't
looking
forward
to
being
lectured
on
cauldron
bottoms
all
through
dinner
i'm
afraid
to
say
mr.
Crouch
isn't
well
not
well
at
all
hasn't
been
right
since
the
World
Cup
hardly
surprising
overwork
he's
not
as
young
as
he
was
though
still
quite
brilliant
of
course
the
mind
remains
as
great
as
it
ever
was
but
the
World
Cup
was
a
fiasco
for
the
whole
Ministry
and
then
mr.
Crouch
suffered
a
huge
personal
shock
with
the
misbehavior
of
that
houseelf
of
his
Blinky
or
whatever
she
was
called
naturally
he
dismissed
her
immediately
afterward
but
well
as
I
say
he's
getting
on
he
needs
looking
after
and
I
think
he's
found
a
definite
drop
in
his
home
comforts
since
she
left
and
then
we
had
the
tournament
to
arrange
and
the
aftermath
of
the
Cup
to
deal
with
that
revolting
Skeeter
woman
buzzing
around
no
poor
man
he's
having
a
well
earned
quiet
Christmas
i'm
just
glad
he
knew
he
had
someone
he
could
rely
upon
to
take
his
place
harry
wanted
very
much
to
ask
whether
mr.
Crouch
had
stopped
calling
Percy
Weatherby
yet
but
resisted
the
temptation
there
was
no
food
as
yet
on
the
glittering
golden
plates
but
small
menus
were
lying
in
front
of
each
of
them
harry
picked
his
up
uncertainly
and
looked
around
there
were
no
waiters
dumbledore
however
looked
carefully
down
at
his
own
menu
then
said
very
clearly
to
his
plate
Pork
chops
and
pork
chops
appeared
getting
the
idea
the
rest
of
the
table
placed
their
orders
with
their
plates
too
harry
glanced
up
at
Hermione
to
see
how
she
felt
about
this
new
and
more
complicated
method
of
dining
surely
it
meant
plenty
of
extra
work
for
the
houseelves
but
for
once
Hermione
didn't
seem
to
be
thinking
about
S
p.e.w.
She
was
deep
in
talk
with
Viktor
Krum
and
hardly
seemed
to
notice
what
she
was
eating
it
now
occurred
to
Harry
that
he
had
never
actually
heard
Krum
speak
before
but
he
was
certainly
talking
now
and
very
enthusiastically
at
that
veil
ve
have
a
castle
also
not
as
big
as
this
nor
as
comfortable
I
am
thinking
he
was
telling
Hermione
ve
have
just
four
floors
and
the
fires
are
lit
only
for
magical
purposes
but
ve
have
grounds
larger
even
than
these
though
in
vinter
ve
have
very
little
daylight
so
ve
are
not
enjoying
them
but
in
summer
ve
are
flying
every
day
over
the
lakes
and
the
mountains
now
now
Viktor
said
Karkaroff
with
a
laugh
that
didn't
reach
his
cold
eyes
don't
go
giving
away
anything
else
now
or
your
charming
friend
will
know
exactly
where
to
find
us
dumbledore
smiled
his
eyes
twinkling
igor
all
this
secrecy
one
would
almost
think
you
didn't
want
visitors
well
Dumbledore
said
Karkaroff
displaying
his
yellowing
teeth
to
their
fullest
extent
we
are
all
protective
of
our
private
domains
are
we
not
do
we
not
jealously
guard
the
halls
of
learning
that
have
been
entrusted
to
us
are
we
not
right
to
be
proud
that
we
alone
know
our
school's
secrets
and
right
to
protect
them
oh
I
would
never
dream
of
assuming
I
know
all
Hogwarts
secrets
Igor
said
Dumbledore
amicably
only
this
morning
for
instance
I
took
a
wrong
turning
on
the
way
to
the
bathroom
and
found
myself
in
a
beautifully
proportioned
room
I
have
never
seen
before
containing
a
really
rather
magnificent
collection
of
chamber
pots
when
I
went
back
to
investigate
more
closely
I
discovered
that
the
room
had
vanished
but
I
must
keep
an
eye
out
for
it
possibly
it
is
only
accessible
at
fivethirty
in
the
morning
or
it
may
only
appear
at
the
quarter
moon
or
when
the
seeker
has
an
exceptionally
full
bladder
harry
snorted
into
his
plate
of
goulash
percy
frowned
but
Harry
could
have
sworn
Dumbledore
had
given
him
a
very
small
wink
meanwhile
Fleur
Delacour
was
criticizing
the
Hogwarts
decorations
to
Roger
Davies
zis
is
nothing
she
said
dismissively
looking
around
at
the
sparkling
walls
of
the
Great
Hall
at
ze
Palace
of
Beauxbatons
we
ave
ice
sculptures
all
around
ze
dining
chamber
at
Chreestmas
zey
do
not
melt
of
course
zey
are
like
uge
statues
of
diamond
glittering
around
ze
place
and
ze
food
is
seemply
superb
and
we
ave
choirs
of
wood
nymphs
oo
serenade
us
as
we
eat
we
ave
none
of
zis
ugly
armor
in
ze
alls
and
eef
a
poltergeist
ever
entaired
into
Beauxbatons
e
would
be
expelled
like
zat
she
slapped
her
hand
onto
the
table
impatiently
roger
Davies
was
watching
her
talk
with
a
very
dazed
look
on
his
face
and
he
kept
missing
his
mouth
with
his
fork
harry
had
the
impression
that
Davies
was
too
busy
staring
at
Fleur
to
take
in
a
word
she
was
saying
absolutely
right
he
said
quickly
slapping
his
own
hand
down
on
the
table
in
imitation
of
Fleur
like
that
yeah
harry
looked
around
the
Hall
hagrid
was
sitting
at
one
of
the
other
staff
tables
he
was
back
in
his
horrible
hairy
brown
suit
and
gazing
up
at
the
top
table
harry
saw
him
give
a
small
wave
and
looking
around
saw
Madame
Maxime
return
it
her
opals
glittering
in
the
candlelight
hermione
was
now
teaching
Krum
to
say
her
name
properly
he
kept
calling
her
Hermyown
hermyohnee
she
said
slowly
and
clearly
hermownninny
close
enough
she
said
catching
harry's
eye
and
grinning
when
all
the
food
had
been
consumed
Dumbledore
stood
up
and
asked
the
students
to
do
the
same
then
with
a
wave
of
his
wand
all
the
tables
zoomed
back
along
the
walls
leaving
the
floor
clear
and
then
he
conjured
a
raised
platform
into
existence
along
the
right
wall
a
set
of
drums
several
guitars
a
lute
a
cello
and
some
bagpipes
were
set
upon
it
the
Weird
Sisters
now
trooped
up
onto
the
stage
to
wildly
enthusiastic
applause
they
were
all
extremely
hairy
and
dressed
in
black
robes
that
had
been
artfully
ripped
and
torn
they
picked
up
their
instruments
and
Harry
who
had
been
so
interested
in
watching
them
that
he
had
almost
forgotten
what
was
coming
suddenly
realized
that
the
lanterns
on
all
the
other
tables
had
gone
out
and
that
the
other
champions
and
their
partners
were
standing
up
come
on
parvati
hissed
we're
supposed
to
dance
harry
tripped
over
his
dress
robes
as
he
stood
up
the
Weird
Sisters
struck
up
a
slow
mournful
tune
Harry
walked
onto
the
brightly
lit
dance
floor
carefully
avoiding
catching
anyone's
eye
he
could
see
Seamus
and
Dean
waving
at
him
and
sniggering
and
next
moment
Parvati
had
seized
his
hands
placed
one
around
her
waist
and
was
holding
the
other
tightly
in
hers
it
wasn't
as
bad
as
it
could
have
been
harry
thought
revolving
slowly
on
the
spot
Parvati
was
steering
he
kept
his
eyes
fixed
over
the
heads
of
the
watching
people
and
very
soon
many
of
them
too
had
come
onto
the
dance
floor
so
that
the
champions
were
no
longer
the
center
of
attention
neville
and
Ginny
were
dancing
nearby
he
could
see
Ginny
wincing
frequently
as
Neville
trod
on
her
feet
and
Dumbledore
was
waltzing
with
Madame
Maxime
he
was
so
dwarfed
by
her
that
the
top
of
his
pointed
hat
barely
tickled
her
chin
however
she
moved
very
gracefully
for
a
woman
so
large
madEye
Moody
was
doing
an
extremely
ungainly
twostep
with
Professor
Sinistra
who
was
nervously
avoiding
his
wooden
leg
nice
socks
potter
Moody
growled
as
he
passed
his
magical
eye
staring
through
harry's
robes
oh
yeah
Dobby
the
houseelf
knitted
them
for
me
said
Harry
grinning
he
is
so
creepy
parvati
whispered
as
Moody
clunked
away
i
don't
think
that
eye
should
be
allowed
harry
heard
the
final
quavering
note
from
the
bagpipe
with
relief
the
Weird
Sisters
stopped
playing
applause
filled
the
hall
once
more
and
Harry
let
go
of
Parvati
at
once
let's
sit
down
shall
we
oh
but
this
is
a
really
good
one
parvati
said
as
the
Weird
Sisters
struck
up
a
new
song
which
was
much
faster
no
I
don't
like
it
Harry
lied
and
he
led
her
away
from
the
dance
floor
past
Fred
and
Angelina
who
were
dancing
so
exhuberantly
that
people
around
them
were
backing
away
in
fear
of
injury
and
over
to
the
table
where
Ron
and
Padma
were
sitting
how's
it
going
harry
asked
Ron
sitting
down
and
opening
a
bottle
of
butterbeer
ron
didn't
answer
he
was
glaring
at
Hermione
and
Krum
who
were
dancing
nearby
padma
was
sitting
with
her
arms
and
legs
crossed
one
foot
jiggling
in
time
to
the
music
every
now
and
then
she
threw
a
disgruntled
look
at
Ron
who
was
completely
ignoring
her
parvati
sat
down
on
harry's
other
side
crossed
her
arms
and
legs
too
and
within
minutes
was
asked
to
dance
by
a
boy
from
beauxbatons
you
don't
mind
do
you
Harry
parvati
said
what
said
Harry
who
was
now
watching
Cho
and
Cedric
oh
never
mind
snapped
Parvati
and
she
went
off
with
the
boy
from
Beauxbatons
when
the
song
ended
she
did
not
return
hermione
came
over
and
sat
down
in
parvati's
empty
chair
she
was
a
bit
pink
in
the
face
from
dancing
hi
said
Harry
ron
didn't
say
anything
it's
hot
isn't
it
said
Hermione
fanning
herself
with
her
hand
viktors
just
gone
to
get
some
drinks
ron
gave
her
a
withering
look
viktor
he
said
hasn't
he
asked
you
to
call
him
Vicky
yet
hermione
looked
at
him
in
surprise
what's
up
with
you
she
said
if
you
don't
know
said
Ron
scathingly
i'm
not
going
to
tell
you
hermione
stared
at
him
then
at
Harry
who
shrugged
ron
what
he's
from
Durmstrang
spat
Ron
he's
competing
against
Harry
against
Hogwarts
you
you're
Ron
was
obviously
casting
around
for
words
strong
enough
to
describe
hermione's
crime
fraternizing
with
the
enemy
that's
what
you're
doing
hermione's
mouth
fell
open
don't
be
so
stupid
she
said
after
a
moment
the
enemy
honestly
who
was
the
one
who
was
all
excited
when
they
saw
him
arrive
who
was
the
one
who
wanted
his
autograph
who's
got
a
model
of
him
up
in
their
dormitory
ron
chose
to
ignore
this
i
s'pose
he
asked
you
to
come
with
him
while
you
were
both
in
the
library
yes
he
did
said
Hermione
the
pink
patches
on
her
cheeks
glowing
more
brightly
so
what
what
happened
trying
to
get
him
to
join
spew
were
you
no
I
wasn't
if
you
really
want
to
know
he
he
said
he'd
been
coming
up
to
the
library
every
day
to
try
and
talk
to
me
but
he
hadn't
been
able
to
pluck
up
the
courage
hermione
said
this
very
quickly
and
blushed
so
deeply
that
she
was
the
same
color
as
parvati's
robes
yeah
well
that's
his
story
said
Ron
nastily
and
what's
that
supposed
to
mean
obvious
isn't
it
he's
karkaroff's
student
isn't
he
he
knows
who
you
hang
around
with
he's
just
trying
to
get
closer
to
Harry
get
inside
information
on
him
or
get
near
enough
to
jinx
him
hermione
looked
as
though
Ron
had
slapped
her
when
she
spoke
her
voice
quivered
for
your
information
he
hasn't
asked
me
one
single
thing
about
Harry
not
one
ron
changed
tack
at
the
speed
of
light
then
he's
hoping
you'll
help
him
find
out
what
his
egg
means
i
suppose
you've
been
putting
your
heads
together
during
those
cozy
little
library
sessions
i'd
never
help
him
work
out
that
egg
said
Hermione
looking
outraged
never
how
could
you
say
something
like
that
I
want
Harry
to
win
the
tournament
harry
knows
that
don't
you
Harry
you've
got
a
funny
way
of
showing
it
sneered
Ron
this
whole
tournament's
supposed
to
be
about
getting
to
know
foreign
wizards
and
making
friends
with
them
said
Hermione
hotly
no
it
isn't
shouted
Ron
it's
about
winning
people
were
starting
to
stare
at
them
ron
said
Harry
quietly
I
haven't
got
a
problem
with
Hermione
coming
with
Krum
but
Ron
ignored
Harry
too
why
don't
you
go
and
find
Vicky
he'll
be
wondering
where
you
are
said
Ron
don't
call
him
Vicky
hermione
jumped
to
her
feet
and
stormed
off
across
the
dance
floor
disappearing
into
the
crowd
ron
watched
her
go
with
a
mixture
of
anger
and
satisfaction
on
his
face
are
you
going
to
ask
me
to
dance
at
all
padma
asked
him
no
said
Ron
still
glaring
after
Hermione
fine
snapped
Padma
and
she
got
up
and
went
to
join
Parvati
and
the
Beauxbatons
boy
who
conjured
up
one
of
his
friends
to
join
them
so
fast
that
harry
could
have
sworn
he
had
zoomed
him
there
by
a
Summoning
Charm
vare
is
Hermownninny
said
a
voice
krum
had
just
arrived
at
their
table
clutching
two
butterbeers
no
idea
said
Ron
mulishly
looking
up
at
him
lost
her
have
you
krum
was
looking
surly
again
veil
if
you
see
her
tell
her
I
haff
drinks
he
said
and
he
slouched
off
made
friends
with
Viktor
Krum
have
you
Ron
percy
had
bustled
over
rubbing
his
hands
together
and
looking
extremely
pompous
excellent
that's
the
whole
point
you
know
international
magical
cooperation
to
harry's
displeasure
Percy
now
took
padma's
vacated
seat
the
top
table
was
now
empty
Professor
Dumbledore
was
dancing
with
Professor
Sprout
Ludo
Bagman
with
Professor
McGonagall
Madame
Maxime
and
Hagrid
were
cutting
a
wide
path
around
the
dance
floor
as
they
waltzed
through
the
students
and
Karkaroff
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
when
the
next
song
ended
everybody
applauded
once
more
and
Harry
saw
Ludo
Bagman
kiss
Professor
mcgonagall's
hand
and
make
his
way
back
through
the
crowds
at
which
point
Fred
and
George
accosted
him
what
do
they
think
they're
doing
annoying
senior
Ministry
members
percy
hissed
watching
Fred
and
George
suspiciously
no
respect
ludo
Bagman
shook
off
Fred
and
George
fairly
quickly
however
and
spotting
Harry
waved
and
came
over
to
their
table
i
hope
my
brothers
weren't
bothering
you
mr.
Bagman
said
Percy
at
once
what
oh
not
at
all
not
at
all
said
Bagman
no
they
were
just
telling
me
a
bit
more
about
those
fake
wands
of
theirs
wondering
if
I
could
advise
them
on
the
marketing
i've
promised
to
put
them
in
touch
with
a
couple
of
contacts
of
mine
at
zonko's
Joke
Shop
percy
didn't
look
happy
about
this
at
all
and
Harry
was
prepared
to
bet
he
would
be
rushing
to
tell
Mrs
weasley
about
this
the
moment
he
got
home
apparently
Fred
and
george's
plans
had
grown
even
more
ambitious
lately
if
they
were
hoping
to
sell
to
the
public
bagman
opened
his
mouth
to
ask
Harry
something
but
Percy
diverted
him
how
do
you
feel
the
tournament's
going
mr.
Bagman
our
department's
quite
satisfied
the
hitch
with
the
Goblet
of
Fire
he
glanced
at
Harry
was
a
little
unfortunate
of
course
but
it
seems
to
have
gone
very
smoothly
since
don't
you
think
oh
yes
Bagman
said
cheerfully
it's
all
been
enormous
fun
how's
old
Barty
doing
shame
he
couldn't
come
oh
i'm
sure
mr.
Crouch
will
be
up
and
about
in
no
time
said
Percy
importantly
but
in
the
meantime
i'm
more
than
willing
to
take
up
the
slack
of
course
it's
not
all
attending
balls
he
laughed
airily
oh
no
i've
had
to
deal
with
all
sorts
of
things
that
have
cropped
up
in
his
absence
you
heard
Ali
Bashir
was
caught
smuggling
a
consignment
of
flying
carpets
into
the
country
and
then
we've
been
trying
to
persuade
the
Transylvanians
to
sign
the
International
Ban
on
Dueling
i've
got
a
meeting
with
their
Head
of
Magical
Cooperation
in
the
new
year
let's
go
for
a
walk
Ron
muttered
to
Harry
get
away
from
Percy
pretending
they
wanted
more
drinks
harry
and
Ron
left
the
table
edged
around
the
dance
floor
and
slipped
out
into
the
entrance
hall
the
front
doors
stood
open
and
the
fluttering
fairy
lights
in
the
rose
garden
winked
and
twinkled
as
they
went
down
the
front
steps
where
they
found
themselves
surrounded
by
bushes
winding
ornamental
paths
and
large
stone
statues
harry
could
hear
splashing
water
which
sounded
like
a
fountain
here
and
there
people
were
sitting
on
carved
benches
he
and
Ron
set
off
along
one
of
the
winding
paths
through
the
rosebushes
but
they
had
gone
only
a
short
way
when
they
heard
an
unpleasantly
familiar
voice
don't
see
what
there
is
to
fuss
about
Igor
severus
you
cannot
pretend
this
isn't
happening
karkaroffs
voice
sounded
anxious
and
hushed
as
though
keen
not
to
be
overheard
it's
been
getting
clearer
and
clearer
for
months
i
am
becoming
seriously
concerned
I
can't
deny
it
then
flee
said
Snapes
voice
curtly
flee
I
will
make
your
excuses
i
however
am
remaining
at
Hogwarts
snape
and
Karkaroff
came
around
the
corner
snape
had
his
wand
out
and
was
blasting
rosebushes
apart
his
expression
most
illnatured
squeals
issued
from
many
of
the
bushes
and
dark
shapes
emerged
from
them
ten
points
from
Ravenclaw
Fawcett
snape
snarled
as
a
girl
ran
past
him
and
ten
points
from
Hufflepuff
too
Stebbins
as
a
boy
went
rushing
after
her
and
what
are
you
two
doing
he
added
catching
sight
of
Harry
and
Ron
on
the
path
ahead
karkaroff
Harry
saw
looked
slightly
discomposed
to
see
them
standing
there
his
hand
went
nervously
to
his
goatee
and
he
began
winding
it
around
his
finger
we
re
walking
Ron
told
Snape
shortly
not
against
the
law
is
it
keep
walking
then
snape
snarled
and
he
brushed
past
them
his
long
black
cloak
billowing
out
behind
him
karkaroff
hurried
away
after
Snape
harry
and
Ron
continued
down
the
path
what's
got
Karkaroff
all
worried
ron
muttered
and
since
when
have
he
and
Snape
been
on
firstname
terms
said
Harry
slowly
they
had
reached
a
large
stone
reindeer
now
over
which
they
could
see
the
sparkling
jets
of
a
tall
fountain
the
shadowy
outlines
of
two
enormous
people
were
visible
on
a
stone
bench
watching
the
water
in
the
moonlight
and
then
Harry
heard
Hagrid
speak
momen
I
saw
yeh
I
knew
he
was
saying
in
an
oddly
husky
voice
harry
and
Ron
froze
this
didn't
sound
like
the
sort
of
scene
they
ought
to
walk
in
on
somehow
harry
looked
around
back
up
the
path
and
saw
Fleur
Delacour
and
Roger
Davies
standing
halfconcealed
in
a
rosebush
nearby
he
tapped
Ron
on
the
shoulder
and
jerked
his
head
toward
them
meaning
that
they
could
easily
sneak
off
that
way
without
being
noticed
Fleur
and
Davies
looked
very
busy
to
Harry
but
Ron
eyes
widening
in
horror
at
the
sight
of
Fleur
shook
his
head
vigorously
and
pulled
Harry
deeper
into
the
shadows
behind
the
reindeer
what
did
you
know
Agrid
said
Madame
Maxime
a
purr
in
her
low
voice
harry
definitely
didn't
want
to
listen
to
this
he
knew
Hagrid
would
hate
to
be
overheard
in
a
situation
like
this
he
certainly
would
have
if
it
had
been
possible
he
would
have
put
his
fingers
in
his
ears
and
hummed
loudly
but
that
wasn't
really
an
option
instead
he
tried
to
interest
himself
in
a
beetle
crawling
along
the
stone
reindeer's
back
but
the
beetle
just
wasn't
interesting
enough
to
block
out
hagrid's
next
words
i
jus
knew
knew
you
were
like
me
was
it
yer
mother
or
yer
father
i
I
don't
know
what
you
mean
Agrid
it
was
my
mother
said
Hagrid
quietly
she
was
one
o
the
las
ones
in
Britain
course
I
can
remember
her
too
well
she
left
see
when
I
was
abou
three
she
wasn
really
the
maternal
sort
well
it's
not
in
their
natures
is
it
dunno
what
happened
to
her
might
be
dead
fer
all
I
know
madame
Maxime
didn't
say
anything
and
Harry
in
spite
of
himself
took
his
eyes
off
the
beetle
and
looked
over
the
top
of
the
reindeer's
antlers
listening
he
had
never
heard
Hagrid
talk
about
his
childhood
before
me
dad
was
brokenhearted
when
she
wen
tiny
little
bloke
my
dad
was
by
the
time
I
was
six
I
could
lift
him
up
an
put
him
on
top
o
the
dresser
if
he
annoyed
me
used
ter
make
him
laugh
hagrid's
deep
voice
broke
madame
Maxime
was
listening
motionless
apparently
staring
at
the
silvery
fountain
dad
raised
me
but
he
died
o
course
jus
after
I
started
school
sorta
had
ter
make
me
own
way
after
that
dumbledore
was
a
real
help
mind
very
kind
ter
me
he
was
hagrid
pulled
out
a
large
spotted
silk
handkerchief
and
blew
his
nose
heavily
so
anyway
enough
abou
me
what
about
you
which
side
you
got
it
on
but
Madame
Maxime
had
suddenly
got
to
her
feet
it
is
chilly
she
said
but
whatever
the
weather
was
doing
it
was
nowhere
near
as
cold
as
her
voice
i
think
I
will
go
in
now
eh
said
Hagrid
blankly
no
don
go
i've
i've
never
met
another
one
before
anuzzer
what
precisely
said
Madame
Maxime
her
tone
icy
harry
could
have
told
Hagrid
it
was
best
not
to
answer
he
stood
there
in
the
shadows
gritting
his
teeth
hoping
against
hope
he
wouldn't
but
it
was
no
good
another
halfgiant
o
course
said
Hagrid
ow
dare
you
shrieked
Madame
Maxime
her
voice
exploded
through
the
peaceful
night
air
like
a
foghorn
behind
him
harry
heard
Fleur
and
Roger
fall
out
of
their
rosebush
i
ave
nevair
been
more
insulted
in
my
life
alfgiant
moi
i
ave
I
ave
big
bones
she
stormed
away
great
multicolored
swarms
of
fairies
rose
into
the
air
as
she
passed
angrily
pushing
aside
bushes
hagrid
was
still
sitting
on
the
bench
staring
after
her
it
was
much
too
dark
to
make
out
his
expression
then
after
about
a
minute
he
stood
up
and
strode
away
not
back
to
the
castle
but
off
out
into
the
dark
grounds
in
the
direction
of
his
cabin
c'mon
Harry
said
very
quietly
to
Ron
let's
go
but
Ron
didn't
move
what's
up
said
Harry
looking
at
him
ron
looked
around
at
Harry
his
expression
very
serious
indeed
did
you
know
he
whispered
about
Hagrid
being
halfgiant
no
Harry
said
shrugging
so
what
he
knew
immediately
from
the
look
Ron
was
giving
him
that
he
was
once
again
revealing
his
ignorance
of
the
wizarding
world
brought
up
by
the
Dursleys
there
were
many
things
that
wizards
took
for
granted
that
were
revelations
to
Harry
but
these
surprises
had
become
fewer
with
each
successive
year
now
however
he
could
tell
that
most
wizards
would
not
have
said
So
what
upon
finding
out
that
one
of
their
friends
had
a
giantess
for
a
mother
i'll
explain
inside
said
Ron
quietly
c'mon
fleur
and
Roger
Davies
had
disappeared
probably
into
a
more
private
clump
of
bushes
harry
and
Ron
returned
to
the
Great
Hall
parvati
and
Padma
were
now
sitting
at
a
distant
table
with
a
whole
crowd
of
Beauxbatons
boys
and
Hermione
was
once
more
dancing
with
Krum
harry
and
Ron
sat
down
at
a
table
far
removed
from
the
dance
floor
so
harry
prompted
Ron
what's
the
problem
with
giants
well
they're
they're
ron
struggled
for
words
not
very
nice
he
finished
lamely
who
cares
harry
said
there's
nothing
wrong
with
Hagrid
i
know
there
isn't
but
blimey
no
wonder
he
keeps
it
quiet
Ron
said
shaking
his
head
i
always
thought
he'd
got
in
the
way
of
a
bad
Engorgement
Charm
when
he
was
a
kid
or
something
didn't
like
to
mention
it
but
what's
it
matter
if
his
mother
was
a
giantess
said
Harry
well
no
one
who
knows
him
will
care
cos
they'll
know
he's
not
dangerous
said
Ron
slowly
but
harry
they're
just
vicious
giants
it's
like
Hagrid
said
it's
in
their
natures
they're
like
trolls
they
just
like
killing
everyone
knows
that
there
aren't
any
left
in
Britain
now
though
what
happened
to
them
well
they
were
dying
out
anyway
and
then
loads
got
themselves
killed
by
Aurors
there're
supposed
to
be
giants
abroad
though
they
hide
out
in
mountains
mostly
i
don't
know
who
Maxime
thinks
she's
kidding
Harry
said
watching
Madame
Maxime
sitting
alone
at
the
judges
table
looking
very
somber
if
hagrid's
half
giant
she
definitely
is
big
bones
the
only
thing
that's
got
bigger
bones
than
her
is
a
dinosaur
harry
and
Ron
spent
the
rest
of
the
ball
discussing
giants
in
their
corner
neither
of
them
having
any
inclination
to
dance
harry
tried
not
to
watch
Cho
and
Cedric
too
much
it
gave
him
a
strong
desire
to
kick
something
when
the
Weird
Sisters
finished
playing
at
midnight
everyone
gave
them
a
last
loud
round
of
applause
and
started
to
wend
their
way
into
the
entrance
hall
many
people
were
expressing
the
wish
that
the
ball
could
have
gone
on
longer
but
Harry
was
perfectly
happy
to
be
going
to
bed
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
the
evening
hadn't
been
much
fun
out
in
the
entrance
hall
Harry
and
Ron
saw
Hermione
saying
good
night
to
Krum
before
he
went
back
to
the
Durmstrang
ship
she
gave
Ron
a
very
cold
look
and
swept
past
him
up
the
marble
staircase
without
speaking
harry
and
Ron
followed
her
but
halfway
up
the
staircase
Harry
heard
someone
calling
him
heyHarry
it
was
Cedric
Diggory
harry
could
see
Cho
waiting
for
him
in
the
entrance
hall
below
yeah
said
Harry
coldly
as
Cedric
ran
up
the
stairs
toward
him
cedric
looked
as
though
he
didn't
want
to
say
whatever
it
was
in
front
of
Ron
who
shrugged
looking
badtempered
and
continued
to
climb
the
stairs
listen
cedric
lowered
his
voice
as
Ron
disappeared
i
owe
you
one
for
telling
me
about
the
dragons
you
know
that
golden
egg
does
yours
wail
when
you
open
it
yeah
said
Harry
well
take
a
bath
okay
what
take
a
bath
and
er
take
the
egg
with
you
and
er
just
mull
things
over
in
the
hot
water
it'll
help
you
think
trust
me
harry
stared
at
him
tell
you
what
Cedric
said
use
the
prefects
bathroom
fourth
door
to
the
left
of
that
statue
of
Boris
the
Bewildered
on
the
fifth
floor
password's
pine
fresh
gotta
go
want
to
say
good
night
he
grinned
at
Harry
again
and
hurried
back
down
the
stairs
to
Cho
harry
walked
back
to
Gryffindor
Tower
alone
that
had
been
extremely
strange
advice
why
would
a
bath
help
him
to
work
out
what
the
wailing
egg
meant
was
Cedric
pulling
his
leg
was
he
trying
to
make
Harry
look
like
a
fool
so
Cho
would
like
him
even
more
by
comparison
the
Fat
Lady
and
her
friend
Vi
were
snoozing
in
the
picture
over
the
portrait
hole
harry
had
to
yell
Fairy
lights
before
he
woke
them
up
and
when
he
did
they
were
extremely
irritated
he
climbed
into
the
common
room
and
found
Ron
and
Hermione
having
a
blazing
row
standing
ten
feet
apart
they
were
bellowing
at
each
other
each
scarlet
in
the
face
well
if
you
don't
like
it
you
know
what
the
solution
is
don't
you
yelled
Hermione
her
hair
was
coming
down
out
of
its
elegant
bun
now
and
her
face
was
screwed
up
in
anger
oh
yeah
ron
yelled
back
what's
that
next
time
there's
a
ball
ask
me
before
someone
else
does
and
not
as
a
last
resort
ron
mouthed
soundlessly
like
a
goldfish
out
of
water
as
Hermione
turned
on
her
heel
and
stormed
up
the
girls
staircase
to
bed
ron
turned
to
look
at
Harry
well
he
sputtered
looking
thunderstruck
well
that
just
proves
completely
missed
the
point
harry
didn't
say
anything
he
liked
being
back
on
speaking
terms
with
Ron
too
much
to
speak
his
mind
right
now
but
he
somehow
thought
that
Hermione
had
gotten
the
point
much
better
than
Ron
had
chapter
twentyfour
rita
skeeter's
scoop
everybody
got
up
late
on
Boxing
Day
the
Gryffindor
common
room
was
much
quieter
than
it
had
been
lately
many
yawns
punctuating
the
lazy
conversations
hermione's
hair
was
bushy
again
she
confessed
to
Harry
that
she
had
used
liberal
amounts
of
sleekeazy's
Hair
Potion
on
it
for
the
ball
but
it's
way
too
much
bother
to
do
every
day
she
said
matteroffactly
scratching
a
purring
Crookshanks
behind
the
ears
ron
and
Hermione
seemed
to
have
reached
an
unspoken
agreement
not
to
discuss
their
argument
they
were
being
quite
friendly
to
each
other
though
oddly
formal
ron
and
Harry
wasted
no
time
in
telling
Hermione
about
the
conversation
they
had
overheard
between
Madame
Maxime
and
Hagrid
but
Hermione
didn't
seem
to
find
the
news
that
Hagrid
was
a
halfgiant
nearly
as
shocking
as
Ron
did
well
I
thought
he
must
be
she
said
shrugging
i
knew
he
couldn't
be
pure
giant
because
they're
about
twenty
feet
tall
but
honestly
all
this
hysteria
about
giants
they
can't
all
be
horrible
it's
the
same
sort
of
prejudice
that
people
have
toward
werewolves
it's
just
bigotry
isn't
it
ron
looked
as
though
he
would
have
liked
to
reply
scathingly
but
perhaps
he
didn't
want
another
row
because
he
contented
himself
with
shaking
his
head
disbelievingly
while
Hermione
wasn't
looking
it
was
time
now
to
think
of
the
homework
they
had
neglected
during
the
first
week
of
the
holidays
everybody
seemed
to
be
feeling
rather
flat
now
that
Christmas
was
over
everybody
except
Harry
that
is
who
was
starting
once
again
to
feel
slightly
nervous
the
trouble
was
that
February
the
twentyfourth
looked
a
lot
closer
from
this
side
of
Christmas
and
he
still
hadn't
done
anything
about
working
out
the
clue
inside
the
golden
egg
he
therefore
started
taking
the
egg
out
of
his
trunk
every
time
he
went
up
to
the
dormitory
opening
it
and
listening
intently
hoping
that
this
time
it
would
make
some
sense
he
strained
to
think
what
the
sound
reminded
him
of
apart
from
thirty
musical
saws
but
he
had
never
heard
anything
else
like
it
he
closed
the
egg
shook
it
vigorously
and
opened
it
again
to
see
if
the
sound
had
changed
but
it
hadn't
he
tried
asking
the
egg
questions
shouting
over
all
the
wailing
but
nothing
happened
he
even
threw
the
egg
across
the
room
though
he
hadn't
really
expected
that
to
help
harry
had
not
forgotten
the
hint
that
Cedric
had
given
him
but
his
lessthan
friendly
feelings
toward
Cedric
just
now
meant
that
he
was
keen
not
to
take
his
help
if
he
could
avoid
it
in
any
case
it
seemed
to
him
that
if
Cedric
had
really
wanted
to
give
Harry
a
hand
he
would
have
been
a
lot
more
explicit
he
Harry
had
told
Cedric
exactly
what
was
coming
in
the
first
task
and
cedric's
idea
of
a
fair
exchange
had
been
to
tell
Harry
to
take
a
bath
well
he
didn't
need
that
sort
of
rubbishy
help
not
from
someone
who
kept
walking
down
corridors
hand
in
hand
with
Cho
anyway
and
so
the
first
day
of
the
new
term
arrived
and
Harry
set
off
to
lessons
weighed
down
with
books
parchment
and
quills
as
usual
but
also
with
the
lurking
worry
of
the
egg
heavy
in
his
stomach
as
though
he
were
carrying
that
around
with
him
too
snow
was
still
thick
upon
the
grounds
and
the
greenhouse
windows
were
covered
in
condensation
so
thick
that
they
couldn't
see
out
of
them
in
Herbology
nobody
was
looking
forward
to
Care
of
Magical
Creatures
much
in
this
weather
though
as
Ron
said
the
skrewts
would
probably
warm
them
up
nicely
either
by
chasing
them
or
blasting
off
so
forcefully
that
hagrid's
cabin
would
catch
fire
when
they
arrived
at
Hagrid
s
cabin
however
they
found
an
elderly
witch
with
closely
cropped
gray
hair
and
a
very
prominent
chin
standing
before
his
front
door
hurry
up
now
the
bell
rang
five
minutes
ago
she
barked
at
them
as
they
struggled
toward
her
through
the
snow
who're
you
said
Ron
staring
at
her
wheres
Hagrid
my
name
is
Professor
GrubblyPlank
she
said
briskly
i
am
your
temporary
Care
of
Magical
Creatures
teacher
where's
Hagrid
harry
repeated
loudly
he
is
indisposed
said
Professor
GrubblyPlank
shortly
soft
and
unpleasant
laughter
reached
Harrys
ears
he
turned
Draco
Malfoy
and
the
rest
of
the
Slytherins
were
joining
the
class
all
of
them
looked
gleeful
and
none
of
them
looked
surprised
to
see
Professor
GrubblyPlank
this
way
please
said
Professor
GrubblyPlank
and
she
strode
off
around
the
paddock
where
the
Beauxbatons
horses
were
shivering
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
followed
her
looking
back
over
their
shoulders
at
hagrid's
cabin
all
the
curtains
were
closed
was
Hagrid
in
there
alone
and
ill
what's
wrong
with
Hagrid
harry
said
hurrying
to
catch
up
with
Professor
GrubblyPlank
never
you
mind
she
said
as
though
she
thought
he
was
being
nosy
i
do
mind
though
said
Harry
hotly
what's
up
with
him
professor
GrubblyPlank
acted
as
though
she
couldn't
hear
him
she
led
them
past
the
paddock
where
the
huge
Beauxbatons
horses
were
standing
huddled
against
the
cold
and
toward
a
tree
on
the
edge
of
the
forest
where
a
large
and
beautiful
unicorn
was
tethered
many
of
the
girls
ooooohed
at
the
sight
of
the
unicorn
oh
it's
so
beautiful
whispered
Lavender
Brown
how
did
she
get
it
they're
supposed
to
be
really
hard
to
catch
the
unicorn
was
so
brightly
white
it
made
the
snow
all
around
look
gray
it
was
pawing
the
ground
nervously
with
its
golden
hooves
and
throwing
back
its
horned
head
boys
keep
back
barked
Professor
GrubblyPlank
throwing
out
an
arm
and
catching
Harry
hard
in
the
chest
they
prefer
the
woman's
touch
unicorns
girls
to
the
front
and
approach
with
care
come
on
easy
does
it
she
and
the
girls
walked
slowly
forward
toward
the
unicorn
leaving
the
boys
standing
near
the
paddock
fence
watching
the
moment
Professor
GrubblyPlank
was
out
of
earshot
harry
turned
to
Ron
what
d'you
reckons
wrong
with
him
you
don't
think
a
skrewt
oh
he
hasn't
been
attacked
Potter
if
that's
what
you're
thinking
said
Malfoy
softly
no
he's
just
too
ashamed
to
show
his
big
ugly
face
what
d'you
mean
said
Harry
sharply
malfoy
put
his
hand
inside
the
pocket
of
his
robes
and
pulled
out
a
folded
page
of
newsprint
there
you
go
he
said
hate
to
break
it
to
you
potter
he
smirked
as
Harry
snatched
the
page
unfolded
it
and
read
it
with
Ron
Seamus
Dean
and
Neville
looking
over
his
shoulder
it
was
an
article
topped
with
a
picture
of
Hagrid
looking
extremely
shifty
dumbledore's
giant
mistake
Albus
Dumbledore
eccentric
Headmaster
of
Hogwarts
School
of
Witchcraft
and
Wizardry
has
never
been
afraid
to
make
controversial
staff
appointments
writes
Rita
Skeeter
Special
Correspondent
in
September
of
this
year
he
hired
Alastor
MadEye
Moody
the
notoriously
jinxhappy
exAuror
to
teach
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
a
decision
that
caused
many
raised
eyebrows
at
the
Ministry
of
Magic
given
moody's
wellknown
habit
of
attacking
anybody
who
makes
a
sudden
movement
in
his
presence
madEye

however
looks
responsible
and
kindly

set
beside
the
parthuman

Care

Magical
Creatures
rubeus
Hagrid
who
admits
to
being
expelled
from
Hogwarts
in
his
third
year
has
enjoyed
the
position
of
gamekeeper
at
the
school
ever
since
a
job
secured
for
him
by
Dumbledore
last
year
however
Hagrid
used
his
mysterious
influence
over
the
headmaster
to
secure
the
additional
post
of
Care
of
Magical
Creatures
teacher
over
the
heads
of
many
betterqualified
candidates
an
alarmingly
large
and
ferociouslooking
man
Hagrid
has
been
using
his
newfound
authority
to
terrify
the
students
in
his
care
with
a
succession
of
horrific
creatures
while
Dumbledore
turns
a
blind
eye
Hagrid
has
maimed
several
pupils
during
a
series
of
lessons
that
many
admit
to
being
very
frightening
i
was
attacked
by
a
hippogriff
and
my
friend
Vincent
Crabbe
got
a
bad
bite
off
a
flobberworm
says
Draco
Malfoy
a
fourthyear
student
we
all
hate
Hagrid
but
we're
just
too
scared
to
say
anything
hagrid
has
no
intention
of
ceasing
his
campaign
of
intimidation
however
in
conversation
with
a
Daily
Prophet
reporter
last
month
he
admitted
breeding
creatures
he
has
dubbed
BlastEnded
Skrewts
highly
dangerous
crosses
between
manticores
and
firecrabs
the
creation
of
new
breeds
of
magical
creature
is
of
course
an
activity
usually
closely
observed
by
the
Department
for
the
Regulation
and
Control
of
Magical
Creatures
hagrid
however
considers
himself
to
be
above
such
petty
restrictions
i
was
just
having
some
fun
he
says
before
hastily
changing
the
subject
as
if
this
were
not
enough
the
Daily
Prophet
has
now
unearthed
evidence
that
Hagrid
is
not
as
he
has
always
pretended
a
pureblood
wizard
he
is
not
in
fact
even
pure
human
his
mother
we
can
exclusively
reveal
is
none
other
than
the
giantess
Fridwulfa
whose
whereabouts
are
currently
unknown
bloodthirsty
and
brutal
the
giants
brought
themselves
to
the
point
of
extinction
by
warring
amongst
themselves
during
the
last
century
the
handful
that
remained
joined
the
ranks
of
HeWhoMustNotBeNamed
and
were
responsible
for
some
of
the
worst
mass
Muggle
killings
of
his
reign
of
terror
while
many
of
the
giants
who
served
HeWhoMustNotBeNamed
were
killed
by
Aurors
working
against
the
Dark
Side
Fridwulfa
was
not
among
them
it
is
possible
she
escaped
to
one
of
the
giant
communities
still
existing
in
foreign
mountain
ranges
if
his
antics
during
Care
of
Magical
Creatures
lessons
are
any
guide
however
fridwulfa's
son
appears
to
have
inherited
her
brutal
nature
in
a
bizarre
twist
Hagrid
is
reputed
to
have
developed
a
close
friendship
with
the
boy
who
brought
around
youknowwho's
fall
from
power
thereby
driving
hagrid's
own
mother
like
the
rest
of
youknowwho's
supporters
into
hiding
perhaps
Harry
Potter
is
unaware
of
the
unpleasant
truth
about
his
large
friend
but
Albus
Dumbledore
surely
has
a
duty
to
ensure
that
Harry
Potter
along
with
his
fellow
students
is
warned
about
the
dangers
of
associating
with
partgiants
harry
finished
reading
and
looked
up
at
Ron
whose
mouth
was
hanging
open
how
did
she
find
out
he
whispered
but
that
wasn't
what
was
bothering
Harry
what
d'you
mean
we
all
hate
Hagrid
harry
spat
at
Malfoy
what's
this
rubbish
about
him
he
pointed
at
Crabbe
getting
a
bad
bite
off
a
flobberworm
they
haven't
even
got
teeth
crabbe
was
sniggering
apparently
very
pleased
with
himself
well
I
think
this
should
put
an
end
to
the
oaf's
teaching
career
said
Malfoy
his
eyes
glinting
halfgiant
and
there
was
me
thinking
he'd
just
swallowed
a
bottle
of
SkeleGro
when
he
was
young
none
of
the
mummies
and
daddies
are
going
to
like
this
at
all
they'll
be
worried
he'll
eat
their
kids
ha
ha
you
are
you
paying
attention
over
there
professor
GrubblyPlanks
voice
carried
over
to
the
boys
the
girls
were
all
clustered
around
the
unicorn
now
stroking
it
harry
was
so
angry
that
the
Daily
Prophet
article
shook
in
his
hands
as
he
turned
to
stare
unseeingly
at
the
unicorn
whose
many
magical
properties
Professor
GrubblyPlank
was
now
enumerating
in
a
loud
voice
so
that
the
boys
could
hear
too
i
hope
she
stays
that
woman
said
Parvati
Patil
when
the
lesson
had
ended
and
they
were
all
heading
back
to
the
castle
for
lunch
that's
more
what
I
thought
Care
of
Magical
Creatures
would
be
like
proper
creatures
like
unicorns
not
monsters
what
about
Hagrid
harry
said
angrily
as
they
went
up
the
steps
what
about
him
said
Parvati
in
a
hard
voice
he
can
still
be
gamekeeper
can't
he
parvati
had
been
very
cool
toward
Harry
since
the
ball
he
supposed
that
he
ought
to
have
paid
her
a
bit
more
attention
but
she
seemed
to
have
had
a
good
time
all
the
same
she
was
certainly
telling
anybody
who
would
listen
that
she
had
made
arrangements
to
meet
the
boy
from
Beauxbatons
in
Hogsmeade
on
the
next
weekend
trip
that
was
a
really
good
lesson
said
Hermione
as
they
entered
the
Great
Hall
i
didn't
know
half
the
things
Professor
GrubblyPlank
told
us
about
uni
look
at
this
harry
snarled
and
he
shoved
the
Daily
Prophet
article
under
hermione's
nose
hermione's
mouth
fell
open
as
she
read
her
reaction
was
exactly
the
same
as
ron's
how
did
that
horrible
Skeeter
woman
find
out
you
don't
think
Hagrid
told
her
no
said
Harry
leading
the
way
over
to
the
Gryffindor
table
and
throwing
himself
into
a
chair
furious
he
never
even
told
us
did
he
i
reckon
she
was
so
mad
he
wouldn't
give
her
loads
of
horrible
stuff
about
me
she
went
ferreting
around
to
get
him
back
maybe
she
heard
him
telling
Madame
Maxime
at
the
ball
said
Hermione
quietly
we'd
have
seen
her
in
the
garden
said
Ron
anyway
she's
not
supposed
to
come
into
school
anymore
Hagrid
said
Dumbledore
banned
her
maybe
she's
got
an
Invisibility
Cloak
said
Harry
ladling
chicken
casserole
onto
his
plate
and
splashing
it
everywhere
in
his
anger
sort
of
thing
she'd
do
isn't
it
hide
in
bushes
listening
to
people
like
you
and
Ron
did
you
mean
said
Hermione
we
weren't
trying
to
hear
him
said
Ron
indignantly
we
didn't
have
any
choice
the
stupid
prat
talking
about
his
giantess
mother
where
anyone
could
have
heard
him
we've
got
to
go
and
see
him
said
Harry
this
evening
after
Divination
tell
him
we
want
him
back
you
do
want
him
back
he
shot
at
Hermione
i
well
i'm
not
going
to
pretend
it
didn't
make
a
nice
change
having
a
proper
Care
of
Magical
Creatures
lesson
for
once
but
I
do
want
Hagrid
back
of
course
I
do
hermione
added
hastily
quailing
under
harry's
furious
stare
so
that
evening
after
dinner
the
three
of
them
left
the
castle
once
more
and
went
down
through
the
frozen
grounds
to
hagrid's
cabin
they
knocked
and
fang's
booming
barks
answered
hagrid
it's
us
harry
shouted
pounding
on
the
door
open
up
hagrid
didn't
answer
they
could
hear
Fang
scratching
at
the
door
whining
but
it
didn't
open
they
hammered
on
it
for
ten
more
minutes
Ron
even
went
and
banged
on
one
of
the
windows
but
there
was
no
response
what's
he
avoiding
us
for
hermione
said
when
they
had
finally
given
up
and
were
walking
back
to
the
school
he
surely
doesn't
think
we'd
care
about
him
being
halfgiant
but
it
seemed
that
Hagrid
did
care
they
didn't
see
a
sign
of
him
all
week
he
didn't
appear
at
the
staff
table
at
mealtimes
they
didn't
see
him
going
about
his
gamekeeper
duties
on
the
grounds
and
Professor
GrubblyPlank
continued
to
take
the
Care
of
Magical
Creatures
classes
malfoy
was
gloating
at
every
possible
opportunity
missing
your
halfbreed
pal
he
kept
whispering
to
Harry
whenever
there
was
a
teacher
around
so
that
he
was
safe
from
harry's
retaliation
missing
the
elephant
man
there
was
a
Hogsmeade
visit
halfway
through
January
hermione
was
very
surprised
that
Harry
was
going
to
go
i
just
thought
you'd
want
to
take
advantage
of
the
common
room
being
quiet
she
said
really
get
to
work
on
that
egg
oh
I
I
reckon
i've
got
a
pretty
good
idea
what
it's
about
now
Harry
lied
have
you
really
said
Hermione
looking
impressed
well
done
harrys
insides
gave
a
guilty
squirm
but
he
ignored
them
he
still
had
five
weeks
to
work
out
that
egg
clue
after
all
and
that
was
ages
whereas
if
he
went
into
Hogsmeade
he
might
run
into
Hagrid
and
get
a
chance
to
persuade
him
to
come
back
he
Ron
and
Hermione
left
the
castle
together
on
Saturday
and
set
off
through
the
cold
wet
grounds
toward
the
gates
as
they
passed
the
Durmstrang
ship
moored
in
the
lake
they
saw
Viktor
Krum
emerge
onto
the
deck
dressed
in
nothing
but
swimming
trunks
he
was
very
skinny
indeed
but
apparently
a
lot
tougher
than
he
looked
because
he
climbed
up
onto
the
side
of
the
ship
stretched
out
his
arms
and
dived
right
into
the
lake
he's
mad
said
Harry
staring
at
Krums
dark
head
as
it
bobbed
out
into
the
middle
of
the
lake
it
must
be
freezing
it's
January
it's
a
lot
colder
where
he
comes
from
said
Hermione
i
suppose
it
feels
quite
warm
to
him
yeah
but
there's
still
the
giant
squid
said
Ron
he
didn't
sound
anxious
if
anything
he
sounded
hopeful
hermione
noticed
his
tone
of
voice
and
frowned
he's
really
nice
you
know
she
said
he's
not
at
all
like
you'd
think
coming
from
Durmstrang
he
likes
it
much
better
here
he
told
me
ron
said
nothing
he
hadn't
mentioned
Viktor
Krum
since
the
ball
but
Harry
had
found
a
miniature
arm
under
his
bed
on
Boxing
Day
which
had
looked
very
much
as
though
it
had
been
snapped
off
a
small
model
figure
wearing
Bulgarian
Quidditch
robes
harry
kept
his
eyes
skinned
for
a
sign
of
Hagrid
all
the
way
down
the
slushy
High
Street
and
suggested
a
visit
to
the
Three
Broomsticks
once
he
had
ascertained
that
Hagrid
was
not
in
any
of
the
shops
the
pub
was
as
crowded
as
ever
but
one
quick
look
around
at
all
the
tables
told
Harry
that
Hagrid
wasn't
there
heart
sinking
he
went
up
to
the
bar
with
Ron
and
Hermione
ordered
three
butterbeers
from
Madam
Rosmerta
and
thought
gloomily
that
he
might
just
as
well
have
stayed
behind
and
listened
to
the
egg
wailing
after
all
doesn't
he
ever
go
into
the
office
hermione
whispered
suddenly
look
she
pointed
into
the
mirror
behind
the
bar
and
Harry
saw
Ludo
Bagman
reflected
there
sitting
in
a
shadowy
corner
with
a
bunch
of
goblins
bagman
was
talking
very
fast
in
a
low
voice
to
the
goblins
all
of
whom
had
their
arms
crossed
and
were
looking
rather
menacing
it
was
indeed
odd
harry
thought
that
Bagman
was
here
at
the
Three
Broomsticks
on
a
weekend
when
there
was
no
Triwizard
event
and
therefore
no
judging
to
be
done
he
watched
Bagman
in
the
mirror
he
was
looking
strained
again
quite
as
strained
as
he
had
that
night
in
the
forest
before
the
Dark
Mark
had
appeared
but
just
then
Bagman
glanced
over
at
the
bar
saw
Harry
and
stood
up
in
a
moment
in
a
moment
harry
heard
him
say
brusquely
to
the
goblins
and
Bagman
hurried
through
the
pub
toward
Harry
his
boyish
grin
back
in
place
harry
he
said
how
are
you
been
hoping
to
run
into
you
everything
going
all
right
fine
thanks
said
Harry
wonder
if
I
could
have
a
quick
private
word
Harry
said
Bagman
eagerly
you
couldn't
give
us
a
moment
you
two
could
you
er
okay
said
Ron
and
he
and
Hermione
went
off
to
find
a
table
bagman
led
Harry
along
the
bar
to
the
end
furthest
from
Madam
Rosmerta
well
I
just
thought
i'd
congratulate
you
again
on
your
splendid
performance
against
that
Horntail
Harry
said
Bagman
really
superb
thanks
said
Harry
but
he
knew
this
couldn't
be
all
that
Bagman
wanted
to
say
because
he
could
have
congratulated
Harry
in
front
of
Ron
and
Hermione
bagman
didn't
seem
in
any
particular
rush
to
spill
the
beans
though
harry
saw
him
glance
into
the
mirror
over
the
bar
at
the
goblins
who
were
all
watching
him
and
Harry
in
silence
through
their
dark
slanting
eyes
absolute
nightmare
said
Bagman
to
Harry
in
an
undertone
noticing
Harry
watching
the
goblins
too
their
English
isn't
too
good
it's
like
being
back
with
all
the
Bulgarians
at
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
but
at
least
they
used
sign
language
another
human
could
recognize
this
lot
keep
gabbling
in
Gobblede
gook
and
I
only
know
one
word
of
Gobbledegook
bladvak
it
means
pickax
i
don't
like
to
use
it
in
case
they
think
i'm
threatening
them
he
gave
a
short
booming
laugh
what
do
they
want
harry
said
noticing
how
the
goblins
were
still
watching
Bagman
very
closely
er
well
said
Bagman
looking
suddenly
nervous
they
er
they're
looking
for
Barty
Crouch
why
are
they
looking
for
him
here
said
Harry
he's
at
the
Ministry
in
London
isn't
he
er
as
a
matter
of
fact
i've
no
idea
where
he
is
said
Bagman
he's
sort
of
stopped
coming
to
work
been
absent
for
a
couple
of
weeks
now
young
Percy
his
assistant
says
he's
ill
apparently
he's
just
been
sending
instructions
in
by
owl
but
would
you
mind
not
mentioning
that
to
anyone
harry
because
Rita
skeeter's
still
poking
around
everywhere
she
can
and
i'm
willing
to
bet
she'd
work
up
Bartys
illness
into
something
sinister
probably
say
he's
gone
missing
like
Bertha
Jorkins
have
you
heard
anything
about
Bertha
Jorkins
harry
asked
no
said
Bagman
looking
strained
again
i've
got
people
looking
of
course
About
time
thought
Harry
and
it's
all
very
strange
she
definitely
arrived
in
Albania
because
she
met
her
second
cousin
there
and
then
she
left
the
cousin's
house
to
go
south
and
see
an
aunt
and
she
seems
to
have
vanished
without
trace
en
route
blowed
if
I
can
see
where
she's
got
to
she
doesn't
seem
the
type
to
elope
for
instance
but
still
what
are
we
doing
talking
about
goblins
and
Bertha
Jorkins
i
really
wanted
to
ask
you
he
lowered
his
voice
how
are
you
getting
on
with
your
golden
egg
er
not
bad
Harry
said
untruthfully
bagman
seemed
to
know
he
wasn't
being
honest
listen
Harry
he
said
still
in
a
very
low
voice
I
feel
very
bad
about
all
this
you
were
thrown
into
this
tournament
you
didn't
volunteer
for
it
and
if
his
voice
was
so
quiet
now
Harry
had
to
lean
closer
to
listen
if
I
can
help
at
all
a
prod
in
the
right
direction
i've
taken
a
liking
to
you
the
way
you
got
past
that
dragon
well
just
say
the
word
harry
stared
up
into
bagman's
round
rosy
face
and
his
wide
babyblue
eyes
we're
supposed
to
work
out
the
clues
alone
aren't
we
he
said
careful
to
keep
his
voice
casual
and
not
sound
as
though
he
was
accusing
the
head
of
the
Department
of
Magical
Games
and
Sports
of
breaking
the
rules
well
well
yes
said
Bagman
impatiently
but
come
on
harry
we
all
want
a
Hogwarts
victory
don't
we
have
you
offered
Cedric
help
harry
said
the
smallest
of
frowns
creased
bagman's
smooth
face
no
I
haven't
he
said
i
well
like
I
say
i've
taken
a
liking
to
you
just
thought
i'd
offer
well
thanks
said
Harry
but
I
think
i'm
nearly
there
with
the
egg
couple
more
days
should
crack
it
he
wasn't
entirely
sure
why
he
was
refusing
bagman's
help
except
that
Bagman
was
almost
a
stranger
to
him
and
accepting
his
assistance
would
feel
somehow
much
more
like
cheating
than
asking
advice
from
Ron
Hermione
or
Sirius
bagman
looked
almost
affronted
but
couldn't
say
much
more
as
Fred
and
George
turned
up
at
that
point
hello
mr.
Bagman
said
Fred
brightly
can
we
buy
you
a
drink
er
no
said
Bagman
with
a
last
disappointed
glance
at
Harry
no
thank
you
boys
fred
and
George
looked
quite
as
disappointed
as
Bagman
who
was
surveying
Harry
as
though
he
had
let
him
down
badly
well
I
must
dash
he
said
nice
seeing
you
all
good
luck
Harry
he
hurried
out
of
the
pub
the
goblins
all
slid
off
their
chairs
and
exited
after
him
harry
went
to
rejoin
Ron
and
Hermione
what
did
he
want
ron
said
the
moment
Harry
had
sat
down
he
offered
to
help
me
with
the
golden
egg
said
Harry
he
shouldn't
be
doing
that
said
Hermione
looking
very
shocked
he's
one
of
the
judges
and
anyway
you've
already
worked
it
out
haven't
you
er
nearly
said
Harry
well
I
don't
think
Dumbledore
would
like
it
if
he
knew
Bagman
was
trying
to
persuade
you
to
cheat
said
Hermione
still
looking
deeply
disapproving
i
hope
he's
trying
to
help
Cedric
as
much
he's
not
I
asked
said
Harry
who
cares
if
Diggorys
getting
help
said
Ron
harry
privately
agreed
those
goblins
didn't
look
very
friendly
said
Hermione
sipping
her
butterbeer
what
were
they
doing
here
looking
for
Crouch
according
to
Bagman
said
Harry
he's
still
ill
hasn't
been
into
work
maybe
Percys
poisoning
him
said
Ron
probably
thinks
if
Crouch
snuffs
it
he'll
be
made
head
of
the
Department
of
International
Magical
Cooperation
hermione
gave
Ron
a
don'tjokeaboutthingslikethat
look
and
said
Funny
goblins
looking
for
mr.
Crouch
they'd
normally
deal
with
the
Department
for
the
Regulation
and
Control
of
Magical
Creatures
crouch
can
speak
loads
of
different
languages
though
said
Harry
maybe
they
need
an
interpreter
worrying
about
poor
ickle
goblins
now
are
you
ron
asked
Hermione
thinking
of
starting
up
S
p.u.g.
or
something
society
for
the
Protection
of
Ugly
Goblins
ha
ha
ha
said
Hermione
sarcastically
goblins
don't
need
protection
haven't
you
been
listening
to
what
Professor
Binns
has
been
telling
us
about
goblin
rebellions
no
said
Harry
and
Ron
together
well
there
quite
capable
of
dealing
with
wizards
said
Hermione
taking
another
sip
of
butterbeer
they're
very
clever
they're
not
like
houseelves
who
never
stick
up
for
themselves
uhoh
said
Ron
staring
at
the
door
rita
Skeeter
had
just
entered
she
was
wearing
bananayellow
robes
today
her
long
nails
were
painted
shocking
pink
and
she
was
accompanied
by
her
paunchy
photographer
she
bought
drinks
and
she
and
the
photographer
made
their
way
through
the
crowds
to
a
table
nearby
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
glaring
at
her
as
she
approached
she
was
talking
fast
and
looking
very
satisfied
about
something
didn't
seem
very
keen
to
talk
to
us
did
he
Bozo
now
why
would
that
be
do
you
think
and
what's
he
doing
with
a
pack
of
goblins
in
tow
anyway
showing
them
the
sights
what
nonsense
he
was
always
a
bad
liar
reckon
something's
up
think
we
should
do
a
bit
of
digging
disgraced
ExHead
of
Magical
Games
and
Sports
Ludo
Bagman
snappy
start
to
a
sentence
Bozo
we
just
need
to
find
a
story
to
fit
it
trying
to
ruin
someone
else's
life
said
Harry
loudly
a
few
people
looked
around
rita
skeeter's
eyes
widened
behind
her
jeweled
spectacles
as
she
saw
who
had
spoken
harry
she
said
beaming
how
lovely
why
don't
you
come
and
join
i
wouldn't
come
near
you
with
a
tenfoot
broomstick
said
Harry
furiously
what
did
you
do
that
to
Hagrid
for
eh
rita
Skeeter
raised
her
heavily
penciled
eyebrows
our
readers
have
a
right
to
the
truth
Harry
i
am
merely
doing
my
who
cares
if
he's
halfgiant
harry
shouted
there's
nothing
wrong
with
him
the
whole
pub
had
gone
very
quiet
madam
Rosmerta
was
staring
over
from
behind
the
bar
apparently
oblivious
to
the
fact
that
the
flagon
she
was
filling
with
mead
was
overflowing
rita
Skeeters
smile
flickered
very
slightly
but
she
hitched
it
back
almost
at
once
she
snapped
open
her
crocodileskin
handbag
pulled
out
her
QuickQuotes
Quill
and
said
How
about
giving
me
an
interview
about
the
Hagrid
you
know
harry
the
man
behind
the
muscles
your
unlikely
friendship
and
the
reasons
behind
it
would
you
call
him
a
father
substitute
hermione
stood
up
very
abruptly
her
butterbeer
clutched
in
her
hand
as
though
it
were
a
grenade
you
horrible
woman
she
said
through
gritted
teeth
you
don't
care
do
you
anything
for
a
story
and
anyone
will
do
wont
they
even
Ludo
Bagman
sit
down
you
silly
little
girl
and
don't
talk
about
things
you
don't
understand
said
Rita
Skeeter
coldly
her
eyes
hardening
as
they
fell
on
Hermione
i
know
things
about
Ludo
Bagman
that
would
make
your
hair
curl
not
that
it
needs
it
she
added
eyeing
hermione's
bushy
hair
let's
go
said
Hermione
c'mon
harry
Ron
they
left
many
people
were
staring
at
them
as
they
went
harry
glanced
back
as
they
reached
the
door
rita
skeeter's
QuickQuotes
Quill
was
out
it
was
zooming
backward
and
forward
over
a
piece
of
parchment
on
the
table
she'll
be
after
you
next
Hermione
said
Ron
in
a
low
and
worried
voice
as
they
walked
quickly
back
up
the
street
let
her
try
said
Hermione
defiantly
she
was
shaking
with
rage
i'll
show
her
silly
little
girl
am
I
oh
i'll
get
her
back
for
this
first
Harry
then
Hagrid
you
don't
want
to
go
upsetting
Rita
Skeeter
said
Ron
nervously
i'm
serious
Hermione
she'll
dig
up
something
on
you
my
parents
don't
read
the
Daily
Prophet
she
can't
scare
me
into
hiding
said
Hermione
now
striding
along
so
fast
that
it
was
all
Harry
and
Ron
could
do
to
keep
up
with
her
the
last
time
Harry
had
seen
Hermione
in
a
rage
like
this
she
had
hit
Draco
Malfoy
around
the
face
and
Hagrid
isn't
hiding
anymore
he
should
never
have
let
that
excuse
for
a
human
being
upset
him
come
on
breaking
into
a
run
she
led
them
all
the
way
back
up
the
road
through
the
gates
flanked
by
winged
boars
and
up
through
the
grounds
to
hagrid's
cabin
the
curtains
were
still
drawn
and
they
could
hear
Fang
barking
as
they
approached
hagrid
hermione
shouted
pounding
on
his
front
door
hagrid
that's
enough
we
know
you're
in
there
nobody
cares
if
your
mum
was
a
giantess
Hagrid
you
can't
let
that
foul
Skeeter
woman
do
this
to
you
hagrid
get
out
here
you're
just
being
the
door
opened
hermione
said
About
t
and
then
stopped
very
suddenly
because
she
had
found
herself
facetoface
not
with
Hagrid
but
with
Albus
Dumbledore
good
afternoon
he
said
pleasantly
smiling
down
at
them
weerwe
wanted
to
see
Hagrid
said
Hermione
in
a
rather
small
voice
yes
I
surmised
as
much
said
Dumbledore
his
eyes
twinkling
why
don't
you
come
in
oh
um
okay
said
Hermione
she
Ron
and
Harry
went
into
the
cabin
Fang
launched
himself
upon
Harry
the
moment
he
entered
barking
madly
and
trying
to
lick
his
ears
harry
fended
off
Fang
and
looked
around
hagrid
was
sitting
at
his
table
where
there
were
two
large
mugs
of
tea
he
looked
a
real
mess
his
face
was
blotchy
his
eyes
swollen
and
he
had
gone
to
the
other
extreme
where
his
hair
was
concerned
far
from
trying
to
make
it
behave
it
now
looked
like
a
wig
of
tangled
wire
hi
Hagrid
said
Harry
hagrid
looked
up
lo
he
said
in
a
very
hoarse
voice
more
tea
I
think
said
Dumbledore
closing
the
door
behind
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
drawing
out
his
wand
and
twiddling
it
a
revolving
tea
tray
appeared
in
midair
along
with
a
plate
of
cakes
dumbledore
magicked
the
tray
onto
the
table
and
everybody
sat
down
there
was
a
slight
pause
and
then
Dumbledore
said
Did
you
by
any
chance
hear
what
Miss
Granger
was
shouting
Hagrid
hermione
went
slightly
pink
but
Dumbledore
smiled
at
her
and
continued
Hermione
Harry
and
Ron
still
seem
to
want
to
know
you
judging
by
the
way
they
were
attempting
to
break
down
the
door
of
course
we
still
want
to
know
you
harry
said
staring
at
Hagrid
you
don't
think
anything
that
Skeeter
cow
sorry
Professor
he
added
quickly
looking
at
Dumbledore
i
have
gone
temporarily
deaf
and
haven't
any
idea
what
you
said
harry
said
Dumbledore
twiddling
his
thumbs
and
staring
at
the
ceiling
erright
said
Harry
sheepishly
i
just
meantHagrid
how
could
you
think
we'd
care
what
thatwomanwrote
about
you
two
fat
tears
leaked
out
of
hagrid's
beetleblack
eyes
and
fell
slowly
into
his
tangled
beard
living
proof
of
what
i've
been
telling
you
Hagrid
said
Dumbledore
still
looking
carefully
up
at
the
ceiling
i
have
shown
you
the
letters
from
the
countless
parents
who
remember
you
from
their
own
days
here
telling
me
in
no
uncertain
terms
that
if
I
sacked
you
they
would
have
something
to
say
about
it
not
all
of
em
said
Hagrid
hoarsely
not
all
of
em
wan
me
ter
stay
really
Hagrid
if
you
are
holding
out
for
universal
popularity
i'm
afraid
you
will
be
in
this
cabin
for
a
very
long
time
said
Dumbledore
now
peering
sternly
over
his
halfmoon
spectacles
not
a
week
has
passed
since
I
became
headmaster
of
this
school
when
I
haven't
had
at
least
one
owl
complaining
about
the
way
I
run
it
but
what
should
I
do
barricade
myself
in
my
study
and
refuse
to
talk
to
anybody
yeh
yeh're
not
halfgiant
said
Hagrid
croakily
hagrid
look
what
i've

Dursleys

Professor
Dumbledore
my
own
brother
Aberforth
was
prosecuted
for
practicing
inappropriate
charms
on
a
goat
it
was
all
over
the
papers
but
did
Aberforth
hide
no
he
did
not
he
held
his
head
high
and
went
about
his
business
as
usual
of
course
i'm
not
entirely
sure
he
can
read
so
that
may
not
have
been
bravery

hagrid
gulped
more
tears
leaked
out
down
his
cheeks
and
into
his
tangled
beard
dumbledore
stood
up
i
refuse
to
accept
your
resignation
Hagrid
and
I

Great
Hall

all
dumbledore
left
the
cabin
pausing
only
to
scratch
Fangs
ears
when
the
door
had
shut
behind
him
Hagrid
began
to
sob
into
his
dustbinlidsized
hands
hermione
kept
patting
his
arm
and
at
last
Hagrid
looked
up
his
eyes
very
red
indeed
and
said
Great

more
tears
leaked
out
but
he
wiped
them
away
more
forcefully
and
said
Never

picture
of
my
old
dad

I
here
hagrid
got
up
went
over
to
his
dresser
opened
a
drawer
and
pulled
out
a
picture
of
a
short
wizard
with
hagrid's
crinkled
black
eyes
beaming
as
he
sat
on
top
of
hagrid's
shoulder
hagrid
was
a
good
seven
or
eight
feet
tall
judging
by
the
apple
tree
beside
him
but
his
face
was
beardless
young
round
and
smooth
he
looked
hardly
older
than
eleven
tha
was
taken
jus
after
I
got
inter
Hogwarts
Hagrid
croaked

respectable
but
some
don

harry
Ron
and
Hermione
looked
at
one
another
nervously
Harry
would
rather
have
taken
fifty
BlastEnded
Skrewts
for
a
walk
than
admit
to
Hagrid
that
he
had
overheard
him
talking
to
Madame
Maxime
but
Hagrid
was
still
talking
apparently
unaware
that
he
had
said
anything
odd
yeh
know
wha
Harry
he
said
looking
up
from
the
photograph
of
his
father
his
eyes
very
bright
when
I
firs
met
you
you
reminded
me
o
me
a
bit
mum

Dad

feelin
like

at
Hogwarts
remember
not
sure
yeh
were
really
up
to
it
an
now
look
at
yeh
Harry
school
champion
he
looked
at
Harry
for
a
moment
and
then
said
very
seriously
Yeh

what
i'd
love
harry
i'd
love
yeh
ter
win
I
really
would
it'd
show
em
all

yeh

the
one
who's
got
it
righ
lettin
anyone

as
long
as
they
can
do
magic
how
you
doin
with
that
egg
Harry
great
said
Harry
really
great
hagrid's
miserable
face
broke
into
a
wide
watery
smile
tha's
my
boy
you
show
em
Harry
you
show
em
beat
em
all
lying
to
Hagrid
wasn't
quite
like
lying
to
anyone
else
harry
went
back
to
the
castle
later
that
afternoon
with
Ron
and
Hermione
unable
to
banish
the
image
of
the
happy
expression
on
hagrid's
whiskery
face
as
he
had
imagined
Harry
winning
the
tournament
the
incomprehensible
egg
weighed
more
heavily
than
ever
on
Harrys
conscience
that
evening
and
by
the
time
he
had
got
into
bed
he
had
made
up
his
mind
it
was
time
to
shelve
his
pride
and
see
if
cedric's
hint
was
worth
anything
chapter
twentyfive
the
egg
and
the
eye
harry
had
no
idea
how
long
a
bath
he
would
need
to
work
out
the
secret
of
the
golden
egg
he
decided
to
do
it
at
night
when
he
would
be
able
to
take
as
much
time
as
he
wanted
reluctant
though
he
was
to
accept
more
favors
from
Cedric
he
also
decided
to
use
the
prefects
bathroom
far
fewer
people
were
allowed
in
there
so
it
was
much
less
likely
that
he
would
be
disturbed
harry
planned
his
excursion
carefully
because
he
had
been
caught
out
of
bed
and
outofbounds
by
Filch
the
caretaker
in
the
middle
of
the
night
once
before
and
had
no
desire
to
repeat
the
experience
the
Invisibility
Cloak
would
of
course
be
essential
and
as
an
added
precaution
Harry
thought
he
would
take
the
Marauders
Map
which
next
to
the
cloak
was
the
most
useful
aid
to
rulebreaking
Harry
owned
the
map
showed
the
whole
of
Hogwarts
including
its
many
shortcuts
and
secret
passageways
and
most
important
of
all
it
revealed
the
people
inside
the
castle
as
minuscule
labeled
dots
moving
around
the
corridors
so
that
Harry
would
be
forewarned
if
somebody
was
approaching
the
bathroom
on
Thursday
night
Harry
sneaked
up
to
bed
put
on
the
cloak
crept
back
downstairs
and
just
as
he
had
done
on
the
night
when
Hagrid
had
shown
him
the
dragons
waited
for
the
portrait
hole
to
open
this
time
it
was
Ron
who
waited
outside
to
give
the
Fat
Lady
the
password
banana
fritters
Good
luck
Ron
muttered
climbing
into
the
room
as
Harry
crept
out
past
him
it
was
awkward
moving
under
the
cloak
tonight
because
Harry
had
the
heavy
egg
under
one
arm
and
the
map
held
in
front
of
his
nose
with
the
other
however
the
moonlit
corridors
were
empty
and
silent
and
by
checking
the
map
at
strategic
intervals
Harry
was
able
to
ensure
that
he
wouldn't
run
into
anyone
he
wanted
to
avoid
when
he
reached
the
statue
of
Boris
the
Bewildered
a
lostlooking
wizard
with
his
gloves
on
the
wrong
hands
he
located
the
right
door
leaned
close
to
it
and
muttered
the
password
Pine
fresh
just
as
Cedric
had
told
him
the
door
creaked
open
harry
slipped
inside
bolted
the
door
behind
him
and
pulled
off
the
Invisibility
Cloak
looking
around
his
immediate
reaction
was
that
it
would
be
worth
becoming
a
prefect
just
to
be
able
to
use
this
bathroom
it
was
softly
lit
by
a
splendid
candlefilled
chandelier
and
everything
was
made
of
white
marble
including
what
looked
like
an
empty
rectangular
swimming
pool
sunk
into
the
middle
of
the
floor
about
a
hundred
golden
taps
stood
all
around
the
pools
edges
each
with
a
differently
colored
Jewel
set
into
its
handle
there
was
also
a
diving
board
long
white
linen
curtains
hung
at
the
windows
a
large
pile
of
fluffy
white
towels
sat
in
a
corner
and
there
was
a
single
goldenframed
painting
on
the
wall
it
featured
a
blonde
mermaid
who
was
fast
asleep
on
a
rock
her
long
hair
over
her
face
it
fluttered
every
time
she
snored
harry
moved
forward
looking
around
his
footsteps
echoing
off
the
walls
magnificent
though
the
bathroom
was
and
quite
keen
though
he
was
to
try
out
a
few
of
those
taps
now
he
was
here
he
couldn't
quite
suppress
the
feeling
that
Cedric
might
have
been
having
him
on
how
on
earth
was
this
supposed
to
help
solve
the
mystery
of
the
egg
nevertheless
he
put
one
of
the
Huffy
towels
the
cloak
the
map
and
the
egg
at
the
side
of
the
swimmingpoolsized
bath
then
knelt
down
and
turned
on
a
few
of
the
taps
he
could
tell
at
once
that
they
carried
different
sorts
of
bubble
bath
mixed
with
the
water
though
it
wasn't
bubble
bath
as
Harry
had
ever
experienced
it
one
tap
gushed
pink
and
blue
bubbles
the
size
of
footballs
another
poured
icewhite
foam
so
thick
that
Harry
thought
it
would
have
supported
his
weight
if
he'd
cared
to
test
it
a
third
sent
heavily
perfumed
purple
clouds
hovering
over
the
surface
of
the
water
harry
amused
himself
for
awhile
turning
the
taps
on
and
off
particularly
enjoying
the
effect
of
one
whose
jet
bounced
off
the
surface
of
the
water
in
large
arcs
then
when
the
deep
pool
was
full
of
hot
water
foam
and
bubbles
which
took
a
very
short
time
considering
its
size
Harry
turned
off
all
the
taps
pulled
off
his
pajamas
slippers
and
dressing
gown
and
slid
into
the
water
it
was
so
deep
that
his
feet
barely
touched
the
bottom
and
he
actually
did
a
couple
of
lengths
before
swimming
back
to
the
side
and
treading
water
staring
at
the
egg
highly
enjoyable
though
it
was
to
swim
in
hot
and
foamy
water
with
clouds
of
differentcolored
steam
wafting
all
around
him
no
stroke
of
brilliance
came
to
him
no
sudden
burst
of
understanding
harry
stretched
out
his
arms
lifted
the
egg
in
his
wet
hands
and
opened
it
the
wailing
screeching
sound
filled
the
bathroom
echoing
and
reverberating
off
the
marble
walls
but
it
sounded
just
as
incomprehensible
as
ever
if
not
more
so
with
all
the
echoes
he
snapped
it
shut
again
worried
that
the
sound
would
attract
Filch
wondering
whether
that
hadn't
been
cedric's
plan
and
then
making
him
jump
so
badly
that
he
dropped
the
egg
which
clattered
away
across
the
bathroom
floor
someone
spoke
i'd
try
putting
it
in
the
water
if
I
were
you
harry
had
swallowed
a
considerable
amount
of
bubbles
in
shock
he
stood
up
sputtering
and
saw
the
ghost
of
a
very
glumlooking
girl
sitting
crosslegged
on
top
of
one
of
the
taps
it
was
Moaning
Myrtle
who
was
usually
to
be
heard
sobbing
in
the
Sbend
of
a
toilet
three
floors
below
myrtle
harry
said
in
outrage
i'm
i'm
not
wearing
anything
the
foam
was
so
dense
that
this
hardly
mattered
but
he
had
a
nasty
feeling
that
Myrtle
had
been
spying
on
him
from
out
of
one
of
the
taps
ever
since
he
had
arrived
i
closed
my
eyes
when
you
got
in
she
said
blinking
at
him
through
her
thick
spectacles
you
haven't
been
to
see
me
for
ages
yeah
well
said
Harry
bending
his
knees
slightly
just
to
make
absolutely
sure
Myrtle
couldn't
see
anything
but
his
head
i'm
not
supposed
to
come
into
your
bathroom
am
I
it's
a
girls
one
you
didn't
used
to
care
said
Myrtle
miserably
you
used
to
be
in
there
all
the
time
this
was
true
though
only
because
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
had
found
myrtle's
outoforder
toilets
a
convenient
place
to
brew
Polyjuice
Potion
in
secret
a
forbidden
potion
that
had
turned
him
and
Ron
into
living
replicas
of
Crabbe
and
Goyle
for
an
hour
so
that
they
could
sneak
into
the
Slytherin
common
room
i
got
told
off
for
going
in
there
said
Harry
which
was
halftrue
Percy
had
once
caught
him
coming
out
of
Myrtles
bathroom
i
thought
i'd
better
not
come
back
after
that
oh
i
see
said
Myrtle
picking
at
a
spot
on
her
chin
in
a
morose
sort
of
way
well
anyway
i'd
try
the
egg
in
the
water
that's
what
Cedric
Diggory
did
have
you
been
spying
on
him
too
said
Harry
indignantly
what
d'you
do
sneak
up
here
in
the
evenings
to
watch
the
prefects
take
baths
sometimes
said
Myrtle
rather
slyly
but
i've
never
come
out
to
speak
to
anyone
before
i'm
honored
said
Harry
darkly
you
keep
your
eyes
shut
he
made
sure
Myrtle
had
her
glasses
well
covered
before
hoisting
himself
out
of
the
bath
wrapping
the
towel
firmly
around
his
waist
and
going
to
retrieve
the
egg
once
he
was
back
in
the
water
Myrtle
peered
through
her
fingers
and
said
Go
on
then
open
it
under
the
water
harry
lowered
the
egg
beneath
the
foamy
surface
and
opened
it
and
this
time
it
did
not
wail
a
gurgling
song
was
coming
out
of
it
a
song
whose
words
he
couldnt
distinguish
through
the
water
you
need
to
put
your
head
under
too
said
Myrtle
who
seemed
to
be
thoroughly
enjoying
bossing
him
around
go
on
harry
took
a
great
breath
and
slid
under
the
surface
and
now
sitting
on
the
marble
bottom
of
the
bubblefilled
bath
he
heard
a
chorus
of
eerie
voices
singing
to
him
from
the
open
egg
in
his
hands
Come
seek
us
where
our
voices
sound
We
cannot
sing
above
the
ground
And
while
you
re
searching
ponder
this
wove
taken
what
you'll
sorely
miss
An
hour
long
you'll
have
to
look
And
to
recover
what
we
took
But
past
an
hour
the
prospect's
black
Too
late
it's
gone
it
wont
come
back
harry
let
himself
float
back
upward
and
broke
the
bubbly
surface
shaking
his
hair
out
of
his
eyes
hear
it
said
Myrtle
yeah
come
seek
us
where
our
voices
sound
and
if
I
need
persuading
hang
on
I
need
to
listen
again
he
sank
back
beneath
the
water
it
took
three
more
underwater
renditions
of
the
egg's
song
before
Harry
had
it
memorized
then
he
trod
water
for
a
while
thinking
hard
while
Myrtle
sat
and
watched
him
i've
got
to
go
and
look
for
people
who
can't
use
their
voices
above
the
ground
he
said
slowly
er
who
could
that
be
slow
aren't
you
he
had
never
seen
Moaning
Myrtle
so
cheerful
apart
from
the
day
when
a
dose
of
PolyJuice
Potion
had
given
Hermione
the
hairy
face
and
tail
of
a
cat
harry
stared
around
the
bathroom
thinking
if
the
voices
could
only
be
heard
underwater
then
it
made
sense
for
them
to
belong
to
underwater
creatures
he
ran
this
theory
past
Myrtle
who
smirked
at
him
well
thats
what
Diggory
thought
she
said
he
lay
there
talking
to
himself
for
ages
about
it
ages
and
ages
nearly
all
the
bubbles
had
gone
underwater
harry
said
slowly
myrtle
what
lives
in
the
lake
apart
from
the
giant
squid
oh
all
sorts
she
said
i
sometimes
go
down
there
sometimes
don't
have
any
choice
if
someone
flushes
my
toilet
when
i'm
not
expecting
it
trying
not
to
think
about
Moaning
Myrtle
zooming
down
a
pipe
to
the
lake
with
the
contents
of
a
toilet
harry
said
Well
does
anything
in
there
have
a
human
voice
hang
on
harry's
eyes
had
fallen
on
the
picture
of
the
snoozing
mermaid
on
the
wall
myrtle
there
aren't
merpeople
in
there
are
there
oooh
very
good
she
said
her
thick
glasses
twinkling
it
took
Diggory
much
longer
than
that
and
that
was
with
her
awake
too
Myrtle
jerked
her
head
toward
the
mermaid
with
an
expression
of
great
dislike
on
her
glum
face
giggling
and
showing
off
and
flashing
her
fins
thats
it
isn't
it
said
Harry
excitedly
the
second
tasks
to
go
and
find
the
merpeople
in
the
lake
and
and
but
he
suddenly
realized
what
he
was
saying
and
he
felt
the
excitement
drain
out
of
him
as
though
someone
had
just
pulled
a
plug
in
his
stomach
he
wasn't
a
very
good
swimmer
he'd
never
had
much
practice
dudley
had
had
lessons
in
his
youth
but
Aunt
Petunia
and
Uncle
Vernon
no
doubt
hoping
that
Harry
would
drown
one
day
hadn't
bothered
to
give
him
any
a
couple
of
lengths
of
this
bath
were
all
very
well
but
that
lake
was
very
large
and
very
deep
and
merpeople
would
surely
live
right
at
the
bottom
myrtle
Harry
said
slowly
how
am
I
supposed
to
breathe
at
this
myrtle's
eyes
filled
with
sudden
tears
again
tactless
she
muttered
groping
in
her
robes
for
a
handkerchief
what's
tactless
said
Harry
bewildered
talking
about
breathing
in
front
of
me
she
said
shrilly
and
her
voice
echoed
loudly
around
the
bathroom
when
I
can't
when
I
haven't
not
for
ages
she
buried
her
face
in
her
handkerchief
and
sniffed
loudly
harry
remembered
how
touchy
Myrtle
had
always
been
about
being
dead
but
none
of
the
other
ghosts
he
knew
made
such
a
fuss
about
it
sorry
he
said
impatiently
i
didn't
mean
I
just
forgot
oh
yes
very
easy
to
forget
myrtle's
dead
said
Myrtle
gulping
looking
at
him
out
of
swollen
eyes
nobody
missed
me
even
when
I
was
alive
took
them
hours
and
hours
to
find
my
body
I
know
I
was
sitting
there
waiting
for
them
olive
Hornby
came
into
the
bathroom
Are
you
in
here
again
sulking
Myrtle
she
said
because
Professor
Dippet
asked
me
to
look
for
you
And
then
she
saw
my
body
ooooh
she
didn't
forget
it
until
her
dying
day
I
made
sure
of
that
followed
her
around
and
reminded
her
I
did
i
remember
at
her
brother's
wedding
but
Harry
wasn't
listening
he
was
thinking
about
the
merpeople's
song
again
we've
taken
what
you
ii
sorely
miss
that
sounded
as
though
they
were
going
to
steal
something
of
his
something
he
had
to
get
back
what
were
they
going
to
take
and
then
of
course
she
went
to
the
Ministry
of
Magic
to
stop
me
stalking
her
so
I
had
to
come
back
here
and
live
in
my
toilet
good
said
Harry
vaguely
well
i'm
a
lot
further
on
than
I
was
shut
your
eyes
again
will
you
i'm
getting
out
he
retrieved
the
egg
from
the
bottom
of
the
bath
climbed
out
dried
himself
and
pulled
on
his
pajamas
and
dressing
gown
again
will
you
come
and
visit
me
in
my
bathroom
again
sometime
moaning
Myrtle
asked
mournfully
as
Harry
picked
up
the
Invisibility
Cloak
er
i'll
try
Harry
said
though
privately
thinking
the
only
way
he'd
be
visiting
myrtle's
bathroom
again
was
if
every
other
toilet
in
the
castle
got
blocked
see
you
myrtle
thanks
for
your
help
bye
bye
she
said
gloomily
and
as
Harry
put
on
the
Invisibllity
Cloak
he
saw
her
zoom
back
up
the
tap
out
in
the
dark
corridor
Harry
examined
the
Marauders
Map
to
check
that
the
coast
was
still
clear
yes
the
dots
belonging
to
Filch
and
his
cat
Mrs
norris
were
safely
in
their
office
nothing
else
seemed
to
be
moving
apart
from
Peeves
though
he
was
bouncing
around
the
trophy
room
on
the
floor
above
harry
had
taken
his
first
step
back
toward
Gryffindor
Tower
when
something
else
on
the
map
caught
his
eye
something
distinctly
odd
peeves
was
not
the
only
thing
that
was
moving
a
single
dot
was
flitting
around
a
room
in
the
bottom
lefthand
corner
Snapes
office
but
the
dot
wasn't
labeled
Severus
Snape
it
was
Bartemius
Crouch
harry
stared
at
the
dot
mr.
Crouch
was
supposed
to
be
too
ill
to
go
to
work
or
to
come
to
the
Yule
Ball
so
what
was
he
doing
sneaking
into
Hogwarts
at
one
o'clock
in
the
morning
harry
watched
closely
as
the
dot
moved
around
and
around
the
room
pausing
here
and
there
harry
hesitated
thinking
and
then
his
curiosity
got
the
better
of
him
he
turned
and
set
off
in
the
opposite
direction
toward
the
nearest
staircase
he
was
going
to
see
what
Crouch
was
up
to
harry
walked
down
the
stairs
as
quietly
as
possible
though
the
faces
in
some
of
the
portraits
still
turned
curiously
at
the
squeak
of
a
floorboard
the
rustle
of
his
pajamas
he
crept
along
the
corridor
below
pushed
aside
a
tapestry
about
halfway
along
and
proceeded
down
a
narrower
staircase
a
shortcut
that
would
take
him
down
two
floors
he
kept
glancing
down
at
the
map
wondering
it
just
didn't
seem
in
character
somehow
for
correct
lawabiding
mr.
Crouch
to
be
sneaking
around
somebody
else's
office
this
late
at
night
and
then
halfway
down
the
staircase
not
thinking
about
what
he
was
doing
not
concentrating
on
anything
but
the
peculiar
behavior
of
mr.
Crouch
Harrys
leg
suddenly
sank
right
through
the
trick
step
Neville
always
forgot
to
jump
he
gave
an
ungainly
wobble
and
the
golden
egg
still
damp
from
the
bath
slipped
from
under
his
arm
he
lurched
forward
to
try
and
catch
it
but
too
late
the
egg
fell
down
the
long
staircase
with
a
bang
as
loud
as
a
bass
drum
on
every
step
the
Invisibility
Cloak
slipped
Harry
snatched
at
it
and
the
Marauder
s
Map
fluttered
out
of
his
hand
and
slid
down
six
stairs
where
sunk
in
the
step
to
above
his
knee
he
couldn't
reach
it
the
golden
egg
fell
through
the
tapestry
at
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
burst
open
and
began
wailing
loudly
in
the
corridor
below
harry
pulled
out
his
wand
and
struggled
to
touch
the
Marauder
s
Map
to
wipe
it
blank
but
it
was
too
far
away
to
reach
Pulling
the
cloak
back
over
himself
Harry
straightened
up
listening
hard
with
his
eyes
screwed
up
with
fear
and
almost
immediately
peeves
it
was
the
unmistakable
hunting
cry
of
Filch
the
caretaker
harry
could
hear
his
rapid
shuffling
footsteps
coming
nearer
and
nearer
his
wheezy
voice
raised
in
fury
what's
this
racket
wake
up
the
whole
castle
will
you
i'll
have
you
Peeves
i'll
have
you
you'll
and
what
is
this
filch's
footsteps
halted
there
was
a
clink
of
metal
on
metal
and
the
wailing
stopped
Filch
had
picked
up
the
egg
and
closed
it
harry
stood
very
still
one
leg
still
Jammed
tightly
in
the
magical
step
listening
any
moment
now
Filch
was
going
to
pull
aside
the
tapestry
expecting
to
see
Peeves
and
there
would
be
no
Peeves
but
if
he
came
up
the
stairs
he
would
spot
the
marauder's
Map
and
Invisibility
Cloak
or
not
the
map
would
show
Harry
Potter
standing
exactly
where
he
was
egg
filch
said
quietly
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
my
sweet
mrs
norris
was
obviously
with
him
This
is
a
Triwizard
clue
this
belongs
to
a
school
champion
harry
felt
sick
his
heart
was
hammering
very
fast
peeves
filch
roared
gleefully
you've
been
stealing
he
ripped
back
the
tapestry
below
and
Harry
saw
his
horrible
pouchy
face
and
bulging
pale
eyes
staring
up
the
dark
and
to
Filch
deserted
staircase
hiding
are
you
he
said
softly
i'm
coming
to
get
you
Peeves
you've
gone
and
stolen
a
Triwizard
clue
Peeves
dumbledore'll
have
you
out
of
here
for
this
you
filthy
pilfering
poltergeist
filch
started
to
climb
the
stairs
his
scrawny
dustcolored
cat
at
his
heels
mrs
morris's
lamplike
eyes
so
very
like
her
masters
were
fixed
directly
upon
Harry
he
had
had
occasion
before
now
to
wonder
whether
the
Invisibility
Cloak
worked
on
cats
sick
with
apprehension
he
watched
Filch
drawing
nearer
and
nearer
in
his
old
flannel
dressing
gown
he
tried
desperately
to
pull
his
trapped
leg
free
but
it
merely
sank
a
few
more
inches
any
second
now
Filch
was
going
to
spot
the
map
or
walk
right
into
him
filch
whats
going
on
filch
stopped
a
few
steps
below
Harry
and
turned
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
stood
the
only
person
who
could
make
harry's
situation
worse
Snape
he
was
wearing
a
long
gray
nightshirt
and
he
looked
livid
its
Peeves
Professor
Filch
whispered
malevolently
he
threw
this
egg
down
the
stairs
snape
climbed
up
the
stairs
quickly
and
stopped
beside
Filch
harry
gritted
his
teeth
convinced
his
loudly
thumping
heart
would
give
him
away
at
any
second
peeves
said
Snape
softly
staring
at
the
egg
in
filch's
hands
but
Peeves
couldn't
get
into
my
office
this
egg
was
in
your
office
professor
of
course
not
Snape
snapped
i
heard
banging
and
wailing
yes
Professor
that
was
the
egg
i
was
coming
to
investigate
peeves
threw
it
professor
and
when
I
passed
my
office
I
saw
that
the
torches
were
lit
and
a
cupboard
door
was
ajar
somebody
has
been
searching
it
but
Peeves
couldn't
i
know
he
couldn't
Filch
snape
snapped
again
i
seal
my
office
with
a
spell
none
but
a
wizard
could
break
snape
looked
up
the
stairs
straight
through
Harry
and
then
down
into
the
corridor
below
i
want
you
to
come
and
help
me
search
for
the
intruder
Filch
i
yes
Professor
but
filch
looked
yearningly
up
the
stairs
right
through
Harry
who
could
see
that
he
was
very
reluctant
to
forgo
the
chance
of
cornering
Peeves
go
Harry
pleaded
with
him
silently
go
with
Snape
go
mrs
norris
was
peering
around
filch's
legs
harry
had
the
distinct
impression
that
she
could
smell
him
why
had
he
filled
that
bath
with
so
much
perfumed
foam
the
thing
is
Professor
said
Filch
plaintively
the
headmaster
will
have
to
listen
to
me
this
time
peeves
has
been
stealing
from
a
student
it
might
be
my
chance
to
get
him
thrown
out
of
the
castle
once
and
for
all
filch
I
don't
give
a
damn
about
that
wretched
poltergeist
it's
my
office
that's
clunk
clunk
clunk
snape
stopped
talking
very
abruptly
he
and
Filch
both
looked
down
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
harry
saw
MadEye
Moody
limp
into
sight
through
the
narrow
gap
between
their
heads
moody
was
wearing
his
old
traveling
cloak
over
his
nightshirt
and
leaning
on
his
staff
as
usual
pajama
party
is
it
he
growled
up
the
stairs
professor
Snape
and
I
heard
noises
Professor
said
Filch
at
once
peeves
the
Poltergeist
throwing
things
around
as
usual
and
then
Professor
Snape
discovered
that
someone
had
broken
into
his
off
shut
up
snape
hissed
to
Filch
moody
took
a
step
closer
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
harry
saw
Moodys
magical
eye
travel
over
Snape
and
then
unmistakably
onto
himself
harrys
heart
gave
a
horrible
jolt
moody
could
see
through
Invisibility
Cloaks
he
alone
could
see
the
full
strangeness
of
the
scene
Snape
in
his
nightshirt
Filch
clutching
the
egg
and
he
Harry
trapped
in
the
stairs
behind
them
moody's
lopsided
gash
of
a
mouth
opened
in
surprise
for
a
few
seconds
he
and
Harry
stared
straight
into
each
other's
eyes
then
Moody
closed
his
mouth
and
turned
his
blue
eye
upon
Snape
again
did
I
hear
that
correctly
Snape
he
asked
slowly
someone
broke
into
your
office
it
is
unimportant
said
Snape
coldly
on
the
contrary
growled
Moody
it
is
very
important
who'd
want
to
break
into
your
office
a
student
I
daresay
said
Snape
harry
could
see
a
vein
flickering
horribly
on
snape's
greasy
temple
it
has
happened
before
potion
ingredients
have
gone
missing
from
my
private
store
cupboard
students
attempting
illicit
mixtures
no
doubt
reckon
they
were
after
potion
ingredients
eh
said
Moody
not
hiding
anything
else
in
your
office
are
you
harry
saw
the
edge
of
Snapes
sallow
face
turn
a
nasty
brick
color
the
vein
in
his
temple
pulsing
more
rapidly
you
know
i'm
hiding
nothing
Moody
he
said
in
a
soft
and
dangerous
voice
as
you've
searched
my
office
pretty
thoroughly
yourself
moodys
face
twisted
into
a
smile
auror's
privilege
Snape
dumbledore
told
me
to
keep
an
eye
dumbledore
happens
to
trust
me
said
Snape
through
clenched
teeth
i
refuse
to
believe
that
he
gave
you
orders
to
search
my
office
course
Dumbledore
trusts
you
growled
Moody
hes
a
trusting
man
isn't
he
believes
in
second
chances
but
me
I
say
there
are
spots
that
don't
come
off
Snape
spots
that
never
come
off
d'you
know
what
I
mean
snape
suddenly
did
something
very
strange
he
seized
his
left
forearm
convulsively
with
his
right
hand
as
though
something
on
it
had
hurt
him
moody
laughed
get
back
to
bed
Snape
you
don't
have
the
authority
to
send
me
anywhere
snape
hissed
letting
go
of
his
arm
as
though
angry
with
himself
i
have
as
much
right
to
prowl
this
school
after
dark
as
you
do
prowl
away
said
Moody
but
his
voice
was
full
of
menace
i
look
forward
to
meeting
you
in
a
dark
corridor
some
time
you've
dropped
something
by
the
way
with
a
stab
of
horror
harry
saw
Moody
point
at
the
Marauders
Map
still
lying
on
the
staircase
six
steps
below
him
as
Snape
and
Filch
both
turned
to
look
at
it
Harry
threw
caution
to
the
winds
he
raised
his
arms
under
the
cloak
and
waved
furiously
at
Moody
to
attract
his
attention
mouthing
it's
mine
mine
snape
had
reached
out
for
it
a
horrible
expression
of
dawning
comprehension
on
his
face
Accio
Parchment
the
map
flew
up
into
the
air
slipped
through
Snapes
outstretched
fingers
and
soared
down
the
stairs
into
Moodys
hand
my
mistake
Moody
said
calmly
it's
mine
must've
dropped
it
earlier
but
snape's
black
eyes
were
darting
from
the
egg
in
filch's
arms
to
the
map
in
Moodys
hand
and
Harry
could
tell
he
was
putting
two
and
two
together
as
only
Snape
could
potter
he
said
quietly
what's
that
said
Moody
calmly
folding
up
the
map
and
pocketing
it
potter
snape
snarled
and
he
actually
turned
his
head
and
stared
right
at
the
place
where
Harry
was
as
though
he
could
suddenly
see
him
that
egg
is
Potters
egg
that
piece
of
parchment
belongs
to
Potter
i
have
seen
it
before
I
recognize
it
potter
is
here
potter
in
his
Invisibility
Cloak
snape
stretched
out
his
hands
like
a
blind
man
and
began
to
move
up
the
stairs
Harry
could
have
sworn
his
overlarge
nostrils
were
dilating
trying
to
sniff
Harry
out
trapped
harry
leaned
backward
trying
to
avoid
Snapes
fingertips
but
any
moment
now
there's
nothing
there
Snape
barked
Moody
but
i'll
be
happy
to
tell
the
headmaster
how
quickly
your
mind
jumped
to
Harry
Potter
meaning
what
snape
turned
again
to
look
at
Moody
his
hands
still
outstretched
inches
from
harry's
chest
meaning
that
dumbledore's
very
interested
to
know
who's
got
it
in
for
that
boy
said
Moody
limping
nearer
still
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
so
am
I
Snape
very
interested
the
torchlight
flickered
across
his
mangled
face
so
that
the
scars
and
the
chunk
missing
from
his
nose
looked
deeper
and
darker
than
ever
snape
was
looking
down
at
Moody
and
Harry
couldn't
see
the
expression
on
his
face
for
a
moment
nobody
moved
or
said
anything
then
Snape
slowly
lowered
his
hands
i
merely
thought
said
Snape
in
a
voice
of
forced
calm
that
if
Potter
was
wandering
around
after
hours
again
it's
an
unfortunate
habit
of
his
he
should
be
stopped
for
for
his
own
safety
ah
I
see
said
Moody
softly
got
potter's
best
interests
at
heart
have
you
there
was
a
pause
snape
and
Moody
were
still
staring
at
each
other
Mrs
norris
gave
a
loud
meow
still
peering
around
filch's
legs
looking
for
the
source
of
harry's
bubblebath
smell
i
think
I
will
go
back
to
bed
Snape
said
curtly
best
idea
you've
had
all
night
said
Moody
now
Filch
if
you'll
just
give
me
that
egg
no
said
Filch
clutching
the
egg
as
though
it
were
his
firstborn
son
professor
Moody
this
is
evidence
of
Peeves
treachery
it's
the
property
of
the
champion
he
stole
it
from
said
Moody
hand
it
over
now
snape
swept
downstairs
and
passed
Moody
without
another
word
filch
made
a
chirruping
noise
to
Mrs
norris
who
stared
blankly
at
Harry
for
a
few
more
seconds
before
turning
and
following
her
master
still
breathing
very
fast
harry
heard
Snape
walking
away
down
the
corridor
Filch
handed
Moody
the
egg
and
disappeared
from
view
too
muttering
to
Mrs
norris
never
mind
my
sweet
we'll
see
Dumbledore
in
the
morning
tell
him
what
Peeves
was
up
to
a
door
slammed
harry
was
left
staring
down
at
Moody
who
placed
his
staff
on
the
bottommost
stair
and
started
to
climb
laboriously
toward
him
a
dull
clunk
on
every
other
step
close
shave
potter
he
muttered
yeah
i
er
thanks
said
Harry
weakly
what
is
this
thing
said
Moody
drawing
the
marauder's
Map
out
of
his
pocket
and
unfolding
it
map
of
Hogwarts
said
Harry
hoping
Moody
was
going
to
pull
him
out
of
the
staircase
soon
his
leg
was
really
hurting
him
merlins
beard
Moody
whispered
staring
at
the
map
his
magical
eye
going
haywire
this
this
is
some
map
potter
yeah
its
quite
useful
Harry
said
his
eyes
were
starting
to
water
from
the
pain
er
Professor
Moody
d'you
think
you
could
help
me
what
oh
yes
yes
of
course
moody
took
hold
of
Harrys
arms
and
pulled
Harrys
leg
came
free
of
the
trick
step
and
he
climbed
onto
the
one
above
it
moody
was
still
gazing
at
the
map
potter
he
said
slowly
you
didn't
happen
by
any
chance
to
see
who
broke
into
Snapes
office
did
you
on
this
map
I
mean
er
yeah
I
did
harry
admitted
it
was
mr.
Crouch
moodys
magical
eye
whizzed
over
the
entire
surface
of
the
map
he
looked
suddenly
alarmed
crouch
he
said
you're
you're
sure
potter
positive
said
Harry
well
he's
not
here
anymore
said
Moody
his
eye
still
whizzing
over
the
map
crouch
that's
very
very
interesting
he
said
nothing
for
almost
a
minute
still
staring
at
the
map
harry
could
tell
that
this
news
meant
something
to
Moody
and
very
much
wanted
to
know
what
it
was
he
wondered
whether
he
dared
ask
moody
scared
him
slightly
yet
Moody
had
just
helped
him
avoid
an
awful
lot
of
trouble
er
professor
Moody
why
d'you
reckon
mr.
Crouch
wanted
to
look
around
Snapes
office
moodys
magical
eye
left
the
map
and
fixed
quivering
upon
Harry
it
was
a
penetrating
glare
and
Harry
had
the
impression
that
Moody
was
sizing
him
up
wondering
whether
to
answer
or
not
or
how
much
to
tell
him
put
it
this
way
potter
Moody
muttered
finally
they
say
old
madeye's
obsessed
with
catching
Dark
wizards
but
i'm
nothing
nothing
compared
to
Barty
Crouch
he
continued
to
stare
at
the
map
harry
was
burning
to
know
more
professor
Moody
he
said
again
d'you
think
could
this
have
anything
to
do
with
maybe
mr.
Crouch
thinks
there's
something
going
on
like
what
said
Moody
sharply
harry
wondered
how
much
he
dare
say
he
didn't
want
Moody
to
guess
that
he
had
a
source
of
information
outside
Hogwarts
that
might
lead
to
tricky
questions
about
Sirius
i
don't
know
Harry
muttered
odd
stuffs
been
happening
lately
hasn't
it
it's
been
in
the
Daily
Prophet
the
Dark
Mark
at
the
World
Cup
and
the
Death
Eaters
and
everything
both
of
moody's
mismatched
eyes
widened
you're
a
sharp
boy
potter
he
said
his
magical
eye
roved
back
to
the
marauder's
Map
crouch
could
be
thinking
along
those
lines
he
said
slowly
very
possible
there
have
been
some
funny
rumors
flying
around
lately
helped
along
by
Rita
Skeeter
of
course
it's
making
a
lot
of
people
nervous
I
reckon
a
grim
smile
twisted
his
lopsided
mouth
oh
if
there's
one
thing
I
hate
he
muttered
more
to
himself
than
to
Harry
and
his
magical
eye
was
fixed
on
the
lefthand
corner
of
the
map
its
a
Death
Eater
who
walked
free
harry
stared
at
him
could
Moody
possibly
mean
what
Harry
thought
he
meant
and
now
I
want
to
ask
you
a
question
potter
said
Moody
in
a
more
businesslike
tone
harrys
heart
sank
he
had
thought
this
was
coming
moody
was
going
to
ask
where
he
had
got
this
map
which
was
a
very
dubious
magical
object
and
the
story
of
how
it
had
fallen
into
his
hands
incriminated
not
only
him
but
his
own
father
Fred
and
George
Weasley
and
Professor
Lupin
their
last
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
teacher
moody
waved
the
map
in
front
of
Harry
who
braced
himself
Can
I
borrow
this
oh
said
Harry
he
was
very
fond
of
his
map
but
on
the
other
hand
he
was
extremely
relieved
that
Moody
wasn't
asking
where
he'd
got
it
and
there
was
no
doubt
that
he
owed
Moody
a
favor
yeah
okay
good
boy
growled
Moody
i
can
make
good
use
of
this
this
might
be
exactly
what
i've
been
looking
for
right
bed
Potter
come
on
now
they
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
stairs
together
Moody
still
examining
the
map
as
though
it
was
a
treasure
the
like
of
which
he
had
never
seen
before
they
walked
in
silence
to
the
door
of
moody's
office
where
he
stopped
and
looked
up
at
Harry
you
ever
thought
of
a
career
as
an
Auror
Potter
no
said
Harry
taken
aback
you
want
to
consider
it
said
Moody
nodding
and
looking
at
Harry
thoughtfully
yes
indeed
and
incidentally
i'm
guessing
you
werent
Just
taking
that
egg
for
a
walk
tonight
er
no
said
Harry
grinning
i've
been
working
out
the
clue
moody
winked
at
him
his
magical
eye
going
haywire
again
nothing
like
a
nighttime
stroll
to
give
you
ideas
Potter
see
you
in
the
morning
he
went
back
into
his
office
staring
down
at
the
Marauders
Map
again
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
harry
walked
slowly
back
to
Gryffindor
Tower
lost
in
thought
about
Snape
and
Crouch
and
what
it
all
meant
why
was
Crouch
pretending
to
be
ill
if
he
could
manage
to
get
to
Hogwarts
when
he
wanted
to
what
did
he
think
Snape
was
concealing
in
his
office
and
Moody
thought
he
harry
ought
to
be
an
Auror
interesting
idea
but
somehow
harry
thought
as
he
got
quietly
into
his
fourposter
ten
minutes
later
the
egg
and
the
cloak
now
safely
back
in
his
trunk
he
thought
he'd
like
to
check
how
scarred
the
rest
of
them
were
before
he
chose
it
as
a
career
chapter
twentysix
the
second
task
you
said
you'd
already
worked
out
that
egg
clue
said
Hermione
indignantly
keep
your
voice
down
said
Harry
crossly
i
just
need
to
sort
of
finetune
it
all
right
he
Ron
and
Hermione
were
sitting
at
the
very
back
of
the
Charms
class
with
a
table
to
themselves
they
were
supposed
to
be
practicing
the
opposite
of
the
Summoning
Charm
today
the
Banishing
Charm
owing
to
the
potential
for
nasty
accidents
when
objects
kept
flying
across
the
room
professor
Flitwick
had
given
each
student
a
stack
of
cushions
on
which
to
practice
the
theory
being
that
these
wouldn't
hurt
anyone
if
they
went
off
target
it
was
a
good
theory
but
it
wasn't
working
very
well
neville's
aim
was
so
poor
that
he
kept
accidentally
sending
much
heavier
things
flying
across
the
room
Professor
Flitwick
for
instance
just
forget
the
egg
for
a
minute
all
right
harry
hissed
as
Professor
Flitwick
went
whizzing
resignedly
past
them
landing
on
top
of
a
large
cabinet
i'm
trying
to
tell
you
about
Snape
and
Moody
this
class
was
an
ideal
cover
for
a
private
conversation
as
everyone
was
having
far
too
much
fun
to
pay
them
any
attention
harry
had
been
recounting
his
adventures
of
the
previous
night
in
whispered
installments
for
the
last
half
hour
snape
said
Moodys
searched
his
office
as
well
ron
whispered
his
eyes
alight
with
interest
as
he
Banished
a
cushion
with
a
sweep
of
his
wand
it
soared
into
the
air
and
knocked
parvati's
hat
off
what
d'you
reckon
moody's
here
to
keep
an
eye
on
Snape
as
well
as
Karkaroff
well
I
dunno
if
that's
what
Dumbledore
asked
him
to
do
but
he's
definitely
doing
it
said
Harry
waving
his
wand
without
paying
much
attention
so
that
his
cushion
did
an
odd
sort
of
belly
flop
off
the
desk
moody
said
Dumbledore
only
lets
Snape
stay
here
because
he's
giving
him
a
second
chance
or
something
what
said
Ron
his
eyes
widening
his
next
cushion
spinning
high
into
the
air
ricocheting
off
the
chandelier
and
dropping
heavily
onto
flitwick's
desk
harry
maybe
Moody
thinks
Snape
put
your
name
in
the
Goblet
of
Fire
oh
Ron
said
Hermione
shaking
her
head
sceptically
we
thought
Snape
was
trying
to
kill
Harry
before
and
it
turned
out
he
was
saving
harry's
life
remember
she
Banished
a
cushion
and
it
flew
across
the
room
and
landed
in
the
box
they
were
all
supposed
to
be
aiming
at
harry
looked
at
Hermione
thinking
it
was
true
that
Snape
had
saved
his
life
once
but
the
odd
thing
was
Snape
definitely
loathed
him
just
as
he'd
loathed
Harry
s
father
when
they
had
been
at
school
together
snape
loved
taking
points
from
Harry
and
had
certainly
never
missed
an
opportunity
to
give
him
punishments
or
even
to
suggest
that
he
should
be
suspended
from
the
school
i
don't
care
what
Moody
says
Hermione
went
on
dumbledore's
not
stupid
he
was
right
to
trust
Hagrid
and
Professor
Lupin
even
though
loads
of
people
wouldn't
have
given
them
jobs
so
why
shouldn't
he
be
right
about
Snape
even
if
Snape
is
a
bit
evil
said
Ron
promptly
come
on
Hermione
why
are
all
these
Dark
wizard
catchers
searching
his
office
then
why
has
mr.
Crouch
been
pretending
to
be
ill
said
Hermione
ignoring
Ron
its
a
bit
funny
isn't
it
that
he
cant
manage
to
come
to
the
Yule
Ball
but
he
can
get
up
here
in
the
middle
of
the
night
when
he
wants
to
you
just
don't
like
Crouch
because
of
that
elf
Winky
said
Ron
sending
a
cushion
soaring
into
the
window
you
just
want
to
think
Snapes
up
to
something
said
Hermione
sending
her
cushion
zooming
neatly
into
the
box
i
just
want
to
know
what
Snape
did
with
his
first
chance
if
he's
on
his
second
one
said
Harry
grimly
and
his
cushion
to
his
very
great
surprise
flew
straight
across
the
room
and
landed
neatly
on
top
of
hermione's
obedient
to
sirius's
wish
of
hearing
about
anything
odd
at
Hogwarts
Harry
sent
him
a
letter
by
brown
owl
that
night
explaining
all
about
mr.
Crouch
breaking
into
Snape
s
office
and
Moody
and
snape's
conversation
then
Harry
turned
his
attention
in
earnest
to
the
most
urgent
problem
facing
him
how
to
survive
underwater
for
an
hour
on
the
twentyfourth
of
February
ron
quite
liked
the
idea
of
using
the
Summoning
Charm
again
Harry
had
explained
about
AquaLungs
and
Ron
couldn't
see
why
Harry
shouldn't
Summon
one
from
the
nearest
Muggle
town
hermione
squashed
this
plan
by
pointing
out
that
in
the
unlikely
event
that
Harry
managed
to
learn
how
to
operate
an
Aqua
Lung
within
the
set
limit
of
an
hour
he
was
sure
to
be
disqualified
for
breaking
the
International
Code
of
Wizarding
Secrecy
it
was
too
much
to
hope
that
no
Muggles
would
spot
an
AquaLung
zooming
across
the
countryside
to
Hogwarts
of
course
the
ideal
solution
would
be
for
you
to
Transfigure
yourself
into
a
submarine
or
something
Hermione
said
if
only
we'd
done
human
Transfiguration
already
but
I
don't
think
we
start
that
until
sixth
year
and
it
can
go
badly
wrong
if
you
don't
know
what
you're
doing
yeah
I
don't
fancy
walking
around
with
a
periscope
sticking
out
of
my
head
said
Harry
i
s'pose
I
could
always
attack
someone
in
front
of
Moody
he
might
do
it
for
me
i
don't
think
he'd
let
you
choose
what
you
wanted
to
be
turned
into
though
said
Hermione
seriously
no
I
think
your
best
chance
is
some
sort
of
charm
so
Harry
thinking
that
he
would
soon
have
had
enough
of
the
library
to
last
him
a
lifetime
buried
himself
once
more
among
the
dusty
volumes
looking
for
any
spell
that
might
enable
a
human
to
survive
without
oxygen
however
though
he
Ron
and
Hermione
searched
through
their
lunchtimes
evenings
and
whole
weekends
though
Harry
asked
Professor
McGonagall
for
a
note
of
permission
to
use
the
Restricted
Section
and
even
asked
the
irritable
vulturelike
librarian
madam
Pince
for
help
they
found
nothing
whatsoever
that
would
enable
Harry
to
spend
an
hour
underwater
and
live
to
tell
the
tale
familiar
flutterings
of
panic
were
starting
to
disturb
Harry
now
and
he
was
finding
it
difficult
to
concentrate
in
class
again
the
lake
which
Harry
had
always
taken
for
granted
as
just
another
feature
of
the
grounds
drew
his
eyes
whenever
he
was
near
a
classroom
window
a
great
irongray
mass
of
chilly
water
whose
dark
and
icy
depths
were
starting
to
seem
as
distant
as
the
moon
just
as
it
had
before
he
faced
the
Horntail
time
was
slipping
away
as
though
somebody
had
bewitched
the
clocks
to
go
extrafast
there
was
a
week
to
go
before
February
the
twentyfourth
there
was
still
time
there
were
five
days
to
go
he
was
bound
to
find
something
soon
three
days
to
go
please
let
me
find
something
please
with
two
days
left
harry
started
to
go
off
food
again
the
only
good
thing
about
breakfast
on
Monday
was
the
return
of
the
brown
owl
he
had
sent
to
Sirius
he
pulled
off
the
parchment
unrolled
it
and
saw
the
shortest
letter
Sirius
had
ever
written
to
him
send
date
of
next
Hogsmeade
weekend
by
return
owl
harry
turned
the
parchment
over
and
looked
at
the
back
hoping
to
see
something
else
but
it
was
blank
weekend
after
next
whispered
Hermione
who
had
read
the
note
over
Harrys
shoulder
here
take
my
quill
and
send
this
owl
back
straight
away
harry
scribbled
the
dates
down
on
the
back
of
sirius's
letter
tied
it
onto
the
brown
owl's
leg
and
watched
it
take
flight
again
what
had
he
expected
advice
on
how
to
survive
underwater
he
had
been
so
intent
on
telling
Sirius
all
about
Snape
and
Moody
he
had
completely
forgotten
to
mention
the
eggs
clue
what's
he
want
to
know
about
the
next
Hogsmeade
weekend
for
said
Ron
dunno
said
Harry
dully
the
momentary
happiness
that
had
flared
inside
him
at
the
sight
of
the
owl
had
died
come
on
care
of
Magical
Creatures
whether
Hagrid
was
trying
to
make
up
for
the
BlastEnded
Skrewts
or
because
there
were
now
only
two
skrewts
left
or
because
he
was
trying
to
prove
he
could
do
anything
that
Professor
GrubblyPlank
could
harry
didnt
know
but
Hagrid
had
been
continuing
her
lessons
on
unicorns
ever
since
he'd
returned
to
work
it
turned
out
that
Hagrid
knew
quite
as
much
about
unicorns
as
he
did
about
monsters
though
it
was
clear
that
he
found
their
lack
of
poisonous
fangs
disappointing
today
he
had
managed
to
capture
two
unicorn
foals
unlike
fullgrown
unicorns
they
were
pure
gold
parvati
and
Lavender
went
into
transports
of
delight
at
the
sight
of
them
and
even
Pansy
Parkinson
had
to
work
hard
to
conceal
how
much
she
liked
them
easier
ter
spot
than
the
adults
Hagrid
told
the
class
they
turn
silver
when
they're
abou
two
years
old
an
they
grow
horns
at
aroun
four
don

harry
hagrid
muttered
moving
aside
slightly
while
most
of
the
others
swarmed
around
the
baby
unicorns
yeah
said
Harry
jus
nervous
eh
said
Hagrid
bit
said
Harry
harry
said
Hagrid
clapping
a
massive
hand
on
his
shoulder
so
that
harry's
knees
buckled
under
its
weight
i'd've
bin
worried
before
I
saw
yeh
take
on
tha
Horntail
but
I
know
now
yeh

mind
ter
i'm
not
worried
at
all
yeh're
goin
ter
be
fine
got
yer
clue
worked
out
haven
yeh
harry
nodded
but
even
as
he
did
so
an
insane
urge
to
confess
that
he
didn't
have
any
idea
how
to
survive
at
the
bottom
of
the
lake
for
an
hour
came
over
him
he
looked
up
at
Hagrid
perhaps
he
had
to
go
into
the
lake
sometimes
to
deal
with
the
creatures
in
it
he
looked
after
everything
else
on
the
grounds
after
all
yeh're
goin
ter
win
Hagrid
growled
patting
Harrys
shoulder
again
so
that
Harry
actually
felt
himself
sink
a
couple
of
inches
into
the
soft
ground
i
know
it
i
can
feel
it
yeh're
goin
ter
win
Harry
n
Harry
just
couldn't
bring
himself
to
wipe
the
happy
confident
smile
off
hagrid's
face
pretending
he
was
interested
in
the
young
unicorns
he
forced
a
smile
in
return
and
moved
forward
to
pat
them
with
the
others
by
the
evening
before
the
second
task
harry
felt
as
though
he
were
trapped
in
a
nightmare
he
was
fully
aware
that
even
if
by
some
miracle
he
managed
to
find
a
suitable
spell
he'd
have
a
real
job
mastering
it
overnight
how
could
he
have
let
this
happen
why
hadn't
he
got
to
work
on
the
egg's
clue
sooner
why
had
he
ever
let
his
mind
wander
in
class
what
if
a
teacher
had
once
mentioned
how
to
breathe
underwater
he
sat
with
Hermione
and
Ron
in
the
library
as
the
sun
set
outside
tearing
feverishly
through
page
after
page
of
spells
hidden
from
one
another
by
the
massive
piles
of
books
on
the
desk
in
front
of
each
of
them
harry
s
heart
gave
a
huge
leap
every
time
he
saw
the
word
water
on
a
page
but
more
often
than
not
it
was
merely
Take
two
pints
of
water
half
a
pound
of
shredded
mandrake
leaves
and
a
newt
i
don't
reckon
it
can
be
done
said
Rons
voice
flatly
from
the
other
side
of
the
table
there's
nothing
nothing
closest
was
that
thing
to
dry
up
puddles
and
ponds
that
Drought
Charm
but
that
was
nowhere
near
powerful
enough
to
drain
the
lake
there
must
be
something
Hermione
muttered
moving
a
candle
closer
to
her
her
eyes
were
so
tired
she
was
poring
over
the
tiny
print
of
Olde
and
Forgotten
Bewitchments
and
Charmes
with
her
nose
about
an
inch
from
the
page
they'd
never
have
set
a
task
that
was
undoable
they
have
said
Ron
harry
just
go
down
to
the
lake
tomorrow
right
stick
your
head
in
yell
at
the
merpeople
to
give
back
whatever
they've
nicked
and
see
if
they
chuck
it
out
best
you
can
do
mate
there's
a
way
of
doing
it
hermione
said
crossly
there
Just
has
to
be
she
seemed
to
be
taking
the
library's
lack
of
useful
information
on
the
subject
as
a
personal
insult
it
had
never
failed
her
before
i
know
what
I
should
have
done
said
Harry
resting
facedown
on
Saucy
Tricks
for
Tricky
Sorts
i
should've
learned
to
be
an
Animagus
like
Sirius
an
Animagus
was
a
wizard
who
could
transform
into
an
animal
yeah
you
could've
turned
into
a
goldfish
any
time
you
wanted
said
Ron
or
a
frog
yawned
Harry
he
was
exhausted
it
takes
years
to
become
an
Animagus
and
then
you
have
to
register
yourself
and
everything
said
Hermione
vaguely
now
squinting
down
the
index
of
Weird
Wizarding
Dilemmas
and
Their
Solutions
professor
McGonagall
told
us
remember
you've
got
to
register
yourself
with
the
Improper
Use
of
Magic
Office
what
animal
you
become
and
your
markings
so
you
can't
abuse
it
hermione
I
was
joking
said
Harry
wearily
i
know
I
haven't
got
a
chance
of
turning
into
a
frog
by
tomorrow
morning
oh
this
is
no
use
Hermione
said
snapping
shut
Weird
Wizarding
Dilemmas
who
on
earth
wants
to
make
their
nose
hair
grow
into
ringlets
i
wouldn't
mind
said
Fred
Weasleys
voice
be
a
talking
point
wouldn't
it
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
looked
up
fred
and
George
had
just
emerged
from
behind
some
bookshelves
what're
you
two
doing
here
ron
asked
looking
for
you
said
George
mcGonagall
wants
you
Ron
and
you
hermione
why
said
Hermione
looking
surprised
dunno
she
was
looking
a
bit
grim
though
said
Fred
we're
supposed
to
take
you
down
to
her
office
said
George
ron
and
Hermione
stared
at
Harry
who
felt
his
stomach
drop
was
Professor
McGonagall
about
to
tell
Ron
and
Hermione
off
perhaps
she'd
noticed
how
much
they
were
helping
him
when
he
ought
to
be
working
out
how
to
do
the
task
alone
we'll
meet
you
back
in
the
common
room
Hermione
told
Harry
as
she
got
up
to
go
with
Ron
both
of
them
looked
very
anxious
bring
as
many
of
these
books
as
you
can
okay
right
said
Harry
uneasily
by
eight
o'clock
madam
Pince
had
extinguished
all
the
lamps
and
came
to
chivvy
Harry
out
of
the
library
staggering
under
the
weight
of
as
many
books
as
he
could
carry
Harry
returned
to
the
Gryffindor
common
room
pulled
a
table
into
a
corner
and
continued
to
search
there
was
nothing
in
Madcap
Magic
for
Wacky
Warlocks
nothing
in
A
Guide
to
Medieval
Sorcery
not
one
mention
of
underwater
exploits
in
An
Anthology
of
EighteenthCentury
Charms
or
in
Dreadful
Denizens
of
the
Deep
or
Powers
You
Never
Knew
You
Had
and
What
to
Do
with
Them
Now
Youve
Wised
Up
crookshanks
crawled
into
Harrys
lap
and
curled
up
purring
deeply
the
common
room
emptied
slowly
around
Harry
people
kept
wishing
him
luck
for
the
next
morning
in
cheery
confident
voices
like
Hagrid
s
all
of
them
apparently
convinced
that
he
was
about
to
pull
off
another
stunning
performance
like
the
one
he
had
managed
in
the
first
task
harry
couldn't
answer
them
he
just
nodded
feeling
as
though
there
were
a
golfball
stuck
in
his
throat
by
ten
to
midnight
he
was
alone
in
the
room
with
Crookshanks
he
had
searched
all
the
remaining
books
and
Ron
and
Hermione
had
not
come
back
it's
over
he
told
himself
you
can't
do
it
you'll
just
have
to
go
down
to
the
lake
in
the
morning
and
tell
the
judges
he
imagined
himself
explaining
that
he
couldn't
do
the
task
he
pictured
bagman's
look
of
roundeyed
surprise
Karkaroffs
satisfied
yellowtoothed
smile
he
could
almost
hear
Fleur
Delacour
saying
I
knew
it
e
is
too
young
e
is
only
a
little
boy
he
saw
Malfoy
flashing
his
potter
stinks
badge
at
the
front
of
the
crowd
saw
Hagrid
s
crestfallen
disbelieving
face
forgetting
that
Crookshanks
was
on
his
lap
harry
stood
up
very
suddenly
Crookshanks
hissed
angrily
as
he
landed
on
the
floor
gave
Harry
a
disgusted
look
and
stalked
away
with
his
bottlebrush
tail
in
the
air
but
Harry
was
already
hurrying
up
the
spiral
staircase
to
his
dormitory
he
would
grab
the
Invisibility
cloak
and
go
back
to
the
library
he'd
stay
there
all
night
if
he
had
to
lumos
Harry
whispered
fifteen
minutes
later
as
he
opened
the
library
door
wand
tip
alight
he
crept
along
the
bookshelves
pulling
down
more
books
books
of
hexes
and
charms
books
on
merpeople
and
water
monsters
books
on
famous
witches
and
wizards
on
magical
inventions
on
anything
at
all
that
might
include
one
passing
reference
to
underwater
survival
he
carried
them
over
to
a
table
then
set
to
work
searching
them
by
the
narrow
beam
of
his
wand
occasionally
checking
his
watch
one
in
the
morning
two
in
the
morning
the
only
way
he
could
keep
going
was
to
tell
himself
over
and
over
again
next
book
in
the
next
one
the
next
one
the
mermaid
in
the
painting
in
the
prefects
bathroom
was
laughing
harry
was
bobbing
like
a
cork
in
bubbly
water
next
to
her
rock
while
she
held
his
Firebolt
over
his
head
come
and
get
it
she
giggled
maliciously
come
on
jump
i
can't
Harry
panted
snatching
at
the
Firebolt
and
struggling
not
to
sink
give
it
to
me
but
she
just
poked
him
painfully
in
the
side
with
the
end
of
the
broomstick
laughing
at
him
that
hurts
get
off
ouch
harry
Potter
must
wake
up

poking
me
dobby

Harry
Potter
sir
he
must

harry
opened
his
eyes
he
was
still
in
the
library
the
Invisibility
Cloak
had
slipped
off
his
head
as
he'd
slept
and
the
side
of
his
face
was
stuck
to
the
pages
of
Where
there's
a
Wand
there's
a
Way
he
sat
up
straightening
his
glasses
blinking
in
the
bright
daylight
harry
Potter

hurry
squeaked
Dobby
the
second
task
starts
in
ten
minutes
and
Harry
Potter

minutes
harry
croaked
ten
ten
minutes
he
looked
down
at
his
watch
dobby
was
right
it
was
twenty
past
nine
a
large
dead
weight
seemed
to
fall
through
harry's
chest
into
his
stomach
hurry
Harry
Potter
squeaked
Dobby
plucking
at
harry's
sleeve
you
is
supposed
to
be
down
by
the
lake
with
the
other
champions
sir

too
late
Dobby
Harry
said
hopelessly
i'm
not

the
task
I
don't
know
how
harry
Potter
will
do
the
task
squeaked
the
elf
dobby
knew
Harry
had
not
found
the
right
book
so
Dobby
did
it
for
him
what
said
Harry
but
you
don't
know
what
the
second
task
is
dobby

over
his
shorts
what
harry
gasped

Ron
the
thing
Harry
Potter

sir
squeaked
Dobby
but
past
an
hour
the
prospect's
black
Harry
recited
staring
horrorstruck
at
the
elf
too
late
it's
gone
it
won't
come
back
dobby
what've
I
got
to
do

s
queaked
the
elf
and
he
put
his
hand
in
the
pocket
of
his
shorts
and
drew
out
a
ball
of
what
looked
like
slimy
grayishgreen
rat
tails
right
before
you
go
into
the
lake
sir
gillyweed
what's
it
do
said
Harry
staring
at
the
gillyweed
it
will
make
Harry
Potter
breathe
underwater
sir
dobby
said
Harry
frantically
listen
are
you
sure
about
this
he
couldn't
quite
forget
that
the
last
time
Dobby
had
tried
to
help
him
he
had
ended
up
with
no
bones
in
his
right
arm
dobby

sure
sir
said
the
elf
earnestly
dobby

sir
he
is
a
houseelf
he
goes
all
over
the
castle
as
he
lights
the
fires
and
mops
the
floors
dobby
heard
Professor
McGonagall
and
Professor
Moody
in
the
staffroom
talking
about
the
next
task
dobby
cannot
let
Harry
Potter
lose
his
Wheezy
harrys
doubts
vanished
jumping
to
his
feet
he
pulled
off
the
Invisibility
Cloak
stuffed
it
into
his
bag
grabbed
the
gillyweed
and
put
it
into
his
pocket
then
tore
out
of
the
library
with
Dobby
at
his
heels
dobby
is
supposed
to
be
in
the
kitchens
sir
dobby
squealed
as
they
burst
into
the
corridor
dobby
will
be
missed
good
luck
Harry
Potter
sir
good
luck
see
you
later
Dobby
harry
shouted
and
he
sprinted
along
the
corridor
and
down
the
stairs
three
at
a
time
the
entrance
hall
contained
a
few
lastminute
stragglers
all
leaving
the
Great
Hall
after
breakfast
and
heading
through
the
double
oak
doors
to
watch
the
second
task
they
stared
as
Harry
flashed
past
sending
Colin
and
Dennis
Creevey
flying
as
he
leapt
down
the
stone
steps
and
out
onto
the
bright
chilly
grounds
as
he
pounded
down
the
lawn
he
saw
that
the
seats
that
had
encircled
the
dragons
enclosure
in
November
were
now
ranged
along
the
opposite
bank
rising
in
stands
that
were
packed
to
the
bursting
point
and
reflected
in
the
lake
below
the
excited
babble
of
the
crowd
echoed
strangely
across
the
water
as
Harry
ran
flatout
around
the
other
side
of
the
lake
toward
the
judges
who
were
sitting
at
another
gold
draped
table
at
the
water's
edge
cedric
Fleur
and
Krum
were
beside
the
judges
table
watching
Harry
sprint
toward
them
i'm
here
harry
panted
skidding
to
a
halt
in
the
mud
and
accidentally
splattering
Fleurs
robes
where
have
you
been
said
a
bossy
disapproving
voice
the
task's
about
to
start
harry
looked
around
percy
Weasley
was
sitting
at
the
judges
table
mr.
Crouch
had
failed
to
turn
up
again
now
now
Percy
said
Ludo
Bagman
who
was
looking
intensely
relieved
to
see
Harry
let
him
catch
his
breath
dumbledore
smiled
at
Harry
but
Karkaroff
and
Madame
Maxime
didn't
look
at
all
pleased
to
see
him
it
was
obvious
from
the
looks
on
their
faces
that
they
had
thought
he
wasn't
going
to
turn
up
harry
bent
over
hands
on
his
knees
gasping
for
breath
he
had
a
stitch
in
his
side
that
felt
as
though
he
had
a
knife
between
his
ribs
but
there
was
no
time
to
get
rid
of
it
Ludo
Bagman
was
now
moving
among
the
champions
spacing
them
along
the
bank
at
intervals
of
ten
feet
harry
was
on
the
very
end
of
the
line
next
to
Krum
who
was
wearing
swimming
trunks
and
was
holding
his
wand
ready
all
right
harry
bagman
whispered
as
he
moved
Harry
a
few
feet
farther
away
from
Krum
know
what
you're
going
to
do
yeah
Harry
panted
massaging
his
ribs
bagman
gave
harry's
shoulder
a
quick
squeeze
and
returned
to
the
judges
table
he
pointed
his
wand
at
his
throat
as
he
had
done
at
the
World
Cup
said
Sonorus
and
his
voice
boomed
out
across
the
dark
water
toward
the
stands
well
all
our
champions
are
ready
for
the
second
task
which
will
start
on
my
whistle
they
have
precisely
an
hour
to
recover
what
has
been
taken
from
them
on
the
count
of
three
then
one
two
three
the
whistle
echoed
shrilly
in
the
cold
still
air
the
stands
erupted
with
cheers
and
applause
without
looking
to
see
what
the
other
champions
were
doing
Harry
pulled
off
his
shoes
and
socks
pulled
the
handful
of
gillyweed
out
of
his
pocket
stuffed
it
into
his
mouth
and
waded
out
into
the
lake
it
was
so
cold
he
felt
the
skin
on
his
legs
searing
as
though
this
were
fire
not
icy
water
his
sodden
robes
weighed
him
down
as
he
walked
in
deeper
now
the
water
was
over
his
knees
and
his
rapidly
numbing
feet
were
slipping
over
silt
and
flat
slimy
stones
he
was
chewing
the
gillyweed
as
hard
and
fast
as
he
could
it
felt
unpleasantly
slimy
and
rubbery
like
octopus
tentacles
waistdeep
in
the
freezing
water
he
stopped
swallowed
and
waited
for
something
to
happen
he
could
hear
laughter
in
the
crowd
and
knew
he
must
look
stupid
walking
into
the
lake
without
showing
any
sign
of
magical
power
the
part
of
him
that
was
still
dry
was
covered
in
goose
pimples
half
immersed
in
the
icy
water
a
cruel
breeze
lifting
his
hair
Harry
started
to
shiver
violently
he
avoided
looking
at
the
stands
the
laughter
was
becoming
louder
and
there
were
catcalls
and
jeering
from
the
Slytherins
then
quite
suddenly
Harry
felt
as
though
an
invisible
pillow
had
been
pressed
over
his
mouth
and
nose
he
tried
to
draw
breath
but
it
made
his
head
spin
his
lungs
were
empty
and
he
suddenly
felt
a
piercing
pain
on
either
side
of
his
neck
Harry
clapped
his
hands
around
his
throat
and
felt
two
large
slits
just
below
his
ears
flapping
in
the
cold
air
he
had
gills
without
pausing
to
think
he
did
the
only
thing
that
made
sense
he
flung
himself
forward
into
the
water
the
first
gulp
of
icy
lake
water
felt
like
the
breath
of
life
his
head
had
stopped
spinning
he
took
another
great
gulp
of
water
and
felt
it
pass
smoothly
through
his
gills
sending
oxygen
back
to
his
brain
he
stretched
out
his
hands
in
front
of
him
and
stared
at
them
they
looked
green
and
ghostly
under
the
water
and
they
had
become
webbed
he
twisted
around
and
looked
at
his
bare
feet
they
had
become
elongated
and
the
toes
were
webbed
too
It
looked
as
though
he
had
sprouted
flippers
the
water
didn't
feel
icy
anymore
either
on
the
contrary
he
felt
pleasantly
cool
and
very
light
harry
struck
out
once
more
marveling
at
how
far
and
fast
his
flipperlike
feet
propelled
him
through
the
vater
and
noticing
how
clearly
he
could
see
and
how
he
no
longer
seemed
to
need
to
blink
he
had
soon
swum
so
far
into
the
lake
that
he
could
no
longer
see
the
bottom
he
flipped
over
and
dived
into
its
depths
silence
pressed
upon
his
ears
as
he
soared
over
a
strange
dark
foggy
landscape
he
could
only
see
ten
feet
around
him
so
that
as
he
sped
throuugh
the
water
new
scenes
seemed
to
loom
suddenly
out
of
the
incoming
darkness
forests
of
rippling
tangled
black
weed
wide
plains
of
mud
littered
with
dull
glimmering
stones
he
swam
deeper
and
deeper
out
toward
the
middle
of
the
lake
his
eyes
wide
staring
through
the
eerily
graylit
water
around
him
to
the
shadow
beyond
where
the
water
became
opaque
small
fish
flickered
past
him
like
silver
darts
once
or
twice
he
thought
he
saw
something
larger
moving
ahead
of
him
but
when
he
got
nearer
he
discovered
it
to
be
nothing
but
a
large
blackened
log
or
a
dense
clump
of
weed
there
was
no
sign
of
any
of
the
other
champions
merpeople
Ron
nor
thankfully
the
giant
squid
light
green
weed
stretched
ahead
of
him
as
far
as
he
could
see
two
feet
deep
like
a
meadow
of
very
overgrown
grass
harry
was
staring
unblinkingly
ahead
of
him
trying
to
discern
shapes
through
the
gloom
and
then
without
warning
something
grabbed
hold
of
his
ankle
harry
twisted
his
body
around
and
saw
a
grindylow
a
small
horned
water
demon
poking
out
of
the
weed
its
long
fingers
clutched
tightly
around
harry's
leg
its
pointed
fangs
bared
Harry
stuck
his
webbed
hand
quickly
inside
his
robes
and
fumbled
for
his
wand
by
the
time
he
had
grasped
it
two
more
grindylows
had
risen
out
of
the
weed
had
seized
handfuls
of
harry's
robes
and
were
attempting
to
drag
him
down
relashio
harry
shouted
except
that
no
sound
came
out
a
large
bubble
issued
from
his
mouth
and
his
wand
instead
of
sending
sparks
at
the
grindylows
pelted
them
with
what
seemed
to
be
a
jet
of
boiling
water
for
where
it
struck
them
angry
red
patches
appeared
on
their
green
skin
harry
pulled
his
ankle
out
of
the
grindylows
grip
and
swam
as
fast
as
he
could
occasionally
sending
more
jets
of
hot
water
over
his
shoulder
at
random
every
now
and
then
he
felt
one
of
the
grindylows
snatch
at
his
foot
again
and
he
kicked
out
hard
finally
he
felt
his
foot
connect
with
a
horned
skull
and
looking
back
saw
the
dazed
grindylow
floating
away
crosseyed
while
its
fellows
shook
their
fists
at
Harry
and
sank
back
into
the
weed
harry
slowed
down
a
little
slipped
his
wand
back
inside
his
robes
and
looked
around
listening
again
he
turned
full
circle
in
the
water
the
silence
pressing
harder
than
ever
against
his
eardrums
he
knew
he
must
be
even
deeper
in
the
lake
now
but
nothing
was
moving
but
the
rippling
weed
how
are
you
getting
on
harry
thought
he
was
having
a
heart
attack
he
whipped
around
and
saw
Moaning
Myrtle
floating
hazily
in
front
of
him
gazing
at
him
through
her
thick
pearly
glasses
myrtle
harry
tried
to
shout
but
once
again
nothing
came
out
of
his
mouth
but
a
very
large
bubble
moaning
Myrtle
actually
giggled
you
want
to
try
over
there
she
said
pointing
i
won't
come
with
you
i
don't
like
them
much
they
always
chase
me
when
I
get
too
close
harry
gave
her
the
thumbsup
to
show
his
thanks
and
set
off
once
more
careful
to
swim
a
bit
higher
over
the
weed
to
avoid
any
more
grindylows
that
might
be
lurking
there
he
swam
on
for
what
felt
like
at
least
twenty
minutes
he
was
passing
over
vast
expanses
of
black
mud
now
which
swirled
murkily
as
he
disturbed
the
water
then
at
long
last
he
heard
a
snatch
of
haunting
mersong
an
hour
long
you'll
have
to
look
And
to
recover
what
we
took
harry
swam
faster
and
soon
saw
a
large
rock
emerge
out
of
the
muddy
water
ahead
it
had
paintings
of
merpeople
on
it
they
were
carrying
spears
and
chasing
what
looked
like
the
giant
squid
harry
swam
on
past
the
rock
following
the
mersong
your
time's
half
gone
so
tarry
not
Lest
what
you
seek
stays
here
to
rot
a
cluster
of
crude
stone
dwellings
stained
with
algae
loomed
suddenly
out
of
the
gloom
on
all
sides
here
and
there
at
the
dark
windows
Harry
saw
faces
faces
that
bore
no
resemblance
at
all
to
the
painting
of
the
mermaid
in
the
prefects
bathroom
the
merpeople
had
grayish
skin
and
long
wild
dark
green
hair
their
eyes
were
yellow
as
were
their
broken
teeth
and
they
wore
thick
ropes
of
pebbles
around
their
necks
they
leered
at
Harry
as
he
swam
past
one
or
two
of
them
emerged
from
their
caves
to
watch
him
better
their
powerful
silver
fish
tails
beating
the
water
spears
clutched
in
their
hands
harry
sped
on
staring
around
and
soon
the
dwellings
became
more
numerous
there
were
gardens
of
weed
around
some
of
them
and
he
even
saw
a
pet
grindylow
tied
to
a
stake
outside
one
door
merpeople
were
emerging
on
all
sides
now
watching
him
eagerly
pointing
at
his
webbed
hands
and
gills
talking
behind
their
hands
to
one
another
harry
sped
around
a
corner
and
a
very
strange
sight
met
his
eyes
a
whole
crowd
of
merpeople
was
floating
in
front
of
the
houses
that
lined
what
looked
like
a
merversion
of
a
village
square
a
choir
of
merpeople
was
singing
in
the
middle
calling
the
champions
toward
them
and
behind
them
rose
a
crude
sort
of
statue
a
gigantic
merperson
hewn
from
a
boulder
four
people
were
bound
tightly
to
the
tail
of
the
stone
merperson
ron
was
tied
between
Hermione
and
Cho
Chang
there
was
also
a
girl
who
looked
no
older
than
eight
whose
clouds
of
silvery
hair
made
Harry
feel
sure
that
she
was
Fleur
delacour's
sister
all
four
of
them
appeared
to
be
in
a
very
deep
sleep
their
heads
were
lolling
onto
their
shoulders
and
fine
streams
of
bubbles
kept
issuing
from
their
mouths
harry
sped
toward
the
hostages
half
expecting
the
merpeople
to
lower
their
spears
and
charge
at
him
but
they
did
nothing
the
ropes
of
weed
tying
the
hostages
to
the
statue
were
thick
slimy
and
very
strong
for
a
fleeting
second
he
thought
of
the
knife
Sirius
had
bought
him
for
Christmas
locked
in
his
trunk
in
the
castle
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
no
use
to
him
whatsoever
he
looked
around
many
of
the
merpeople
surrounding
them
were
carrying
spears
he
swam
swiftly
toward
a
sevenfoottall
merman
with
a
long
green
beard
and
a
choker
of
shark
fangs
and
tried
to
mime
a
request
to
borrow
the
spear
the
merman
laughed
and
shook
his
head
we
do
not
help
he
said
in
a
harsh
croaky
voice
come
on
harry
said
fiercely
but
only
bubbles
issued
from
his
mouth
and
he
tried
to
pull
the
spear
away
from
the
merman
but
the
merman
yanked
it
back
still
shaking
his
head
and
laughing
harry
swirled
around
staring
about
something
sharp
anything
there
were
rocks
littering
the
lake
bottom
he
dived
and
snatched
up
a
particularly
jagged
one
and
returned
to
the
statue
he
began
to
hack
at
the
ropes
binding
Ron
and
after
several
minutes
hard
work
they
broke
apart
ron
floated
unconscious
a
few
inches
above
the
lake
bottom
drifting
a
little
in
the
ebb
of
the
water
harry
looked
around
there
was
no
sign
of
any
of
the
other
champions
what
were
they
playing
at
why
didn't
they
hurry
up
he
turned
back
to
Hermione
raised
the
jagged
rock
and
began
to
hack
at
her
bindings
too
At
once
several
pairs
of
strong
gray
hands
seized
him
half
a
dozen
mermen
were
pulling
him
away
from
Hermione
shaking
their
greenhaired
heads
and
laughing
you
take
your
own
hostage
one
of
them
said
to
him
leave
the
others
no
way
said
Harry
furiously
but
only
two
large
bubbles
came
out
your
task
is
to
retrieve
your
own
friend
leave
the
others
she's
my
friend
too
harry
yelled
gesturing
toward
Hermione
an
enormous
silver
bubble
emerging
soundlessly
from
his
lips
and
I
don't
want
them
to
die
either
cho's
head
was
on
Hermiones
shoulder
the
small
silverhaired
girl
was
ghostly
green
and
pale
harry
struggled
to
fight
off
the
mermen
but
they
laughed
harder
than
ever
holding
him
back
harry
looked
wildly
around
where
were
the
other
champions
would
he
have
time
to
take
Ron
to
the
surface
and
come
back
down
for
Hermione
and
the
others
would
he
be
able
to
find
them
again
he
looked
down
at
his
watch
to
see
how
much
time
was
left
it
had
stopped
working
but
then
the
merpeople
around
him
pointed
excitedly
over
his
head
harry
looked
up
and
saw
Cedric
swimming
toward
them
there
was
an
enormous
bubble
around
his
head
which
made
his
features
look
oddly
wide
and
stretched
got
lost
he
mouthed
looking
panicstricken
fleur
and
krum're
coming
now
feeling
enormously
relieved
Harry
watched
Cedric
pull
a
knife
out
of
his
pocket
and
cut
Cho
free
he
pulled
her
upward
and
out
of
sight
harry
looked
around
waiting
where
were
Fleur
and
Krum
time
was
getting
short
and
according
to
the
song
the
hostages
would
be
lost
after
an
hour
the
merpeople
started
screeching
animatedly
those
holding
Harry
loosened
their
grip
staring
behind
them
harry
turned
and
saw
something
monstrous
cutting
through
the
water
toward
them
a
human
body
in
swimming
trunks
with
the
head
of
a
shark
it
was
Krum
he
appeared
to
have
transfigured
himself
but
badly
the
sharkman
swam
straight
to
Hermione
and
began
snapping
and
biting
at
her
ropes
the
trouble
was
that
krum's
new
teeth
were
positioned
very
awkwardly
for
biting
anything
smaller
than
a
dolphin
and
Harry
was
quite
sure
that
if
Krum
wasn't
careful
he
was
going
to
rip
Hermione
in
half
darting
forward
harry
hit
Krum
hard
on
the
shoulder
and
held
up
the
jagged
stone
krum
seized
it
and
began
to
cut
Hermione
free
within
seconds
he
had
done
it
he
grabbed
Hermione
around
the
waist
and
without
a
backward
glance
began
to
rise
rapidly
with
her
toward
the
surface
now
what
harry
thought
desperately
if
he
could
be
sure
that
Fleur
was
coming
but
still
no
sign
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
except
he
snatched
up
the
stone
which
Krum
had
dropped
but
the
mermen
now
closed
in
around
Ron
and
the
little
girl
shaking
their
heads
at
him
harry
pulled
out
his
wand
get
out
of
the
way
only
bubbles
flew
out
of
his
mouth
but
he
had
the
distinct
impression
that
the
mermen
had
understood
him
because
they
suddenly
stopped
laughing
their
yellowish
eyes
were
fixed
upon
harry's
wand
and
they
looked
scared
there
might
be
a
lot
more
of
them
than
there
were
of
him
but
Harry
could
tell
by
the
looks
on
their
faces
that
they
knew
no
more
magic
than
the
giant
squid
did
you've
got
until
three
harry
shouted
a
great
stream
of
bubbles
burst
from
him
but
he
held
up
three
fingers
to
make
sure
they
got
the
message
one
he
put
down
a
finger
two
he
put
down
a
second
one
They
scattered
harry
darted
forward
and
began
to
hack
at
the
ropes
binding
the
small
girl
to
the
statue
and
at
last
she
was
free
he
seized
the
little
girl
around
the
waist
grabbed
the
neck
of
Rons
robes
and
kicked
off
from
the
bottom
it
was
very
slow
work
he
could
no
longer
use
his
webbed
hands
to
propel
himself
forward
he
worked
his
flippers
furiously
but
Ron
and
fleur's
sister
were
like
potatofilled
sacks
dragging
him
back
down
he
fixed
his
eyes
skyward
though
he
knew
he
must
still
be
very
deep
the
water
above
him
was
so
dark
merpeople
were
rising
with
him
he
could
see
them
swirling
around
him
with
ease
watching
him
struggle
through
the
water
would
they
pull
him
back
down
to
the
depths
when
the
time
was
up
did
they
perhaps
eat
humans
harry's
legs
were
seizing
up
with
the
effort
to
keep
swimming
his
shoulders
were
aching
horribly
with
the
effort
of
dragging
Ron
and
the
girl
he
was
drawing
breath
with
extreme
difficulty
he
could
feel
pain
on
the
sides
of
his
neck
again
he
was
becoming
very
aware
of
how
wet
the
water
was
in
his
mouth
yet
the
darkness
was
definitely
thinning
now
he
could
see
daylight
above
him
he
kicked
hard
with
his
flippers
and
discovered
that
they
were
nothing
more
than
feet
water
was
flooding
through
his
mouth
into
his
lungs
he
was
starting
to
feel
dizzy
but
he
knew
light
and
air
were
only
ten
feet
above
him
he
had
to
get
there
he
had
to
harry
kicked
his
legs
so
hard
and
fast
it
felt
as
though
his
muscles
were
screaming
in
protest
his
very
brain
felt
waterlogged
he
couldn't
breathe
he
needed
oxygen
he
had
to
keep
going
he
could
not
stop
And
then
he
felt
his
head
break
the
surface
of
the
lake
wonderful
cold
clear
air
was
making
his
wet
face
sting
he
gulped
it
down
feeling
as
though
he
had
never
breathed
properly
before
and
panting
pulled
Ron
and
the
little
girl
up
with
him
all
around
him
wild
greenhaired
heads
were
emerging
out
of
the
water
with
him
but
they
were
smiling
at
him
the
crowd
in
the
stands
was
making
a
great
deal
of
noise
shouting
and
screaming
they
all
seemed
to
be
on
their
feet
Harry
had
the
impression
they
thought
that
Ron
and
the
little
girl
might
be
dead
but
they
were
wrong
both
of
them
had
opened
their
eyes
the
girl
looked
scared
and
confused
but
Ron
merely
expelled
a
great
spout
of
water
blinked
in
the
bright
light
turned
to
Harry
and
said
Wet
this
isn't
it
then
he
spotted
fleur's
sister
what
did
you
bring
her
for
fleur
didn't
turn
up
I
couldn't
leave
her
Harry
panted
harry
you
prat
said
Ron
you
didn't
take
that
song
thing
seriously
did
you
dumbledore
wouldn't
have
let
any
of
us
drown
the
song
said
it
was
only
to
make
sure
you
got
back
inside
the
time
limit
said
Ron
i
hope
you
didn't
waste
time
down
there
acting
the
hero
harry
felt
both
stupid
and
annoyed
it
was
all
very
well
for
Ron
he'd
been
asleep
he
hadn't
felt
how
eerie
it
was
down
in
the
lake
surrounded
by
spearcarrying
merpeople
who'd
looked
more
than
capable
of
murder
c'mon
Harry
said
shortly
help
me
with
her
I
don't
think
she
can
swim
very
well
they
pulled
fleur's
sister
through
the
water
back
toward
the
bank
where
the
judges
stood
watching
twenty
merpeople
accompanying
them
like
a
guard
of
honor
singing
their
horrible
screechy
songs
harry
could
see
Madam
Pomfrey
fussing
over
Hermione
Krum
Cedric
and
Cho
all
of
whom
were
wrapped
in
thick
blankets
dumbledore
and
Ludo
Bagman
stood
beaming
at
Harry
and
Ron
from
the
bank
as
they
swam
nearer
but
Percy
who
looked
very
white
and
somehow
much
younger
than
usual
came
splashing
out
to
meet
them
meanwhile
Madame
Maxime
was
trying
to
restrain
Fleur
Delacour
who
was
quite
hysterical
fighting
tooth
and
nail
to
return
to
the
water
gabrielle
gabrielle
is
she
alive
is
she
urt
she's
fine
harry
tried
to
tell
her
but
he
was
so
exhausted
he
could
hardly
talk
let
alone
shout
percy
seized
Ron
and
was
dragging
him
back
to
the
bank
Gerroff
Percy
i'm
all
right
Dumbledore
and
Bagman
were
pulling
Harry
upright
Fleur
had
broken
free
of
Madame
Maxime
and
was
hugging
her
sister
it
was
ze
grindylows
zey
attacked
me
oh
Gabrielle
I
thought
i
thought
come
here
you
said
Madam
Pomfrey
she
seized
Harry
and
pulled
him
over
to
Hermione
and
the
others
wrapped
him
so
tightly
in
a
blanket
that
he
felt
as
though
he
were
in
a
straitjacket
and
forced
a
measure
of
very
hot
potion
down
his
throat
steam
gushed
out
of
his
ears
harry
well
done
hermione
cried
you
did
it
you
found
out
how
all
by
yourself
well
said
Harry
he
would
have
told
her
about
Dobby
but
he
had
just
noticed
Karkaroff
watching
him
he
was
the
only
judge
who
had
not
left
the
table
the
only
judge
not
showing
signs
of
pleasure
and
relief
that
Harry
Ron
and
fleur's
sister
had
got
back
safely
yeah
that's
right
said
Harry
raising
his
voice
slightly
so
that
Karkaroff
could
hear
him
you
haff
a
water
beetle
in
your
hair
Hermownninny
said
Krum
harry
had
the
impression
that
Krum
was
drawing
her
attention
back
onto
himself
perhaps
to
remind
her
that
he
had
just
rescued
her
from
the
lake
but
Hermione
brushed
away
the
beetle
impatiently
and
said
you're
well
outside
the
time
limit
though
Harry
did
it
take
you
ages
to
find
us
no
i
found
you
okay
harry's
feeling
of
stupidity
was
growing
now
he
was
out
of
the
water
it
seemed
perfectly
clear
that
Dumbledores
safety
precautions
wouldn't
have
permitted
the
death
of
a
hostage
just
because
their
champion
hadn't
turned
up
why
hadn't
he
just
grabbed
Ron
and
gone
he
would
have
been
first
back
cedric
and
Krum
hadn't
wasted
time
worrying
about
anyone
else
they
hadn't
taken
the
mersong
seriously
dumbledore
was
crouching
at
the
water's
edge
deep
in
conversation
with
what
seemed
to
be
the
chief
merperson
a
particularly
wild
and
ferociouslooking
female
he
was
making
the
same
sort
of
screechy
noises
that
the
merpeople
made
when
they
were
above
water
clearly
Dumbledore
could
speak
Mermish
finally
he
straightened
up
turned
to
his
fellow
judges
and
said
A
conference
before
we
give
the
marks
I
think
the
judges
went
into
a
huddle
madam
Pomfrey
had
gone
to
rescue
Ron
from
percy's
clutches
she
led
him
over
to
Harry
and
the
others
gave
him
a
blanket
and
some
Pepperup
Potion
then
went
to
fetch
Fleur
and
her
sister
fleur
had
many
cuts
on
her
face
and
arms
and
her
robes
were
torn
but
she
didn't
seem
to
care
nor
would
she
allow
Madam
Pomfrey
to
clean
them
look
after
Gabrielle
she
told
her
and
then
she
turned
to
Harry
you
saved
er
she
said
breathlessly
even
though
she
was
not
your
ostage
yeah
said
Harry
who
was
now
heartily
wishing
he'd
left
all
three
girls
tied
to
the
statue
fleur
bent
down
kissed
Harry
twice
on
each
cheek
he
felt
his
face
burn
and
wouldn't
have
been
surprised
if
steam
was
coming
out
of
his
ears
again
then
said
to
Ron
And
you
tooyou
elped
yeah
said
Ron
looking
extremely
hopeful
yeah
a
bit
fleur
swooped
down
on
him
too
and
kissed
him
hermione
looked
simply
furious
but
just
then
Ludo
bagman's
magically
magnified
voice
boomed
out
beside
them
making
them
all
jump
and
causing
the
crowd
in
the
stands
to
go
very
quiet
ladies
and
gentlemen
we
have
reached
our
decision
merchieftainess
Murcus
has
told
us
exactly
what
happened
at
the
bottom
of
the
lake
and
we
have
therefore
decided
to
award
marks
out
of
fifty
for
each
of
the
champions
as
follows
fleur
Delacour
though
she
demonstrated
excellent
use
of
the
BubbleHead
Charm
was
attacked
by
grindylows
as
she
approached
her
goal
and
failed
to
retrieve
her
hostage
we
award
her
twentyfive
points
applause
from
the
stands
i
deserved
zero
said
Fleur
throatily
shaking
her
magnificent
head
cedric
Diggory
who
also
used
the
BubbleHead
Charm
was
first
to
return
with
his
hostage
though
he
returned
one
minute
outside
the
time
limit
of
an
hour
enormous
cheers
from
the
Hufflepuffs
in
the
crowd
Harry
saw
Cho
give
Cedric
a
glowing
look
we
therefore
award
him
fortyseven
points
harrys
heart
sank
if
Cedric
had
been
outside
the
time
limit
he
most
certainly
had
been
viktor
Krum
used
an
incomplete
form
of
Transfiguration
which
was
nevertheless
effective
and
was
second
to
return
with
his
hostage
we
award
him
forty
points
karkaroff
clapped
particularly
hard
looking
very
superior
harry
Potter
used
gillyweed
to
great
effect
Bagman
continued
he
returned
last
and
well
outside
the
time
limit
of
an
hour
however
the
Merchieftainess
informs
us
that
mr.
Potter
was
first
to
reach
the
hostages
and
that
the
delay
in
his
return
was
due
to
his
determination
to
return
all
hostages
to
safety
not
merely
his
own
ron
and
Hermione
both
gave
Harry
halfexasperated
halfcommiserating
looks
most
of
the
judges
and
here
Bagman
gave
Karkaroff
a
very
nasty
look
feel
that
this
shows
moral
fiber
and
merits
full
marks
however
mr.
potter's
score
is
fortyfive
points
harry's
stomach
leapt
he
was
now
tying
for
first
place
with
Cedric
ron
and
Hermione
caught
by
surprise
stared
at
Harry
then
laughed
and
started
applauding
hard
with
the
rest
of
the
crowd
there
you
go
harry
ron
shouted
over
the
noise
you
weren't
being
thick
after
all
you
were
showing
moral
fiber
fleur
was
clapping
very
hard
too
but
Krum
didn't
look
happy
at
all
he
attempted
to
engage
Hermione
in
conversation
again
but
she
was
too
busy
cheering
Harry
to
listen
the
third
and
final
task
will
take
place
at
dusk
on
the
twentyfourth
of
June
continued
Bagman
the
champions
will
be
notified
of
what
is
coming
precisely
one
month
beforehand
thank
you
all
for
your
support
of
the
champions
it
was
over
harry
thought
dazedly
as
Madam
Pomfrey
began
herding
the
champions
and
hostages
back
to
the
castle
to
get
into
dry
clothes
it
was
over
he
had
got
through
he
didn't
have
to
worry
about
anything
now
until
June
the
twentyfourth
next
time
he
was
in
Hogsmeade
Harry
decided
as
he
walked
back
up
the
stone
steps
into
the
castle
he
was
going
to
buy
Dobby
a
pair
of
socks
for
every
day
of
the
year
chapter
twentyseven
padfoot
returns
one
of
the
best
things
about
the
aftermath
of
the
second
task
was
that
everybody
was
very
keen
to
hear
details
of
what
had
happened
down
in
the
lake
which
meant
that
Ron
was
getting
to
share
harry's
limelight
for
once
harry
noticed
that
ron's
version
of
events
changed
subtly
with
every
retelling
at
first
he
gave
what
seemed
to
be
the
truth
it
tallied
with
hermione's
story
anyway
Dumbledore
had
put
all
the
hostages
into
a
bewitched
sleep
in
Professor
mcgonagall's
office
first
assuring
them
that
they
would
be
quite
safe
and
would
awake
when
they
were
back
above
the
water
one
week
later
however
Ron
was
telling
a
thrilling
tale
of
kidnap
in
which
he
struggled
singlehandedly
against
fifty
heavily
armed
merpeople
who
had
to
beat
him
into
submission
before
tying
him
up
but
I
had
my
wand
hidden
up
my
sleeve
he
assured
Padma
Patil
who
seemed
to
be
a
lot
keener
on
Ron
now
that
he
was
getting
so
much
attention
and
was
making
a
point
of
talking
to
him
every
time
they
passed
in
the
corridors
i
could've
taken
those
meridiots
any
time
I
wanted
what
were
you
going
to
do
snore
at
them
said
Hermione
waspishly
people
had
been
teasing
her
so
much
about
being
the
thing
that
Viktor
Krum
would
most
miss
that
she
was
in
a
rather
tetchy
mood
ron's
ears
went
red
and
thereafter
he
reverted
to
the
bewitched
sleep
version
of
events
as
they
entered
March
the
weather
became
drier
but
cruel
winds
skinned
their
hands
and
faces
every
time
they
went
out
onto
the
grounds
there
were
delays
in
the
post
because
the
owls
kept
being
blown
off
course
the
brown
owl
that
Harry
had
sent
to
Sirius
with
the
dates
of
the
Hogsmeade
weekend
turned
up
at
breakfast
on
Friday
morning
with
half
its
feathers
sticking
up
the
wrong
way
Harry
had
no
sooner
torn
off
sirius's
reply
than
it
took
flight
clearly
afraid
it
was
going
to
be
sent
outside
again
sirius's
letter
was
almost
as
short
as
the
previous
one
be
at
stile
at
end
of
road
out
of
Hogsmeade
past
Dervish
and
Banges
at
two
o'clock
on
Saturday
afternoon
bring
as
much
food
as
you
can
he
hasn't
come
back
to
Hogsmeade
said
Ron
incredulously
it
looks
like
it
doesn't
it
said
Hermione
i
can't
believe
him
said
Harry
tensely
if
he's
caught
made
it
so
far
though
hasn't
he
said
Ron
and
it's
not
like
the
place
is
swarming
with
dementors
anymore
harry
folded
up
the
letter
thinking
if
he
was
honest
with
himself
he
really
wanted
to
see
Sirius
again
he
therefore
approached
the
final
lesson
of
the
afternoon
double
Potions
feeling
considerably
more
cheerful
than
he
usually
did
when
descending
the
steps
to
the
dungeons
malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
were
standing
in
a
huddle
outside
the
classroom
door
with
Pansy
parkinson's
gang
of
Slytherin
girls
all
of
them
were
looking
at
something
Harry
couldn't
see
and
sniggering
heartily
pansys
puglike
face
peered
excitedly
around
goyle's
broad
back
as
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
approached
there
they
are
there
they
are
she
giggled
and
the
knot
of
Slytherins
broke
apart
harry
saw
that
Pansy
had
a
magazine
in
her
hands
Witch
Weekly
the
moving
picture
on
the
front
showed
a
curlyhaired
witch
who
was
smiling
toothily
and
pointing
at
a
large
sponge
cake
with
her
wand
you
might
find
something
to
interest
you
in
there
Granger
pansy
said
loudly
and
she
threw
the
magazine
at
Hermione
who
caught
it
looking
startled
at
that
moment
the
dungeon
door
opened
and
Snape
beckoned
them
all
inside
hermione
Harry
and
Ron
headed
for
a
table
at
the
back
of
the
dungeon
as
usual
once
Snape
had
turned
his
back
on
them
to
write
up
the
ingredients
of
todays
potion
on
the
blackboard
Hermione
hastily
rifled
through
the
magazine
under
the
desk
at
last
in
the
center
pages
Hermione
found
what
they
were
looking
for
harry
and
Ron
leaned
in
closer
a
color
photograph
of
Harry
headed
a
short
piece
entitled
Harry
potter's
Secret
Heartache
A
boy
like
no
other
perhaps
yet
a
boy
suffering
all
the
usual
pangs
of
adolescence
writes
Rita
Skeeter
deprived
of
love
since
the
tragic
demise
of
his
parents
fourteenyearold
Harry
Potter
thought
he
had
found
solace
in
his
steady
girlfriend
at
Hogwarts
Muggleborn
Hermione
Granger
little
did
he
know
that
he
would
shortly
be
suffering
yet
another
emotional
blow
in
a
life
already
littered
with
personal
loss
miss
Granger
a
plain
but
ambitious
girl
seems
to
have
a
taste
for
famous
wizards
that
Harry
alone
cannot
satisfy
since
the
arrival
at
Hogwarts
of
Viktor
Krum
Bulgarian
Seeker
and
hero
of
the
last
World
Quidditch
Cup
Miss
Granger
has
been
toying
with
both
boys
affections
krum
who
is
openly
smitten
with
the
devious
Miss
Granger
has
already
invited
her
to
visit
him
in
Bulgaria
over
the
summer
holidays
and
insists
that
he
has
never
felt
this
way
about
any
other
girl
however
it
might
not
be
Miss
granger's
doubtful
natural
charms
that
have
captured
these
unfortunate
boys
interest
she's
really
ugly
says
Pansy
Parkinson
a
pretty
and
vivacious
fourthyear
student
but
she'd
be
well
up
to
making
a
Love
Potion
she's
quite
brainy
i
think
that's
how
she's
doing
it
love
Potions
are
of
course
banned
at
Hogwarts
and
no
doubt
Albus
Dumbledore
will
want
to
investigate
these
claims
in
the
meantime
Harry
Potters
wellwishers
must
hope
that
next
time
he
bestows
his
heart
on
a
worthier
candidate
i
told
you
ron
hissed
at
Hermione
as
she
stared
down
at
the
article
i
told
you
not
to
annoy
Rita
Skeeter
she's
made
you
out
to
be
some
sort
of
of
scarlet
woman
hermione
stopped
looking
astonished
and
snorted
with
laughter
scarlet
woman
she
repeated
shaking
with
suppressed
giggles
as
she
looked
around
at
Ron
it's
what
my
mum
calls
them
Ron
muttered
his
ears
going
red
if
that's
the
best
Rita
can
do
she's
losing
her
touch
said
Hermione
still
giggling
as
she
threw
Witch
Weekly
onto
the
empty
chair
beside
her
what
a
pile
of
old
rubbish
she
looked
over
at
the
Slytherins
who
were
all
watching
her
and
Harry
closely
across
the
room
to
see
if
they
had
been
upset
by
the
article
hermione
gave
them
a
sarcastic
smile
and
a
wave
and
she
Harry
and
Ron
started
unpacking
the
ingredients
they
would
need
for
their
WitSharpening
Potion
there's
something
funny
though
said
Hermione
ten
minutes
later
holding
her
pestle
suspended
over
a
bowl
of
scarab
beetles
how
could
Rita
Skeeter
have
known
known
what
said
Ron
quickly
you
haven't
been
mixing
up
Love
Potions
have
you
don't
be
stupid
Hermione
snapped
starting
to
pound
up
her
beetles
again
no
it's
just
how
did
she
know
Viktor
asked
me
to
visit
him
over
the
summer
hermione
blushed
scarlet
as
she
said
this
and
determinedly
avoided
ron's
eyes
what
said
Ron
dropping
his
pestle
with
a
loud
clunk
he
asked
me
right
after
he'd
pulled
me
out
of
the
lake
hermione
muttered
after
he'd
got
rid
of
his
shark's
head
madam
Pomfrey
gave
us
both
blankets
and
then
he
sort
of
pulled
me
away
from
the
judges
so
they
wouldn't
hear
and
he
said
if
I
wasn't
doing
anything
over
the
summer
would
I
like
to
and
what
did
you
say
said
Ron
who
had
picked
up
his
pestle
and
was
grinding
it
on
the
desk
a
good
six
inches
from
his
bowl
because
he
was
looking
at
hermione
and
he
did
say
he'd
never
felt
the
same
way
about
anyone
else
Hermione
went
on
going
so
red
now
that
Harry
could
almost
feel
the
heat
coming
from
her
but
how
could
Rita
Skeeter
have
heard
him
she
wasn't
there
or
was
she
maybe
she
has
got
an
Invisibility
Cloak
maybe
she
sneaked
onto
the
grounds
to
watch
the
second
task
and
what
did
you
say
ron
repeated
pounding
his
pestle
down
so
hard
that
it
dented
the
desk
well
I
was
too
busy
seeing
whether
you
and
Harry
were
okay
to
fascinating
though
your
social
life
undoubtedly
is
miss
Granger
said
an
icy
voice
right
behind
them
and
all
three
of
them
jumped
I
must
ask
you
not
to
discuss
it
in
my
class
ten
points
from
Gryffindor
snape
had
glided
over
to
their
desk
while
they
were
talking
the
whole
class
was
now
looking
around
at
them
Malfoy
took
the
opportunity
to
flash
potter
stinks
across
the
dungeon
at
Harry
ah
reading
magazines
under
the
table
as
well
snape
added
snatching
up
the
copy
of
Witch
Weekly
a
further
ten
points
from
Gryffindor
oh
but
of
course
snapes
black
eyes
glittered
as
they
fell
on
Rita
skeeter's
article
potter
has
to
keep
up
with
his
press
cuttings
the
dungeon
rang
with
the
Slytherins
laughter
and
an
unpleasant
smile
curled
snape's
thin
mouth
to
harry's
fury
he
began
to
read
the
article
aloud
harry
potter's
Secret
Heartache
dear
dear
potter
what's
ailing
you
now
a
boy
like
no
other
perhaps
harry
could
feel
his
face
burning
snape
was
pausing
at
the
end
of
every
sentence
to
allow
the
Slytherins
a
hearty
laugh
the
article
sounded
ten
times
worse
when
read
by
Snape
even
Hermione
was
blushing
scarlet
now
harry
potter's
wellwishers
must
hope
that
next
time
he
bestows
his
heart
upon
a
worthier
candidate
how
very
touching
sneered
Snape
rolling
up
the
magazine
to
continued
gales
of
laughter
from
the
Slytherins
well
I
think
I
had
better
separate
the
three
of
you
so
you
can
keep
your
minds
on
your
potions
rather
than
on
your
tangled
love
lives
weasley
you
stay
here
miss
Granger
over
there
beside
Miss
Parkinson
potter
that
table
in
front
of
my
desk
move
now
furious
Harry
threw
his
ingredients
and
his
bag
into
his
cauldron
and
dragged
it
up
to
the
front
of
the
dungeon
to
the
empty
table
snape
followed
sat
down
at
his
desk
and
watched
Harry
unload
his
cauldron
determined
not
to
look
at
Snape
Harry
resumed
the
mashing
of
his
scarab
beetles
imagining
each
one
to
have
snape's
face
all
this
press
attention
seems
to
have
inflated
your
already
overlarge
head
potter
said
Snape
quietly
once
the
rest
of
the
class
had
settled
down
again
harry
didn't
answer
he
knew
Snape
was
trying
to
provoke
him
he
had
done
this
before
no
doubt
he
was
hoping
for
an
excuse
to
take
a
round
fifty
points
from
Gryffindor
before
the
end
of
the
class
you
might
be
laboring
under
the
delusion
that
the
entire
wizarding
world
is
impressed
with
you
Snape
went
on
so
quietly
that
no
one
else
could
hear
him
Harry
continued
to
pound
his
scarab
beetles
even
though
he
had
already
reduced
them
to
a
very
fine
powder
but
I
don't
care
how
many
times
your
picture
appears
in
the
papers
to
me
potter
you
are
nothing
but
a
nasty
little
boy
who
considers
rules
to
be
beneath
him
harry
tipped
the
powdered
beetles
into
his
cauldron
and
started
cutting
up
his
ginger
roots
his
hands
were
shaking
slightly
out
of
anger
but
he
kept
his
eyes
down
as
though
he
couldn't
hear
what
Snape
was
saying
to
him
so
I
give
you
fair
warning
Potter
Snape
continued
in
a
sorter
and
more
dangerous
voice
pintsized
celebrity
or
not
if
I
catch
you
breaking
into
my
office
one
more
time
i
haven't
been
anywhere
near
your
office
said
Harry
angrily
forgetting
his
feigned
deafness
don't
lie
to
me
Snape
hissed
his
fathomless
black
eyes
boring
into
Harrys
boomslang
skin
gillyweed
both
come
from
my
private
stores
and
I
know
who
stole
them
harry
stared
back
at
Snape
determined
not
to
blink
or
to
look
guilty
in
truth
he
hadn't
stolen
either
of
these
things
from
Snape
hermione
had
taken
the
boomslang
skin
back
in
their
second
year
they
had
needed
it
for
the
Polyjuice
Potion
and
while
Snape
had
suspected
Harry
at
the
time
he
had
never
been
able
to
prove
it
dobby
of
course
had
stolen
the
gillyweed
i
don't
know
what
you're
talking
about
Harry
lied
coldly
you
were
out
of
bed
on
the
night
my
office
was
broken
into
snape
hissed
i
know
it
potter
now
MadEye
Moody
might
have
joined
your
fan
club
but
I
will
not
tolerate
your
behavior
one
more
nighttime
stroll
into
my
office
Potter
and
you
will
pay
right
said
Harry
coolly
turning
back
to
his
ginger
roots
i'll
bear
that
in
mind
if
I
ever
get
the
urge
to
go
in
there
snape's
eyes
flashed
he
plunged
a
hand
into
the
inside
of
his
black
robes
for
one
wild
moment
harry
thought
Snape
was
about
to
pull
out
his
wand
and
curse
him
then
he
saw
that
Snape
had
drawn
out
a
small
crystal
bottle
of
a
completely
clear
potion
harry
stared
at
it
do
you
know
what
this
is
potter
snape
said
his
eyes
glittering
dangerously
again
no
said
Harry
with
complete
honesty
this
time
it
is
Veritaserum
a
Truth
Potion
so
powerful
that
three
drops
would
have
you
spilling
your
innermost
secrets
for
this
entire
class
to
hear
said
Snape
viciously
now
the
use
of
this
potion
is
controlled
by
very
strict
Ministry
guidelines
but
unless
you
watch
your
step
you
might
just
find
that
my
hand
slips
he
shook
the
crystal
bottle
slightly
right
over
your
evening
pumpkin
juice
and
then
potter
then
we'll
find
out
whether
you've
been
in
my
office
or
not
harry
said
nothing
he
turned
back
to
his
ginger
roots
once
more
picked
up
his
knife
and
started
slicing
them
again
he
didn't
like
the
sound
of
that
Truth
Potion
at
all
nor
would
he
put
it
past
Snape
to
slip
him
some
he
repressed
a
shudder
at
the
thought
of
what
might
come
spilling
out
of
his
mouth
if
Snape
did
it
quite
apart
from
landing
a
whole
lot
of
people
in
trouble
Hermione
and
Dobby
for
a
start
there
were
all
the
other
things
he
was
concealing
like
the
fact
that
he
was
in
contact
with
Sirius
and
his
insides
squirmed
at
the
thought
how
he
felt
about
Cho
he
tipped
his
ginger
roots
into
the
cauldron
too
and
wondered
whether
he
ought
to
take
a
leaf
out
of
Moody
s
book
and
start
drinking
only
from
a
private
hip
flask
there
was
a
knock
on
the
dungeon
door
enter
said
Snape
in
his
usual
voice
the
class
looked
around
as
the
door
opened
professor
Karkaroff
came
in
everyone
watched
him
as
he
walked
up
toward
snape's
desk
he
was
twisting
his
finger
around
his
goatee
and
looking
agitated
we
need
to
talk
said
Karkaroff
abruptly
when
he
had
reached
Snape
he
seemed
so
determined
that
nobody
should
hear
what
he
was
saying
that
he
was
barely
opening
his
lips
it
was
as
though
he
were
a
rather
poor
ventriloquist
harry
kept
his
eyes
on
his
ginger
roots
listening
hard
i'll
talk
to
you
after
my
lesson
Karkaroff
Snape
muttered
but
Karkaroff
interrupted
him
i
want
to
talk
now
while
you
can't
slip
off
Severus
you've
been
avoiding
me
after
the
lesson
Snape
snapped
under
the
pretext
of
holding
up
a
measuring
cup
to
see
if
he'd
poured
out
enough
armadillo
bile
Harry
sneaked
a
sidelong
glance
at
the
pair
of
them
karkaroff
looked
extremely
worried
and
Snape
looked
angry
karkaroff
hovered
behind
snape's
desk
for
the
rest
of
the
double
period
he
seemed
intent
on
preventing
Snape
from
slipping
away
at
the
end
of
class
keen
to
hear
what
Karkaroff
wanted
to
say
Harry
deliberately
knocked
over
his
bottle
of
armadillo
bile
with
two
minutes
to
go
to
the
bell
which
gave
him
an
excuse
to
duck
down
behind
his
cauldron
and
mop
up
while
the
rest
of
the
class
moved
noisily
toward
the
door
what's
so
urgent
he
heard
Snape
hiss
at
Karkaroff
this
said
Karkaroff
and
Harry
peering
around
the
edge
of
his
cauldron
saw
Karkaroff
pull
up
the
lefthand
sleeve
of
his
robe
and
show
Snape
something
on
his
inner
forearm
well
said
Karkaroff
still
making
every
effort
not
to
move
his
lips
do
you
see
it's
never
been
this
clear
never
since
put
it
away
snarled
Snape
his
black
eyes
sweeping
the
classroom
but
you
must
have
noticed
Karkaroff
began
in
an
agitated
voice
we
can
talk
later
Karkaroff
spat
Snape
potter
what
are
you
doing
clearing
up
my
armadillo
bile
Professor
said
Harry
innocently
straightening
up
and
showing
Snape
the
sodden
rag
he
was
holding
karkaroff
turned
on
his
heel
and
strode
out
of
the
dungeon
he
looked
both
worried
and
angry
not
wanting
to
remain
alone
with
an
exceptionally
angry
Snape
Harry
threw
his
books
and
ingredients
back
into
his
bag
and
left
at
top
speed
to
tell
Ron
and
Hermione
what
he
had
just
witnessed
they
left
the
castle
at
noon
the
next
day
to
find
a
weak
silver
sun
shining
down
upon
the
grounds
the
weather
was
milder
than
it
had
been
all
year
and
by
the
time
they
arrived
in
Hogsmeade
all
three
of
them
had
taken
off
their
cloaks
and
thrown
them
over
their
shoulders
the
food
Sirius
had
told
them
to
bring
was
in
harry's
bag
they
had
sneaked
a
dozen
chicken
legs
a
loaf
of
bread
and
a
flask
of
pumpkin
juice
from
the
lunch
table
they
went
into
Gladrags
Wizardwear
to
buy
a
present
for
Dobby
where
they
had
fun
selecting
the
most
lurid
socks
they
could
find
including
a
pair
patterned
with
flashing
gold
and
silver
stars
and
another
that
screamed
loudly
when
they
became
too
smelly
then
at
half
past
one
they
made
their
way
up
the
High
Street
past
Dervish
and
Banges
and
out
toward
the
edge
of
the
village
harry
had
never
been
in
this
direction
before
the
winding
lane
was
leading
them
out
into
the
wild
countryside
around
Hogsmeade
the
cottages
were
fewer
here
and
their
gardens
larger
they
were
walking
toward
the
foot
of
the
mountain
in
whose
shadow
Hogsmeade
lay
then
they
turned
a
corner
and
saw
a
stile
at
the
end
of
the
lane
waiting
for
them
its
front
paws
on
the
topmost
bar
was
a
very
large
shaggy
black
dog
which
was
carrying
some
newspapers
in
its
mouth
and
looking
very
familiar
hello
Sirius
said
Harry
when
they
had
reached
him
the
black
dog
sniffed
harry's
bag
eagerly
wagged
its
tail
once
then
turned
and
began
to
trot
away
from
them
across
the
scrubby
patch
of
ground
that
rose
to
meet
the
rocky
foot
of
the
mountain
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
climbed
over
the
stile
and
followed
sirius
led
them
to
the
very
foot
of
the
mountain
where
the
ground
was
covered
with
boulders
and
rocks
it
was
easy
for
him
with
his
four
paws
but
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
were
soon
out
of
breath
they
followed
Sirius
higher
up
onto
the
mountain
itself
for
nearly
half
an
hour
they
climbed
a
steep
winding
and
stony
path
following
sirius's
wagging
tail
sweating
in
the
sun
the
shoulder
straps
of
harry's
bag
cutting
into
his
shoulders
then
at
last
Sirius
slipped
out
of
sight
and
when
they
reached
the
place
where
he
had
vanished
they
saw
a
narrow
fissure
in
the
rock
they
squeezed
into
it
and
found
themselves
in
a
cool
dimly
lit
cave
tethered
at
the
end
of
it
one
end
of
his
rope
around
a
large
rock
was
Buckbeak
the
hippogriff
half
gray
horse
half
giant
eagle
buckbeak's
fierce
orange
eye
flashed
at
the
sight
of
them
all
three
of
them
bowed
low
to
him
and
after
regarding
them
imperiously
for
a
moment
Buckbeak
bent
his
scaly
front
knees
and
allowed
Hermione
to
rush
forward
and
stroke
his
feathery
neck
harry
however
was
looking
at
the
black
dog
which
had
just
turned
into
his
godfather
sirius
was
wearing
ragged
gray
robes
the
same
ones
he
had
been
wearing
when
he
had
left
Azkaban
his
black
hair
was
longer
than
it
had
been
when
he
had
appeared
in
the
fire
and
it
was
untidy
and
matted
once
more
he
looked
very
thin
chicken
he
said
hoarsely
after
removing
the
old
Daily
Prophets
from
his
mouth
and
throwing
them
down
onto
the
cave
floor
harry
pulled
open
his
bag
and
handed
over
the
bundle
of
chicken
legs
and
bread
thanks
said
Sirius
opening
it
grabbing
a
drumstick
sitting
down
on
the
cave
floor
and
tearing
off
a
large
chunk
with
his
teeth
i've
been
living
off
rats
mostly
can't
steal
too
much
food
from
Hogsmeade
i'd
draw
attention
to
myself
he
grinned
up
at
Harry
but
Harry
returned
the
grin
only
reluctantly
what're
you
doing
here
Sirius
he
said
fulfilling
my
duty
as
godfather
said
Sirius
gnawing
on
the
chicken
bone
in
a
very
doglike
way
don't
worry
about
it
i'm
pretending
to
be
a
lovable
stray
he
was
still
grinning
but
seeing
the
anxiety
in
Harrys
face
said
more
seriously
I
want
to
be
on
the
spot
your
last
letter
well
let's
just
say
things
are
getting
fishier
i've
been
stealing
the
paper
every
time
someone
throws
one
out
and
by
the
looks
of
things
i'm
not
the
only
one
who's
getting
worried
he
nodded
at
the
yellowing
Daily
Prophets
on
the
cave
floor
and
Ron
picked
them
up
and
unfolded
them
harry
however
continued
to
stare
at
Sirius
what
if
they
catch
you
what
if
you're
seen
you
three
and
Dumbledore
are
the
only
ones
around
here
who
know
i'm
an
Animagus
said
Sirius
shrugging
and
continuing
to
devour
the
chicken
leg
ron
nudged
Harry
and
passed
him
the
Daily
Prophets
there
were
two
The
first

said
Harry
slowly
but
he
can't
be
that
ill
if
he
managed
to
get
up
here
my
brothers
crouch's
personal
assistant
Ron
informed
Sirius
he
says
Crouch
is
suffering
from
overwork
mind
you
he
did
look
ill
last
time
I
saw
him
up
close
said
Harry
slowly
still
reading
the
story
the
night
my
name
came
out
of
the
goblet
getting
his
comeuppance
for
sacking
Winky
isn't
he
said
Hermione
an
edge
to
her
voice
she
was
stroking
Buckbeak
who
was
crunching
up
sirius's
chicken
bones
i
bet
he
wishes
he
hadn't
done
it
now
bet
he
feels
the
difference
now
she's
not
there
to
look
after
him
hermione's
obsessed
with
houseelfs
Ron
muttered
to
Sirius
casting
Hermione
a
dark
look
sirius
however
looked
interested
crouch
sacked
his
houseelf
yeah
at
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
said
Harry
and
he
launched
into
the
story
of
the
Dark
mark's
appearance
and
Winky
being
found
with
Harrys
wand
clutched
in
her
hand
and
mr.
crouch's
fury
when
Harry
had
finished
Sirius
was
on
his
feet
again
and
had
started
pacing
up
and
down
the
cave
let
me
get
this
straight
he
said
after
a
while
brandishing
a
fresh
chicken
leg
you
first
saw
the
elfin
the
Top
Box
she
was
saving
Crouch
a
seat
right
right
said
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
together
but
Crouch
didn't
turn
up
for
the
match
no
said
Harry
i
think
he
said
he'd
been
too
busy
sirius
paced
all
around
the
cave
in
silence
then
he
said
Harry
did
you
check
your
pockets
for
your
wand
after
you'd
left
the
Top
Box
erm
harry
thought
hard
no
he
said
finally
i
didn't
need
to
use
it
before
we
got
in
the
forest
and
then
I
put
my
hand
in
my
pocket
and
all
that
was
in
there
were
my
Omnioculars
he
stared
at
Sirius
are
you
saying
whoever
conjured
the
Mark
stole
my
wand
in
the
Top
Box
it's
possible
said
Sirius
winky
didn't
steal
that
wand
hermione
insisted
the
elf
wasn't
the
only
one
in
that
box
said
Sirius
his
brow
furrowed
as
he
continued
to
pace
who
else
was
sitting
behind
you
loads
of
people
said
Harry
some
Bulgarian
ministers
cornelius
Fudge
the
Malfoys
the
Malfoys
said
Ron
suddenly
so
loudly
that
his
voice
echoed
all
around
the
cave
and
Buckbeak
tossed
his
head
nervously
i
bet
it
was
Lucius
Malfoy
anyone
else
said
Sirius
no
one
said
Harry
yes
there
was
there
was
Ludo
Bagman
Hermione
reminded
him
oh
yeah
i
don't
know
anything
about
Bagman
except
that
he
used
to
be
Beater
for
the
Wimbourne
Wasps
said
Sirius
still
pacing
what's
he
like
he's
okay
said
Harry
he
keeps
offering
to
help
me
with
the
Triwizard
Tournament
does
he
now
said
Sirius
frowning
more
deeply
i
wonder
why
he'd
do
that
says
he's
taken
a
liking
to
me
said
Harry
hmm
said
Sirius
looking
thoughtful
we
saw
him
in
the
forest
just
before
the
Dark
Mark
appeared
Hermione
told
Sirius
remember
she
said
to
Harry
and
Ron
yeah
but
he
didn't
stay
in
the
forest
did
he
said
Ron
the
moment
we
told
him
about
the
riot
he
went
off
to
the
campsite
how
d'you
know
hermione
shot
back
how
d'you
know
where
he
Disapparated
to
come
off
it
said
Ron
incredulously
are
you
saying
you
reckon
Ludo
Bagman
conjured
the
Dark
Mark
it's
more
likely
he
did
it
than
Winky
said
Hermione
stubbornly
told
you
said
Ron
looking
meaningfully
at
Sirius
told
you
she's
obsessed
with
house
but
Sirius
held
up
a
hand
to
silence
Ron
when
the
Dark
Mark
had
been
conjured
and
the
elf
had
been
discovered
holding
harry's
wand
what
did
Crouch
do
went
to
look
in
the
bushes
said
Harry
but
there
wasn't
anyone
else
there
of
course
Sirius
muttered
pacing
up
and
down
of
course
he'd
want
to
pin
it
on
anyone
but
his
own
elf
and
then
he
sacked
her
yes
said
Hermione
in
a
heated
voice
he
sacked
her
just
because
she
hadn't
stayed
in
her
tent
and
let
herself
get
trampled
hermione
will
you
give
it
a
rest
with
the
elf
said
Ron
sirius
shook
his
head
and
said
she's
got
the
measure
of
Crouch
better
than
you
have
Ron
if
you
want
to
know
what
a
mans
like
take
a
good
look
at
how
he
treats
his
inferiors
not
his
equals
he
ran
a
hand
over
his
unshaven
face
evidently
thinking
hard
all
these
absences
of
Barty
crouch's
he
goes
to
the
trouble
of
making
sure
his
houseelf
saves
him
a
seat
at
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
but
doesn't
bother
to
turn
up
and
watch
he
works
very
hard
to
reinstate
the
Triwizard
Tournament
and
then
stops
coming
to
that
too
it's
not
like
Crouch
if
he's
ever
taken
a
day
off
work
because
of
illness
before
this
i'll
eat
Buckbeak
d'you
know
Crouch
then
said
Harry
sirius's
face
darkened
he
suddenly
looked
as
menacing
as
he
had
the
night
when
Harry
first
met
him
the
night
when
Harry
still
believed
Sirius
to
be
a
murderer
oh
I
know
Crouch
all
right
he
said
quietly
he
was
the
one
who
gave
the
order
for
me
to
be
sent
to
Azkaban
without
a
trial
what
said
Ron
and
Hermione
together
you're
kidding
said
Harry
no
i'm
not
said
Sirius
taking
another
great
bite
of
chicken
crouch
used
to
be
Head
of
the
Department
of
Magical
Law
Enforcement
didn't
you
know
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
shook
their
heads
he
was
tipped
for
the
next
Minister
of
Magic
said
Sirius
he's
a
great
wizard
Barty
Crouch
powerfully
magical
and
powerhungry
oh
never
a
Voldemort
supporter
he
said
reading
the
look
on
Harrys
face
no
Barty
Crouch
was
always
very
outspoken
against
the
Dark
Side
but
then
a
lot
of
people
who
were
against
the
Dark
Side
well
you
wouldn't
understand
you're
too
young
that's
what
my
dad
said
at
the
World
Cup
said
Ron
with
a
trace
of
irritation
in
his
voice
try
us
why
don't
you
a
grin
flashed
across
sirius's
thin
face
all
right
i'll
try
you
he
walked
once
up
the
cave
back
again
and
then
said
Imagine
that
voldemort's
powerful
now
you
don't
know
who
his
supporters
are
you
don't
know
who's
working
for
him
and
who
isn't
you
know
he
can
control
people
so
that
they
do
terrible
things
without
being
able
to
stop
themselves
you're
scared
for
yourself
and
your
family
and
your
friends
every
week
news
comes
of
more
deaths
more
disappearances
more
torturing
the
Ministry
of
magic's
in
disarray
they
don't
know
what
to
do
they're
trying
to
keep
everything
hidden
from
the
Muggles
but
meanwhile
Muggles
are
dying
too
terror
everywhere
panic
confusion
that's
how
it
used
to
be
well
times
like
that
bring
out
the
best
in
some
people
and
the
worst
in
others
crouch's
principles
might've
been
good
in
the
beginning
I
wouldn't
know
he
rose
quickly
through
the
Ministry
and
he
started
ordering
very
harsh
measures
against
Voldemorts
supporters
the
Aurors
were
given
new
powers
powers
to
kill
rather
than
capture
for
instance
and
I
wasn't
the
only
one
who
was
handed
straight
to
the
dementors
without
trial
crouch
fought
violence
with
violence
and
authorized
the
use
of
the
Unforgivable
Curses
against
suspects
i
would
say
he
became
as
ruthless
and
cruel
as
many
on
the
Dark
Side
he
had
his
supporters
mind
you
plenty
of
people
thought
he
was
going
about
things
the
right
way
and
there
were
a
lot
of
witches
and
wizards
clamoring
for
him
to
take
over
as
Minister
of
Magic
when
Voldemort
disappeared
it
looked
like
only
a
matter
of
time
until
Crouch
got
the
top
job
but
then
something
rather
unfortunate
happened
sirius
smiled
grimly
crouch's
own
son
was
caught
with
a
group
of
Death
Eaters
who'd
managed
to
talk
their
way
out
of
Azkaban
apparently
they
were
trying
to
find
Voldemort
and
return
him
to
power
crouch's
son
was
caught
gasped
Hermione
yep
said
Sirius
throwing
his
chicken
bone
to
Buckbeak
flinging
himself
back
down
on
the
ground
beside
the
loaf
of
bread
and
tearing
it
in
half
nasty
little
shock
for
old
Barty
i'd
imagine
should
have
spent
a
bit
more
time
at
home
with
his
family
shouldn't
he
ought
to
have
left
the
office
early
once
in
a
while
gotten
to
know
his
own
son
he
began
to
wolf
down
large
pieces
of
bread
was
his
son
a
Death
Eater
said
Harry
no
idea
said
Sirius
still
stuffing
down
bread
i
was
in
Azkaban
myself
when
he
was
brought
in
this
is
mostly
stuff
i've
found
out
since
I
got
out
the
boy
was
definitely
caught
in
the
company
of
people
i'd
bet
my
life
were
Death
Eaters
but
he
might
have
been
in
the
wrong
place
at
the
wrong
time
just
like
the
houseelf
did
Crouch
try
and
get
his
son
off
hermione
whispered
sirius
let
out
a
laugh
that
was
much
more
like
a
bark
crouch
let
his
son
off
i
thought
you
had
the
measure
of
him
Hermione
anything
that
threatened
to
tarnish
his
reputation
had
to
go
he
had
dedicated
his
whole
life
to
becoming
Minister
of
Magic
you
saw
him
dismiss
a
devoted
house
elf
because
she
associated
him
with
the
Dark
Mark
again
doesn't
that
tell
you
what
he's
like
crouch's
fatherly
affection
stretched
just
far
enough
to
give
his
son
a
trial
and
by
all
accounts
it
wasn't
much
more
than
an
excuse
for
Crouch
to
show
how
much
he
hated
the
boy
then
he
sent
him
straight
to
Azkaban
he
gave
his
own
son
to
the
dementors
asked
Harry
quietly
that's
right
said
Sirius
and
he
didn't
look
remotely
amused
now
i
saw
the
dementors
bringing
him
in
watched
them
through
the
bars
in
my
cell
door
he
can't
have
been
more
than
nineteen
they
took
him
into
a
cell
near
mine
he
was
screaming
for
his
mother
by
nightfall
he
went
quiet
after
a
few
days
though
they
all
went
quiet
in
the
end
except
when
they
shrieked
in
their
sleep
for
a
moment
the
deadened
look
in
sirius's
eyes
became
more
pronounced
than
ever
as
though
shutters
had
closed
behind
them
so
he's
still
in
Azkaban
harry
said
no
said
Sirius
dully
no
he's
not
in
there
anymore
he
died
about
a
year
after
they
brought
him
in
he
died
he
wasn't
the
only
one
said
Sirius
bitterly
most
go
mad
in
there
and
plenty
stop
eating
in
the
end
they
lose
the
will
to
live
you
could
always
tell
when
a
death
was
coming
because
the
dementors
could
sense
it
they
got
excited
that
boy
looked
pretty
sickly
when
he
arrived
crouch
being
an
important
Ministry
member
he
and
his
wife
were
allowed
a
deathbed
visit
that
was
the
last
time
I
saw
Barty
Crouch
half
carrying
his
wife
past
my
cell
she
died
herself
apparently
shortly
afterward
grief
wasted
away
just
like
the
boy
crouch
never
came
for
his
sons
body
the
dementors
buried
him
outside
the
fortress
I
watched
them
do
it
sirius
threw
aside
the
bread
he
had
just
lifted
to
his
mouth
and
instead
picked
up
the
flask
of
pumpkin
juice
and
drained
it
so
old
Crouch
lost
it
all
just
when
he
thought
he
had
it
made
he
continued
wiping
his
mouth
with
the
back
of
his
hand
one
moment
a
hero
poised
to
become
Minister
of
Magic
next
his
son
dead
his
wife
dead
the
family
name
dishonored
and
so
i've
heard
since
I
escaped
a
big
drop
in
popularity
once
the
boy
had
died
people
started
feeling
a
bit
more
sympathetic
toward
the
son
and
started
asking
how
a
nice
young
lad
from
a
good
family
had
gone
so
badly
astray
the
conclusion
was
that
his
father
never
cared
much
for
him
so
Cornelius
Fudge
got
the
top
job
and
Crouch
was
shunted
sideways
into
the
Department
of
International
Magical
Cooperation
there
was
a
long
silence
harry
was
thinking
of
the
way
crouch's
eyes
had
bulged
as
he'd
looked
down
at
his
disobedient
houseelf
back
in
the
wood
at
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
this
then
must
have
been
why
Crouch
had
overreacted
to
Winky
being
found
beneath
the
Dark
Mark
it
had
brought
back
memories
of
his
son
and
the
old
scandal
and
his
fall
from
grace
at
the
Ministry
moody
says
Crouch
is
obsessed
with
catching
Dark
wizards
Harry
told
Sirius
yeah
i've
heard
it's
become
a
bit
of
a
mania
with
him
said
Sirius
nodding
if
you
ask
me
he
still
thinks
he
can
bring
back
the
old
popularity
by
catching
one
more
Death
Eater
and
he
sneaked
up
here
to
search
snape's
office
s
aid
Ron
triumphantly
looking
at
Hermione
yes
and
that
doesn't
make
sense
at
all
said
Sirius
yeah
it
does
said
Ron
excitedly
but
Sirius
shook
his
head
listen
if
Crouch
wants
to
investigate
Snape
why
hasn't
he
been
coming
to
judge
the
tournament
it
would
be
an
ideal
excuse
to
make
regular
visits
to
Hogwarts
and
keep
an
eye
on
him
so
you
think
Snape
could
be
up
to
something
then
asked
Harry
but
Hermione
broke
in
look
I
don't
care
what
you
say
Dumbledore
trusts
Snape
oh
give
it
a
rest
Hermione
said
Ron
impatiently
i
know
Dumbledores
brilliant
and
everything
but
that
doesn't
mean
a
really
clever
Dark
wizard
couldn't
fool
him
why
did
Snape
save
harry's
life
in
the
first
year
then
why
didn't
he
just
let
him
die
i
dunno
maybe
he
thought
Dumbledore
would
kick
him
out
what
d'you
think
Sirius
harry
said
loudly
and
Ron
and
Hermione
stopped
bickering
to
listen
i
think
they've
both
got
a
point
said
Sirius
looking
thoughtfully
at
Ron
and
Hermione
ever
since
I
found
out
Snape
was
teaching
here
i've
wondered
why
Dumbledore
hired
him
snape's
always
been
fascinated
by
the
Dark
Arts
he
was
famous
for
it
at
school
slimy
oily
greasyhaired
kid
he
was
Sirius
added
and
Harry
and
Ron
grinned
at
each
other
snape
knew
more
curses
when
he
arrived
at
school
than
half
the
kids
in
seventh
year
and
he
was
part
of
a
gang
of
Slytherins
who
nearly
all
turned
out
to
be
Death
Eaters
sirius
held
up
his
fingers
and
began
ticking
off
names
rosier
and
Wilkes
they
were
both
killed
by
Aurors
the
year
before
Voldemort
fell
the
Lestranges
they're
a
married
couple
they're
in
Azkaban
avery
from
what
i've
heard
he
wormed
his
way
out
of
trouble
by
saying
he'd
been
acting
under
the
Imperius
Curse
he's
still
at
large
but
as
far
as
I
know
Snape
was
never
even
accused
of
being
a
Death
Eater
not
that
that
means
much
plenty
of
them
were
never
caught
and
Snape
s
certainly
clever
and
cunning
enough
to
keep
himself
out
of
trouble
snape
knows
Karkaroff
pretty
well
but
he
wants
to
keep
that
quiet
said
Ron
yeah
you
should've
seen
snape's
face
when
Karkaroff
turned
up
in
Potions
yesterday
said
Harry
quickly
karkaroff
wanted
to
talk
to
Snape
he
says
snape's
been
avoiding
him
karkaroff
looked
really
worried
he
showed
Snape
something
on
his
arm
but
I
couldn't
see
what
it
was
he
showed
Snape
something
on
his
arm
said
Sirius
looking
frankly
bewildered
he
ran
his
fingers
distractedly
through
his
filthy
hair
then
shrugged
again
well
i've
no
idea
what
that's
about
but
if
Karkaroff
s
genuinely
worried
and
he's
going
to
Snape
for
answers
sirius
stared
at
the
cave
wall
then
made
a
grimace
of
frustration
there's
still
the
fact
that
Dumbledore
trusts
Snape
and
I
know
Dumbledore
trusts
where
a
lot
of
other
people
wouldn't
but
I
just
can't
see
him
letting
Snape
teach
at
Hogwarts
if
he'd
ever
worked
for
Voldemort
why
are
Moody
and
Crouch
so
keen
to
get
into
Snapes
office
then
said
Ron
stubbornly
well
said
Sirius
slowly
I
wouldn't
put
it
past
MadEye
to
have
searched
every
single
teacher's
office
when
he
got
to
Hogwarts
he
takes
his
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
seriously
Moody
i'm
not
sure
he
trusts
anyone
at
all
and
after
the
things
he's
seen
it's
not
surprising
i'll
say
this
for
Moody
though
he
never
killed
if
he
could
help
it
always
brought
people
in
alive
where
possible
he
was
tough
but
he
never
descended
to
the
level
of
the
Death
Eaters
crouch
though
he's
a
different
matter
is
he
really
ill
if
he
is
why
did
he
make
the
effort
to
drag
himself
up
to
snape's
office
and
if
he's
not
what's
he
up
to
what
was
he
doing
at
the
World
Cup
that
was
so
important
he
didn't
turn
up
in
the
Top
Box
what's
he
been
doing
while
he
should
have
been
judging
the
tournament
sirius
lapsed
into
silence
still
staring
at
the
cave
wall
buckbeak
was
ferreting
around
on
the
rocky
floor
looking
for
bones
he
might
have
overlooked
finally
Sirius
looked
up
at
Ron
you
say
your
brother
s
crouch's
personal
assistant
any
chance
you
could
ask
him
if
he's
seen
Crouch
lately
i
can
try
said
Ron
doubtfully
better
not
make
it
sound
like
I
reckon
Crouch
is
up
to
anything
dodgy
though
percy
loves
Crouch
and
you
might
try
and
find
out
whether
they've
got
any
leads
on
Bertha
Jorkins
while
you're
at
it
said
Sirius
gesturing
to
the
second
copy
of
the
Daily
Prophet
bagman
told
me
they
hadn't
said
Harry
yes
he's
quoted
in
the
article
in
there
said
Sirius
nodding
at
the
paper
blustering
on
about
how
bad
bertha's
memory
is
well
maybe
she's
changed
since
I
knew
her
but
the
Bertha
I
knew
wasn't
forgetful
at
all
quite
the
reverse
she
was
a
bit
dim
but
she
had
an
excellent
memory
for
gossip
it
used
to
get
her
into
a
lot
of
trouble
she
never
knew
when
to
keep
her
mouth
shut
i
can
see
her
being
a
bit
of
a
liability
at
the
Ministry
of
Magic
maybe
that's
why
Bagman
didn't
bother
to
look
for
her
for
so
long
sirius
heaved
an
enormous
sigh
and
rubbed
his
shadowed
eyes
what's
the
time
harry
checked
his
watch
then
remembered
it
hadn't
been
working
since
it
had
spent
over
an
hour
in
the
lake
it's
half
past
three
said
Hermione
you'd
better
get
back
to
school
Sirius
said
getting
to
his
feet
now
listen
he
looked
particularly
hard
at
Harry
i
don't
want
you
lot
sneaking
out
of
school
to
see
me
all
right
just
send
notes
to
me
here
i
still
want
to
hear
about
anything
odd
but
you're
not
to
go
leaving
Hogwarts
without
permission
it
would
be
an
ideal
opportunity
for
someone
to
attack
you
no
one's
tried
to
attack
me
so
far
except
a
dragon
and
a
couple
of
grindylows
harry
said
but
Sirius
scowled
at
him
i
don't
care
i'll
breathe
freely
again
when
this
tournament's
over
and
that's
not
until
June
and
don't
forget
if
you're
talking
about
me
among
yourselves
call
me
Snuffles
okay
he
handed
Harry
the
empty
napkin
and
flask
and
went
to
pat
Buckbeak
goodbye
i'll
walk
to
the
edge
of
the
village
with
you
said
Sirius
see
if
I
can
scrounge
another
paper
he
transformed
into
the
great
black
dog
before
they
left
the
cave
and
they
walked
back
down
the
mountainside
with
him
across
the
boulderstrewn
ground
and
back
to
the
stile
here
he
allowed
each
of
them
to
pat
him
on
the
head
before
turning
and
setting
off
at
a
run
around
the
outskirts
of
the
village
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
made
their
way
back
into
Hogsmeade
and
up
toward
Hogwarts
wonder
if
Percy
knows
all
that
stuff
about
Crouch
ron
said
as
they
walked
up
the
drive
to
the
castle
but
maybe
he
doesn't
care
it'd
probably
just
make
him
admire
Crouch
even
more
yeah
Percy
loves
rules
he'd
just
say
Crouch
was
refusing
to
break
them
for
his
own
son
percy
would
never
throw
any
of
his
family
to
the
dementors
said
Hermione
severely
i
don't
know
said
Ron
if
he
thought
we
were
standing
in
the
way
of
his
career
percy's
really
ambitious
you
know
they
walked
up
the
stone
steps
into
the
entrance
hall
where
the
delicious
smells
of
dinner
wafted
toward
them
from
the
Great
Hall
poor
old
Snuffles
said
Ron
breathing
deeply
he
must
really
like
you
harry
imagine
having
to
live
off
rats
chapter
twentyeight
the
madness
of
mr
crouch
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
went
up
to
the
Owlery
after
breakfast
on
Sunday
to
send
a
letter
to
Percy
asking
as
Sirius
had
suggested
whether
he
had
seen
Mr
crouch
lately
they
used
Hedwig
because
it
had
been
so
long
since
she'd
had
a
job
when
they
had
watched
her
fly
out
of
sight
through
the
Owlery
window
they
proceeded
down
to
the
kitchen
to
give
Dobby
his
new
socks
the
houseelves
gave
them
a
very
cheery
welcome
bowing
and
curtsying
and
bustling
around
making
tea
again
dobby
was
ecstatic
about
his
present
harry
Potter
is
too
good
to
Dobby
he
squeaked
wiping
large
tears
out
of
his
enormous
eyes
you
saved
my
life
with
that
gillyweed
Dobby
you
really
did
said
Harry
no
chance
of
more
of
those
eclairs
is
there
said
Ron
who
was
looking
around
at
the
beaming
and
bowing
houseelves
you've
just
had
breakfast
said
Hermione
irritably
but
a
great
silver
platter
of
eclairs
was
already
zooming
toward
them
supported
by
four
elves
we
should
get
some
stuff
to
send
up
to
Snuffles
Harry
muttered
good
idea
said
Ron
give
Pig
something
to
do
you
couldn't
give
us
a
bit
of
extra
food
could
you
he
said
to
the
surrounding
elves
and
they
bowed
delightedly
and
hurried
off
to
get
some
more
dobby
where's
Winky
said
Hermione
who
was
looking
around
winky
is
over
there
by
the
fire
miss
said
Dobby
quietly
his
ears
drooping
slightly
oh
dear
said
Hermione
as
she
spotted
Winky
harry
looked
over
at
the
fireplace
too
winky
was
sitting
on
the
same
stool
as
last
time
but
she
had
allowed
herself
to
become
so
filthy
that
she
was
not
immediately
distinguishable
from
the
smokeblackened
brick
behind
her
her
clothes
were
ragged
and
unwashed
she
was
clutching
a
bottle
of
butterbeer
and
swaying
slightly
on
her
stool
staring
into
the
fire
as
they
watched
her
she
gave
an
enormous
hiccup
winky
is
getting
through
six
bottles
a
day
now
Dobby
whispered
to
Harry
well
it's
not
strong
that
stuff
Harry
said
but
Dobby
shook
his
head
tis
strong
for
a
houseelf
sir
he
said
winky
hiccuped
again
the
elves
who
had
brought
the
eclairs
gave
her
disapproving
looks
as
they
returned
to
work
winky
is
pining
Harry
Potter
Dobby
whispered
sadly
winky
wants
to
go
home
winky
still
thinks
mr.
Crouch
is
her
master
sir
and
nothing
Dobby
says
will
persuade
her
that
Professor
Dumbledore
is
her
master
now
hey
Winky
said
Harry
struck
by
a
sudden
inspiration
walking
over
to
her
and
bending
down
you
don't
know
what
mr.
Crouch
might
be
up
to
do
you
because
he's
stopped
turning
up
to
judge
the
Triwizard
Tournament
winky's
eyes
flickered
her
enormous
pupils
focused
on
Harry
she
swayed
slightly
again
and
then
said
M
Master
is
stopped
hic
coming
yeah
said
Harry
we
haven't
seen
him
since
the
first
task
the
Daily
prophet's
saying
he's
ill
winky
swayed
some
more
staring
blurrily
at
Harry
master
hic
ill
her
bottom
lip
began
to
tremble
but
we're
not
sure
if
that's
true
said
Hermione
quickly
master
is
needing
his
hie
Winky
whimpered
the
elf
master
cannot
hic
manage
hic
all
by
himself
other
people
manage
to
do
their
own
housework
you
know
Winky
Hermione
said
severely
winky
hic
is
not
only
hic
doing
housework
for
mr.
Crouch
winky
squeaked
indignantly
swaying
worse
than
ever
and
slopping
butterbeer
down
her
already
heavily
stained
blouse
master
is
hic
trusting
Winky
with
hic
the
most
important
hic
the
most
secret
what
said
Harry
but
Winky
shook
her
head
very
hard
spilling
more
butterbeer
down
herself
winky
keeps
hic
her
master's
secrets
she
said
mutinously
swaying
very
heavily
now
frowning
up
at
Harry
with
her
eyes
crossed
you
is
hic
nosing
you
is
winky
must
not
talk
like
that
to
Harry
Potter
said
Dobby
angrily
harry
Potter

brave
and
noble
and
Harry
Potter
is
not
nosy
he
is
nosing
hic
into
my
master's
hic
private
and
secret
hic
Winky
is
a
good
houseelf
hic
Winky
keeps
her
silence
hic
people
trying
to
hic
pry
and
poke
hic
winky's
eyelids
drooped
and
suddenly
without
warning
she
slid
off
her
stool
into
the
hearth
snoring
loudly
the
empty
bottle
of
butterbeer
rolled
away
across
the
stoneflagged
floor
half
a
dozen
houseelves
came
hurrying
forward
looking
disgusted
one
of
them
picked
up
the
bottle
the
others
covered
Winky
with
a
large
checked
tablecloth
and
tucked
the
ends
in
neatly
hiding
her
from
view
we
is
sorry
you
had
to
see
that
sirs
and
miss
squeaked
a
nearby
elf
shaking
his
head
and
looking
very
ashamed
we
is
hoping
you
will
not
judge
us
all
by
Winky
sirs
and
miss
she's
unhappy
said
Hermione
exasperated
why
don't
you
try
and
cheer
her
up
instead
of
covering
her
up
begging
your
pardon
miss
said
the
houseelf
bowing
deeply
again
but
house
elves
has
no
right
to
be
unhappy
when
there
is
work
to
be
done
and
masters
to
be
served
oh
for
heavens
sake
hermione
cried
listen
to
me
all
of
you
you've
got
just
as
much
right
as
wizards
to
be
unhappy
you've
got
the
right
to
wages
and
holidays
and
proper
clothes
you
don't
have
to
do
everything
you're
told
look
at
Dobby
miss
will
please
keep
Dobby
out
of
this
Dobby
mumbled
looking
scared
the
cheery
smiles
had
vanished
from
the
faces
of
the
houseelves
around
the
kitchen
they
were
suddenly
looking
at
Hermione
as
though
she
were
mad
and
dangerous
we
has
your
extra
food
squeaked
an
elf
at
harry's
elbow
and
he
shoved
a
large
ham
a
dozen
cakes
and
some
fruit
into
harry's
arms
goodbye
the
houseelves
crowded
around
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
and
began
shunting
them
out
of
the
kitchen
many
little
hands
pushing
in
the
smalls
of
their
backs
thank
you
for
the
socks
Harry
Potter
dobby
called
miserably
from
the
hearth
where
he
was
standing
next
to
the
lumpy
tablecloth
that
was
Winky
you
couldn't
keep
your
mouth
shut
could
you
Hermione
said
Ron
angrily
as
the
kitchen
door
slammed
shut
behind
them
they
won't
want
us
visiting
them
now
we
could've
tried
to
get
more
stuff
out
of
Winky
about
Crouch
oh
as
if
you
care
about
that
scoffed
Hermione
you
only
like
coming
down
here
for
the
food
it
was
an
irritable
sort
of
day
after
that
harry
got
so
tired
of
Ron
and
Hermione
sniping
at
each
other
over
their
homework
in
the
common
room
that
he
took
sirius's
food
up
to
the
Owlery
that
evening
on
his
own
pigwidgeon
was
much
too
small
to
carry
an
entire
ham
up
to
the
mountain
by
himself
so
Harry
enlisted
the
help
of
two
school
screech
owls
as
well
when
they
had
set
off
into
the
dusk
looking
extremely
odd
carrying
the
large
package
between
them
harry
leaned
on
the
windowsill
looking
out
at
the
grounds
at
the
dark
rustling
treetops
of
the
Forbidden
Forest
and
the
rippling
sails
of
the
Durmstrang
ship
an
eagle
owl
flew
through
the
coil
of
smoke
rising
from
Hagrids
chimney
it
soared
toward
the
castle
around
the
Owlery
and
out
of
sight
looking
down
Harry
saw
Hagrid
digging
energetically
in
front
of
his
cabin
harry
wondered
what
he
was
doing
it
looked
as
though
he
were
making
a
new
vegetable
patch
as
he
watched
Madame
Maxime
emerged
from
the
Beauxbatons
carriage
and
walked
over
to
Hagrid
she
appeared
to
be
trying
to
engage
him
in
conversation
hagrid
leaned
upon
his
spade
but
did
not
seem
keen
to
prolong
their
talk
because
Madame
Maxime
returned
to
the
carriage
shortly
afterward
unwilling
to
go
back
to
Gryffindor
Tower
and
listen
to
Ron
and
Hermione
snarling
at
each
other
Harry
watched
Hagrid
digging
until
the
darkness
swallowed
him
and
the
owls
around
Harry
began
to
awake
swooshing
past
him
into
the
night
by
breakfast
the
next
day
ron's
and
hermione's
bad
moods
had
burnt
out
and
to
Harrys
relief
ron's
dark
predictions
that
the
houseelves
would
send
substandard
food
up
to
the
Gryffindor
table
because
Hermione
had
insulted
them
proved
false
the
bacon
eggs
and
kippers
were
quite
as
good
as
usual
when
the
post
owls
arrived
Hermione
looked
up
eagerly
she
seemed
to
be
expecting
something
percy
won't've
had
time
to
answer
yet
said
Ron
we
only
sent
Hedwig
yesterday
no
it's
not
that
said
Hermione
i've
taken
out
a
subscription
to
the
Daily
Prophet
i'm
getting
sick
of
finding
everything
out
from
the
Slytherins
good
thinking
said
Harry
also
looking
up
at
the
owls
hey
Hermione
I
think
you're
in
luck
a
gray
owl
was
soaring
down
toward
Hermione
it
hasn't
got
a
newspaper
though
she
said
looking
disappointed
it's
but
to
her
bewilderment
the
gray
owl
landed
in
front
of
her
plate
closely
followed
by
four
barn
owls
a
brown
owl
and
a
tawny
how
many
subscriptions
did
you
take
out
said
Harry
seizing
hermione's
goblet
before
it
was
knocked
over
by
the
cluster
of
owls
all
of
whom
were
jostling
close
to
her
trying
to
deliver
their
own
letter
first
what
on
earth
hermione
said
taking
the
letter
from
the
gray
owl
opening
it
and
starting
to
read
oh
really
she
sputtered
going
rather
red
what's
up
said
Ron
it's
oh
how
ridiculous
she
thrust
the
letter
at
Harry
who
saw
that
it
was
not
handwritten
but
composed
from
pasted
letters
that
seemed
to
have
been
cut
out
of
the
Daily
Prophet
you
are
A
wicked
girl
harry
potter
deserves
better
go
back
where
you
came
from
muggle
they're
all
like
it
said
Hermione
desperately
opening
one
letter
after
another
harry
Potter
can
do
much
better
than
the
likes
of
you
you
deserve
to
be
boiled
in
frog
spawn
ouch
she
had
opened
the
last
envelope
and
yellowishgreen
liquid
smelling
strongly
of
petrol
gushed
over
her
hands
which
began
to
erupt
in
large
yellow
boils
undiluted
bubotuber
pus
said
Ron
picking
up
the
envelope
gingerly
and
sniffing
it
ow
said
Hermione
tears
starting
in
her
eyes
as
she
tried
to
rub
the
pus
off
her
hands
with
a
napkin
but
her
fingers
were
now
so
thickly
covered
in
painful
sores
that
it
looked
as
though
she
were
wearing
a
pair
of
thick
knobbly
gloves
you'd
better
get
up
to
the
hospital
wing
said
Harry
as
the
owls
around
Hermione
took
flight
we'll
tell
Professor
Sprout
where
you've
gone
i
warned
her
said
Ron
as
Hermione
hurried
out
of
the
Great
Hall
cradling
her
hands
i
warned
her
not
to
annoy
Rita
Skeeter
look
at
this
one
he
read
out
one
of
the
letters
Hermione
had
left
behind
I
read
In
Witch
Weekly
about
how
you
are
playing
Harry
Potter
false
and
that
boy
has
had
enough
hardship
and
I
will
be
sending
you
a
curse
by
next
post
as
soon
as
I
can
find
a
big
enough
envelope
blimey
she'd
better
watch
out
for
herself
hermione
didn't
turn
up
for
Herbology
as
Harry
and
Ron
left
the
greenhouse
for
their
Care
of
Magical
Creatures
class
they
saw
Malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
descending
the
stone
steps
of
the
castle
pansy
Parkinson
was
whispering
and
giggling
behind
them
with
her
gang
of
Slytherin
girls
catching
sight
of
Harry
Pansy
called
Potter
have
you
split
up
with
your
girlfriend
why
was
she
so
upset
at
breakfast
harry
ignored
her
he
didn't
want
to
give
her
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
how
much
trouble
the
Witch
Weekly
article
had
caused
hagrid
who
had
told
them
last
lesson
that
they
had
finished
with
unicorns
was
waiting
for
them
outside
his
cabin
with
a
fresh
supply
of
open
crates
at
his
feet
harrys
heart
sank
at
the
sight
of
the
crates
surely
not
another
skrewt
hatching
but
when
he
got
near
enough
to
see
inside
he
found
himself
looking
at
a
number
of
flurry
black
creatures
with
long
snouts
their
front
paws
were
curiously
flat
like
spades
and
they
were
blinking
up
at
the
class
looking
politely
puzzled
at
all
the
attention
these're
nifflers
said
Hagrid
when
the
class
had
gathered
around
yeh
find
em
down
mines
mostly
they
like
sparkly
stuff
there
yeh
go
look
one
of
the
nifflers
had
suddenly
leapt
up
and
attempted
to
bite
Pansy
parkinson's
watch
off
her
wrist
she
shrieked
and
jumped
backward
useful
little
treasure
detectors
said
Hagrid
happily
thought
we'd
have
some
fun
with
em
today
see
over
there
he
pointed
at
the
large
patch
of
freshly
turned
earth
Harry
had
watched
him
digging
from
the
Owlery
window
i've
buried
some

harry
took
off
his
watch
which
he
was
only
wearing
out
of
habit
as
it
didn't
work
anymore
and
stuffed
it
into
his
pocket
then
he
picked
up
a
niffler
it
put
its
long
snout
in
harry's
ear
and
sniffed
enthusiastically
it
was
really
quite
cuddly
hang
on
said
Hagrid
looking
down
into
the
crate
there's
a
spare
niffler
here
who's
missin
where's
Hermione
she
had
to
go
to
the
hospital
wing
said
Ron
we'll
explain
later
Harry
muttered
Pansy
Parkinson
was
listening
it
was
easily
the
most
fun
they
had
ever
had
in
Care
of
Magical
Creatures
the
nifflers
dived
in
and
out
of
the
patch
of
earth
as
though
it
were
water
each
scurrying
back
to
the
student
who
had
released
it
and
spitting
gold
into
their
hands
ron's
was
particularly
efficient
it
had
soon
filled
his
lap
with
coins
can
you
buy
these
as
pets
Hagrid
he
asked
excitedly
as
his
niffler
dived
back
into
the
soil
splattering
his
robes
yer
mum
wouldn
be
happy
Ron
said
Hagrid
grinning
they
wreck
houses
nifflers
i
reckon
they've
nearly
got
the
lot
now
he
added
pacing
around
the
patch
of
earth
while
the
nifflers
continued
to
dive
i
on'y
buried
a
hundred
coins
oh
there
y'are
Hermione
hermione
was
walking
toward
them
across
the
lawn
her
hands
were
very
heavily
bandaged
and
she
looked
miserable
pansy
Parkinson
was
watching
her
beadily
well
let's
check
how
yeh've
done
said
Hagrid
count
yer
coins
an
there's
no
point
tryin
ter
steal
any
Goyle
he
added
his
beetleblack
eyes
narrowed
it's
leprechaun
gold
vanishes
after
a
few
hours
goyle
emptied
his
pockets
looking
extremely
sulky
it
turned
out
that
ron's
niffler
had
been
most
successful
so
Hagrid
gave
him
an
enormous
slab
of
Honeydukes
chocolate
for
a
prize
the
bell
rang
across
the
grounds
for
lunch
the
rest
of
the
class
set
off
back
to
the
castle
but
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
stayed
behind
to
help
Hagrid
put
the
nifflers
back
in
their
boxes
harry
noticed
Madame
Maxime
watching
them
out
other
carriage
window
what

done
ter
your
hands
Hermione
said
Hagrid
looking
concerned
hermione
told
him
about
the
hate
mail
she
had
received
that
morning
and
the
envelope
full
of
bubotuber
pus
aaah

said
Hagrid
gendy
looking
down
at
her
i
got
some
o
those
letters

all
after
Rita
Skeeter
wrote
abou

Hermione
looking
shocked

Hagrid
heaving
the
niffler
crates
over
by
his
cabin
wall
they're
jus
nutters
Hermione

more

really
good
lesson
Harry
told
Hermione
as
they
headed
back
toward
the
castle
they're
good
nifflers
aren't
they
Ron
ron
however
was
frowning
at
the
chocolate
Hagrid
had
given
him
he
looked
thoroughly
put
out
about
something
what's
the
matter
said
Harry
wrong
flavor
no
said
Ron
shortly
why
didn't
you
tell
me
about
the
gold
what
gold
said
Harry
the
gold
I
gave
you
at
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
said
Ron
the
leprechaun
gold
I
gave
you
for
my
Omnioculars
in
the
Top
Box
why
didn't
you
tell
me
it
disappeared
harry
had
to
think
for
a
moment
before
he
realized
what
Ron
was
talking
about
oh
he
said
the
memory
coming
back
to
him
at
last
i
dunno
i
never
noticed
it
had
gone
i
was
more
worried
about
my
wand
wasn't
I
they
climbed
the
steps
into
the
entrance
hall
and
went
into
the
Great
Hall
for
lunch
must
be
nice
Ron
said
abruptly
when
they
had
sat
down
and
started
serving
themselves
roast
beef
and
Yorkshire
puddings
to
have
so
much
money
you
don't
notice
if
a
pocketful
of
Galleons
goes
missing
listen
I
had
other
stuff
on
my
mind
that
night
s
aid
Harry
impatiently
we
all
did
remember
i
didn't
know
leprechaun
gold
vanishes
Ron
muttered
i
thought
I
was
paying
you
back
you
shouldn't've
given
me
that
Chudley
Cannon
hat
for
Christmas
forget
it
all
right
said
Harry
ron
speared
a
roast
potato
on
the
end
of
his
fork
glaring
at
it
then
he
said
I
hate
being
poor
harry
and
Hermione
looked
at
each
other
neither
of
them
really
knew
what
to
say
it's
rubbish
said
Ron
still
glaring
down
at
his
potato
i
don't
blame
Fred
and
George
for
trying
to
make
some
extra
money
wish
I
could
wish
I
had
a
niffler
well
we
know
what
to
get
you
next
Christmas
said
Hermione
brightly
then
when
Ron
continued
to
look
gloomy
she
said
Come
on
Ron
it
could
be
worse
at
least
your
fingers
aren't
full
of
pus
hermione
was
having
a
lot
of
difficulty
managing
her
knife
and
fork
her
fingers
were
so
stiff
and
swollen
i
hate
that
Skeeter
woman
she
burst
out
savagely
i'll
get
her
back
for
this
if
it's
the
last
thing
I
do
hate
mail
continued
to
arrive
for
Hermione
over
the
following
week
and
although
she
followed
hagrid's
advice
and
stopped
opening
it
several
of
her
illwishers
sent
Howlers
which
exploded
at
the
Gryffindor
table
and
shrieked
insults
at
her
for
the
whole
Hall
to
hear
even
those
people
who
didn't
read
Witch
Weekly
knew
all
about
the
supposed
HarryKrumHermione
triangle
now
harry
was
getting
sick
of
telling
people
that
Hermione
wasn't
his
girlfriend
it'll
die
down
though
he
told
Hermione
if
we
just
ignore
it
people
got
bored
with
that
stuff
she
wrote
about
me
last
time
I
want
to
know
how
she's
listening
into
private
conversations
when
she's
supposed
to
be
banned
from
the
grounds
said
Hermione
angrily
hermione
hung
back
in
their
next
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
lesson
to
ask
Professor
Moody
something
the
rest
of
the
class
was
very
eager
to
leave
Moody
had
given
them
such
a
rigorous
test
of
hexdeflection
that
many
of
them
were
nursing
small
injuries
harry
had
such
a
bad
case
of
Twitchy
Ears
he
had
to
hold
his
hands
clamped
over
them
as
he
walked
away
from
the
class
well
rita's
definitely
not
using
an
Invisibility
Cloak
hermione
panted
five
minutes
later
catching
up
with
Harry
and
Ron
in
the
entrance
hall
and
pulling
Harrys
hand
away
from
one
of
his
wiggling
ears
so
that
he
could
hear
her
moody
says
he
didn't
see
her
anywhere
near
the
judges
table
at
the
second
task
or
anywhere
near
the
lake
hermione
is
there
any
point
in
telling
you
to
drop
this
said
Ron
no
said
Hermione
stubbornly
i
want
to
know
how
she
heard
me
talking
to
Viktor
and
how
she
found
out
about
Hagrids
mum
maybe
she
had
you
bugged
said
Harry
bugged
said
Ron
blankly
what
put
fleas
on
her
or
something
harry
started
explaining
about
hidden
microphones
and
recording
equipment
ron
was
fascinated
but
Hermione
interrupted
them
aren't
you
two
ever
going
to
read
Hogwarts
A
History
what's
the
point
said
Ron
you
know
it
by
heart
we
can
just
ask
you
all
those
substitutes
for
magic
Muggles
use
electricity
computers
and
radar
and
all
those
things
they
all
go
haywire
around
Hogwarts
there's
too
much
magic
in
the
air
no
rita's
using
magic
to
eavesdrop
she
must
be
if
I
could
just
find
out
what
it
is
ooh
if
it's
illegal
i'll
have
her
haven't
we
got
enough
to
worry
about
ron
asked
her
do
we
have
to
start
a
vendetta
against
Rita
Skeeter
as
well
i'm
not
asking
you
to
help
hermione
snapped
i'll
do
it
on
my
own
she
marched
back
up
the
marble
staircase
without
a
backward
glance
harry
was
quite
sure
she
was
going
to
the
library
what's
the
betting
she
comes
back
with
a
box
of
Hate
Rita
Skeeter
badges
said
Ron
hermione
however
did
not
ask
Harry
and
Ron
to
help
her
pursue
vengeance
against
Rita
Skeeter
for
which
they
were
both
grateful
because
their
workload
was
mounting
ever
higher
in
the
days
before
the
Easter
holidays
harry
frankly
marveled
at
the
fact
that
Hermione
could
research
magical
methods
of
eavesdropping
as
well
as
everything
else
they
had
to
do
he
was
working
flatout
just
to
get
through
all
their
homework
though
he
made
a
point
of
sending
regular
food
packages
up
to
the
cave
in
the
mountain
for
Sirius
after
last
summer
Harry
had
not
forgotten
what
it
felt
like
to
be
continually
hungry
he
enclosed
notes
to
Sirius
telling
him
that
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
had
happened
and
that
they
were
still
waiting
for
an
answer
from
Percy
hedwig
didn't
return
until
the
end
of
the
Easter
holidays
percy's
letter
was
enclosed
in
a
package
of
Easter
eggs
that
Mrs
weasley
had
sent
both
Harrys
and
ron's
were
the
size
of
dragon
eggs
and
full
of
homemade
toffee
hermiones
however
was
smaller
than
a
chicken
egg
her
face
fell
when
she
saw
it
your
mum
doesn't
read
Witch
Weekly
by
any
chance
does
she
Ron
she
asked
quietly
yeah
said
Ron
whose
mouth
was
full
of
toffee
gets
it
for
the
recipes
hermione
looked
sadly
at
her
tiny
egg
don't
you
want
to
see
what
percy's
written
harry
asked
her
hastily
percys
letter
was
short
and
irritated
as
I
am
constantly
telling
the
Daily
Prophet
mr.
Crouch
is
taking
a
welldeserved
break
he
is
sending
in
regular
owls
with
instructions
no
I
haven't
actually
seen
him
but
I
think
I
can
be
trusted
to
know
my
own
superior's
handwriting
i
have
quite
enough
to
do
at
the
moment
without
trying
to
quash
these
ridiculous
rumors
please
don't
bother
me
again
unless
it's
something
important
happy
Easter
the
start
of
the
summer
term
would
normally
have
meant
that
Harry
was
training
hard
for
the
last
Quidditch
match
of
the
season
this
year
however
it
was
the
third
and
final
task
in
the
Triwizard
Tournament
for
which
he
needed
to
prepare
but
he
still
didn't
know
what
he
would
have
to
do
finally
in
the
last
week
of
May
Professor
McGonagall
held
him
back
in
Transfiguration
you
are
to
go
down
to
the
Quidditch
field
tonight
at
nine
o'clock
potter
she
told
him
mr.
Bagman
will
be
there
to
tell
the
champions
about
the
third
task
so
at
half
past
eight
that
night
harry
left
Ron
and
Hermione
in
Gryffindor
Tower
and
went
downstairs
as
he
crossed
the
entrance
hall
Cedric
came
up
from
the
Hufflepuff
common
room
what
d'you
reckon
it's
going
to
be
he
asked
Harry
as
they
went
together
down
the
stone
steps
out
into
the
cloudy
night
fleur
keeps
going
on
about
underground
tunnels
she
reckons
we've
got
to
find
treasure
that
wouldn't
be
too
bad
said
Harry
thinking
that
he
would
simply
ask
Hagrid
for
a
niffler
to
do
the
job
for
him
they
walked
down
the
dark
lawn
to
the
Quidditch
stadium
turned
through
a
gap
in
the
stands
and
walked
out
onto
the
field
what've
they
done
to
it
cedric
said
indignantly
stopping
dead
the
Quidditch
field
was
no
longer
smooth
and
flat
it
looked
as
though
somebody
had
been
building
long
low
walls
all
over
it
that
twisted
and
crisscrossed
in
every
direction
they're
hedges
said
Harry
bending
to
examine
the
nearest
one
hello
there
called
a
cheery
voice
ludo
Bagman
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
field
with
Krum
and
Fleur
harry
and
Cedric
made
their
way
toward
them
climbing
over
the
hedges
fleur
beamed
at
Harry
as
he
came
nearer
her
attitude
toward
him
had
changed
completely
since
he
had
saved
her
sister
from
the
lake
well
what
d'you
think
said
Bagman
happily
as
Harry
and
Cedric
climbed
over
the
last
hedge
growing
nicely
aren't
they
give
them
a
month
and
hagrid'll
have
them
twenty
feet
high
don't
worry
he
added
grinning
spotting
the
less
thanhappy
expressions
on
Harrys
and
cedric's
faces
you'll
have
your
Quidditch
field
back
to
normal
once
the
task
is
over
now
I
imagine
you
can
guess
what
we're
making
here
no
one
spoke
for
a
moment
then
maze
grunted
Krum
that's
right
said
Bagman
a
maze
the
third
task's
really
very
straightforward
the
Triwizard
Cup
will
be
placed
in
the
center
of
the
maze
the
first
champion
to
touch
it
will
receive
full
marks
we
seemply
ave
to
get
through
the
maze
said
Fleur
there
will
be
obstacles
said
Bagman
happily
bouncing
on
the
balls
of
his
feet
hagrid
is
providing
a
number
of
creatures
then
there
will
be
spells
that
must
be
broken
all
that
sort
of
thing
you
know
now
the
champions
who
are
leading
on
points
will
get
a
head
start
into
the
maze
bagman
grinned
at
Harry
and
Cedric
then
mr.
Krum
will
enter
then
Miss
Delacour
but
you'll
all
be
in
with
a
fighting
chance
depending
how
well
you
get
past
the
obstacles
should
be
fun
eh
harry
who
knew
only
too
well
the
kind
of
creatures
that
Hagrid
was
likely
to
provide
for
an
event
like
this
thought
it
was
unlikely
to
be
any
fun
at
all
however
he
nodded
politely
like
the
other
champions
very
well
if
you
haven't
got
any
questions
we'll
go
back
up
to
the
castle
shall
we
it's
a
bit
chilly
bagman
hurried
alongside
Harry
as
they
began
to
wend
their
way
out
of
the
growing
maze
harry
had
the
feeling
that
Bagman
was
going
to
start
offering
to
help
him
again
but
just
then
Krum
tapped
Harry
on
the
shoulder
could
I
haff
a
vord
yeah
all
right
said
Harry
slightly
surprised
vill
you
valk
vith
me
okay
said
Harry
curiously
bagman
looked
slightly
perturbed
i'll
wait
for
you
harry
shall
I
no
it's
okay
mr.
Bagman
said
Harry
suppressing
a
smile
I
think
I
can
find
the
castle
on
my
own
thanks
harry
and
Krum
left
the
stadium
together
but
Krum
did
not
set
a
course
for
the
Durmstrang
ship
instead
he
walked
toward
the
forest
what're
we
going
this
way
for
said
Harry
as
they
passed
Hagrid
s
cabin
and
the
illuminated
Beauxbatons
carriage
don't
vont
to
be
overheard
said
Krum
shortly
when
at
last
they
had
reached
a
quiet
stretch
of
ground
a
short
way
from
the
beauxbatons
horses
paddock
Krum
stopped
in
the
shade
of
the
trees
and
turned
to
face
Harry
i
vant
to
know
he
said
glowering
vot
there
is
between
you
and
Hermyown
ninny
harry
who
from
krum's
secretive
manner
had
expected
something
much
more
serious
than
this
stared
up
at
Krum
in
amazement
nothing
he
said
but
Krum
glowered
at
him
and
Harry
somehow
struck
anew
by
how
tall
Krum
was
elaborated
we're
friends
she's
not
my
girlfriend
and
she
never
has
been
it's
just
that
Skeeter
woman
making
things
up
hermyownninny
talks
about
you
very
often
said
Krum
looking
suspiciously
at
Harry
yeah
said
Harry
because
were
friends
he
couldn't
quite
believe
he
was
having
this
conversation
with
Viktor
Krum
the
famous
International
Quidditch
player
it
was
as
though
the
eighteenyearold
Krum
thought
he
harry
was
an
equal
a
real
rival
You
haff
never
you
haff
not
no
said
Harry
very
firmly
krum
looked
slightly
happier
he
stared
at
Harry
for
a
few
seconds
then
said
You
fly
very
veil
i
vos
votching
at
the
first
task
thanks
said
Harry
grinning
broadly
and
suddenly
feeling
much
taller
himself
i
saw
you
at
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
the
Wronski
Feint
you
really
but
something
moved
behind
Krum
in
the
trees
and
Harry
who
had
some
experience
of
the
sort
of
thing
that
lurked
in
the
forest
instinctively
grabbed
krum's
arm
and
pulled
him
around
vot
is
it
harry
shook
his
head
staring
at
the
place
where
he'd
seen
movement
he
slipped
his
hand
inside
his
robes
reaching
for
his
wand
suddenly
a
man
staggered
out
from
behind
a
tall
oak
for
a
moment
Harry
didn't
recognize
him
then
he
realized
it
was
mr.
Crouch
he
looked
as
though
he
had
been
traveling
for
days
the
knees
of
his
robes
were
ripped
and
bloody
his
face
scratched
he
was
unshaven
and
gray
with
exhaustion
his
neat
hair
and
mustache
were
both
in
need
of
a
wash
and
a
trim
his
strange
appearance
however
was
nothing
to
the
way
he
was
behaving
muttering
and
gesticulating
mr.
Crouch
appeared
to
be
talking
to
someone
that
he
alone
could
see
he
reminded
Harry
vividly
of
an
old
tramp
he
had
seen
once
when
out
shopping
with
the
Dursleys
that
man
too
had
been
conversing
wildly
with
thin
air
Aunt
Petunia
had
seized
dudley's
hand
and
pulled
him
across
the
road
to
avoid
him
Uncle
Vernon
had
then
treated
the
family
to
a
long
rant
about
what
he
would
like
to
do
with
beggars
and
vagrants
vosn't
he
a
judge
said
Krum
staring
at
mr.
Crouch
isn't
he
vith
your
Ministry
harry
nodded
hesitated
for
a
moment
then
walked
slowly
toward
mr.
Crouch
who
did
not
look
at
him
but
continued
to
talk
to
a
nearby
tree
and
when
you've
done
that
Weatherby
send
an
owl
to
Dumbledore
confirming
the
number
of
Durmstrang
students
who
will
be
attending
the
tournament
Karkaroff
has
just
sent
word
there
will
be
twelve
mr.
Crouch
said
Harry
cautiously
and
then
send
another
owl
to
Madame
Maxime
because
she
might
want
to
up
the
number
of
students
she's
bringing
now
karkaroff's
made
it
a
round
dozen
do
that
Weatherby
will
you
will
you
will
mr.
crouch's
eyes
were
bulging
he
stood
staring
at
the
tree
muttering
soundlessly
at
it
then
he
staggered
sideways
and
fell
to
his
knees
mr.
Crouch
harry
said
loudly
are
you
all
right
crouch's
eyes
were
rolling
in
his
head
harry
looked
around
at
Krum
who
had
followed
him
into
the
trees
and
was
looking
down
at
Crouch
in
alarm
vot
is
wrong
with
him
no
idea
Harry
muttered
listen
you'd
better
go
and
get
someone
dumbledore
gasped
mr.
Crouch
he
reached
out
and
seized
a
handful
of
Harrys
robes
dragging
him
closer
though
his
eyes
were
staring
over
harry's
head
i
need
see
dumbledore
okay
said
Harry
if
you
get
up
mr.
Crouch
we
can
go
up
to
the
i've
done
stupid
thing
mr.
Crouch
breathed
he
looked
utterly
mad
his
eyes
were
rolling
and
bulging
and
a
trickle
of
spittle
was
sliding
down
his
chin
every
word
he
spoke
seemed
to
cost
him
a
terrible
effort
must
tell
dumbledore
get
up
mr.
Crouch
said
Harry
loudly
and
clearly
get
up
i'll
take
you
to
Dumbledore
mr
crouch's
eyes
rolled
forward
onto
Harry
who
you
he
whispered
i'm
a
student
at
the
school
said
Harry
looking
around
at
Krum
for
some
help
but
Krum
was
hanging
back
looking
extremely
nervous
you're
not
his
whispered
Crouch
his
mouth
sagging
no
said
Harry
without
the
faintest
idea
what
Crouch
was
talking
about
dumbledore's
that's
right
said
Harry
crouch
was
pulling
him
closer
Harry
tried
to
loosen
crouch's
grip
on
his
robes
but
it
was
too
powerful
warn
dumbledore
i'll
get
Dumbledore
if
you
let
go
of
me
said
Harry
just
let
go
mr.
Crouch
and
i'll
get
him
thank
you
Weatherby
and
when
you
have
done
that
I
would
like
a
cup
of
tea
my
wife
and
son
will
be
arriving
shortly
we
are
attending
a
concert
tonight
with
mr.
and
Mrs
fudge
crouch
was
now
talking
fluently
to
a
tree
again
and
seemed
completely
unaware
that
Harry
was
there
which
surprised
Harry
so
much
he
didn't
notice
that
Crouch
had
released
him
yes
my
son
has
recently
gained
twelve
O
w.l.s
most
satisfactory
yes

very
proud
indeed
now
if
you
could
bring
me
that
memo
from
the
Andorran
Minister
of
Magic
I
think
I
will
have
time
to
draft
a
response
you

here
with
him
harry
said
to
Krum
i'll
get
Dumbledore
i'll
be
quicker
I
know
where
his
office
is
he
is
mad
said
Krum
doubtfully
staring
down
at
Crouch
who
was
still
gabbling
to
the
tree
apparently
convinced
it
was
Percy
just
stay
with
him
said
Harry
starting
to
get
up
but
his
movement
seemed
to
trigger
another
abrupt
change
in
mr.
Crouch
who
seized
him
hard
around
the
knees
and
pulled
Harry
back
to
the
ground
don't
leave
me
he
whispered
his
eyes
bulging
again
escaped
must
warn
must
tell

Dumbledore

Dark
Lord
stronger

Potter

if
you

me
go
mr.
Crouch
said
Harry
he
looked
furiously
around
at
Krum
help
me
will
you
looking
extremely
apprehensive
Krum
moved
forward
and
squatted
down
next
to
mr.
Crouch
just
keep
him
here
said
Harry
pulling
himself
free
of
mr.
Crouch
i'll
be
back
with
Dumbledore
hurry
von't
you
krum
called
after
him
as
Harry
sprinted
away
from
the
forest
and
up
through
the
dark
grounds
they
were
deserted
Bagman
Cedric
and
Fleur
had
disappeared
harry
tore
up
the
stone
steps
through
the
oak
front
doors
and
off
up
the
marble
staircase
toward
the
second
floor
five
minutes
later
he
was
hurtling
toward
a
stone
gargoyle
standing
halfway
along
an
empty
corridor
sher
sherbet
lemon
he
panted
at
it
this
was
the
password
to
the
hidden
staircase
to
dumbledore's
office
or
at
least
it
had
been
two
years
ago
the
password
had
evidently
changed
however
for
the
stone
gargoyle
did
not
spring
to
life
and
jump
aside
but
stood
frozen
glaring
at
Harry
malevolently
move
harry
shouted
at
it
c'mon
but
nothing
at
Hogwarts
had
ever
moved
just
because
he
shouted
at
it
he
knew
it
was
no
good
he
looked
up
and
down
the
dark
corridor
perhaps
Dumbledore
was
in
the
staffroom
he
started
running
as
fast
as
he
could
toward
the
staircase
potter
harry
skidded
to
a
halt
and
looked
around
snape
had
just
emerged
from
the
hidden
staircase
behind
the
stone
gargoyle
the
wall
was
sliding
shut
behind
him
even
as
he
beckoned
Harry
back
toward
him
what
are
you
doing
here
Potter
i
need
to
see
Professor
Dumbledore
said
Harry
running
back
up
the
corridor
and
skidding
to
a
standstill
in
front
of
Snape
instead
it's
mr.
Crouch
he's
just
turned
up
he's
in
the
forest
he's
asking
what
is
this
rubbish
said
Snape
his
black
eyes
glittering
what
are
you
talking
about
mr.
Crouch
harry
shouted
from
the
Ministry
he's
ill
or
something
he's
in
the
forest
he
wants
to
see
Dumbledore
just
give
me
the
password
up
to
the
headmaster
is
busy
potter
said
Snape
his
thin
mouth
curling
into
an
unpleasant
smile
i've
got
to
tell
Dumbledore
harry
yelled
didn't
you
hear
me
potter
harry
could
tell
Snape
was
thoroughly
enjoying
himself
denying
Harry
the
thing
he
wanted
when
he
was
so
panicky
look
said
Harry
angrily
Crouch
isn't
right
he's
he's
out
of
his
mind
he
says
he
wants
to
warn
the
stone
wall
behind
Snape
slid
open
dumbledore
was
standing
there
wearing
long
green
robes
and
a
mildly
curious
expression
is
there
a
problem
he
said
looking
between
Harry
and
Snape
professor
harry
said
sidestepping
Snape
before
Snape
could
speak
Mr
crouch
is
here
he's
down
in
the
forest
he
wants
to
speak
to
you
harry
expected
Dumbledore
to
ask
questions
but
to
his
relief
Dumbledore
did
nothing
of
the
sort
lead
the
way
he
said
promptly
and
he
swept
off
along
the
corridor
behind
Harry
leaving
Snape
standing
next
to
the
gargoyle
and
looking
twice
as
ugly
what
did
mr.
Crouch
say
harry
said
Dumbledore
as
they
walked
swiftly
down
the
marble
staircase
said
he
wants
to
warn
you
said
he's
done
something
terrible
he
mentioned
his
son
and
Bertha
Jorkins
and
and
Voldemort
something
about
Voldemort
getting
stronger
indeed
said
Dumbledore
and
he
quickened
his
pace
as
they
hurried
out
into
the
pitchdarkness
he's
not
acting
normally
Harry
said
hurrying
along
beside
Dumbledore
he
doesn't
seem
to
know
where
he
is
he
keeps
talking
like
he
thinks
Percy
weasley's
there
and
then
he
changes
and
says
he
needs
to
see
you
i
left
him
with
Viktor
Krum
you
did
said
Dumbledore
sharply
and
he
began
to
take
longer
strides
still
so
that
Harry
was
running
to
keep
up
do
you
know
if
anybody
else
saw
Mr
crouch
no
said
Harry
krum
and
I
were
talking
mr.
Bagman
had
just
finished
telling
us
about
the
third
task
we
stayed
behind
and
then
we
saw
mr.
Crouch
coming
out
of
the
forest
where
are
they
said
Dumbledore
as
the
Beauxbatons
carriage
emerged
from
the
darkness
over
here
said
Harry
moving
in
front
of
Dumbledore
leading
the
way
through
the
trees
he
couldn't
hear
crouch's
voice
anymore
but
he
knew
where
he
was
going
it
hadn't
been
much
past
the
Beauxbatons
carriage
somewhere
around
here
viktor
harry
shouted
no
one
answered
they
were
here
Harry
said
to
Dumbledore
they
were
definitely
somewhere
around
here
lumos
Dumbledore
said
lighting
his
wand
and
holding
it
up
its
narrow
beam
traveled
from
black
trunk
to
black
trunk
illuminating
the
ground
and
then
it
fell
upon
a
pair
of
feet
harry
and
Dumbledore
hurried
forward
krum
was
sprawled
on
the
forest
floor
he
seemed
to
be
unconscious
there
was
no
sign
at
all
of
mr.
Crouch
dumbledore
bent
over
Krum
and
gently
lifted
one
of
his
eyelids
stunned
he
said
softly
his
halfmoon
glasses
glittered
in
the
wandlight
as
he
peered
around
at
the
surrounding
trees
should
I
go
and
get
someone
said
Harry
madam
Pomfrey
no
said
Dumbledore
swiftly
stay
here
he
raised
his
wand
into
the
air
and
pointed
it
in
the
direction
of
hagrid's
cabin
harry
saw
something
silvery
dart
out
of
it
and
streak
away
through
the
trees
like
a
ghostly
bird
then
Dumbledore
bent
over
Krum
again
pointed
his
wand
at
him
and
muttered
Ennervate
krum
opened
his
eyes
he
looked
dazed
when
he
saw
Dumbledore
he
tried
to
sit
up
but
Dumbledore
put
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
made
him
lie
still
he
attacked
me
krum
muttered
putting
a
hand
up
to
his
head
the
old
madman
attacked
me
i
vos
looking
around
to
see
vare
Potter
had
gone
and
he
attacked
from
behind
lie
still
for
a
moment
Dumbledore
said
the
sound
of
thunderous
footfalls
reached
them
and
Hagrid
came
panting
into
sight
with
Fang
at
his
heels
he
was
carrying
his
crossbow
professor
Dumbledore
he
said
his
eyes
widening
harry
what
the
hagrid
I
need
you
to
fetch
Professor
Karkaroff
said
Dumbledore
his
student
has
been
attacked
when
you've
done
that
kindly
alert
Professor
Moody
no
need
Dumbledore
said
a
wheezy
growl
i'm
here
moody
was
limping
toward
them
leaning
on
his
staff
his
wand
lit
damn
leg
he
said
furiously
would've
been
here
quicker
what's
happened
snape
said
something
about
Crouch
crouch
said
Hagrid
blankly
karkaroff
please
Hagrid
said
Dumbledore
sharply
oh
yeah
right
y'are
Professor
said
Hagrid
and
he
turned
and
disappeared
into
the
dark
trees
Fang
trotting
after
him
i
don't
know
where
Barty
Crouch
is
Dumbledore
told
Moody
but
it
is
essential
that
we
find
him
i'm
onto
it
growled
Moody
and
he
pulled
out
his
wand
and
limped
off
into
the
forest
neither
Dumbledore
nor
Harry
spoke
again
until
they
heard
the
unmistakable
sounds
of
Hagrid
and
Fang
returning
karkaroff
was
hurrying
along
behind
them
he
was
wearing
his
sleek
silver
furs
and
he
looked
pale
and
agitated
what
is
this
he
cried
when
he
saw
Krum
on
the
ground
and
Dumbledore
and
Harry
beside
him
what's
going
on
i
vos
attacked
said
Krum
sitting
up
now
and
rubbing
his
head
mr.
Crouch
or
votever
his
name
crouch
attacked
you
crouch
attacked
you
the
Triwizard
judge
igor
Dumbledore
began
but
Karkaroff
had
drawn
himself
up
clutching
his
furs
around
him
looking
livid
treachery
he
bellowed
pointing
at
Dumbledore
it
is
a
plot
you
and
your
Ministry
of
Magic
have
lured
me
here
under
false
pretenses
Dumbledore
this
is
not
an
equal
competition
first
you
sneak
Potter
into
the
tournament
though
he
is
underage
now
one
of
your
Ministry
friends
attempts
to
put
my
champion
out
of
action
i
smell
doubledealing
and
corruption
in
this
whole
affair
and
you
Dumbledore
you
with
your
talk
of
closer
international
wizarding
links
of
rebuilding
old
ties
of
forgetting
old
differences
here's
what
I
think
of
you
karkaroff
spat
onto
the
ground
at
dumbledore's
feet
in
one
swift
movement
Hagrid
seized
the
front
of
karkaroff's
furs
lifted
him
into
the
air
and
slammed
him
against
a
nearby
tree
apologize
hagrid
snarled
as
Karkaroff
gasped
for
breath
hagrid's
massive
fist
at
his
throat
his
feet
dangling
in
midair
hagrid
no
dumbledore
shouted
his
eyes
flashing
hagrid
removed
the
hand
pinning
Karkaroff
to
the
tree
and
Karkaroff
slid
all
the
way
down
the
trunk
and
slumped
in
a
huddle
at
its
roots
a
few
twigs
and
leaves
showered
down
upon
his
head
kindly
escort
Harry
back
up
to
the
castle
Hagrid
said
Dumbledore
sharply
breathing
heavily
Hagrid
gave
Karkaroff
a
glowering
look
maybe
i'd
better
stay
here
headmaster
you
will
take
Harry
back
to
school
Hagrid
Dumbledore
repeated
firmly
take
him
right
up
to
Gryffindor
Tower
and
Harry
I

to
stay
there

want
to

want

you
understand

er
yes
said
Harry
staring
at
him
how
had
Dumbledore
known
that
at
that
very
moment
he
had
been
thinking
about
sending
Pigwidgeon
straight
to
Sirius
to
tell
him
what
had
happened
i'll
leave
Fang
with
yeh
headmaster
Hagrid
said
staring
menacingly
at
Karkaroff
who
was
still
sprawled
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
tangled
in
furs
and
tree
roots
stay
Fang
c'mon
Harry
they
marched
in
silence
past
the
Beauxbatons
carriage
and
up
toward
the
castle
how
dare
he
Hagrid
growled
as
they
strode
past
the
lake
how

just

was
in
such
a
bad
mood
Harry
was
quite
glad
to
say
goodbye
to
him
in
front
of
the
Fat
Lady
he
clambered
through
the
portrait
hole
into
the
common
room
and
hurried
straight
for
the
corner
where
Ron
and
Hermione
were
sitting
to
tell
them
what
had
happened
chapter
twentynine
the
dream
it
comes
down
to
this
said
Hermione
rubbing
her
forehead
either
mr.
Crouch
attacked
Viktor
or
somebody
else
attacked
both
of
them
when
Viktor
wasn't
looking
it
must've
been
Crouch
said
Ron
at
once
that's
why
he
was
gone
when
Harry
and
Dumbledore
got
there
he'd
done
a
runner
i
don't
think
so
said
Harry
shaking
his
head
he
seemed
really
weak
I
don't
reckon
he
was
up
to
Disapparating
or
anything
you
cant
Disapparate
on
the
Hogwarts
grounds
haven't
I
told
you
enough
times
said
Hermione
okay
hows
this
for
a
theory
said
Ron
excitedly
krum
attacked
Crouch
no
wait
for
it
and
then
Stunned
himself
and
mr.
Crouch
evaporated
did
he
said
Hermione
coldly
oh
yeah
it
was
daybreak
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
had
crept
out
of
their
dormitories
very
early
and
hurried
up
to
the
Owlery
together
to
send
a
note
to
Sirius
now
they
were
standing
looking
out
at
the
misty
grounds
all
three
of
them
were
puffyeyed
and
pale
because
they
had
been
talking
late
into
the
night
about
mr.
Crouch
just
go
through
it
again
Harry
said
Hermione
what
did
mr.
Crouch
actually
say
i've
told
you
he
wasn't
making
much
sense
said
Harry
he
said
he
wanted
to
warn
Dumbledore
about
something
he
definitely
mentioned
Bertha
Jorkins
and
he
seemed
to
think
she
was
dead
he
kept
saying
stuff
was
his
fault
he
mentioned
his
son
well
that
was
his
fault
said
Hermione
testily
he
was
out
of
his
mind
said
Harry
half
the
time
he
seemed
to
think
his
wife
and
son
were
still
alive
and
he
kept
talking
to
Percy
about
work
and
giving
him
instructions
and
remind
me
what
he
said
about
YouKnowWho
said
Ron
tentatively
i've
told
you
Harry
repeated
dully
he
said
he's
getting
stronger
there
was
a
pause
then
Ron
said
in
a
falsely
confident
voice
But
he
was
out
of
his
mind
like
you
said
so
half
of
it
was
probably
just
raving
he
was
sanest
when
he
was
trying
to
talk
about
Voldemort
said
Harry
and
Ron
winced
at
the
sound
of
the
name
he
was
having
real
trouble
stringing
two
words
together
but
that
was
when
he
seemed
to
know
where
he
was
and
know
what
he
wanted
to
do
he
just
kept
saying
he
had
to
see
Dumbledore
harry
turned
away
from
the
window
and
stared
up
into
the
rafters
the
many
perches
were
halfempty
every
now
and
then
another
owl
would
swoop
in
through
one
of
the
windows
returning
from
its
night's
hunting
with
a
mouse
in
its
beak
if
Snape
hadn't
held
me
up
Harry
said
bitterly
we
might've
got
there
in
time
the
headmaster
is
busy
potter
what's
this
rubbish
Potter
why
couldn't
he
have
just
got
out
of
the
way
maybe
he
didn't
want
you
to
get
there
said
Ron
quickly
maybe
hang
on
how
fast
d'you
reckon
he
could've
gotten
down
to
the
forest
d'you
reckon
he
could've
beaten
you
and
Dumbledore
there
not
unless
he
can
turn
himself
into
a
bat
or
something
said
Harry
wouldn't
put
it
past
him
Ron
muttered
we
need
to
see
Professor
Moody
said
Hermione
we
need
to
find
out
whether
he
found
mr.
Crouch
if
he
had
the
marauder's
Map
on
him
it
would've
been
easy
said
Harry
unless
Crouch
was
already
outside
the
grounds
said
Ron
because
it
only
shows
up
to
the
boundaries
doesn't
shh
said
Hermione
suddenly
somebody
was
climbing
the
steps
up
to
the
Owlery
harry
could
hear
two
voices
arguing
coming
closer
and
closer
that's
blackmail
that
is
we
could
get
into
a
lot
of
trouble
for
that
we've
tried
being
polite
it's
time
to
play
dirty
like
him
he
wouldn't
like
the
Ministry
of
Magic
knowing
what
he
did
i'm
telling
you
if
you
put
that
in
writing
it's
blackmail
yeah
and
you
won't
be
complaining
if
we
get
a
nice
fat
payoff
will
you
the
Owlery
door
banged
open
fred
and
George
came
over
the
threshold
then
froze
at
the
sight
of
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
what're
you
doing
here
ron
and
Fred
said
at
the
same
time
sending
a
letter
said
Harry
and
George
in
unison
what
at
this
time
said
Hermione
and
Fred
fred
grinned
fine
we
won't
ask
you
what
you're
doing
if
you
don't
ask
us
he
said
he
was
holding
a
sealed
envelope
in
his
hands
harry
glanced
at
it
but
Fred
whether
accidentally
or
on
purpose
shifted
his
hand
so
that
the
name
on
it
was
covered
well
don't
let
us
hold
you
up
Fred
said
making
a
mock
bow
and
pointing
at
the
door
ron
didn't
move
who're
you
blackmailing
he
said
the
grin
vanished
from
fred's
face
harry
saw
George
half
glance
at
Fred
before
smiling
at
Ron
don't
be
stupid
I
was
only
joking
he
said
easily
didn't
sound
like
that
said
Ron
fred
and
George
looked
at
each
other
then
Fred
said
abruptly
i've
told
you
before
Ron
keep
your
nose
out
if
you
like
it
the
shape
it
is
can't
see
why
you
would
but
it's
my
business
if
you're
blackmailing
someone
said
Ron
george's
right
you
could
end
up
in
serious
trouble
for
that
told
you
I
was
joking
said
George
he
walked
over
to
Fred
pulled
the
letter
out
of
his
hands
and
began
attaching
it
to
the
leg
of
the
nearest
barn
owl
you're
starting
to
sound
a
bit
like
our
dear
older
brother
you
are
Ron
carry
on
like
this
and
you'll
be
made
a
prefect
no
I
won't
said
Ron
hotly
george
carried
the
barn
owl
over
to
the
window
and
it
took
off
george
turned
around
and
grinned
at
Ron
well
stop
telling
people
what
to
do
then
see
you
later
he
and
Fred
left
the
Owlery
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
stared
at
one
another
you
don't
think
they
know
something
about
all
this
do
you
hermione
whispered
about
Crouch
and
everything
no
said
Harry
if
it
was
something
that
serious
they'd
tell
someone
they'd
tell
Dumbledore
ron
however
was
looking
uncomfortable
what's
the
matter
hermione
asked
him
well
said
Ron
slowly
I
dunno
if
they
would
they're
they're
obsessed
with
making
money
lately
I
noticed
it
when
I
was
hanging
around
with
them
when
you
know
we
weren't
talking
harry
finished
the
sentence
for
him
yeah
but
blackmail
it's
this
joke
shop
idea
they've
got
said
Ron
i
thought
they
were
only
saying
it
to
annoy
Mum
but
they
really
mean
it
they
want
to
start
one
they've
only
got
a
year
left
at
Hogwarts
they
keep
going
on
about
how
it's
time
to
think
about
their
future
and
Dad
can't
help
them
and
they
need
gold
to
get
started
hermione
was
looking
uncomfortable
now
yes
but
they
wouldn't
do
anything
against
the
law
to
get
gold
wouldn't
they
said
Ron
looking
skeptical
i
dunno
they
don't
exactly
mind
breaking
rules
do
they
yes
but
this
is
the
law
said
Hermione
looking
scared
this
isn't
some
silly
school
rule
they'll
get
a
lot
more
than
detention
for
blackmail
ron
maybe
you'd
better
tell
Percy
are
you
mad
said
Ron
tell
Percy
he'd
probably
do
a
Crouch
and
turn
them
in
he
stared
at
the
window
through
which
Fred
and
george's
owl
had
departed
then
said
Come
on
let's
get
some
breakfast
d'you
think
it's
too
early
to
go
and
see
Professor
Moody
hermione
said
as
they
went
down
the
spiral
staircase
yes
said
Harry
he'd
probably
blast
us
through
the
door
if
we
wake
him
at
the
crack
of
dawn
he'll
think
we're
trying
to
attack
him
while
he's
asleep
let's
give
it
till
break
history
of
Magic
had
rarely
gone
so
slowly
harry
kept
checking
ron's
watch
having
finally
discarded
his
own
but
ron's
was
moving
so
slowly
he
could
have
sworn
it
had
stopped
working
too
all
three
of
them
were
so
tired
they
could
happily
have
put
their
heads
down
on
the
desks
and
slept
even
Hermione
wasn't
taking
her
usual
notes
but
was
sitting
with
her
head
on
her
hand
gazing
at
Professor
Binns
with
her
eyes
out
of
focus
when
the
bell
finally
rang
they
hurried
out
into
the
corridors
toward
the
Dark
Arts
classroom
and
found
Professor
Moody
leaving
it
he
looked
as
tired
as
they
felt
the
eyelid
of
his
normal
eye
was
drooping
giving
his
face
an
even
more
lopsided
appearance
than
usual
professor
Moody
harry
called
as
they
made
their
way
toward
him
through
the
crowd
hello
Potter
growled
Moody
his
magical
eye
followed
a
couple
of
passing
first
years
who
sped
up
looking
nervous
it
rolled
into
the
back
of
moody's
head
and
watched
them
around
the
corner
before
he
spoke
again
come
in
here
he
stood
back
to
let
them
into
his
empty
classroom
limped
in
after
them
and
closed
the
door
did
you
find
him
harry
asked
without
preamble
mr.
Crouch
no
said
Moody
he
moved
over
to
his
desk
sat
down
stretched
out
his
wooden
leg
with
a
slight
groan
and
pulled
out
his
hip
flask
did
you
use
the
map
harry
said
of
course
said
Moody
taking
a
swig
from
his
flask
took
a
leaf
out
of
your
book
Potter
summoned
it
from
my
office
into
the
forest
he
wasn't
anywhere
on
there
so
he
did
Disapparate
said
Ron
you
can't
Disapparate
on
the
grounds
Ron
said
Hermione
there
are
other
ways
he
could
have
disappeared
aren't
there
Professor
moody's
magical
eye
quivered
as
it
rested
on
Hermione
you're
another
one
who
might
think
about
a
career
as
an
Auror
he
told
her
mind
works
the
right
way
granger
hermione
flushed
pink
with
pleasure
well
he
wasn't
invisible
said
Harry
the
map
shows
invisible
people
he
must've
left
the
grounds
then
but
under
his
own
steam
said
Hermione
eagerly
or
because
someone
made
him
yeah
someone
could've
could've
pulled
him
onto
a
broom
and
flown
off
with
him
couldn't
they
said
Ron
quickly
looking
hopefully
at
Moody
as
if
he
too
wanted
to
be
told
he
had
the
makings
of
an
Auror
we
can't
rule
out
kidnap
growled
Moody
so
said
Ron
d'you
reckon
he's
somewhere
in
Hogsmeade
could
be
anywhere
said
Moody
shaking
his
head
only
thing
we
know
for
sure
is
that
he's
not
here
he
yawned
widely
so
that
his
scars
stretched
and
his
lopsided
mouth
revealed
a
number
of
missing
teeth
then
he
said
Now
dumbledore's
told
me
you
three
fancy
yourselves
as
investigators
but
there's
nothing
you
can
do
for
Crouch
the
ministry'll
be
looking
for
him
now
dumbledore's
notified
them
potter
you
just
keep
your
mind
on
the
third
task
what
said
Harry
oh
yeah
he
hadn't
given
the
maze
a
single
thought
since
he'd
left
it
with
Krum
the
previous
night
should
be
right
up
your
street
this
one
said
Moody
looking
up
at
Harry
and
scratching
his
scarred
and
stubbly
chin
from
what
dumbledore's
said
you've
managed
to
get
through
stuff
like
this
plenty
of
times
broke
your
way
through
a
series
of
obstacles
guarding
the
Sorcerers
Stone
in
your
first
year
didn't
you
we
helped
Ron
said
quickly
me
and
Hermione
helped
moody
grinned
well
help
him
practice
for
this
one
and
i'll
be
very
surprised
if
he
doesn't
win
said
Moody
in
the
meantime
constant
vigilance
Potter
constant
vigilance
he
took
another
long
draw
from
his
hip
flask
and
his
magical
eye
swiveled
onto
the
window
the
topmost
sail
of
the
Durmstrang
ship
was
visible
through
it
you
two
counseled
Moody
his
normal
eye
on
Ron
and
Hermione
you
stick
close
to
Potter
all
right
i'm
keeping
an
eye
on
things
but
all
the
same
you
can
never
have
too
many
eyes
out
sirius
sent
their
owl
back
the
very
next
morning
it
fluttered
down
beside
Harry
at
the
same
moment
that
a
tawny
owl
landed
in
front
of
Hermione
clutching
a
copy
of
the
Daily
Prophet
in
its
beak
she
took
the
newspaper
scanned
the
first
few
pages
said
Ha
she
hasn't
got
wind
of
Crouch
then
joined
Ron
and
Harry
in
reading
what
Sirius
had
to
say
on
the
mysterious
events
of
the
night
before
last
harry
what
do
you
think
you
are
playing
at
walking
off
into
the
forest
with
Viktor
Krum
i
want
you
to
swear
by
return
owl
that
you
are
not
going
to
go
walking
with
anyone
else
at
night
there
is
somebody
highly
dangerous
at
Hogwarts
it
is
clear
to
me
that
they
wanted
to
stop
Crouch
from
seeing
Dumbledore
and
you
were
probably
feet
away
from
them
in
the
dark
you
could
have
been
killed
your
name
didn't
get
into
the
Goblet
of
Fire
by
accident
if
someone's
trying
to
attack
you
they're
on
their
last
chance
stay
close
to
Ron
and
Hermione
do
not
leave
Gryffindor
Tower
after
hours
and
arm
yourself
for
the
third
task
practice
Stunning
and
Disarming
a
few
hexes
wouldn't
go
amiss
either
there's
nothing
you
can
do
about
Crouch
keep
your
head
down
and
look
after
yourself
i'm
waiting
for
your
letter
giving
me
your
word
you
won't
stray
outofbounds
again
sirius
who's
he
to
lecture
me
about
being
outofbounds
said
Harry
in
mild
indignation
as
he
folded
up
sirius's
letter
and
put
it
inside
his
robes
after
all
the
stuff
he
did
at
school
he's
worried
about
you
said
Hermione
sharply
just
like
Moody
and
Hagrid
so
listen
to
them
no
one's
tried
to
attack
me
all
year
said
Harry
no
one's
done
anything
to
me
at
all
except
put
your
name
in
the
Goblet
of
Fire
said
Hermione
and
they
must've
done
that
for
a
reason
harry
snuffles
is
right
maybe
they've
been
biding
their
time
maybe
this
is
the
task
they're
going
to
get
you
look
said
Harry
impatiently
let's
say
Sirius
is
right
and
someone
Stunned
Krum
to
kidnap
Crouch
well
they
would've
been
in
the
trees
near
us
wouldn't
they
but
they
waited
till
I
was
out
of
the
way
until
they
acted
didn't
they
so
it
doesn't
look
like
i'm
their
target
does
it
they
couldn't
have
made
it
look
like
an
accident
if
they'd
murdered
you
in
the
forest
said
Hermione
but
if
you
die
during
a
task
they
didn't
care
about
attacking
Krum
did
they
said
Harry
why
didn't
they
just
polish
me
off
at
the
same
time
they
could've
made
it
look
like
Krum
and
I
had
a
duel
or
something
harry
I
don't
understand
it
either
said
Hermione
desperately
i
just
know
there
are
a
lot
of
odd
things
going
on
and
I
don't
like
it
moody's
right
Sirius
is
right
you've
got
to
get
in
training
for
the
third
task
straight
away
and
you
make
sure
you
write
back
to
Sirius
and
promise
him
you're
not
going
to
go
sneaking
off
alone
again
the
Hogwarts
grounds
never
looked
more
inviting
than
when
Harry
had
to
stay
indoors
for
the
next
few
days
he
spent
all
of
his
free
time
either
in
the
library
with
Hermione
and
Ron
looking
up
hexes
or
else
in
empty
classrooms
which
they
sneaked
into
to
practice
harry
was
concentrating
on
the
Stunning
Spell
which
he
had
never
used
before
the
trouble
was
that
practicing
it
involved
certain
sacrifices
on
ron's
and
hermione's
part
can't
we
kidnap
Mrs
norris
ron
suggested
on
Monday
lunchtime
as
he
lay
flat
on
his
back
in
the
middle
of
their
Charms
classroom
having
just
been
Stunned
and
reawoken
by
Harry
for
the
fifth
time
in
a
row
let's
Stun
her
for
a
bit
or
you
could
use
Dobby
Harry
I
bet
he'd
do
anything
to
help
you
i'm
not
complaining
or
anything
he
got
gingerly
to
his
feet
rubbing
his
backside
but
i'm
aching
all
over
well
you
keep
missing
the
cushions
don't
you
said
Hermione
impatiently
rearranging
the
pile
of
cushions
they
had
used
for
the
Banishing
Spell
which
Flitwick
had
left
in
a
cabinet
just
try
and
fall
backward
once
you're
Stunned
you
can't
aim
too
well
Hermione
said
Ron
angrily
why
don't
you
take
a
turn
well
I
think
harry's
got
it
now
anyway
said
Hermione
hastily
and
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
Disarming
because
he's
been
able
to
do
that
for
ages
i
think
we
ought
to
start
on
some
of
these
hexes
this
evening
she
looked
down
the
list
they
had
made
in
the
library
i
like
the
look
of
this
one
she
said
this
Impediment
Curse
should
slow
down
anything
that's
trying
to
attack
you
harry
we'll
start
with
that
one
the
bell
rang
they
hastily
shoved
the
cushions
back
into
Flitwicks
cupboard
and
slipped
out
of
the
classroom
see
you
at
dinner
said
Hermione
and
she
set
off
for
Arithmancy
while
Harry
and
Ron
headed
toward
North
Tower
and
Divination
broad
strips
of
dazzling
gold
sunlight
tell
across
the
corridor
from
the
high
windows
the
sky
outside
was
so
brightly
blue
it
looked
as
though
it
had
been
enameled
it's
going
to
be
boiling
in
trelawney's
room
she
never
puts
out
that
fire
said
Ron
as
they
started
up
the
staircase
toward
the
silver
ladder
and
the
trapdoor
he
was
quite
right
the
dimly
lit
room
was
swelteringly
hot
the
fumes
from
the
perfumed
fire
were
heavier
than
ever
harrys
head
swam
as
he
made
his
way
over
to
one
of
the
curtained
windows
while
Professor
Trelawney
was
looking
the
other
way
disentangling
her
shawl
from
a
lamp
he
opened
it
an
inch
or
so
and
settled
back
in
his
chintz
armchair
so
that
a
soft
breeze
played
across
his
face
it
was
extremely
comfortable
my
dears
said
Professor
Trelawney
sitting
down
in
her
winged
armchair
in
front
of
the
class
and
peering
around
at
them
all
with
her
strangely
enlarged
eyes
we
have
almost
finished
our
work
on
planetary
divination
today
however
will
be
an
excellent
opportunity
to
examine
the
effects
of
Mars
for
he
is
placed
most
interestingly
at
the
present
time
if
you
will
all
look
this
way
I
will
dim
the
lights
she
waved
her
wand
and
the
lamps
went
out
the
fire
was
the
only
source
of
light
now
professor
Trelawney
bent
down
and
lifted
from
under
her
chair
a
miniature
model
of
the
solar
system
contained
within
a
glass
dome
it
was
a
beautiful
thing
each
of
the
moons
glimmered
in
place
around
the
nine
planets
and
the
fiery
sun
all
of
them
hanging
in
thin
air
beneath
the
glass
harry
watched
lazily
as
Professor
Trelawney
began
to
point
out
the
fascinating
angle
Mars
was
making
to
Neptune
the
heavily
perfumed
fumes
washed
over
him
and
the
breeze
from
the
window
played
across
his
face
he
could
hear
an
insect
humming
gently
somewhere
behind
the
curtain
his
eyelids
began
to
droop
he
was
riding
on
the
back
of
an
eagle
owl
soaring
through
the
clear
blue
sky
toward
an
old
ivycovered
house
set
high
on
a
hillside
lower
and
lower
they
flew
the
wind
blowing
pleasantly
in
harry's
face
until
they
reached
a
dark
and
broken
window
in
the
upper
story
of
the
house
and
entered
now
they
were
flying
along
a
gloomy
passageway
to
a
room
at
the
very
end
through
the
door
they
went
into
a
dark
room
whose
windows
were
boarded
up
harry
had
left
the
owl's
back
he
was
watching
now
as
it
fluttered
across
the
room
into
a
chair
with
its
back
to
him
there
were
two
dark
shapes
on
the
floor
beside
the
chair
both
of
them
were
stirring
one
was
a
huge
snake
the
other
was
a
man
a
short
balding
man
a
man
with
watery
eyes
and
a
pointed
nose
he
was
wheezing
and
sobbing
on
the
hearth
rug
you
are
in
luck
Wormtail
said
a
cold
highpitched
voice
from
the
depths
of
the
chair
in
which
the
owl
had
landed
you
are
very
fortunate
indeed
your
blunder
has
not
ruined
everything
he
is
dead
my
Lord
gasped
the
man
on
the
floor
my
Lord
I
am
i
am
so
pleased
and
so
sorry
nagini
said
the
cold
voice
you
are
out
of
luck
i
will
not
be
feeding
Wormtail
to
you
after
all
but
never
mind
never
mind
there
is
still
Harry
Potter
the
snake
hissed
harry
could
see
its
tongue
fluttering
now
Wormtail
said
the
cold
voice
perhaps
one
more
little
reminder
why
I
will
not
tolerate
another
blunder
from
you
my
Lord
no
i
beg
you
the
tip
of
a
wand
emerged
from
around
the
back
of
the
chair
it
was
pointing
at
Wormtail
crucio
said
the
cold
voice
wormtail
screamed
screamed
as
though
every
nerve
in
his
body
were
on
fire
the
screaming
filled
harry's
ears
as
the
scar
on
his
forehead
seared
with
pain
he
was
yelling
too
voldemort
would
hear
him
would
know
he
was
there
harry
harry
harry
opened
his
eyes
he
was
lying
on
the
floor
of
Professor
trelawney's
room
with
his
hands
over
his
face
his
scar
was
still
burning
so
badly
that
his
eyes
were
watering
the
pain
had
been
real
the
whole
class
was
standing
around
him
and
Ron
was
kneeling
next
to
him
looking
terrified
you
all
right
he
said
of
course
he
isn't
said
Professor
Trelawney
looking
thoroughly
excited
her
great
eyes
loomed
over
Harry
gazing
at
him
what
was
it
potter
a
premonition
an
apparition
what
did
you
see
nothing
Harry
lied
he
sat
up
he
could
feel
himself
shaking
he
couldn't
stop
himself
from
looking
around
into
the
shadows
behind
him
Voldemorts
voice
had
sounded
so
close
you
were
clutching
your
scar
said
Professor
Trelawney
you
were
rolling
on
the
floor
clutching
your
scar
come
now
potter
I
have
experience
in
these
matters
harry
looked
up
at
her
i
need
to
go
to
the
hospital
wing
I
think
he
said
bad
headache
my
dear
you
were
undoubtedly
stimulated
by
the
extraordinary
clairvoyant
vibrations
of
my
room
said
Professor
Trelawney
if
you
leave
now
you
may
lose
the
opportunity
to
see
further
than
you
have
ever
i
don't
want
to
see
anything
except
a
headache
cure
said
Harry
he
stood
up
the
class
backed
away
they
all
looked
unnerved
see
you
later
Harry
muttered
to
Ron
and
he
picked
up
his
bag
and
headed
for
the
trapdoor
ignoring
Professor
Trelawney
who
was
wearing
an
expression
of
great
frustration
as
though
she
had
just
been
denied
a
real
treat
when
Harry
reached
the
bottom
of
her
stepladder
however
he
did
not
set
off
for
the
hospital
wing
he
had
no
intention
whatsoever
of
going
there
sirius
had
told
him
what
to
do
if
his
scar
hurt
him
again
and
Harry
was
going
to
follow
his
advice
He
was
going
straight
to
dumbledore's
office
he
marched
down
the
corridors
thinking
about
what
he
had
seen
in
the
dream
it
had
been
as
vivid
as
the
one
that
had
awoken
him
on
Privet
Drive
he
ran
over
the
details
in
his
mind
trying
to
make
sure
he
could
remember
them
he
had
heard
Voldemort
accusing
Wormtail
of
making
a
blunder
but
the
owl
had
brought
good
news
the
blunder
had
been
repaired
somebody
was
dead
so
Wormtail
was
not
going
to
be
fed
to
the
snake
he
Harry
was
going
to
be
fed
to
it
instead
harry
had
walked
right
past
the
stone
gargoyle
guarding
the
entrance
to
Dumbledores
office
without
noticing
he
blinked
looked
around
realized
what
he
had
done
and
retraced
his
steps
stopping
in
front
of
it
then
he
remembered
that
he
didn't
know
the
password
sherbet
lemon
he
tried
tentatively
the
gargoyle
did
not
move
okay
said
Harry
staring
at
it
Pear
Drop
er
Licorice
Wand
fizzing
Whizbee
drooble's
Best
Blowing
Gum
bertie
bott's
Every
Flavor
Beans
oh
no
he
doesn't
like
them
does
he
oh
just
open
can't
you
he
said
angrily
i
really
need
to
see
him
its
urgent
the
gargoyle
remained
immovable
harry
kicked
it
achieving
nothing
but
an
excruciating
pain
in
his
big
toe
chocolate
Frog
he
yelled
angrily
standing
on
one
leg
sugar
Quill
cockroach
cluster
the
gargoyle
sprang
to
life
and
jumped
aside
harry
blinked
cockroach
Cluster
he
said
amazed
i
was
only
joking
he
hurried
through
the
gap
in
the
walls
and
stepped
onto
the
foot
of
a
spiral
stone
staircase
which
moved
slowly
upward
as
the
doors
closed
behind
him
taking
him
up
to
a
polished
oak
door
with
a
brass
door
knocker
he
could
hear
voices
from
inside
the
office
he
stepped
off
the
moving
staircase
and
hesitated
listening
dumbledore
i'm
afraid
I
don't
see
the
connection
don't
see
it
at
all
it
was
the
voice
of
the
Minister
of
Magic
Cornelius
Fudge
ludo
says
Berthas
perfectly
capable
of
getting
herself
lost
i
agree
we
would
have
expected
to
have
found
her
by
now
but
all
the
same
we've
no
evidence
of
foul
play
Dumbledore
none
at
all
as
for
her
disappearance
being
linked
with
Barty
crouch's
and
what
do
you
thinks
happened
to
Barty
Crouch
Minister
said
moody's
growling
voice
i
see
two
possibilities
Alastor
said
Fudge
either
Crouch
has
finally
cracked
more
than
likely
i'm
sure
you'll
agree
given
his
personal
history
lost
his
mind
and
gone
wandering
off
somewhere
he
wandered
extremely
quickly
if
that
is
the
case
Cornelius
said
Dumbledore
calmly
or
else
well
fudge
sounded
embarrassed
well
i'll
reserve
judgment
until
after
i've
seen
the
place
where
he
was
found
but
you
say
it
was
just
past
the
Beauxbatons
carriage
dumbledore
you
know
what
that
woman
is
i
consider
her
to
be
a
very
able
headmistress
and
an
excellent
dancer
said
Dumbledore
quietly
dumbledore
come
said
Fudge
angrily
don't
you
think
you
might
be
prejudiced
in
her
favor
because
of
Hagrid
they
don't
all
turn
out
harmless
if
indeed
you
can
call
Hagrid
harmless
with
that
monster
fixation
he's
got
i
no
more
suspect
Madame
Maxime
than
Hagrid
said
Dumbledore
just
as
calmly
i
think
it
possible
that
it
is
you
who
are
prejudiced
Cornelius
can
we
wrap
up
this
discussion
growled
Moody
yes
yes
let's
go
down
to
the
grounds
then
said
Fudge
impatiently
no
it's
not
that
said
Moody
it's
just
that
Potter
wants
a
word
with
you
Dumbledore
he's
just
outside
the
door
chapter
thirty
the
pensieve
the
door
of
the
office
opened
hello
Potter
said
Moody
come
in
then
harry
walked
inside
he
had
been
inside
dumbledore's
office
once
before
it
was
a
very
beautiful
circular
room
lined
with
pictures
of
previous
headmasters
and
headmistresses
of
Hogwarts
all
of
whom
were
fast
asleep
their
chests
rising
and
falling
gently
cornelius
Fudge
was
standing
beside
dumbledore's
desk
wearing
his
usual
pinstriped
cloak
and
holding
his
limegreen
bowler
hat
harry
said
Fudge
jovially
moving
forward
how
are
you
fine
Harry
lied
we
were
just
talking
about
the
night
when
mr.
Crouch
turned
up
on
the
grounds
said
Fudge
it
was
you
who
found
him
was
it
not
yes
said
Harry
then
feeling
it
was
pointless
to
pretend
that
he
hadn't
overheard
what
they
had
been
saying
he
added
I
didn't
see
Madame
Maxime
anywhere
though
and
she'd
have
a
job
hiding
wouldn't
she
dumbledore
smiled
at
Harry
behind
fudge's
back
his
eyes
twinkling
yes
well
said
Fudge
looking
embarrassed
we're
about
to
go
for
a
short
walk
on
the
grounds
Harry
if
you'll
excuse
us
perhaps
if
you
just
go
back
to
your
class
i
wanted
to
talk
to
you
professor
Harry
said
quickly
looking
at
Dumbledore
who
gave
him
a
swift
searching
look
wait
here
for
me
Harry
he
said
our
examination
of
the
grounds
will
not
take
long
they
trooped
out
in
silence
past
him
and
closed
the
door
after
a
minute
or
so
Harry
heard
the
clunks
of
moody's
wooden
leg
growing
fainter
in
the
corridor
below
he
looked
around
hello
Fawkes
he
said
fawkes
Professor
dumbledore's
phoenix
was
standing
on
his
golden
perch
beside
the
door
the
size
of
a
swan
with
magnificent
scarletandgold
plumage
he
swished
his
long
tail
and
blinked
benignly
at
Harry
harry
sat
down
in
a
chair
in
front
of
dumbledore's
desk
for
several
minutes
he
sat
and
watched
the
old
headmasters
and
headmistresses
snoozing
in
their
frames
thinking
about
what
he
had
just
heard
and
running
his
fingers
over
his
scar
it
had
stopped
hurting
now
he
felt
much
calmer
somehow
now
that
he
was
in
dumbledore's
office
knowing
he
would
shortly
be
telling
him
about
the
dream
harry
looked
up
at
the
walls
behind
the
desk
the
patched
and
ragged
Sorting
Hat
was
standing
on
a
shelf
a
glass
case
next
to
it
held
a
magnificent
silver
sword
with
large
rubies
set
into
the
hilt
which
Harry
recognized
as
the
one
he
himself
had
pulled
out
of
the
Sorting
Hat
in
his
second
year
the
sword
had
once
belonged
to
Godric
Gryffindor
founder
of
harry's
House
he
was
gazing
at
it
remembering
how
it
had
come
to
his
aid
when
he
had
thought
all
hope
was
lost
when
he
noticed
a
patch
of
silvery
light
dancing
and
shimmering
on
the
glass
case
he
looked
around
for
the
source
of
the
light
and
saw
a
sliver
of
silverwhite
shining
brightly
from
within
a
black
cabinet
behind
him
whose
door
had
not
been
closed
properly
harry
hesitated
glanced
at
Fawkes
then
got
up
walked
across
the
office
and
pulled
open
the
cabinet
door
a
shallow
stone
basin
lay
there
with
odd
carvings
around
the
edge
runes
and
symbols
that
Harry
did
not
recognize
the
silvery
light
was
coming
from
the
basin's
contents
which
were
like
nothing
Harry
had
ever
seen
before
he
could
not
tell
whether
the
substance
was
liquid
or
gas
it
was
a
bright
whitish
silver
and
it
was
moving
ceaselessly
the
surface
of
it
became
ruffled
like
water
beneath
wind
and
then
like
clouds
separated
and
swirled
smoothly
it
looked
like
light
made
liquid
or
like
wind
made
solid
Harry
couldn't
make
up
his
mind
he
wanted
to
touch
it
to
find
out
what
it
felt
like
but
nearly
four
years
experience
of
the
magical
world
told
him
that
sticking
his
hand
into
a
bowl
full
of
some
unknown
substance
was
a
very
stupid
thing
to
do
he
therefore
pulled
his
wand
out
of
the
inside
of
his
robes
cast
a
nervous
look
around
the
office
looked
back
at
the
contents
of
the
basin
and
prodded
them
the
surface
of
the
silvery
stuff
inside
the
basin
began
to
swirl
very
fast
harry
bent
closer
his
head
right
inside
the
cabinet
the
silvery
substance
had
become
transparent
it
looked
like
glass
he
looked
down
into
it
expecting
to
see
the
stone
bottom
of
the
basin
and
saw
instead
an
enormous
room
below
the
surface
of
the
mysterious
substance
a
room
into
which
he
seemed
to
be
looking
through
a
circular
window
in
the
ceiling
the
room
was
dimly
lit
he
thought
it
might
even
be
underground
for
there
were
no
windows
merely
torches
in
brackets
such
as
the
ones
that
illuminated
the
walls
of
Hogwarts
lowering
his
face
so
that
his
nose
was
a
mere
inch
away
from
the
glassy
substance
Harry
saw
that
rows
and
rows
of
witches
and
wizards
were
seated
around
every
wall
on
what
seemed
to
be
benches
rising
in
levels
an
empty
chair
stood
in
the
very
center
of
the
room
there
was
something
about
the
chair
that
gave
Harry
an
ominous
feeling
chains
encircled
the
arms
of
it
as
though
its
occupants
were
usually
tied
to
it
where
was
this
place
it
surely
wasn't
Hogwarts
he
had
never
seen
a
room
like
that
here
in
the
castle
moreover
the
crowd
in
the
mysterious
room
at
the
bottom
of
the
basin
was
comprised
of
adults
and
Harry
knew
there
were
not
nearly
that
many
teachers
at
Hogwarts
they
seemed
he
thought
to
be
waiting
for
something
even
though
he
could
only
see
the
tops
of
their
hats
all
of
their
faces
seemed
to
be
pointing
in
one
direction
and
none
of
them
were
talking
to
one
another
the
basin
being
circular
and
the
room
he
was
observing
square
Harry
could
not
make
out
what
was
going
on
in
the
corners
of
it
he
leaned
even
closer
tilting
his
head
trying
to
see
the
tip
of
his
nose
touched
the
strange
substance
into
which
he
was
staring
dumbledore's
office
gave
an
almighty
lurch
Harry
was
thrown
forward
and
pitched
headfirst
into
the
substance
inside
the
basin
But
his
head
did
not
hit
the
stone
bottom
he
was
falling
through
something
icy
cold
and
black
it
was
like
being
sucked
into
a
dark
whirlpool
And
suddenly
Harry
found
himself
sitting
on
a
bench
at
the
end
of
the
room
inside
the
basin
a
bench
raised
high
above
the
others
he
looked
up
at
the
high
stone
ceiling
expecting
to
see
the
circular
window
through
which
he
had
just
been
staring
but
there
was
nothing
there
but
dark
solid
stone
breathing
hard
and
fast
harry
looked
around
him
not
one
of
the
witches
and
wizards
in
the
room
and
there
were
at
least
two
hundred
of
them
was
looking
at
him
not
one
of
them
seemed
to
have
noticed
that
a
fourteenyearold
boy
had
just
dropped
from
the
ceiling
into
their
midst
harry
turned
to
the
wizard
next
to
him
on
the
bench
and
uttered
a
loud
cry
of
surprise
that
reverberated
around
the
silent
room
he
was
sitting
right
next
to
Albus
Dumbledore
professor
harry
said
in
a
kind
of
strangled
whisper
i'm
sorry
I
didn't
mean
to
I
was
just
looking
at
that
basin
in
your
cabinet
I
where
are
we
but
Dumbledore
didn't
move
or
speak
he
ignored
Harry
completely
like
every
other
wizard
on
the
benches
he
was
staring
into
the
far
corner
of
the
room
where
there
was
a
door
harry
gazed
nonplussed
at
Dumbledore
then
around
at
the
silently
watchful
crowd
then
back
at
Dumbledore
and
then
it
dawned
on
him
once
before
harry
had
found
himself
somewhere
that
nobody
could
see
or
hear
him
that
time
he
had
fallen
through
a
page
in
an
enchanted
diary
right
into
somebody
else's
memory
and
unless
he
was
very
much
mistaken
something
of
the
sort
had
happened
again
harry
raised
his
right
hand
hesitated
and
then
waved
it
energetically
in
from
of
dumbledore's
face
dumbledore
did
not
blink
look
around
at
Harry
or
indeed
move
at
all
and
that
in
harry's
opinion
settled
the
matter
dumbledore
wouldn't
ignore
him
like
that
he
was
inside
a
memory
and
this
was
not
the
presentday
Dumbledore
yet
it
couldn't
be
that
long
ago
the
Dumbledore
sitting
next
to
him
now
was
silverhaired
just
like
the
presentday
Dumbledore
but
what
was
this
place
what
were
all
these
wizards
waiting
for
harry
looked
around
more
carefully
the
room
as
he
had
suspected
when
observing
it
from
above
was
almost
certainly
underground
more
of
a
dungeon
than
a
room
he
thought
there
was
a
bleak
and
forbidding
air
about
the
place
there
were
no
pictures
on
the
walls
no
decorations
at
all
just
these
serried
rows
of
benches
rising
in
levels
all
around
the
room
all
positioned
so
that
they
had
a
clear
view
of
that
chair
with
the
chains
on
its
arms
before
Harry
could
reach
any
conclusions
about
the
place
in
which
they
were
he
heard
footsteps
the
door
in
the
corner
of
the
dungeon
opened
and
three
people
entered
or
at
least
one
man
flanked
by
two
dementors
harry's
insides
went
cold
the
dementors
tall
hooded
creatures
whose
faces
were
concealed
were
gliding
slowly
toward
the
chair
in
the
center
of
the
room
each
grasping
one
of
the
man's
arms
with
their
dead
and
rottenlooking
hands
the
man
between
them
looked
as
though
he
was
about
to
faint
and
Harry
couldn't
blame
him
he
knew
the
dementors
could
not
touch
him
inside
a
memory
but
he
remembered
their
power
only
too
well
the
watching
crowd
recoiled
slightly
as
the
dementors
placed
the
man
in
the
chained
chair
and
glided
back
out
of
the
room
the
door
swung
shut
behind
them
harry
looked
down
at
the
man
now
sitting
in
the
chair
and
saw
that
it
was
Karkaroff
unlike
Dumbledore
Karkaroff
looked
much
younger
his
hair
and
goatee
were
black
he
was
not
dressed
in
sleek
furs
but
in
thin
and
ragged
robes
he
was
shaking
even
as
Harry
watched
the
chains
on
the
arms
of
the
chair
glowed
suddenly
gold
and
snaked
their
way
up
karkaroff's
arms
binding
him
there
igor
Karkaroff
said
a
curt
voice
to
harry's
left
harry
looked
around
and
saw
mr.
Crouch
standing
up
in
the
middle
of
the
bench
beside
him
crouch's
hair
was
dark
his
face
was
much
less
lined
he
looked
fit
and
alert
you
have
been
brought
from
Azkaban
to
present
evidence
to
the
Ministry
of
Magic
you
have
given
us
to
understand
that
you
have
important
information
for
us
karkaroff
straightened
himself
as
best
he
could
tightly
bound
to
the
chair
i
have
sir
he
said
and
although
his
voice
was
very
scared
Harry
could
still
hear
the
familiar
unctuous
note
in
it
i
wish
to
be
of
use
to
the
Ministry
i
wish
to
help
i
I
know
that
the
Ministry
is
trying
to
to
round
up
the
last
of
the
Dark
Lords
supporters
i
am
eager
to
assist
in
any
way
I
can
there
was
a
murmur
around
the
benches
some
of
the
wizards
and
witches
were
surveying
Karkaroff
with
interest
others
with
pronounced
mistrust
then
Harry
heard
quite
distinctly
from
Dumbledores
other
side
a
familiar
growling
voice
saying
Filth
harry
leaned
forward
so
that
he
could
see
past
Dumbledore
madEye
Moody
was
sitting
there
except
that
there
was
a
very
noticeable
difference
in
his
appearance
he
did
not
have
his
magical
eye
but
two
normal
ones
both
were
looking
down
upon
Karkaroff
and
both
were
narrowed
in
intense
dislike
crouch
is
going
to
let
him
out
Moody
breathed
quietly
to
Dumbledore
he's
done
a
deal
with
him
took
me
six
months
to
track
him
down
and
Crouch
is
going
to
let
him
go
if
he's
got
enough
new
names
let's
hear
his
information
I
say
and
throw
him
straight
back
to
the
dementors
dumbledore
made
a
small
noise
of
dissent
through
his
long
crooked
nose
ah
I
was
forgetting
you
don't
like
the
dementors
do
you
Albus
said
Moody
with
a
sardonic
smile
no
said
Dumbledore
calmly
i'm
afraid
I
don't
i
have
long
felt
the
Ministry
is
wrong
to
ally
itself
with
such
creatures
but
for
filth
like
this
moody
said
softly
you
say
you
have
names
for
us
Karkaroff
said
mr.
Crouch
let
us
hear
them
please
you
must
understand
said
Karkaroff
hurriedly
that
HeWhoMustNotBe
Named
operated
always
in
the
greatest
secrecy
he
preferred
that
we
I
mean
to
say
his
supporters
and
I
regret
now
very
deeply
that
I
ever
counted
myself
among
them
get
on
with
it
sneered
Moody
we
never
knew
the
names
of
every
one
of
our
fellows
He
alone
knew
exactly
who
we
all
were
which
was
a
wise
move
wasn't
it
as
it
prevented
someone
like
you
Karkaroff
from
turning
all
of
them
in
muttered
Moody
yet
you
say
you
have
some
names
for
us
said
mr.
Crouch
i
I
do
said
Karkaroff
breathlessly
and
these
were
important
supporters
mark
you
people
I
saw
with
my
own
eyes
doing
his
bidding
i
give
this
information
as
a
sign
that
I
fully
and
totally
renounce
him
and
am
filled
with
a
remorse
so
deep
I
can
barely
these
names
are
said
mr.
Crouch
sharply
karkaroff
drew
a
deep
breath
there
was
Antonin
Dolohov
he
said
i
I
saw
him
torture
countless
Muggles
and
and
nonsupporters
of
the
Dark
Lord
and
helped
him
do
it
murmured
Moody
we
have
already
apprehended
Dolohov
said
Crouch
he
was
caught
shortly
after
yourself
indeed
said
Karkaroff
his
eyes
widening
i
I
am
delighted
to
hear
it
but
he
didn't
look
it
harry
could
tell
that
this
news
had
come
as
a
real
blow
to
him
one
of
his
names
was
worthless
any
others
said
Crouch
coldly
why
yes
there
was
Rosier
said
Karkaroff
hurriedly
evan
Rosier
rosier
is
dead
said
Crouch
he
was
caught
shortly
after
you
were
too
he
preferred
to
fight
rather
than
come
quietly
and
was
killed
in
the
struggle
took
a
bit
of
me
with
him
though
whispered
Moody
to
harry's
right
harry
looked
around
at
him
once
more
and
saw
him
indicating
the
large
chunk
out
of
his
nose
to
Dumbledore
no
no
more
than
Rosier
deserved
said
Karkaroff
a
real
note
of
panic
in
his
voice
now
harry
could
see
that
he
was
starting
to
worry
that
none
of
his
information
would
be
of
any
use
to
the
Ministry
karkaroff's
eyes
darted
toward
the
door
in
the
corner
behind
which
the
dementors
undoubtedly
still
stood
waiting
any
more
said
Crouch
yes
said
Karkaroff
there
was
Travers
he
helped
murder
the
McKinnons
mulciber
he
specialized
in
the
Imperius
Curse
forced
countless
people
to
do
horrific
things
rookwood
who
was
a
spy
and
passed
HeWhoMustNotBe
Named
useful
information
from
inside
the
Ministry
itself
harry
could
tell
that
this
time
Karkaroff
had
struck
gold
the
watching
crowd
was
all
murmuring
together
rookwood
said
mr.
Crouch
nodding
to
a
witch
sitting
in
front
of
him
who
began
scribbling
upon
her
piece
of
parchment
augustus
Rookwood
of
the
Department
of
Mysteries
the
very
same
said
Karkaroff
eagerly
i
believe
he
used
a
network
of
well
placed
wizards
both
inside
the
Ministry
and
out
to
collect
information
but
Travers
and
Mulciber
we
have
said
mr.
Crouch
very
well
Karkaroff
if
that
is
all
you
will
be
returned
to
Azkaban
while
we
decide
not
yet
cried
Karkaroff
looking
quite
desperate
wait
I
have
more
harry
could
see
him
sweating
in
the
torchlight
his
white
skin
contrasting
strongly
with
the
black
of
his
hair
and
beard
snape
he
shouted
severus
Snape
snape
has
been
cleared
by
this
council
said
Crouch
disdainfully
he
has
been
vouched
for
by
Albus
Dumbledore
no
shouted
Karkaroff
straining
at
the
chains
that
bound
him
to
the
chair
i
assure
you
severus
Snape
is
a
Death
Eater
dumbledore
had
gotten
to
his
feet
i
have
given
evidence
already
on
this
matter
he
said
calmly
severus
Snape
was
indeed
a
Death
Eater
however
he
rejoined
our
side
before
Lord
voldemort's
downfall
and
turned
spy
for
us
at
great
personal
risk
he
is
now
no
more
a
Death
Eater
than
I
am
harry
turned
to
look
at
MadEye
Moody
he
was
wearing
a
look
of
deep
skepticism
behind
dumbledore's
back
very
well
Karkaroff
Crouch
said
coldly
you
have
been
of
assistance
i
shall
review
your
case
you
will
return
to
Azkaban
in
the
meantime
mr.
crouch's
voice
faded
harry
looked
around
the
dungeon
was
dissolving
as
though
it
were
made
of
smoke
everything
was
fading
he
could
see
only
his
own
body
all
else
was
swirling
darkness
and
then
the
dungeon
returned
harry
was
sitting
in
a
different
seat
still
on
the
highest
bench
but
now
to
the
left
side
of
mr.
Crouch
the
atmosphere
seemed
quite
different
relaxed
even
cheerful
the
witches
and
wizards
all
around
the
walls
were
talking
to
one
another
almost
as
though
they
were
at
some
sort
of
sporting
event
harry
noticed
a
witch
halfway
up
the
rows
of
benches
opposite
she
had
short
blonde
hair
was
wearing
magenta
robes
and
was
sucking
the
end
of
an
acidgreen
quill
it
was
unmistakably
a
younger
Rita
Skeeter
harry
looked
around
Dumbledore
was
sitting
beside
him
again
wearing
different
robes
mr
crouch
looked
more
tired
and
somehow
fiercer
gaunter
harry
understood
it
was
a
different
memory
a
different
day
a
different
trial
the
door
in
the
corner
opened
and
Ludo
Bagman
walked
into
the
room
this
was
not
however
a
Ludo
Bagman
gone
to
seed
but
a
Ludo
Bagman
who
was
clearly
at
the
height
of
his
Quidditchplaying
fitness
his
nose
wasn't
broken
now
he
was
tall
and
lean
and
muscular
bagman
looked
nervous
as
he
sat
down
in
the
chained
chair
but
it
did
not
bind
him
there
as
it
had
bound
Karkaroff
and
Bagman
perhaps
taking
heart
from
this
glanced
around
at
the
watching
crowd
waved
at
a
couple
of
them
and
managed
a
small
smile
ludo
Bagman
you
have
been
brought
here
in
front
of
the
Council
of
Magical
Law
to
answer
charges
relating
to
the
activities
of
the
Death
Eaters
said
Mr
crouch
we
have
heard
the
evidence
against
you
and
are
about
to
reach
our
verdict
do
you
have
anything
to
add
to
your
testimony
before
we
pronounce
judgment
harry
couldn't
believe
his
ears
ludo
Bagman
a
Death
Eater
only
said
Bagman
smiling
awkwardly
well
I
know
i've
been
a
bit
of
an
idiot
one
or
two
wizards
and
witches
in
the
surrounding
seats
smiled
indulgently
mr
crouch
did
not
appear
to
share
their
feelings
he
was
staring
down
at
Ludo
Bagman
with
an
expression
of
the
utmost
severity
and
dislike
you
never
spoke
a
truer
word
boy
someone
muttered
dryly
to
Dumbledore
behind
Harry
he
looked
around
and
saw
Moody
sitting
there
again
if
I
didn't
know
he'd
always
been
dim
i'd
have
said
some
of
those
Bludgers
had
permanently
affected
his
brain
ludovic
Bagman
you
were
caught
passing
information
to
Lord
voldemort's
supporters
said
mr.
Crouch
for
this
I
suggest
a
term
of
imprisonment
in
Azkaban
lasting
no
less
than
but
there
was
an
angry
outcry
from
the
surrounding
benches
several
of
the
witches
and
wizards
around
the
walls
stood
up
shaking
their
heads
and
even
their
fists
at
mr.
Crouch
but
i've
told
you
I
had
no
idea
bagman
called
earnestly
over
the
crowd's
babble
his
round
blue
eyes
widening
none
at
all
old
Rookwood
was
a
friend
of
my
dad's
never
crossed
my
mind
he
was
in
with
YouKnowWho
i
thought
I
was
collecting
information
for
our
side
and
Rookwood
kept
talking
about
getting
me
a
job
in
the
Ministry
later
on
once
my
Quidditch
days
are
over
you
know
i
mean
I
can't
keep
getting
hit
by
Bludgers
for
the
rest
of
my
life
can
I
there
were
titters
from
the
crowd
it
will
be
put
to
the
vote
said
mr.
Crouch
coldly
he
turned
to
the
righthand
side
of
the
dungeon
the
jury
will
please
raise
their
hands
those
in
favor
of
imprisonment
harry
looked
toward
the
righthand
side
of
the
dungeon
not
one
person
raised
their
hand
many
of
the
witches
and
wizards
around
the
walls
began
to
clap
one
of
the
witches
on
the
jury
stood
up
yes
barked
Crouch
we'd
just
like
to
congratulate
mr.
Bagman
on
his
splendid
performance
for
England
in
the
Quidditch
match
against
Turkey
last
Saturday
the
witch
said
breathlessly
mr.
Crouch
looked
furious
the
dungeon
was
ringing
with
applause
now
bagman
got
to
his
feet
and
bowed
beaming
despicable
mr.
Crouch
spat
at
Dumbledore
sitting
down
as
Bagman
walked
out
of
the
dungeon
rookwood
get
him
a
job
indeed
the
day
Ludo
Bagman
joins
us
will
be
a
sad
day
indeed
for
the
Ministry
and
the
dungeon
dissolved
again
when
it
had
returned
Harry
looked
around
he
and
Dumbledore
were
still
sitting
beside
mr.
Crouch
but
the
atmosphere
could
not
have
been
more
different
there
was
total
silence
broken
only
by
the
dry
sobs
of
a
frail
wispylooking
witch
in
the
seat
next
to
mr.
Crouch
she
was
clutching
a
handkerchief
to
her
mouth
with
trembling
hands
harry
looked
up
at
Crouch
and
saw
that
he
looked
gaunter
and
grayer
than
ever
before
a
nerve
was
twitching
in
his
temple
bring
them
in
he
said
and
his
voice
echoed
through
the
silent
dungeon
the
door
in
the
corner
opened
yet
again
six
dementors
entered
this
time
flanking
a
group
of
four
people
harry
saw
the
people
in
the
crowd
turn
to
look
up
at
Mr
crouch
a
few
of
them
whispered
to
one
another
the
dementors
placed
each
of
the
four
people
in
the
four
chairs
with
chained
arms
that
now
stood
on
the
dungeon
floor
there
was
a
thickset
man
who
stared
blankly
up
at
Crouch
a
thinner
and
more
nervouslooking
man
whose
eyes
were
darting
around
the
crowd
a
woman
with
thick
shining
dark
hair
and
heavily
hooded
eyes
who
was
sitting
in
the
chained
chair
as
though
it
were
a
throne
and
a
boy
in
his
late
teens
who
looked
nothing
short
of
petrified
he
was
shivering
his
straw
colored
hair
all
over
his
face
his
freckled
skin
milkwhite
the
wispy
little
witch
beside
Crouch
began
to
rock
backward
and
forward
in
her
seat
whimpering
into
her
handkerchief
crouch
stood
up
he
looked
down
upon
the
four
in
front
of
him
and
there
was
pure
hatred
in
his
face
you
have
been
brought
here
before
the
Council
of
Magical
Law
he
said
clearly
so
that
we
may
pass
judgment
on
you
for
a
crime
so
heinous
father
said
the
boy
with
the
strawcolored
hair
father
please
that
we
have
rarely
heard
the
like
of
it
within
this
court
said
Crouch
speaking
more
loudly
drowning
out
his
son's
voice
we
have
heard
the
evidence
against
you
the
four
of
you
stand
accused
of
capturing
an
Auror
Frank
Longbottom
and
subjecting
him
to
the
Cruciatus
Curse
believing
him
to
have
knowledge
of
the
present
whereabouts
of
your
exiled
master
HeWhoMustNotBeNamed
father
I
didn't
shrieked
the
boy
in
chains
below
i
didn't
I
swear
it
father
don't
send
me
back
to
the
dementors
you
are
further
accused
bellowed
mr.
Crouch
of
using
the
Cruciatus
Curse
on
Frank
longbottom's
wife
when
he
would
not
give
you
information
you
planned
to
restore
HeWhoMustNotBeNamed
to
power
and
to
resume
the
lives
of
violence
you
presumably
led
while
he
was
strong
i
now
ask
the
jury
mother
screamed
the
boy
below
and
the
wispy
little
witch
beside
Crouch
began
to
sob
rocking
backward
and
forward
mother
stop
him
mother
I
didn't
do
it
it
wasn't
me
i
now
ask
the
jury
shouted
mr.
Crouch
to
raise
their
hands
if
they
believe
as
I
do
that
these
crimes
deserve
a
life
sentence
in
Azkaban
in
unison
the
witches
and
wizards
along
the
righthand
side
of
the
dungeon
raised
their
hands
the
crowd
around
the
walls
began
to
clap
as
it
had
for
Bagman
their
faces
full
of
savage
triumph
the
boy
began
to
scream
no
mother
no
i
didn't
do
it
I
didn't
do
it
I
didn't
know
don't
send
me
there
don't
let
him
the
dementors
were
gliding
back
into
the
room
the
boys
three
companions
rose
quietly
from
their
seats
the
woman
with
the
heavylidded
eyes
looked
up
at
Crouch
and
called
The
Dark
Lord
will
rise
again
Crouch
throw
us
into
Azkaban
we
will
wait
he
will
rise
again
and
will
come
for
us
he
will
reward
us
beyond
any
of
his
other
supporters
we
alone
were
faithful
we
alone
tried
to
find
him
but
the
boy
was
trying
to
fight
off
the
dementors
even
though
Harry
could
see
their
cold
draining
power
starting
to
affect
him
the
crowd
was
jeering
some
of
them
on
their
feet
as
the
woman
swept
out
of
the
dungeon
and
the
boy
continued
to
struggle
i'm
your
son
he
screamed
up
at
Crouch
i'm
your
son
you
are
no
son
of
mine
bellowed
mr.
Crouch
his
eyes
bulging
suddenly
i
have
no
son
the
wispy
witch
beside
him
gave
a
great
gasp
and
slumped
in
her
seat
she
had
fainted
crouch
appeared
not
to
have
noticed
take
them
away
crouch
roared
at
the
dementors
spit
flying
from
his
mouth
take
them
away
and
may
they
rot
there
father
father
I
wasn't
involved
no
no
father
please
i
think
harry
it
is
time
to
return
to
my
office
said
a
quiet
voice
in
Harrys
ear
harry
started
he
looked
around
then
he
looked
on
his
other
side
there
was
an
Albus
Dumbledore
sitting
on
his
right
watching
crouch's
son
being
dragged
away
by
the
dementors
and
there
was
an
Albus
Dumbledore
on
his
left
looking
right
at
him
come
said
the
Dumbledore
on
his
left
and
he
put
his
hand
under
Harrys
elbow
harry
felt
himself
rising
into
the
air
the
dungeon
dissolved
around
him
for
a
moment
all
was
blackness
and
then
he
felt
as
though
he
had
done
a
slowmotion
somersault
suddenly
landing
flat
on
his
feet
in
what
seemed
like
the
dazzling
light
of
dumbledore's
sunlit
office
the
stone
basin
was
shimmering
in
the
cabinet
in
front
of
him
and
Albus
Dumbledore
was
standing
beside
him
professor
Harry
gasped
I
know
I
shouldn't've
I
didn't
mean
the
cabinet
door
was
sort
of
open
and
i
quite
understand
said
Dumbledore
he
lifted
the
basin
carried
it
over
to
his
desk
placed
it
upon
the
polished
top
and
sat
down
in
the
chair
behind
it
he
motioned
for
Harry
to
sit
down
opposite
him
harry
did
so
staring
at
the
stone
basin
the
contents
had
returned
to
their
original
silverywhite
state
swirling
and
rippling
beneath
his
gaze
what
is
it
harry
asked
shakily
this
it
is
called
a
Pensieve
said
Dumbledore
i
sometimes
find
and
I
am
sure
you
know
the
feeling
that
I
simply
have
too
many
thoughts
and
memories
crammed
into
my
mind
er
said
Harry
who
couldn't
truthfully
say
that
he
had
ever
felt
anything
of
the
sort
at
these
times
said
Dumbledore
indicating
the
stone
basin
I
use
the
Pensieve
one
simply
siphons
the
excess
thoughts
from
one's
mind
pours
them
into
the
basin
and
examines
them
at
one's
leisure
it
becomes
easier
to
spot
patterns
and
links
you
understand
when
they
are
in
this
form
you
mean
that
stuff's
your
thoughts
harry
said
staring
at
the
swirling
white
substance
in
the
basin
certainly
said
Dumbledore
let
me
show
you
dumbledore
drew
his
wand
out
of
the
inside
of
his
robes
and
placed
the
tip
into
his
own
silvery
hair
near
his
temple
when
he
took
the
wand
away
hair
seemed
to
be
clinging
to
it
but
then
Harry
saw
that
it
was
in
fact
a
glistening
strand
of
the
same
strange
silverywhite
substance
that
filled
the
Pensieve
dumbledore
added
this
fresh
thought
to
the
basin
and
Harry
astonished
saw
his
own
face
swimming
around
the
surface
of
the
bowl
dumbledore
placed
his
long
hands
on
either
side
of
the
Pensieve
and
swirled
it
rather
as
a
gold
prospector
would
pan
for
fragments
of
gold
and
Harry
saw
his
own
face
change
smoothly
into
snape's
who
opened
his
mouth
and
spoke
to
the
ceiling
his
voice
echoing
slightly
it's
coming
back
karkaroff's
too
stronger
and
clearer
than
ever
a
connection
I
could
have
made
without
assistance
Dumbledore
sighed
but
never
mind
he
peered
over
the
top
of
his
halfmoon
spectacles
at
Harry
who
was
gaping
at
snape's
face
which
was
continuing
to
swirl
around
the
bowl
i
was
using
the
Pensieve
when
mr.
Fudge
arrived
for
our
meeting
and
put
it
away
rather
hastily
undoubtedly
I
did
not
fasten
the
cabinet
door
properly
naturally
it
would
have
attracted
your
attention
i'm
sorry
Harry
mumbled
dumbledore
shook
his
head
curiosity
is
not
a
sin
he
said
but
we
should
exercise
caution
with
our
curiosity
yes
indeed
frowning
slightly
he
prodded
the
thoughts
within
the
basin
with
the
tip
of
his
wand
instantly
a
figure
rose
out
of
it
a
plump
scowling
girl
of
about
sixteen
who
began
to
revolve
slowly
with
her
feet
still
in
the
basin
she
took
no
notice
whatsoever
of
Harry
or
Professor
Dumbledore
when
she
spoke
her
voice
echoed
as
snape's
had
done
as
though
it
were
coming
from
the
depths
of
the
stone
basin
he
put
a
hex
on
me
Professor
Dumbledore
and
I
was
only
teasing
him
sir
I
only
said
i'd
seen
him
kissing
Florence
behind
the
greenhouses
last
Thursday
but
why
bertha
said
Dumbledore
sadly
looking
up
at
the
now
silently
revolving
girl
why
did
you
have
to
follow
him
in
the
first
place
bertha
harry
whispered
looking
up
at
her
is
that
was
that
Bertha
Jorkins
yes
said
Dumbledore
prodding
the
thoughts
in
the
basin
again
Bertha
sank
back
into
them
and
they
became
silvery
and
opaque
once
more
that
was
Bertha
as
I
remember
her
at
school
the
silvery
light
from
the
Pensieve
illuminated
dumbledore's
face
and
it
struck
Harry
suddenly
how
very
old
he
was
looking
he
knew
of
course
that
Dumbledore
was
getting
on
in
years
but
somehow
he
never
really
thought
of
Dumbledore
as
an
old
man
so
Harry
said
Dumbledore
quietly
before
you
got
lost
in
my
thoughts
you
wanted
to
tell
me
something
yes
said
Harry
professor
I
was
in
Divination
just
now
and
er
I
fell
asleep
he
hesitated
here
wondering
if
a
reprimand
was
coming
but
Dumbledore
merely
said
Quite
understandable
continue
well
I
had
a
dream
said
Harry
a
dream
about
Lord
Voldemort
he
was
torturing
Wormtail
you
know
who
Wormtail
i
do
know
said
Dumbledore
promptly
please
continue
voldemort
got
a
letter
from
an
owl
he
said
something
like
wormtail's
blunder
had
been
repaired
he
said
someone
was
dead
then
he
said
Wormtail
wouldn't
be
fed
to
the
snake
there
was
a
snake
beside
his
chair
he
said
he
said
he'd
be
feeding
me
to
it
instead
then
he
did
the
Cruciatus
Curse
on
Wormtail
and
my
scar
hurt
Harry
said
it
woke
me
up
it
hurt
so
badly
dumbledore
merely
looked
at
him
er
that's
all
said
Harry
i
see
said
Dumbledore
quietly
i
see
now
has
your
scar
hurt
at
any
other
time
this
year
excepting
the
time
it
woke
you
up
over
the
summer
no
I
how
did
you
know
it
woke
me
up
over
the
summer
said
Harry
astonished
you
are
not
sirius's
only
correspondent
said
Dumbledore
i
have
also
been
in
contact
with
him
ever
since
he
left
Hogwarts
last
year
it
was
I
who
suggested
the
mountainside
cave
as
the
safest
place
for
him
to
stay
dumbledore
got
up
and
began
walking
up
and
down
behind
his
desk
every
now
and
then
he
placed
his
wand
tip
to
his
temple
removed
another
shining
silver
thought
and
added
it
to
the
Pensieve
the
thoughts
inside
began
to
swirl
so
fast
that
Harry
couldn't
make
out
anything
clearly
It
was
merely
a
blur
of
color
professor
he
said
quietly
after
a
couple
of
minutes
dumbledore
stopped
pacing
and
looked
at
Harry
my
apologies
he
said
quietly
he
sat
back
down
at
his
desk
d'you
d'you
know
why
my
scar's
hurting
me
dumbledore
looked
very
intently
at
Harry
for
a
moment
and
then
said
I
have
a
theory
no
more
than
that
it
is
my
belief
that
your
scar
hurts
both
when
Lord
Voldemort
is
near
you
and
when
he
is
feeling
a
particularly
strong
surge
of
hatred
but
why
because
you
and
he
are
connected
by
the
curse
that
failed
said
Dumbledore
that
is
no
ordinary
scar
so
you
think
that
dream
did
it
really
happen
it
is
possible
said
Dumbledore
i
would
say
probable
harry
did
you
see
Voldemort
no
said
Harry
just
the
back
of
his
chair
but
there
wouldn't
have
been
anything
to
see
would
there
i
mean
he
hasn't
got
a
body
has
he
but
but
then
how
could
he
have
held
the
wand
harry
said
slowly
how
indeed
muttered
Dumbledore
how
indeed
neither
Dumbledore
nor
Harry
spoke
for
a
while
dumbledore
was
gazing
across
the
room
and
every
now
and
then
placing
his
wand
tip
to
his
temple
and
adding
another
shining
silver
thought
to
the
seething
mass
within
the
Pensieve
professor
Harry
said
at
last
do
you
think
he's
getting
stronger
voldemort
said
Dumbledore
looking
at
Harry
over
the
Pensieve
it
was
the
characteristic
piercing
look
Dumbledore
had
given
him
on
other
occasions
and
always
made
Harry
feel
as
though
Dumbledore
were
seeing
right
through
him
in
a
way
that
even
moody's
magical
eye
could
not
once
again
harry
I
can
only
give
you
my
suspicions
dumbledore
sighed
again
and
he
looked
older
and
wearier
than
ever
the
years
of
voldemort's
ascent
to
power
he
said
were
marked
with
disappearances
bertha
Jorkins
has
vanished
without
a
trace
in
the
place
where
Voldemort
was
certainly
known
to
be
last
mr.
Crouch
too
has
disappeared
within
these
very
grounds
and
there
was
a
third
disappearance
one
which
the
Ministry
I
regret
to
say
do
not
consider
of
any
importance
for
it
concerns
a
Muggle
his
name
was
Frank
Bryce
he
lived
in
the
village
where
voldemort's
father
grew
up
and
he
has
not
been
seen
since
last
August
you
see
I
read
the
Muggle
newspapers
unlike
most
of
my
Ministry
friends
dumbledore
looked
very
seriously
at
Harry
these
disappearances
seem
to
me
to
be
linked
the
Ministry
disagrees
as
you
may
have
heard
while
waiting
outside
my
office
harry
nodded
silence
fell
between
them
again
Dumbledore
extracting
thoughts
every
now
and
then
harry
felt
as
though
he
ought
to
go
but
his
curiosity
held
him
in
his
chair
professor
he
said
again
yes
Harry
said
Dumbledore
er
could
I
ask
you
about
that
court
thing
I
was
in
in
the
Pensieve
you
could
said
Dumbledore
heavily
i
attended
it
many
times
but
some
trials
come
back
to
me
more
clearly
than
others
particularly
now
you
know
you
know
the
trial
you
found
me
in
the
one
with
crouch's
son
well
were
they
talking
about
neville's
parents
dumbledore
gave
Harry
a
very
sharp
look
has
Neville
never
told
you
why
he
has
been
brought
up
by
his
grandmother
he
said
harry
shook
his
head
wondering
as
he
did
so
how
he
could
have
failed
to
ask
Neville
this
in
almost
four
years
of
knowing
him
yes
they
were
talking
about
Nevilles
parents
said
Dumbledore
his
father
Frank
was
an
Auror
just
like
Professor
Moody
he
and
his
wife
were
tortured
for
information
about
voldemort's
whereabouts
after
he
lost
his
powers
as
you
heard
so
they're
dead
said
Harry
quietly
no
said
Dumbledore
his
voice
full
of
a
bitterness
Harry
had
never
heard
there
before
they
are
insane
they
are
both
in
st.
mungo's
Hospital
for
Magical
Maladies
and
Injuries
i
believe
Neville
visits
them
with
his
grandmother
during
the
holidays
they
do
not
recognize
him
harry
sat
there
horrorstruck
he
had
never
known
never
in
four
years
bothered
to
find
out
the
Longbottoms
were
very
popular
said
Dumbledore
the
attacks
on
them
came
after
voldemort's
fall
from
power
just
when
everyone
thought
they
were
safe
those
attacks
caused
a
wave
of
fury
such
as
I
have
never
known
the
Ministry
was
under
great
pressure
to
catch
those
who
had
done
it
unfortunately
the
Longbottoms
evidence
was
given
their
condition
none
too
reliable
then
mr.
crouch's
son
might
not
have
been
involved
said
Harry
slowly
dumbledore
shook
his
head
as
to
that
I
have
no
idea
harry
sat
in
silence
once
more
watching
the
contents
of
the
Pensieve
swirl
there
were
two
more
questions
he
was
burning
to
ask
but
they
concerned
the
guilt
of
living
people
er
he
said
mr.
Bagman
has
never
been
accused
of
any
Dark
activity
since
said
Dumbledore
calmly
right
said
Harry
hastily
staring
at
the
contents
of
the
Pensieve
again
which
were
swirling
more
slowly
now
that
Dumbledore
had
stopped
adding
thoughts
and
er
but
the
Pensieve
seemed
to
be
asking
his
question
for
him
snape's
face
was
swimming
on
the
surface
again
dumbledore
glanced
down
into
it
and
then
up
at
Harry
no
more
has
Professor
Snape
he
said
harry
looked
into
dumbledore's
light
blue
eyes
and
the
thing
he
really
wanted
to
know
spilled
out
of
his
mouth
before
he
could
stop
it
what
made
you
think
he'd
really
stopped
supporting
Voldemort
Professor
dumbledore
held
Harrys
gaze
for
a
few
seconds
and
then
said
That
Harry
is
a
matter
between
Professor
Snape
and
myself
harry
knew
that
the
interview
was
over
Dumbledore
did
not
look
angry
yet
there
was
a
finality
in
his
tone
that
told
Harry
it
was
time
to
go
he
stood
up
and
so
did
Dumbledore
harry
he
said
as
Harry
reached
the
door
please
do
not
speak
about
neville's
parents
to
anybody
else
he
has
the
right
to
let
people
know
when
he
is
ready
yes
Professor
said
Harry
turning
to
go
and
harry
looked
back
dumbledore
was
standing
over
the
Pensieve
his
face
lit
from
beneath
by
its
silvery
spots
of
light
looking
older
than
ever
he
stared
at
Harry
for
a
moment
and
then
said
Good
luck
with
the
third
task
chapter
thirtyone
the
third
task
dumbledore
reckons
youknowwho's
getting
stronger
again
as
well
ron
whispered
everything
Harry
had
seen
in
the
Pensieve
nearly
everything
Dumbledore
had
told
and
shown
him
afterward
he
had
now
shared
with
Ron
and
Hermione
and
of
course
with
Sirius
to
whom
Harry
had
sent
an
owl
the
moment
he
had
left
dumbledore's
office
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
sat
up
late
in
the
common
room
once
again
that
night
talking
it
all
over
until
harry's
mind
was
reeling
until
he
understood
what
Dumbledore
had
meant
about
a
head
becoming
so
full
of
thoughts
that
it
would
have
been
a
relief
to
siphon
them
off
ron
stared
into
the
common
room
fire
harry
thought
he
saw
Ron
shiver
slightly
even
though
the
evening
was
warm
and
he
trusts
Snape
ron
said
he
really
trusts
Snape
even
though
he
knows
he
was
a
Death
Eater
yes
said
Harry
hermione
had
not
spoken
for
ten
minutes
she
was
sitting
with
her
forehead
in
her
hands
staring
at
her
knees
harry
thought
she
too
looked
as
though
she
could
have
done
with
a
Pensieve
rita
Skeeter
she
muttered
finally
how
can
you
be
worrying
about
her
now
said
Ron
in
utter
disbelief
i'm
not
worrying
about
her
Hermione
said
to
her
knees
i'm
just
thinking
remember
what
she
said
to
me
in
the
Three
Broomsticks
i
know
things
about
Ludo
Bagman
that
would
make
your
hair
curl
this
is
what
she
meant
isn't
it
she
reported
his
trial
she
knew
he'd
passed
information
to
the
Death
Eaters
and
Winky
too
remember
ludo
bagman's
a
bad
wizard
mr.
Crouch
would
have
been
furious
he
got
off
he
would
have
talked
about
it
at
home
yeah
but
Bagman
didn't
pass
information
on
purpose
did
he
hermione
shrugged
and
Fudge
reckons
Madame
Maxime
attacked
Crouch
ron
said
turning
back
to
Harry
yeah
said
Harry
but
he's
only
saying
that
because
Crouch
disappeared
near
the
Beauxbatons
carriage
we
never
thought
of
her
did
we
said
Ron
slowly
mind
you
she's
definitely
got
giant
blood
and
she
doesn't
want
to
admit
it
of
course
she
doesn't
said
Hermione
sharply
looking
up
look
what
happened
to
Hagrid
when
Rita
found
out
about
his
mother
look
at
Fudge
jumping
to
conclusions
about
her
just
because
she's
part
giant
who
needs
that
sort
of
prejudice
i'd
probably
say
I
had
big
bones
if
I
knew
that's
what
i'd
get
for
telling
the
truth
hermione
looked
at
her
watch
we
haven't
done
any
practicing
she
said
looking
shocked
we
were
going
to
do
the
Impediment
Curse
we'll
have
to
really
get
down
to
it
tomorrow
come
on
harry
you
need
to
get
some
sleep
harry
and
Ron
went
slowly
upstairs
to
their
dormitory
as
Harry
pulled
on
his
pajamas
he
looked
over
at
Nevilles
bed
true
to
his
word
to
Dumbledore
he
had
not
told
Ron
and
Hermione
about
Neville
s
parents
as
Harry
took
off
his
glasses
and
climbed
into
his
fourposter
he
imagined
how
it
must
feel
to
have
parents
still
living
but
unable
to
recognize
you
he
often
got
sympathy
from
strangers
for
being
an
orphan
but
as
he
listened
to
Nevilles
snores
he
thought
that
Neville
deserved
it
more
than
he
did
lying
in
the
darkness
Harry
felt
a
rush
of
anger
and
hate
toward
the
people
who
had
tortured
mr.
and
Mrs
longbottom
he
remembered
the
jeers
of
the
crowd
as
crouch's
son
and
his
companions
had
been
dragged
from
the
court
by
the
dementors
he
understood
how
they
had
felt
then
he
remembered
the
milkwhite
face
of
the
screaming
boy
and
realized
with
a
jolt
that
he
had
died
a
year
later
it
was
Voldemort
Harry
thought
staring
up
at
the
canopy
of
his
bed
in
the
darkness
it
all
came
back
to
Voldemort
he
was
the
one
who
had
torn
these
families
apart
who
had
ruined
all
these
lives
ron
and
Hermione
were
supposed
to
be
studying
for
their
exams
which
would
finish
on
the
day
of
the
third
task
but
they
were
putting
most
of
their
efforts
into
helping
Harry
prepare
don't
worry
about
it
Hermione
said
shortly
when
Harry
pointed
this
out
to
them
and
said
he
didn't
mind
practicing
on
his
own
for
a
while
at
least
we'll
get
top
marks
in
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
we'd
never
have
found
out
about
all
these
hexes
in
class
good
training
for
when
we're
all
Aurors
said
Ron
excitedly
attempting
the
Impediment
Curse
on
a
wasp
that
had
buzzed
into
the
room
and
making
it
stop
dead
in
midair
the
mood
in
the
castle
as
they
entered
June
became
excited
and
tense
again
everyone
was
looking
forward
to
the
third
task
which
would
take
place
a
week
before
the
end
of
term
harry
was
practicing
hexes
at
every
available
moment
he
felt
more
confident
about
this
task
than
either
of
the
others
difficult
and
dangerous
though
it
would
undoubtedly
be
Moody
was
right
Harry
had
managed
to
find
his
way
past
monstrous
creatures
and
enchanted
barriers
before
now
and
this
time
he
had
some
notice
some
chance
to
prepare
himself
for
what
lay
ahead
tired
of
walking
in
on
Harry
Hermione
and
Ron
all
over
the
school
professor
McGonagall
had
given
them
permission
to
use
the
empty
Transfiguration
classroom
at
lunchtimes
harry
had
soon
mastered
the
Impediment
Curse
a
spell
to
slow
down
and
obstruct
attackers
the
Reductor
Curse
which
would
enable
him
to
blast
solid
objects
out
of
his
way
and
the
FourPoint
Spell
a
useful
discovery
of
Hermiones
that
would
make
his
wand
point
due
north
therefore
enabling
him
to
check
whether
he
was
going
in
the
right
direction
within
the
maze
he
was
still
having
trouble
with
the
Shield
Charm
though
this
was
supposed
to
cast
a
temporary
invisible
wall
around
himself
that
deflected
minor
curses
Hermione
managed
to
shatter
it
with
a
wellplaced
JellyLegs
Jinx
and
Harry
wobbled
around
the
room
for
ten
minutes
afterward
before
she
had
looked
up
the
counter
jinx
you're
still
doing
really
well
though
Hermione
said
encouragingly
looking
down
her
list
and
crossing
off
those
spells
they
had
already
learned
some
of
these
are
bound
to
come
in
handy
come
and
look
at
this
said
Ron
who
was
standing
by
the
window
he
was
staring
down
onto
the
grounds
what's
Malfoy
doing
harry
and
Hermione
went
to
see
malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
were
standing
in
the
shadow
of
a
tree
below
crabbe
and
Goyle
seemed
to
be
keeping
a
lookout
both
were
smirking
malfoy
was
holding
his
hand
up
to
his
mouth
and
speaking
into
it
he
looks
like
he's
using
a
walkietalkie
said
Harry
curiously
he
can't
be
said
Hermione
i've
told
you
those
sorts
of
things
don't
work
around
Hogwarts
come
on
Harry
she
added
briskly
turning
away
from
the
window
and
moving
back
into
the
middle
of
the
room
let's
try
that
Shield
Charm
again
sirius
was
sending
daily
owls
now
like
Hermione
he
seemed
to
want
to
concentrate
on
getting
Harry
through
the
last
task
before
they
concerned
themselves
with
anything
else
he
reminded
Harry
in
every
letter
that
whatever
might
be
going
on
outside
the
walls
of
Hogwarts
was
not
harry's
responsibility
nor
was
it
within
his
power
to
influence
it
if
Voldemort
is
really
getting
stronger
again
he
wrote
my
priority
is
to
ensure
your
safety
he
cannot
hope
to
lay
hands
on
you
while
you
are
under
dumbledore's
protection
but
all
the
same
take
no
risks
Concentrate
on
getting
through
that
maze
safely
and
then
we
can
turn
our
attention
to
other
matters
harry's
nerves
mounted
as
June
the
twentyfourth
drew
closer
but
they
were
not
as
bad
as
those
he
had
felt
before
the
first
and
second
tasks
for
one
thing
he
was
confident
that
this
time
he
had
done
everything
in
his
power
to
prepare
for
the
task
for
another
this
was
the
final
hurdle
and
however
well
or
badly
he
did
the
tournament
would
at
last
be
over
which
would
be
an
enormous
relief
breakfast
was
a
very
noisy
affair
at
the
Gryffindor
table
on
the
morning
of
the
third
task
the
post
owls
appeared
bringing
Harry
a
goodluck
card
from
Sirius
it
was
only
a
piece
of
parchment
folded
over
and
bearing
a
muddy
paw
print
on
its
front
but
Harry
appreciated
it
all
the
same
a
screech
owl
arrived
for
Hermione
carrying
her
morning
copy
of
the
Daily
Prophet
as
usual
she
unfolded
the
paper
glanced
at
the
front
page
and
spat
out
a
mouthful
of
pumpkin
juice
all
over
it
what
said
Harry
and
Ron
together
staring
at
her
nothing
said
Hermione
quickly
trying
to
shove
the
paper
out
of
sight
but
Ron
grabbed
it
he
stared
at
the
headline
and
said
No
way
not
today
that
old
cow
what
said
Harry
rita
Skeeter
again
no
said
Ron
and
just
like
Hermione
he
attempted
to
push
the
paper
out
of
sight
it's
about
me
isn't
it
said
Harry
no
said
Ron
in
an
entirely
unconvincing
tone
but
before
Harry
could
demand
to
see
the
paper
draco
Malfoy
shouted
across
the
Great
Hall
from
the
Slytherin
table
hey
Potter
potter
how's
your
head
you
feeling
all
right
sure
you're
not
going
to
go
berserk
on
us
malfoy
was
holding
a
copy
of
the
Daily
Prophet
too
slytherins
up
and
down
the
table
were
sniggering
twisting
in
their
seats
to
see
harry's
reaction
let
me
see
it
Harry
said
to
Ron
give
it
here
very
reluctantly
Ron
handed
over
the
newspaper
harry
turned
it
over
and
found
himself
staring
at
his
own
picture
beneath
the
banner
headline
harry
potter
disturbed
and
dangerous
the
boy
who
defeated
HeWhoMustNotBeNamed
is
unstable
and
possibly
dangerous
writes
Rita
Skeeter
Special
Correspondent
alarming
evidence
has
recently
come
to
light
about
Harry
potter's
strange
behavior
which
casts
doubts
upon
his
suitability
to
compete
in
a
demanding
competition
like
the
Triwizard
Tournament
or
even
to
attend
Hogwarts
School
potter
the
Daily
Prophet
can
exclusively
reveal
regularly
collapses
at
school
and
is
often
heard
to
complain
of
pain
in
the
scar
on
his
forehead
relic
of
the
curse
with
which
YouKnowWho
attempted
to
kill
him
on
Monday
last
midway
through
a
Divination
lesson
your
Daily
Prophet
reporter
witnessed
Potter
storming
from
the
class
claiming
that
his
scar
was
hurting
too
badly
to
continue
studying
it
is
possible
say
top
experts
at
st.
mungo's
Hospital
for
Magical
Maladies
and
Injuries
that
Potters
brain
was
affected
by
the
attack
inflicted
upon
him
by
You
KnowWho
and
that
his
insistence
that
the
scar
is
still
hurting
is
an
expression
of
his
deepseated
confusion
he
might
even
be
pretending
said
one
specialist
this
could
be
a
plea
for
attention
the
Daily
Prophet
however
has
unearthed
worrying
facts
about
Harry
Potter
that
Albus
Dumbledore
Headmaster
of
Hogwarts
has
carefully
concealed
from
the
wizarding
public
potter
can
speak
Parseltongue
reveals
Draco
Malfoy
a
Hogwarts
fourth
year
there
were
a
lot
of
attacks
on
students
a
couple
of
years
ago
and
most
people
thought
Potter
was
behind
them
after
they
saw
him
lose
his
temper
at
a
dueling
club
and
set
a
snake
on
another
boy
it
was
all
hushed
up
though
but
he's
made
friends
with
werewolves
and
giants
too
we
think
he'd
do
anything
for
a
bit
of
power
parseltongue
the
ability
to
converse
with
snakes
has
long
been
considered
a
Dark
Art
indeed
the
most
famous
Parselmouth
of
our
times
is
none
other
than
You
KnowWho
himself
a
member
of
the
Dark
Force
Defense
League
who
wished
to
remain
unnamed
stated
that
he
would
regard
any
wizard
who
could
speak
Parseltongue
as
worthy
of
investigation
personally
I
would
be
highly
suspicious
of
anybody
who
could
converse
with
snakes
as
serpents
are
often
used
in
the
worst
kinds
of
Dark
Magic
and
are
historically
associated
with
evildoers
similarly
anyone
who
seeks
out
the
company
of
such
vicious
creatures
as
werewolves
and
giants
would
appear
to
have
a
fondness
for
violence
albus
Dumbledore
should
surely
consider
whether
a
boy
such
as
this
should
be
allowed
to
compete
in
the
Triwizard
Tournament
some
fear
that
Potter
might
resort
to
the
Dark
Arts
in
his
desperation
to
win
the
tournament
the
third
task
of
which
takes
place
this
evening
gone
off
me
a
bit
hasn't
she
said
Harry
lightly
folding
up
the
paper
over
at
the
Slytherin
table
Malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
were
laughing
at
him
tapping
their
heads
with
their
fingers
pulling
grotesquely
mad
faces
and
waggling
their
tongues
like
snakes
how
did
she
know
your
scar
hurt
in
Divination
ron
said
there's
no
way
she
was
there
there's
no
way
she
could've
heard
the
window
was
open
said
Harry
i
opened
it
to
breathe
you
were
at
the
top
of
North
Tower
hermione
said
your
voice
couldn't
have
carried
all
the
way
down
to
the
grounds
well
you're
the
one
who's
supposed
to
be
researching
magical
methods
of
bugging
said
Harry
you
tell
me
how
she
did
it
i've
been
trying
said
Hermione
but
I
but
an
odd
dreamy
expression
suddenly
came
over
hermione's
face
she
slowly
raised
a
hand
and
ran
her
fingers
through
her
hair
are
you
all
right
said
Ron
frowning
at
her
yes
said
Hermione
breathlessly
she
ran
her
fingers
through
her
hair
again
and
then
held
her
hand
up
to
her
mouth
as
though
speaking
into
an
invisible
walkie
talkie
harry
and
Ron
stared
at
each
other
i've
had
an
idea
Hermione
said
gazing
into
space
i
think
I
know
because
then
no
one
would
be
able
to
see
even
Moody
and
she'd
have
been
able
to
get
onto
the
window
ledge
but
she's
not
allowed
she's
definitely
not
allowed
i
think
we've
got
her
just
give
me
two
seconds
in
the
library
just
to
make
sure
with
that
Hermione
seized
her
school
bag
and
dashed
out
of
the
Great
Hall
oi
ron
called
after
her
we've
got
our
History
of
Magic
exam
in
ten
minutes
blimey
he
said
turning
back
to
Harry
she
must
really
hate
that
Skeeter
woman
to
risk
missing
the
start
of
an
exam
what're
you
going
to
do
in
binns's
class
read
again
exempt
from
the
endofterm
tests
as
a
Triwizard
champion
Harry
had
been
sitting
in
the
back
of
every
exam
class
so
far
looking
up
fresh
hexes
for
the
third
task
s'pose
so
Harry
said
to
Ron
but
just
then
professor
McGonagall
came
walking
alongside
the
Gryffindor
table
toward
him
potter
the
champions
are
congregating
in
the
chamber
off
the
Hall
after
breakfast
she
said
but
the
task's
not
till
tonight
said
Harry
accidentally
spilling
scrambled
eggs
down
his
front
afraid
he
had
mistaken
the
time
i'm
aware
of
that
Potter
she
said
the
champions
families
are
invited
to
watch
the
final
task
you
know
this
is
simply
a
chance
for
you
to
greet
them
she
moved
away
harry
gaped
after
her
she
doesn't
expect
the
Dursleys
to
turn
up
does
she
he
asked
Ron
blankly
dunno
said
Ron
harry
i'd
better
hurry
i'm
going
to
be
late
for
Binns

later
harry
finished
his
breakfast
in
the
emptying
Great
Hall
he
saw
Fleur
Delacour
get
up
from
the
Ravenclaw
table
and
join
Cedric
as
he
crossed
to
the
side
chamber
and
entered
krum
slouched
off
to
join
them
shortly
afterward
harry
stayed
where
he
was
he
really
didn't
want
to
go
into
the
chamber
he
had
no
family
no
family
who
would
turn
up
to
see
him
risk
his
life
anyway
but
just
as
he
was
getting
up
thinking
that
he
might
as
well
go
up
to
the
library
and
do
a
spot
more
hex
research
the
door
of
the
side
chamber
opened
and
Cedric
stuck
his
head
out
harry
come
on
they're
waiting
for
you
utterly
perplexed
harry
got
up
the
Dursleys
couldn't
possibly
be
here
could
they
he
walked
across
the
Hall
and
opened
the
door
into
the
chamber
cedric
and
his
parents
were
just
inside
the
door
viktor
Krum
was
over
in
a
corner
conversing
with
his
darkhaired
mother
and
father
in
rapid
Bulgarian
he
had
inherited
his
fathers
hooked
nose
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
Fleur
was
jabbering
away
in
French
to
her
mother
fleur's
little
sister
Gabrielle
was
holding
her
mother's
hand
she
waved
at
Harry
who
waved
back
grinning
then
he
saw
Mrs
weasley
and
Bill
standing
in
front
of
the
fireplace
beaming
at
him
surprise
mrs
weasley
said
excitedly
as
he
smiled
broadly
and
walked
over
to
them
thought
we'd
come
and
watch
you
harry
she
bent
down
and
kissed
him
on
the
cheek
you
all
right
said
Bill
grinning
at
Harry
and
shaking
his
hand
charlie
wanted
to
come
but
he
couldn't
get
time
off
he
said
you
were
incredible
against
the
Horntail
fleur
Delacour
Harry
noticed
was
eyeing
Bill
with
great
interest
over
her
mother's
shoulder
harry
could
tell
she
had
no
objection
whatsoever
to
long
hair
or
earrings
with
fangs
on
them
this
is
really
nice
of
you
Harry
muttered
to
Mrs
weasley
i
thought
for
a
moment
the
Dursleys
hmm
said
Mrs
weasley
pursing
her
lips
she
had
always
refrained
from
criticizing
the
Dursleys
in
front
of
Harry
but
her
eyes
flashed
every
time
they
were
mentioned
it's
great
being
back
here
said
Bill
looking
around
the
chamber
Violet
the
Fat
lady's
friend
winked
at
him
from
her
frame
haven't
seen
this
place
for
five
years
is
that
picture
of
the
mad
knight
still
around
sir
Cadogan
oh
yeah
said
Harry
who
had
met
Sir
Cadogan
the
previous
year
and
the
Fat
Lady
said
Bill
she
was
here
in
my
time
said
Mrs
weasley
she
gave
me
such
a
telling
off
one
night
when
I
got
back
to
the
dormitory
at
four
in
the
morning
what
were
you
doing
out
of
your
dormitory
at
four
in
the
morning
said
Bill
surveying
his
mother
with
amazement
mrs
weasley
grinned
her
eyes
twinkling
your
father
and
I
had
been
for
a
nighttime
stroll
she
said
he
got
caught
by
apollyon
Pringle
he
was
the
caretaker
in
those
days
your
father's
still
got
the
marks
fancy
giving
us
a
tour
Harry
said
Bill
yeah
okay
said
Harry
and
they
made
their
way
back
toward
the
door
into
the
Great
Hall
as
they
passed
Amos
Diggory
he
looked
around
there
you
are
are
you
he
said
looking
Harry
up
and
down
bet
you're
not
feeling
quite
as
full
of
yourself
now
Cedrics
caught
you
up
on
points
are
you
what
said
Harry
ignore
him
said
Cedric
in
a
low
voice
to
Harry
frowning
after
his
father
he's
been
angry
ever
since
Rita
Skeeters
article
about
the
Triwizard
Tournament
you
know
when
she
made
out
you
were
the
only
Hogwarts
champion
didn't
bother
to
correct
her
though
did
he
said
Amos
Diggory
loudly
enough
for
Harry
to
hear
as
he
started
to
walk
out
of
the
door
with
Mrs
weasley
and
Bill
still
you'll
show
him
Ced
beaten
him
once
before
haven't
you
rita
Skeeter
goes
out
of
her
way
to
cause
trouble
Amos
mrs
weasley
said
angrily
i
would
have
thought
you'd
know
that
working
at
the
Ministry
mr.
Diggory
looked
as
though
he
was
going
to
say
something
angry
but
his
wife
laid
a
hand
on
his
arm
and
he
merely
shrugged
and
turned
away
harry
had
a
very
enjoyable
morning
walking
over
the
sunny
grounds
with
Bill
and
Mrs
weasley
showing
them
the
Beauxbatons
carriage
and
the
Durmstrang
ship
mrs
weasley
was
intrigued
by
the
Whomping
Willow
which
had
been
planted
after
she
had
left
school
and
reminisced
at
length
about
the
gamekeeper
before
Hagrid
a
man
called
Ogg
how's
Percy
harry
asked
as
they
walked
around
the
greenhouses
not
good
said
Bill
he's
very
upset
said
Mrs
weasley
lowering
her
voice
and
glancing
around
the
Ministry
wants
to
keep
mr.
crouch's
disappearance
quiet
but
percy's
been
hauled
in
for
questioning
about
the
instructions
mr.
Crouch
has
been
sending
in
they
seem
to
think
there's
a
chance
they
weren't
genuinely
written
by
him
percy's
been
under
a
lot
of
strain
they're
not
letting
him
fill
in
for
mr.
Crouch
as
the
fifth
judge
tonight
cornelius
Fudge
is
going
to
be
doing
it
they
returned
to
the
castle
for
lunch
mum
Bill
said
Ron
looking
stunned
as
he
joined
the
Gryffindor
table
what're
you
doing
here
come
to
watch
Harry
in
the
last
task
said
Mrs
weasley
brightly
i
must
say
it
makes
a
lovely
change
not
having
to
cook
how
was
your
exam
oh
okay
said
Ron
couldn't
remember
all
the
goblin
rebels
names
so
I
invented
a
few
it's
all
right
he
said
helping
himself
to
a
Cornish
pasty
while
Mrs
weasley
looked
stern
they're
all
called
stuff
like
Bodrod
the
Bearded
and
Urg
the
Unclean
it
wasn't
hard
fred
George
and
Ginny
came
to
sit
next
to
them
too
and
Harry
was
having
such
a
good
time
he
felt
almost
as
though
he
were
back
at
the
Burrow
he
had
forgotten
to
worry
about
that
evening's
task
and
not
until
Hermione
turned
up
halfway
through
lunch
did
he
remember
that
she
had
had
a
brainwave
about
Rita
Skeeter
are
you
going
to
tell
us
hermione
shook
her
head
warningly
and
glanced
at
Mrs
weasley
hello
Hermione
said
Mrs
weasley
much
more
stiffly
than
usual
hello
said
Hermione
her
smile
faltering
at
the
cold
expression
on
Mrs
weasley's
face
harry
looked
between
them
then
said
Mrs
weasley
you
didn't
believe
that
rubbish
Rita
Skeeter
wrote
in
Witch
Weekly
did
you
because
hermione's
not
my
girlfriend
oh
said
Mrs
weasley
No
of
course
I
didn't
but
she
became
considerably
warmer
toward
Hermione
after
that
harry
Bill
and
Mrs
weasley
whiled
away
the
afternoon
with
a
long
walk
around
the
castle
and
then
returned
to
the
Great
Hall
for
the
evening
feast
ludo
Bagman
and
Cornelius
Fudge
had
joined
the
staff
table
now
bagman
looked
quite
cheerful
but
Cornelius
Fudge
who
was
sitting
next
to
Madame
Maxime
looked
stern
and
was
not
talking
madame
Maxime
was
concentrating
on
her
plate
and
Harry
thought
her
eyes
looked
red
hagrid
kept
glancing
along
the
table
at
her
There
were
more
courses
than
usual
but
Harry
who
was
starting
to
feel
really
nervous
now
didn't
eat
much
as
the
enchanted
ceiling
overhead
began
to
fade
from
blue
to
a
dusky
purple
Dumbledore
rose
to
his
feet
at
the
staff
table
and
silence
fell
ladies
and
gentlemen
in
five
minutes
time
I
will
be
asking
you
to
make
your
way
down
to
the
Quidditch
field
for
the
third
and
final
task
of
the
Triwizard
Tournament
will
the
champions
please
follow
mr.
Bagman
down
to
the
stadium
now
harry
got
up
the
Gryffindors
all
along
the
table
were
applauding
him
the
Weasleys
and
Hermione
all
wished
him
good
luck
and
he
headed
off
out
of
the
Great
Hall
with
Cedric
Fleur
and
Viktor
feeling
all
right
harry
bagman
asked
as
they
went
down
the
stone
steps
onto
the
grounds
confident
i'm
okay
said
Harry
it
was
sort
of
true
he
was
nervous
but
he
kept
running
over
all
the
hexes
and
spells
he
had
been
practicing
in
his
mind
as
they
walked
and
the
knowledge
that
he
could
remember
them
all
made
him
feel
better
they
walked
onto
the
Quidditch
field
which
was
now
completely
unrecognizable
a
twentyfoothigh
hedge
ran
all
the
way
around
the
edge
of
it
there
was
a
gap
right
in
front
of
them
the
entrance
to
the
vast
maze
the
passage
beyond
it
looked
dark
and
creepy
five
minutes
later
the
stands
had
begun
to
fill
the
air
was
full
of
excited
voices
and
the
rumbling
of
feet
as
the
hundreds
of
students
filed
into
their
seats
the
sky
was
a
deep
clear
blue
now
and
the
first
stars
were
starting
to
appear
hagrid
Professor
Moody
Professor
McGonagall
and
Professor
Flitwick
came
walking
into
the
stadium
and
approached
Bagman
and
the
champions
they
were
wearing
large
red
luminous
stars
on
their
hats
all
except
Hagrid
who
had
his
on
the
back
of
his
moleskin
vest
we
are
going
to
be
patrolling
the
outside
of
the
maze
said
Professor
McGonagall
to
the
champions
if
you
get
into
difficulty
and
wish
to
be
rescued
send
red
sparks
into
the
air
and
one
of
us
will
come
and
get
you
do
you
understand
the
champions
nodded
off
you
go
then
said
Bagman
brightly
to
the
four
patrollers
good
luck
harry
Hagrid
whispered
and
the
four
of
them
walked
away
in
different
directions
to
station
themselves
around
the
maze
bagman
now
pointed
his
wand
at
his
throat
muttered
Sonorus
and
his
magically
magnified
voice
echoed
into
the
stands
ladies
and
gentlemen
the
third
and
final
task
of
the
Triwizard
Tournament
is
about
to
begin
let
me
remind
you
how
the
points
currently
stand
tied
in
first
place
with
eightyfive
points
each
mr.
Cedric
Diggory
and
mr.
Harry
Potter
both
of
Hogwarts
School
the
cheers
and
applause
sent
birds
from
the
Forbidden
Forest
fluttering
into
the
darkening
sky
in
second
place
with
eighty
points
Mr
viktor
Krum
of
Durmstrang
Institute
more
applause
and
in
third
place
Miss
Fleur
Delacour
of
Beauxbatons
Academy
harry
could
just
make
out
Mrs
weasley
Bill
Ron
and
Hermione
applauding
Fleur
politely
halfway
up
the
stands
he
waved
up
at
them
and
they
waved
back
beaming
at
him
so
on
my
whistle
Harry
and
Cedric
said
Bagman
three
two
one
he
gave
a
short
blast
on
his
whistle
and
Harry
and
Cedric
hurried
forward
into
the
maze
the
towering
hedges
cast
black
shadows
across
the
path
and
whether
because
they
were
so
tall
and
thick
or
because
they
had
been
enchanted
the
sound
of
the
surrounding
crowd
was
silenced
the
moment
they
entered
the
maze
harry
felt
almost
as
though
he
were
underwater
again
he
pulled
out
his
wand
muttered
Lumos
and
heard
Cedric
do
the
same
just
behind
him
after
about
fifty
yards
they
reached
a
fork
they
looked
at
each
other
see
you
Harry
said
and
he
took
the
left
one
while
Cedric
took
the
right
harry
heard
bagman's
whistle
for
the
second
time
krum
had
entered
the
maze
harry
sped
up
his
chosen
path
seemed
completely
deserted
he
turned
right
and
hurried
on
holding
his
wand
high
over
his
head
trying
to
see
as
far
ahead
as
possible
still
there
was
nothing
in
sight
bagman's
whistle
blew
in
the
distance
for
the
third
time
all
of
the
champions
were
now
inside
harry
kept
looking
behind
him
the
old
feeling
that
he
was
being
watched
was
upon
him
the
maze
was
growing
darker
with
every
passing
minute
as
the
sky
overhead
deepened
to
navy
he
reached
a
second
fork
point
Me
he
whispered
to
his
wand
holding
it
flat
in
his
palm
the
wand
spun
around
once
and
pointed
toward
his
right
into
solid
hedge
that
way
was
north
and
he
knew
that
he
needed
to
go
northwest
for
the
center
of
the
maze
the
best
he
could
do
was
to
take
the
left
fork
and
go
right
again
as
soon
as
possible
the
path
ahead
was
empty
too
and
when
Harry
reached
a
right
turn
and
took
it
he
again
found
his
way
unblocked
harry
didn't
know
why
but
the
lack
of
obstacles
was
unnerving
him
surely
he
should
have
met
something
by
now
it
felt
as
though
the
maze
were
luring
him
into
a
false
sense
of
security
then
he
heard
movement
right
behind
him
he
held
out
his
wand
ready
to
attack
but
its
beam
fell
only
upon
Cedric
who
had
just
hurried
out
of
a
path
on
the
righthand
side
cedric
looked
severely
shaken
the
sleeve
of
his
robe
was
smoking
hagrid's
BlastEnded
Skrewts
he
hissed
they're
enormous
I
only
just
got
away
he
shook
his
head
and
dived
out
of
sight
along
another
path
keen
to
put
plenty
of
distance
between
himself
and
the
skrewts
Harry
hurried
off
again
then
as
he
turned
a
corner
he
saw
a
dementor
gliding
toward
him
twelve
feet
tall
its
face
hidden
by
its
hood
its
rotting
scabbed
hands
outstretched
it
advanced
sensing
its
way
blindly
toward
him
harry
could
hear
its
rattling
breath
he
felt
clammy
coldness
stealing
over
him
but
knew
what
he
had
to
do
he
summoned
the
happiest
thought
he
could
concentrated
with
all
his
might
on
the
thought
of
getting
out
of
the
maze
and
celebrating
with
Ron
and
Hermione
raised
his
wand
and
cried
Expecto
Patronum
a
silver
stag
erupted
from
the
end
of
harry's
wand
and
galloped
toward
the
dementor
which
fell
back
and
tripped
over
the
hem
of
its
robes
harry
had
never
seen
a
dementor
stumble
hang
on
he
shouted
advancing
in
the
wake
of
his
silver
Patronus
you're
a
boggart
riddikulus
there
was
a
loud
crack
and
the
shapeshifter
exploded
in
a
wisp
of
smoke
the
silver
stag
faded
from
sight
harry
wished
it
could
have
stayed
he
could
have
used
some
company
but
he
moved
on
quickly
and
quietly
as
possible
listening
hard
his
wand
held
high
once
more
left
right
left
again
twice
he
found
himself
facing
dead
ends
he
did
the
FourPoint
Spell
again
and
found
that
he
was
going
too
far
east
he
turned
back
took
a
right
turn
and
saw
an
odd
golden
mist
floating
ahead
of
him
harry
approached
it
cautiously
pointing
the
wand's
beam
at
it
this
looked
like
some
kind
of
enchantment
he
wondered
whether
he
might
be
able
to
blast
it
out
of
the
way
reducio
he
said
the
spell
shot
straight
through
the
mist
leaving
it
intact
he
supposed
he
should
have
known
better
the
Reductor
Curse
was
for
solid
objects
what
would
happen
if
he
walked
through
the
mist
was
it
worth
chancing
it
or
should
he
double
back
he
was
still
hesitating
when
a
scream
shattered
the
silence
fleur
harry
yelled
there
was
silence
he
stared
all
around
him
what
had
happened
to
her
her
scream
seemed
to
have
come
from
somewhere
ahead
he
took
a
deep
breath
and
ran
through
the
enchanted
mist
the
world
turned
upside
down
harry
was
hanging
from
the
ground
with
his
hair
on
end
his
glasses
dangling
off
his
nose
threatening
to
fall
into
the
bottomless
sky
he
clutched
them
to
the
end
of
his
nose
and
hung
there
terrified
it
felt
as
though
his
feet
were
glued
to
the
grass
which
had
now
become
the
ceiling
below
him
the
dark
starspangled
heavens
stretched
endlessly
he
felt
as
though
if
he
tried
to
move
one
of
his
feet
he
would
fall
away
from
the
earth
completely
think
he
told
himself
as
all
the
blood
rushed
to
his
head
think
but
not
one
of
the
spells
he
had
practiced
had
been
designed
to
combat
a
sudden
reversal
of
ground
and
sky
did
he
dare
move
his
foot
he
could
hear
the
blood
pounding
in
his
ears
he
had
two
choices
try
and
move
or
send
up
red
sparks
and
get
rescued
and
disqualified
from
the
task
he
shut
his
eyes
so
he
wouldn't
be
able
to
see
the
view
of
endless
space
below
him
and
pulled
his
right
foot
as
hard
as
he
could
away
from
the
grassy
ceiling
immediately
the
world
righted
itself
harry
fell
forward
onto
his
knees
onto
the
wonderfully
solid
ground
he
felt
temporarily
limp
with
shock
he
took
a
deep
steadying
breath
then
got
up
again
and
hurried
forward
looking
back
over
his
shoulder
as
he
ran
away
from
the
golden
mist
which
twinkled
innocently
at
him
in
the
moonlight
he
paused
at
a
junction
of
two
paths
and
looked
around
for
some
sign
of
Fleur
he
was
sure
it
had
been
she
who
had
screamed
what
had
she
met
was
she
all
right
there
was
no
sign
of
red
sparks
did
that
mean
she
had
got
herself
out
of
trouble
or
was
she
in
such
trouble
that
she
couldn't
reach
her
wand
harry
took
the
right
fork
with
a
feeling
of
increasing
unease
but
at
the
same
time
he
couldn't
help
thinking
one
champion
down
the
cup
was
somewhere
close
by
and
it
sounded
as
though
Fleur
was
no
longer
in
the
running
he'd
got
this
far
hadn't
he
what
if
he
actually
managed
to
win
fleetingly
and
for
the
first
time
since
he'd
found
himself
champion
he
saw
again
that
image
of
himself
raising
the
Triwizard
Cup
in
front
of
the
rest
of
the
school
he
met
nothing
for
ten
minutes
but
kept
running
into
dead
ends
twice
he
took
the
same
wrong
turning
finally
he
found
a
new
route
and
started
to
jog
along
it
his
wandlight
waving
making
his
shadow
flicker
and
distort
on
the
hedge
walls
then
he
rounded
another
corner
and
found
himself
facing
a
BlastEnded
Skrewt
cedric
was
right
it
was
enormous
ten
feet
long
it
looked
more
like
a
giant
scorpion
than
anything
its
long
sting
was
curled
over
its
back
its
thick
armor
glinted
in
the
light
from
harry's
wand
which
he
pointed
at
it
stupefy
the
spell
hit
the
skrewt's
armor
and
rebounded
Harry
ducked
just
in
time
but
could
smell
burning
hair
it
had
singed
the
top
of
his
head
the
skrewt
issued
a
blast
of
fire
from
its
end
and
flew
forward
toward
him
impedimenta
harry
yelled
the
spell
hit
the
skrewt's
armor
again
and
ricocheted
off
Harry
staggered
back
a
few
paces
and
fell
over
impedimenta
the
skrewt
was
inches
from
him
when
it
froze
he
had
managed
to
hit
it
on
its
fleshy
shellless
underside
panting
Harry
pushed
himself
away
from
it
and
ran
hard
in
the
opposite
direction
the
Impediment
Curse
was
not
permanent
the
skrewt
would
be
regaining
the
use
of
its
legs
at
any
moment
he
took
a
left
path
and
hit
a
dead
end
a
right
and
hit
another
forcing
himself
to
stop
heart
hammering
he
performed
the
FourPoint
Spell
again
backtracked
and
chose
a
path
that
would
take
him
northwest
he
had
been
hurrying
along
the
new
path
for
a
few
minutes
when
he
heard
something
in
the
path
running
parallel
to
his
own
that
made
him
stop
dead
what
are
you
doing
yelled
cedric's
voice
what
the
hell
d'you
think
you're
doing
and
then
Harry
heard
krum's
voice
crucio
the
air
was
suddenly
full
of
cedric's
yells
horrified
Harry
began
sprinting
up
his
path
trying
to
find
a
way
into
cedric's
when
none
appeared
he
tried
the
Reductor
Curse
again
it
wasn't
very
effective
but
it
burned
a
small
hole
in
the
hedge
through
which
Harry
forced
his
leg
kicking
at
the
thick
brambles
and
branches
until
they
broke
and
made
an
opening
he
struggled
through
it
tearing
his
robes
and
looking
to
his
right
saw
Cedric
jerking
and
twitching
on
the
ground
Krum
standing
over
him
harry
pulled
himself
up
and
pointed
his
wand
at
Krum
just
as
Krum
looked
up
krum
turned
and
began
to
run
stupefy
harry
yelled
the
spell
hit
Krum
in
the
back
he
stopped
dead
in
his
tracks
fell
forward
and
lay
motionless
facedown
in
the
grass
harrydashed
over
to
Cedric
who
had
stopped
twitching
and
was
lying
there
panting
his
hands
over
his
face
are
you
all
right
harry
said
roughly
grabbing
cedric's
arm
yeah
panted
Cedric
yeah
i
don't
believe
it
he
crept
up
behind
me
i
heard
him
I
turned
around
and
he
had
his
wand
on
me
cedric
got
up
he
was
still
shaking
he
and
Harry
looked
down
at
Krum
i
can't
believe
this
i
thought
he
was
all
right
Harry
said
staring
at
Krum
so
did
I
said
Cedric
did
you
hear
Fleur
scream
earlier
said
Harry
yeah
said
Cedric
you
don't
think
Krum
got
her
too
i
don't
know
said
Harry
slowly
should
we
leave
him
here
cedric
muttered
no
said
Harry
i
reckon
we
should
send
up
red
sparks
someone'll
come
and
collect
him
otherwise
he'll
probably
be
eaten
by
a
skrewt
he'd
deserve
it
Cedric
muttered
but
all
the
same
he
raised
his
wand
and
shot
a
shower
of
red
sparks
into
the
air
which
hovered
high
above
Krum
marking
the
spot
where
he
lay
harry
and
Cedric
stood
there
in
the
darkness
for
a
moment
looking
around
them
then
Cedric
said
Well
i
s'pose
we'd
better
go
on
what
said
Harry
oh
yeah
right
it
was
an
odd
moment
he
and
Cedric
had
been
briefly
united
against
Krum
now
the
fact
that
they
were
opponents
came
back
to
Harry
the
two
of
them
proceeded
up
the
dark
path
without
speaking
then
Harry
turned
left
and
Cedric
right
cedric's
footsteps
soon
died
away
harry
moved
on
continuing
to
use
the
FourPoint
Spell
making
sure
he
was
moving
in
the
right
direction
it
was
between
him
and
Cedric
now
his
desire
to
reach
the
cup
first
was
now
burning
stronger
than
ever
but
he
could
hardly
believe
what
he'd
just
seen
Krum
do
the
use
of
an
Unforgivable
Curse
on
a
fellow
human
being
meant
a
life
term
in
Azkaban
that
was
what
Moody
had
told
them
krum
surely
couldn't
have
wanted
the
Triwizard
Cup
that
badly
harry
sped
up
every
so
often
he
hit
more
dead
ends
but
the
increasing
darkness
made
him
feel
sure
he
was
getting
near
the
heart
of
the
maze
then
as
he
strode
down
a
long
straight
path
he
saw
movement
once
again
and
his
beam
of
wandlight
hit
an
extraordinary
creature
one
which
he
had
only
seen
in
picture
form
in
his
Monster
Book
of
Monsters
it
was
a
sphinx
it
had
the
body
of
an
overlarge
lion
great
clawed
paws
and
a
long
yellowish
tail
ending
in
a
brown
tuft
its
head
however
was
that
of
a
woman
she
turned
her
long
almondshaped
eyes
upon
Harry
as
he
approached
he
raised
his
wand
hesitating
she
was
not
crouching
as
if
to
spring
but
pacing
from
side
to
side
of
the
path
blocking
his
progress
then
she
spoke
in
a
deep
hoarse
voice
you
are
very
near
your
goal
the
quickest
way
is
past
me
so
so
will
you
move
please
said
Harry
knowing
what
the
answer
was
going
to
be
no
she
said
continuing
to
pace
not
unless
you
can
answer
my
riddle
answer
on
your
first
guess
I
let
you
pass
answer
wrongly
I
attack
remain
silent
I
will
let
you
walk
away
from
me
unscathed
harry's
stomach
slipped
several
notches
it
was
Hermione
who
was
good
at
this
sort
of
thing
not
him
he
weighed
his
chances
if
the
riddle
was
too
hard
he
could
keep
silent
get
away
from
the
sphinx
unharmed
and
try
and
find
an
alternative
route
to
the
center
okay
he
said
can
I
hear
the
riddle
the
sphinx
sat
down
upon
her
hind
legs
in
the
very
middle
of
the
path
and
recited
First
think
of
the
person
who
lives
in
disguise
Who
deals
in
secrets
and
tells
naught
but
lies
next
tell
me
what's
always
the
last
thing
to
mend
The
middle
of
middle
and
end
of
the
end
and
finally
give
me
the
sound
often
heard
During
the
search
for
a
hardtofind
word
now
string
them
together
and
answer
me
this
Which
creature
would
you
be
unwilling
to
kiss
harry
gaped
at
her
could
I
have
it
again
more
slowly
he
asked
tentatively
she
blinked
at
him
smiled
and
repeated
the
poem
all
the
clues
add
up
to
a
creature
I
wouldn't
want
to
kiss
harry
asked
she
merely
smiled
her
mysterious
smile
harry
took
that
for
a
yes
harry
cast
his
mind
around
there
were
plenty
of
animals
he
wouldn't
want
to
kiss
his
immediate
thought
was
a
BlastEnded
Skrewt
but
something
told
him
that
wasn't
the
answer
he'd
have
to
try
and
work
out
the
clues
a
person
in
disguise
Harry
muttered
staring
at
her
who
lies
er
that'd
be
a
an
impostor
no
that's
not
my
guess
a
a
spy
i'll
come
back
to
that
could
you
give
me
the
next
clue
again
please
she
repeated
the
next
lines
of
the
poem
the
last
thing
to
mend
Harry
repeated
er
no
idea
middle
of
middle
could
I
have
the
last
bit
again
she
gave
him
the
last
four
lines
the
sound
often
heard
during
the
search
for
a
hardtofind
word
said
Harry
er
that'd
be
er
hang
on
er
er's
a
sound
the
sphinx
smiled
at
him
spy
er
spy
er
said
Harry
pacing
up
and
down
a
creature
I
wouldn't
want
to
kiss
a
spider
the
sphinx
smiled
more
broadly
she
got
up
stretched
her
front
legs
and
then
moved
aside
for
him
to
pass
thanks
said
Harry
and
amazed
at
his
own
brilliance
he
dashed
forward
he
had
to
be
close
now
he
had
to
be
his
wand
was
telling
him
he
was
bang
on
course
as
long
as
he
didn't
meet
anything
too
horrible
he
might
have
a
chance
harry
broke
into
a
run
he
had
a
choice
of
paths
up
ahead
point
Me
he
whispered
again
to
his
wand
and
it
spun
around
and
pointed
him
to
the
righthand
one
he
dashed
up
this
one
and
saw
light
ahead
the
Triwizard
Cup
was
gleaming
on
a
plinth
a
hundred
yards
away
suddenly
a
dark
figure
hurtled
out
onto
the
path
in
front
of
him
cedric
was
going
to
get
there
first
cedric
was
sprinting
as
fast
as
he
could
toward
the
cup
and
Harry
knew
he
would
never
catch
up
Cedric
was
much
taller
had
much
longer
legs
Then
Harry
saw
something
immense
over
a
hedge
to
his
left
moving
quickly
along
a
path
that
intersected
with
his
own
it
was
moving
so
fast
Cedric
was
about
to
run
into
it
and
Cedric
his
eyes
on
the
cup
had
not
seen
it
Cedric
harry
bellowed
on
your
left
cedric
looked
around
just
in
time
to
hurl
himself
past
the
thing
and
avoid
colliding
with
it
but
in
his
haste
he
tripped
harry
saw
cedric's
wand
fly
out
of
his
hand
as
a
gigantic
spider
stepped
into
the
path
and
began
to
bear
down
upon
Cedric
stupefy
harry
yelled
the
spell
hit
the
spider's
gigantic
hairy
black
body
but
for
all
the
good
it
did
he
might
as
well
have
thrown
a
stone
at
it
the
spider
jerked
scuttled
around
and
ran
at
Harry
instead
stupefy
impedimenta
stupefy
but
it
was
no
use
the
spider
was
either
so
large
or
so
magical
that
the
spells
were
doing
no
more
than
aggravating
it
harry
had
one
horrifying
glimpse
of
eight
shining
black
eyes
and
razorsharp
pincers
before
it
was
upon
him
he
was
lifted
into
the
air
in
its
front
legs
struggling
madly
he
tried
to
kick
it
his
leg
connected
with
the
pincers
and
next
moment
he
was
in
excruciating
pain
he
could
hear
Cedric
yelling
Stupefy
too
but
his
spell
had
no
more
effect
than
harry's
Harry
raised
his
wand
as
the
spider
opened
its
pincers
once
more
and
shouted
Expelliarmus
it
worked
the
Disarming
Spell
made
the
spider
drop
him
but
that
meant
that
Harry
fell
twelve
feet
onto
his
already
injured
leg
which
crumpled
beneath
him
without
pausing
to
think
he
aimed
high
at
the
spider's
underbelly
as
he
had
done
with
the
skrewt
and
shouted
Stupefy
just
as
Cedric
yelled
the
same
thing
the
two
spells
combined
did
what
one
alone
had
not
The
spider
keeled
over
sideways
flattening
a
nearby
hedge
and
strewing
the
path
with
a
tangle
of
hairy
legs
harry
he
heard
Cedric
shouting
you
all
right
did
it
fall
on
you
no
Harry
called
back
panting
he
looked
down
at
his
leg
it
was
bleeding
freely
he
could
see
some
sort
of
thick
gluey
secretion
from
the
spider's
pincers
on
his
torn
robes
he
tried
to
get
up
but
his
leg
was
shaking
badly
and
did
not
want
to
support
his
weight
he
leaned
against
the
hedge
gasping
for
breath
and
looked
around
cedric
was
standing
feet
from
the
Triwizard
Cup
which
was
gleaming
behind
him
take
it
then
Harry
panted
to
Cedric
go
on
take
it
you're
there
but
Cedric
didn't
move
he
merely
stood
there
looking
at
Harry
then
he
turned
to
stare
at
the
cup
harry
saw
the
longing
expression
on
his
face
in
its
golden
light
cedric
looked
around
at
Harry
again
who
was
now
holding
onto
the
hedge
to
support
himself
cedric
took
a
deep
breath
you
take
it
you
should
win
that's
twice
you've
saved
my
neck
in
here
that's
not
how
it's
supposed
to
work
Harry
said
he
felt
angry
his
leg
was
very
painful
he
was
aching
all
over
from
trying
to
throw
off
the
spider
and
after
all
his
efforts
Cedric
had
beaten
him
to
it
just
as
he'd
beaten
Harry
to
ask
Cho
to
the
ball
the
one
who
reaches
the
cup
first
gets
the
points
that's
you
i'm
telling
you
i'm
not
going
to
win
any
races
on
this
leg
cedric
took
a
few
paces
nearer
to
the
Stunned
spider
away
from
the
cup
shaking
his
head
no
he
said
stop
being
noble
said
Harry
irritably
just
take
it
then
we
can
get
out
of
here
cedric
watched
Harry
steadying
himself
holding
tight
to
the
hedge
you
told
me
about
the
dragons
Cedric
said
i
would've
gone
down
in
the
first
task
if
you
hadn't
told
me
what
was
coming
i
had
help
on
that
too
Harry
snapped
trying
to
mop
up
his
bloody
leg
with
his
robes
you
helped
me
with
the
egg
we're
square
i
had
help
on
the
egg
in
the
first
place
said
Cedric
we're
still
square
said
Harry
testing
his
leg
gingerly
it
shook
violently
as
he
put
weight
on
it
he
had
sprained
his
ankle
when
the
spider
had
dropped
him
you
should've
got
more
points
on
the
second
task
said
Cedric
mulishly
you
stayed
behind
to
get
all
the
hostages
i
should've
done
that
i
was
the
only
one
who
was
thick
enough
to
take
that
song
seriously
said
Harry
bitterly
just
take
the
cup
no
said
Cedric
he
stepped
over
the
spider's
tangled
legs
to
join
Harry
who
stared
at
him
cedric
was
serious
he
was
walking
away
from
the
sort
of
glory
Hufflepuff
House
hadn't
had
in
centuries
go
on
Cedric
said
he
looked
as
though
this
was
costing
him
every
ounce
of
resolution
he
had
but
his
face
was
set
his
arms
were
folded
he
seemed
decided
harry
looked
from
Cedric
to
the
cup
for
one
shining
moment
he
saw
himself
emerging
from
the
maze
holding
it
he
saw
himself
holding
the
Triwizard
Cup
aloft
heard
the
roar
of
the
crowd
saw
cho's
face
shining
with
admiration
more
clearly
than
he
had
ever
seen
it
before
and
then
the
picture
faded
and
he
found
himself
staring
at
cedric's
shadowy
stubborn
face
both
of
us
Harry
said
what
we'll
take
it
at
the
same
time
it's
still
a
Hogwarts
victory
we'll
tie
for
it
cedric
stared
at
Harry
he
unfolded
his
arms
you
you
sure
yeah
said
Harry
yeah
we've
helped
each
other
out
haven't
we
we
both
got
here
let's
just
take
it
together
for
a
moment
Cedric
looked
as
though
he
couldn't
believe
his
ears
then
his
face
split
in
a
grin
you're
on
he
said
come
here
he
grabbed
Harrys
arm
below
the
shoulder
and
helped
Harry
limp
toward
the
plinth
where
the
cup
stood
when
they
had
reached
it
they
both
held
a
hand
out
over
one
of
the
cup's
gleaming
handles
on
three
right
said
Harry
one
two
three
he
and
Cedric
both
grasped
a
handle
instantly
Harry
felt
a
jerk
somewhere
behind
his
navel
his
feet
had
left
the
ground
he
could
not
unclench
the
hand
holding
the
Triwizard
Cup
it
was
pulling
him
onward
in
a
howl
of
wind
and
swirling
color
Cedric
at
his
side
chapter
thirtytwo
flesh
blood
and
bone
harry
felt
his
feet
slam
into
the
ground
his
injured
leg
gave
way
and
he
fell
forward
his
hand
let
go
of
the
Triwizard
Cup
at
last
he
raised
his
head
where
are
we
he
said
cedric
shook
his
head
he
got
up
pulled
Harry
to
his
feet
and
they
looked
around
they
had
left
the
Hogwarts
grounds
completely
they
had
obviously
traveled
miles
perhaps
hundreds
of
miles
for
even
the
mountains
surrounding
the
castle
were
gone
they
were
standing
instead
in
a
dark
and
overgrown
graveyard
the
black
outline
of
a
small
church
was
visible
beyond
a
large
yew
tree
to
their
right
a
hill
rose
above
them
to
their
left
harry
could
just
make
out
the
outline
of
a
fine
old
house
on
the
hillside
cedric
looked
down
at
the
Triwizard
Cup
and
then
up
at
Harry
did
anyone
tell
you
the
cup
was
a
Portkey
he
asked
nope
said
Harry
he
was
looking
around
the
graveyard
it
was
completely
silent
and
slightly
eerie
is
this
supposed
to
be
part
of
the
task
i
dunno
said
Cedric
he
sounded
slightly
nervous
wands
out
d'you
reckon
yeah
said
Harry
glad
that
Cedric
had
made
the
suggestion
rather
than
him
they
pulled
out
their
wands
harry
kept
looking
around
him
he
had
yet
again
the
strange
feeling
that
they
were
being
watched
someone's
coming
he
said
suddenly
squinting
tensely
through
the
darkness
they
watched
the
figure
drawing
nearer
walking
steadily
toward
them
between
the
graves
harry
couldn't
make
out
a
face
but
from
the
way
it
was
walking
and
holding
its
arms
he
could
tell
that
it
was
carrying
something
whoever
it
was
he
was
short
and
wearing
a
hooded
cloak
pulled
up
over
his
head
to
obscure
his
face
and
several
paces
nearer
the
gap
between
them
closing
all
the
time
Harry
saw
that
the
thing
in
the
persons
arms
looked
like
a
baby
or
was
it
merely
a
bundle
of
robes
harry
lowered
his
wand
slightly
and
glanced
sideways
at
Cedric
cedric
shot
him
a
quizzical
look
they
both
turned
back
to
watch
the
approaching
figure
it
stopped
beside
a
towering
marble
headstone
only
six
feet
from
them
for
a
second
harry
and
Cedric
and
the
short
figure
simply
looked
at
one
another
and
then
without
warning
harry's
scar
exploded
with
pain
it
was
agony
such
as
he
had
never
felt
in
all
his
life
his
wand
slipped
from
his
fingers
as
he
put
his
hands
over
his
face
his
knees
buckled
he
was
on
the
ground
and
he
could
see
nothing
at
all
his
head
was
about
to
split
open
from
far
away
above
his
head
he
heard
a
high
cold
voice
say
Kill
the
spare
a
swishing
noise
and
a
second
voice
which
screeched
the
words
to
the
night
Avada
Kedavra
a
blast
of
green
light
blazed
through
harry's
eyelids
and
he
heard
something
heavy
fall
to
the
ground
beside
him
the
pain
in
his
scar
reached
such
a
pitch
that
he
retched
and
then
it
diminished
terrified
of
what
he
was
about
to
see
he
opened
his
stinging
eyes
cedric
was
lying
spreadeagled
on
the
ground
beside
him
he
was
dead
for
a
second
that
contained
an
eternity
Harry
stared
into
cedric's
face
at
his
open
gray
eyes
blank
and
expressionless
as
the
windows
of
a
deserted
house
at
his
halfopen
mouth
which
looked
slightly
surprised
and
then
before
harry's
mind
had
accepted
what
he
was
seeing
before
he
could
feel
anything
but
numb
disbelief
he
felt
himself
being
pulled
to
his
feet
the
short
man
in
the
cloak
had
put
down
his
bundle
lit
his
wand
and
was
dragging
Harry
toward
the
marble
headstone
harry
saw
the
name
upon
it
flickering
in
the
wandlight
before
he
was
forced
around
and
slammed
against
it
tom
riddle
The
cloaked
man
was
now
conjuring
tight
cords
around
Harry
tying
him
from
neck
to
ankles
to
the
headstone
harry
could
hear
shallow
fast
breathing
from
the
depths
of
the
hood
he
struggled
and
the
man
hit
him
hit
him
with
a
hand
that
had
a
finger
missing
and
Harry
realized
who
was
under
the
hood
it
was
Wormtail
you
he
gasped
but
Wormtail
who
had
finished
conjuring
the
ropes
did
not
reply
he
was
busy
checking
the
tightness
of
the
cords
his
fingers
trembling
uncontrollably
rumbling
over
the
knots
once
sure
that
Harry
was
bound
so
tightly
to
the
headstone
that
he
couldn't
move
an
inch
Wormtail
drew
a
length
of
some
black
material
from
the
inside
of
his
cloak
and
stuffed
it
roughly
into
harry's
mouth
then
without
a
word
he
turned
from
Harry
and
hurried
away
harry
couldn't
make
a
sound
nor
could
he
see
where
Wormtail
had
gone
he
couldn't
turn
his
head
to
see
beyond
the
headstone
he
could
see
only
what
was
right
in
front
of
him
cedric's
body
was
lying
some
twenty
feet
away
some
way
beyond
him
glinting
in
the
starlight
lay
the
Triwizard
Cup
harry's
wand
was
on
the
ground
at
cedric's
feet
the
bundle
of
robes
that
Harry
had
thought
was
a
baby
was
close
by
at
the
foot
of
the
grave
it
seemed
to
be
stirring
fretfully
harry
watched
it
and
his
scar
seared
with
pain
again
and
he
suddenly
knew
that
he
didn't
want
to
see
what
was
in
those
robes
he
didn't
want
that
bundle
opened
he
could
hear
noises
at
his
feet
he
looked
down
and
saw
a
gigantic
snake
slithering
through
the
grass
circling
the
headstone
where
he
was
tied
wormtail's
fast
wheezy
breathing
was
growing
louder
again
it
sounded
as
though
he
was
forcing
something
heavy
across
the
ground
then
he
came
back
within
harry's
range
of
vision
and
Harry
saw
him
pushing
a
stone
cauldron
to
the
foot
of
the
grave
it
was
full
of
what
seemed
to
be
water
Harry
could
hear
it
slopping
around
and
it
was
larger
than
any
cauldron
Harry
had
ever
used
a
great
stone
belly
large
enough
for
a
fullgrown
man
to
sit
in
the
thing
inside
the
bundle
of
robes
on
the
ground
was
stirring
more
persistently
as
though
it
was
trying
to
free
itself
now
Wormtail
was
busying
himself
at
the
bottom
of
the
cauldron
with
a
wand
suddenly
there
were
crackling
names
beneath
it
the
large
snake
slithered
away
into
the
darkness
the
liquid
in
the
cauldron
seemed
to
heat
very
fast
the
surface
began
not
only
to
bubble
but
to
send
out
fiery
sparks
as
though
it
were
on
fire
steam
was
thickening
blurring
the
outline
of
Wormtail
tending
the
fire
the
movements
beneath
the
robes
became
more
agitated
and
Harry
heard
the
high
cold
voice
again
hurry
the
whole
surface
of
the
water
was
alight
with
sparks
now
it
might
have
been
encrusted
with
diamonds
it
is
ready
master
now
said
the
cold
voice
wormtail
pulled
open
the
robes
on
the
ground
revealing
what
was
inside
them
and
Harry
let
out
a
yell
that
was
strangled
in
the
wad
of
material
blocking
his
mouth
it
was
as
though
Wormtail
had
flipped
over
a
stone
and
revealed
something
ugly
slimy
and
blind
but
worse
a
hundred
times
worse
the
thing
Wormtail
had
been
carrying
had
the
shape
of
a
crouched
human
child
except
that
Harry
had
never
seen
anything
less
like
a
child
it
was
hairless
and
scalylooking
a
dark
raw
reddish
black
its
arms
and
legs
were
thin
and
feeble
and
its
face
no
child
alive
ever
had
a
face
like
that
flat
and
snakelike
with
gleaming
red
eyes
the
thing
seemed
almost
helpless
it
raised
its
thin
arms
put
them
around
wormtail's
neck
and
Wormtail
lifted
it
as
he
did
so
his
hood
fell
back
and
Harry
saw
the
look
of
revulsion
on
wormtail's
weak
pale
face
in
the
firelight
as
he
carried
the
creature
to
the
rim
of
the
cauldron
for
one
moment
Harry
saw
the
evil
flat
face
illuminated
in
the
sparks
dancing
on
the
surface
of
the
potion
and
then
Wormtail
lowered
the
creature
into
the
cauldron
there
was
a
hiss
and
it
vanished
below
the
surface
Harry
heard
its
frail
body
hit
the
bottom
with
a
soft
thud
let
it
drown
Harry
thought
his
scar
burning
almost
past
endurance
please
let
it
drown
wormtail
was
speaking
his
voice
shook
he
seemed
frightened
beyond
his
wits
he
raised
his
wand
closed
his
eyes
and
spoke
to
the
night
bone
of
the
father
unknowingly
given
you
wil
lrenew
your
son
the
surface
of
the
grave
at
harry's
feet
cracked
horrified
Harry
watched
as
a
fine
trickle
of
dust
rose
into
the
air
at
wormtail's
command
and
fell
softly
into
the
cauldron
the
diamond
surface
of
the
water
broke
and
hissed
it
sent
sparks
in
all
directions
and
turned
a
vivid
poisonouslooking
blue
and
now
Wormtail
was
whimpering
he
pulled
a
long
thin
shining
silver
dagger
from
inside
his
cloak
his
voice
broke
into
petrified
sobs
flesh
of
the
servant
wwillingly
given
you
will
revive
your
master
he
stretched
his
right
hand
out
in
front
of
him
the
hand
with
the
missing
finger
he
gripped
the
dagger
very
tightly
in
his
left
hand
and
swung
it
upward
harry
realized
what
Wormtail
was
about
to
do
a
second
before
it
happened
he
closed
his
eyes
as
tightly
as
he
could
but
he
could
not
block
the
scream
that
pierced
the
night
that
went
through
Harry
as
though
he
had
been
stabbed
with
the
dagger
too
he
heard
something
fall
to
the
ground
heard
wormtail's
anguished
panting
then
a
sickening
splash
as
something
was
dropped
into
the
cauldron
harry
couldn't
stand
to
look
but
the
potion
had
turned
a
burning
red
the
light
of
it
shone
through
harry's
closed
eyelids
wormtail
was
gasping
and
moaning
with
agony
not
until
Harry
felt
wormtail's
anguished
breath
on
his
face
did
he
realize
that
Wormtail
was
right
in
front
of
him
bblood
of
the
enemy
forcibly
taken
you
will
resurrect
your
foe
harry
could
do
nothing
to
prevent
it
he
was
tied
too
tightly
squinting
down
struggling
hopelessly
at
the
ropes
binding
him
he
saw
the
shining
silver
dagger
shaking
in
Wormtails
remaining
hand
he
felt
its
point
penetrate
the
crook
of
his
right
arm
and
blood
seeping
down
the
sleeve
of
his
torn
robes
wormtail
still
panting
with
pain
rumbled
in
his
pocket
for
a
glass
vial
and
held
it
to
harry's
cut
so
that
a
dribble
of
blood
fell
into
it
he
staggered
back
to
the
cauldron
with
Harrys
blood
he
poured
it
inside
the
liquid
within
turned
instantly
a
blinding
white
wormtail
his
job
done
dropped
to
his
knees
beside
the
cauldron
then
slumped
sideways
and
lay
on
the
ground
cradling
the
bleeding
stump
of
his
arm
gasping
and
sobbing
the
cauldron
was
simmering
sending
its
diamond
sparks
in
all
directions
so
blindingly
bright
that
it
turned
all
else
to
velvety
blackness
nothing
happened
let
it
have
drowned
harry
thought
let
it
have
gone
wrong
and
then
suddenly
the
sparks
emanating
from
the
cauldron
were
extinguished
a
surge
of
white
steam
billowed
thickly
from
the
cauldron
instead
obliterating
everything
in
front
of
Harry
so
that
he
couldn't
see
Wormtail
or
Cedric
or
anything
but
vapor
hanging
in
the
air
it's
gone
wrong
he
thought
it's
drowned
please
please
let
it
be
dead
but
then
through
the
mist
in
front
of
him
he
saw
with
an
icy
surge
of
terror
the
dark
outline
of
a
man
tall
and
skeletally
thin
rising
slowly
from
inside
the
cauldron
robe
me
said
the
high
cold
voice
from
behind
the
steam
and
Wormtail
sobbing
and
moaning
still
cradling
his
mutilated
arm
scrambled
to
pick
up
the
black
robes
from
the
ground
got
to
his
feet
reached
up
and
pulled
them
one
handed
over
his
master's
head
the
thin
man
stepped
out
of
the
cauldron
staring
at
Harry
and
Harry
stared
back
into
the
face
that
had
haunted
his
nightmares
for
three
years
whiter
than
a
skull
with
wide
livid
scarlet
eyes
and
a
nose
that
was
flat
as
a
snakes
with
slits
for
nostrils
lord
Voldemort
had
risen
again
chapter
thirtythree
the
death
eaters
voldemort
looked
away
from
Harry
and
began
examining
his
own
body
his
hands
were
like
large
pale
spiders
his
long
white
fingers
caressed
his
own
chest
his
arms
his
face
the
red
eyes
whose
pupils
were
slits
like
a
cats
gleamed
still
more
brightly
through
the
darkness
he
held
up
his
hands
and
flexed
the
fingers
his
expression
rapt
and
exultant
he
took
not
the
slightest
notice
of
Wormtail
who
lay
twitching
and
bleeding
on
the
ground
nor
of
the
great
snake
which
had
slithered
back
into
sight
and
was
circling
Harry
again
hissing
voldemort
slipped
one
of
those
unnaturally
longfingered
hands
into
a
deep
pocket
and
drew
out
a
wand
he
caressed
it
gently
too
and
then
he
raised
it
and
pointed
it
at
Wormtail
who
was
lifted
off
the
ground
and
thrown
against
the
headstone
where
Harry
was
tied
he
fell
to
the
foot
of
it
and
lay
there
crumpled
up
and
crying
voldemort
turned
his
scarlet
eyes
upon
Harry
laughing
a
high
cold
mirthless
laugh
wormtail's
robes
were
shining
with
blood
now
he
had
wrapped
the
stump
of
his
arm
in
them
my
Lord
he
choked
my
Lord
you
promised
you
did
promise
hold
out
your
arm
said
Voldemort
lazily
oh
Master
thank
you
Master
he
extended
the
bleeding
stump
but
Voldemort
laughed
again
the
other
arm
Wormtail
master
please
please
voldemort
bent
down
and
pulled
out
wormtail's
left
arm
he
forced
the
sleeve
of
wormtail's
robes
up
past
his
elbow
and
Harry
saw
something
upon
the
skin
there
something
like
a
vivid
red
tattoo
a
skull
with
a
snake
protruding
from
its
mouth
the
image
that
had
appeared
in
the
sky
at
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
the
Dark
Mark
voldemort
examined
it
carefully
ignoring
wormtail's
uncontrollable
weeping
it
is
back
he
said
softly
they
will
all
have
noticed
it
and
now
we
shall
see
now
we
shall
know
he
pressed
his
long
white
forefinger
to
the
brand
on
wormtail's
arm
the
scar
on
Harry
s
forehead
seared
with
a
sharp
pain
again
and
Wormtail
let
out
a
fresh
howl
Voldemort
removed
his
fingers
from
wormtail's
mark
and
Harry
saw
that
it
had
turned
jet
black
a
look
of
cruel
satisfaction
on
his
face
Voldemort
straightened
up
threw
back
his
head
and
stared
around
at
the
dark
graveyard
how
many
will
be
brave
enough
to
return
when
they
feel
it
he
whispered
his
gleaming
red
eyes
fixed
upon
the
stars
and
how
many
will
be
foolish
enough
to
stay
away
he
began
to
pace
up
and
down
before
Harry
and
Wormtail
eyes
sweeping
the
graveyard
all
the
while
after
a
minute
or
so
he
looked
down
at
Harry
again
a
cruel
smile
twisting
his
snakelike
face
you
stand
Harry
Potter
upon
the
remains
of
my
late
father
he
hissed
softly
a
Muggle
and
a
fool
very
like
your
dear
mother
but
they
both
had
their
uses
did
they
not
your
mother
died
to
defend
you
as
a
child
and
I
killed
my
father
and
see
how
useful
he
has
proved
himself
in
death
voldemort
laughed
again
up
and
down
he
paced
looking
all
around
him
as
he
walked
and
the
snake
continued
to
circle
in
the
grass
you
see
that
house
upon
the
hillside
Potter
my
father
lived
there
my
mother
a
witch
who
lived
here
in
this
village
fell
in
love
with
him
but
he
abandoned
her
when
she
told
him
what
she
was
he
didn't
like
magic
my
father
he
left
her
and
returned
to
his
Muggle
parents
before
I
was
even
born
potter
and
she
died
giving
birth
to
me
leaving
me
to
be
raised
in
a
Muggle
orphanage
but
I
vowed
to
find
him
i
revenged
myself
upon
him
that
fool
who
gave
me
his
name
tom
Riddle
still
he
paced
his
red
eyes
darting
from
grave
to
grave
listen
to
me
reliving
family
history
he
said
quietly
why
I
am
growing
quite
sentimental
but
look
Harry
my
true
family
returns
the
air
was
suddenly
full
of
the
swishing
of
cloaks
between
graves
behind
the
yew
tree
in
every
shadowy
space
wizards
were
Apparating
all
of
them
were
hooded
and
masked
and
one
by
one
they
moved
forward
slowly
cautiously
as
though
they
could
hardly
believe
their
eyes
Voldemort
stood
in
silence
waiting
for
them
then
one
of
the
Death
Eaters
fell
to
his
knees
crawled
toward
Voldemort
and
kissed
the
hem
of
his
black
robes
master
master
he
murmured
the
Death
Eaters
behind
him
did
the
same
each
of
them
approaching
Voldemort
on
his
knees
and
kissing
his
robes
before
backing
away
and
standing
up
forming
a
silent
circle
which
enclosed
Tom
Riddle
s
grave
Harry
Voldemort
and
the
sobbing
and
twitching
heap
that
was
Wormtail
yet
they
left
gaps
in
the
circle
as
though
waiting
for
more
people
voldemort
however
did
not
seem
to
expect
more
he
looked
around
at
the
hooded
faces
and
though
there
was
no
wind
rustling
seemed
to
run
around
the
circle
as
though
it
had
shivered
welcome
Death
Eaters
said
Voldemort
quietly
thirteen
years
thirteen
years
since
last
we
met
yet
you
answer
my
call
as
though
it
were
yesterday
we
are
still
united
under
the
Dark
Mark
then
or
are
we
he
put
back
his
terrible
face
and
sniffed
his
slitlike
nostrils
widening
i
smell
guilt
he
said
there
is
a
stench
or
guilt
upon
the
air
a
second
shiver
ran
around
the
circle
as
though
each
member
of
it
longed
but
did
not
dare
to
step
back
from
him
i
see
you
all
whole
and
healthy
with
your
powers
intact
such
prompt
appearances
and
I
ask
myself
why
did
this
band
of
wizards
never
come
to
the
aid
of
their
master
to
whom
they
swore
eternal
loyalty
no
one
spoke
no
one
moved
except
Wormtail
who
was
upon
the
ground
still
sobbing
over
his
bleeding
arm
and
I
answer
myself
whispered
Voldemort
they
must
have
believed
me
broken
they
thought
I
was
gone
they
slipped
back
among
my
enemies
and
they
pleaded
innocence
and
ignorance
and
bewitchment
and
then
I
ask
myself
but
how
could
they
have
believed
I
would
not
rise
again
they
who
knew
the
steps
I
took
long
ago
to
guard
myself
against
mortal
death
they
who
had
seen
proofs
of
the
immensity
of
my
power
in
the
times
when
I
was
mightier
than
any
wizard
living
and
I
answer
myself
perhaps
they
believed
a
still
greater
power
could
exist
one
that
could
vanquish
even
Lord
Voldemort
perhaps
they
now
pay
allegiance
to
another
perhaps
that
champion
of
commoners
of
Mudbloods
and
Muggles
Albus
Dumbledore
at
the
mention
of
dumbledore's
name
the
members
of
the
circle
stirred
and
some
muttered
and
shook
their
heads
voldemort
ignored
them
it
is
a
disappointment
to
me
i
confess
myself
disappointed
one
of
the
men
suddenly
flung
himself
forward
breaking
the
circle
trembling
from
head
to
foot
he
collapsed
at
voldemort's
feet
master
he
shrieked
Master
forgive
me
forgive
us
all
voldemort
began
to
laugh
he
raised
his
wand
crucio
the
Death
Eater
on
the
ground
writhed
and
shrieked
Harry
was
sure
the
sound
must
carry
to
the
houses
around
let
the
police
come
he
thought
desperately
anyone
anything
voldemort
raised
his
wand
the
tortured
Death
Eater
lay
flat
upon
the
ground
gasping
get
up
Avery
said
Voldemort
softly
stand
up
you
ask
for
forgiveness
i
do
not
forgive
i
do
not
forget
thirteen
long
years
i
want
thirteen
years
repayment
before
I
forgive
you
wormtail
here
has
paid
some
of
his
debt
already
have
you
not
Wormtail
he
looked
down
at
Wormtail
who
continued
to
sob
you
returned
to
me
not
out
of
loyalty
but
out
of
fear
of
your
old
friends
you
deserve
this
pain
Wormtail
you
know
that
don't
you
yes
Master
moaned
Wormtail
please
master
please
yet
you
helped
return
me
to
my
body
said
Voldemort
coolly
watching
Wormtail
sob
on
the
ground
worthless
and
traitorous
as
you
are
you
helped
me
and
Lord
Voldemort
rewards
his
helpers
voldemort
raised
his
wand
again
and
whirled
it
through
the
air
a
streak
of
what
looked
like
molten
silver
hung
shining
in
the
wand's
wake
momentarily
shapeless
it
writhed
and
then
formed
itself
into
a
gleaming
replica
of
a
human
hand
bright
as
moonlight
which
soared
downward
and
fixed
itself
upon
Wormtails
bleeding
wrist
wormtail's
sobbing
stopped
abruptly
his
breathing
harsh
and
ragged
he
raised
his
head
and
stared
in
disbelief
at
the
silver
hand
now
attached
seamlessly
to
his
arm
as
though
he
were
wearing
a
dazzling
glove
he
flexed
the
shining
fingers
then
trembling
picked
up
a
small
twig
on
the
ground
and
crushed
it
into
powder
my
Lord
he
whispered
master
it
is
beautiful
thank
you
thank
you
he
scrambled
forward
on
his
knees
and
kissed
the
hem
of
voldemort's
robes
may
your
loyalty
never
waver
again
Wormtail
said
Voldemort
no
my
Lord
never
my
Lord
wormtail
stood
up
and
took
his
place
in
the
circle
staring
at
his
powerful
new
hand
his
face
still
shining
with
tears
voldemort
now
approached
the
man
on
wormtail's
right
lucius
my
slippery
friend
he
whispered
halting
before
him
i
am
told
that
you
have
not
renounced
the
old
ways
though
to
the
world
you
present
a
respectable
face
you
are
still
ready
to
take
the
lead
in
a
spot
of
Muggletorture
I
believe
yet
you
never
tried
to
find
me
Lucius
your
exploits
at
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
were
fun
I
daresay
but
might
not
your
energies
have
been
better
directed
toward
finding
and
aiding
your
master
my
Lord
I
was
constantly
on
the
alert
came
Lucius
malfoy's
voice
swiftly
from
beneath
the
hood
had
there
been
any
sign
from
you
any
whisper
of
your
whereabouts
I
would
have
been
at
your
side
immediately
nothing
could
have
prevented
me
and
yet
you
ran
from
my
Mark
when
a
faithful
Death
Eater
sent
it
into
the
sky
last
summer
said
Voldemort
lazily
and
mr.
Malfoy
stopped
talking
abruptly
yes
I
know
all
about
that
Lucius
you
have
disappointed
me
i
expect
more
faithful
service
in
the
future
of
course
my
Lord
of
course
you
are
merciful
thank
you
voldemort
moved
on
and
stopped
staring
at
the
space
large
enough
for
two
people
that
separated
Malfoy
and
the
next
man
the
Lestranges
should
stand
here
said
Voldemort
quietly
but
they
are
entombed
in
Azkaban
they
were
faithful
they
went
to
Azkaban
rather
than
renounce
me
when
Azkaban
is
broken
open
the
Lestranges
will
be
honored
beyond
their
dreams
the
dementors
will
join
us
they
are
our
natural
allies
we
will
recall
the
banished
giants
i
shall
have
all
my
devoted
servants
returned
to
me
and
an
army
of
creatures
whom
all
fear
he
walked
on
some
of
the
Death
Eaters
he
passed
in
silence
but
he
paused
before
others
and
spoke
to
them
macnair
destroying
dangerous
beasts
for
the
Ministry
of
Magic
now
Wormtail
tells
me
you
shall
have
better
victims
than
that
soon
Macnair
lord
Voldemort
will
provide
thank
you
Master
thank
you
murmured
Macnair
and
here
Voldemort
moved
on
to
the
two
largest
hooded
figures
we
have
Crabbe
you
will
do
better
this
time
will
you
not
Crabbe
and
you
Goyle
they
bowed
clumsily
muttering
dully
yes
Master
we
will
Master
the
same
goes
for
you
Nott
said
Voldemort
quietly
as
he
walked
past
a
stooped
figure
in
mr.
Goyles
shadow
my
Lord
I
prostrate
myself
before
you
I
am
your
most
faithful
that
will
do
said
Voldemort
he
had
reached
the
largest
gap
of
all
and
he
stood
surveying
it
with
his
blank
red
eyes
as
though
he
could
see
people
standing
there
and
here
we
have
six
missing
Death
Eaters
three
dead
in
my
service
one
too
cowardly
to
return
he
will
pay
one
who
I
believe
has
left
me
forever
he
will
be
killed
of
course
and
one
who
remains
my
most
faithful
servant
and
who
has
already
reentered
my
service
the
Death
Eaters
stirred
and
Harry
saw
their
eyes
dart
sideways
at
one
another
through
their
masks
he
is
at
Hogwarts
that
faithful
servant
and
it
was
through
his
efforts
that
our
young
friend
arrived
here
tonight
yes
said
Voldemort
a
grin
curling
his
lipless
mouth
as
the
eyes
of
the
circle
flashed
in
harry's
direction
harry
Potter
has
kindly
joined
us
for
my
rebirthing
party
one
might
go
so
far
as
to
call
him
my
guest
of
honor
there
was
a
silence
then
the
Death
Eater
to
the
right
of
Wormtail
stepped
forward
and
Lucius
malfoy's
voice
spoke
from
under
the
mask
master
we
crave
to
know
we
beg
you
to
tell
us
how
you
have
achieved
this
this
miracle
how
you
managed
to
return
to
us
ah
what
a
story
it
is
Lucius
said
Voldemort
and
it
begins
and
ends
with
my
young
friend
here
he
walked
lazily
over
to
stand
next
to
Harry
so
that
the
eyes
of
the
whole
circle
were
upon
the
two
of
them
the
snake
continued
to
circle
you
know
of
course
that
they
have
called
this
boy
my
downfall
voldemort
said
softly
his
red
eyes
upon
Harry
whose
scar
began
to
burn
so
fiercely
that
he
almost
screamed
in
agony
you
all
know
that
on
the
night
I
lost
my
powers
and
my
body
I
tried
to
kill
him
his
mother
died
in
the
attempt
to
save
him
and
unwittingly
provided
him
with
a
protection
I
admit
I
had
not
foreseen
i
could
not
touch
the
boy
voldemort
raised
one
of
his
long
white
fingers
and
put
it
very
close
to
harry's
cheek
his
mother
left
upon
him
the
traces
other
sacrifice
this
is
old
magic
I
should
have
remembered
it
I
was
foolish
to
overlook
it
but
no
matter
i
can
touch
him
now
harry
felt
the
cold
tip
of
the
long
white
finger
touch
him
and
thought
his
head
would
burst
with
the
pain
voldemort
laughed
softly
in
his
ear
then
took
the
finger
away
and
continued
addressing
the
Death
Eaters
i
miscalculated
my
friends
I
admit
it
my
curse
was
deflected
by
the
woman's
foolish
sacrifice
and
it
rebounded
upon
myself
aaah
pain
beyond
pain
my
friends
nothing
could
have
prepared
me
for
it
i
was
ripped
from
my
body
I
was
less
than
spirit
less
than
the
meanest
ghost
but
still
I
was
alive
what
I
was
even
I
do
not
know
i
who
have
gone
further
than
anybody
along
the
path
that
leads
to
immortality
you
know
my
goal
to
conquer
death
and
now
I
was
tested
and
it
appeared
that
one
or
more
of
my
experiments
had
worked
for
I
had
not
been
killed
though
the
curse
should
have
done
it
nevertheless
I
was
as
powerless
as
the
weakest
creature
alive
and
without
the
means
to
help
myself
for
I
had
no
body
and
every
spell
that
might
have
helped
me
required
the
use
of
a
wand
i
remember
only
forcing
myself
sleeplessly
endlessly
second
by
second
to
exist
i
settled
in
a
faraway
place
in
a
forest
and
I
waited
surely
one
of
my
faithful
Death
Eaters
would
try
and
find
me
one
of
them
would
come
and
perform
the
magic
I
could
not
to
restore
me
to
a
body
but
I
waited
in
vain
the
shiver
ran
once
more
around
the
circle
of
listening
Death
Eaters
voldemort
let
the
silence
spiral
horribly
before
continuing
only
one
power
remained
to
me
i
could
possess
the
bodies
of
others
but
I
dared
not
go
where
other
humans
were
plentiful
for
I
knew
that
the
Aurors
were
still
abroad
and
searching
for
me
i
sometimes
inhabited
animals
snakes
of
course
being
my
preference
but
I
was
little
better
off
inside
them
than
as
pure
spirit
for
their
bodies
were
ill
adapted
to
perform
magic
and
my
possession
of
them
shortened
their
lives
none
of
them
lasted
long
then
four
years
ago
the
means
for
my
return
seemed
assured
a
wizard
young
foolish
and
gullible
wandered
across
my
path
in
the
forest
I
had
made
my
home
oh
he
seemed
the
very
chance
I
had
been
dreaming
of
for
he
was
a
teacher
at
dumbledore's
school
he
was
easy
to
bend
to
my
will
he
brought
me
back
to
this
country
and
after
a
while
I
took
possession
of
his
body
to
supervise
him
closely
as
he
carried
out
my
orders
but
my
plan
failed
i
did
not
manage
to
steal
the
sorcerer's
Stone
i
was
not
to
be
assured
immortal
life
i
was
thwarted
thwarted
once
again
by
Harry
Potter
silence
once
more
nothing
was
stirring
not
even
the
leaves
on
the
yew
tree
the
Death
Eaters
were
quite
motionless
the
glittering
eyes
in
their
masks
fixed
upon
Voldemort
and
upon
Harry
the
servant
died
when
I
left
his
body
and
I
was
left
as
weak
as
ever
I
had
been
voldemort
continued
i
returned
to
my
hiding
place
far
away
and
I
will
not
pretend
to
you
that
I
didn't
then
fear
that
I
might
never
regain
my
powers
yes
that
was
perhaps
my
darkest
hour
i
could
not
hope
that
I
would
be
sent
another
wizard
to
possess
and
I
had
given
up
hope
now
that
any
of
my
Death
Eaters
cared
what
had
become
of
me
one
or
two
of
the
masked
wizards
in
the
circle
moved
uncomfortably
but
Voldemort
took
no
notice
and
then
not
even
a
year
ago
when
I
had
almost
abandoned
hope
it
happened
at
last
a
servant
returned
to
me
wormtail
here
who
had
faked
his
own
death
to
escape
justice
was
driven
out
of
hiding
by
those
he
had
once
counted
friends
and
decided
to
return
to
his
master
he
sought
me
in
the
country
where
it
had
long
been
rumored
I
was
hiding
helped
of
course
by
the
rats
he
met
along
the
way
wormtail
has
a
curious
affinity
with
rats
do
you
not
Wormtail
his
filthy
little
friends
told
him
there
was
a
place
deep
in
an
Albanian
forest
that
they
avoided
where
small
animals
like
themselves
had
met
their
deaths
by
a
dark
shadow
that
possessed
them
but
his
journey
back
to
me
was
not
smooth
was
it
Wormtail
for
hungry
one
night
on
the
edge
of
the
very
forest
where
he
had
hoped
to
find
me
he
foolishly
stopped
at
an
inn
for
some
food
and
who
should
he
meet
there
but
one
Bertha
Jorkins
a
witch
from
the
Ministry
of
Magic
now
see
the
way
that
fate
favors
Lord
Voldemort
this
might
have
been
the
end
of
Wormtail
and
of
my
last
hope
for
regeneration
but
Wormtail
displaying
a
presence
of
mind
I
would
never
have
expected
from
him
convinced
Bertha
Jorkins
to
accompany
him
on
a
nighttime
stroll
he
overpowered
her
he
brought
her
to
me
and
Bertha
Jorkins
who
might
have
ruined
all
proved
instead
to
be
a
gift
beyond
my
wildest
dreams
for
with
a
little
persuasion
she
became
a
veritable
mine
of
information
she
told
me
that
the
Triwizard
Tournament
would
be
played
at
Hogwarts
this
year
she
told
me
that
she
knew
of
a
faithful
Death
Eater
who
would
be
only
too
willing
to
help
me
if
I
could
only
contact
him
she
told
me
many
things
but
the
means
I
used
to
break
the
Memory
Charm
upon
her
were
powerful
and
when
I
had
extracted
all
useful
information
from
her
her
mind
and
body
were
both
damaged
beyond
repair
she
had
now
served
her
purpose
i
could
not
possess
her
i
disposed
of
her
voldemort
smiled
his
terrible
smile
his
red
eyes
blank
and
pitiless
wormtail's
body
of
course
was
ill
adapted
for
possession
as
all
assumed
him
dead
and
would
attract
far
too
much
attention
if
noticed
however
he
was
the
ablebodied
servant
I
needed
and
poor
wizard
though
he
is
Wormtail
was
able
to
follow
the
instructions
I
gave
him
which
would
return
me
to
a
rudimentary
weak
body
of
my
own
a
body
I
would
be
able
to
inhabit
while
awaiting
the
essential
ingredients
for
true
rebirth
a
spell
or
two
of
my
own
invention
a
little
help
from
my
dear
Nagini
Voldemorts
red
eyes
fell
upon
the
continually
circling
snake
a
potion
concocted
from
unicorn
blood
and
the
snake
venom
Nagini
provided
i
was
soon
returned
to
an
almost
human
form
and
strong
enough
to
travel
there
was
no
hope
of
stealing
the
sorcerer's
Stone
anymore
for
I
knew
that
Dumbledore
would
have
seen
to
it
that
it
was
destroyed
but
I
was
willing
to
embrace
mortal
life
again
before
chasing
immortality
i
set
my
sights
lower
i
would
settle
for
my
old
body
back
again
and
my
old
strength
i
knew
that
to
achieve
this
it
is
an
old
piece
of
Dark
Magic
the
potion
that
revived
me
tonight
I
would
need
three
powerful
ingredients
well
one
of
them
was
already
at
hand
was
it
not
Wormtail
flesh
given
by
a
servant
my
father's
bone
naturally
meant
that
we
would
have
to
come
here
where
he
was
buried
but
the
blood
of
a
foe
wormtail
would
have
had
me
use
any
wizard
would
you
not
Wormtail
any
wizard
who
had
hated
me
as
so
many
of
them
still
do
but
I
knew
the
one
I
must
use
if
I
was
to
rise
again
more
powerful
than
I
had
been
when
I
had
fallen
i
wanted
Harry
Potters
blood
i
wanted
the
blood
of
the
one
who
had
stripped
me
of
power
thirteen
years
ago
for
the
lingering
protection
his
mother
once
gave
him
would
then
reside
in
my
veins
too
but
how
to
get
at
Harry
Potter
for
he
has
been
better
protected
than
I
think
even
he
knows
protected
in
ways
devised
by
Dumbledore
long
ago
when
it
fell
to
him
to
arrange
the
boy's
future
dumbledore
invoked
an
ancient
magic
to
ensure
the
boy's
protection
as
long
as
he
is
in
his
relations
care
not
even
I
can
touch
him
there
then
of
course
there
was
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
i
thought
his
protection
might
be
weaker
there
away
from
his
relations
and
Dumbledore
but
I
was
not
yet
strong
enough
to
attempt
kidnap
in
the
midst
of
a
horde
of
Ministry
wizards
and
then
the
boy
would
return
to
Hogwarts
where
he
is
under
the
crooked
nose
of
that
Muggleloving
fool
from
morning
until
night
so
how
could
I
take
him
why
by
using
Bertha
jorkins's
information
of
course
use
my
one
faithful
Death
Eater
stationed
at
Hogwarts
to
ensure
that
the
boy's
name
was
entered
into
the
Goblet
of
Fire
use
my
Death
Eater
to
ensure
that
the
boy
won
the
tournament
that
he
touched
the
Triwizard
Cup
first
the
cup
which
my
Death
Eater
had
turned
into
a
Portkey
which
would
bring
him
here
beyond
the
reach
of
dumbledore's
help
and
protection
and
into
my
waiting
arms
and
here
he
is
the
boy
you
all
believed
had
been
my
downfall
voldemort
moved
slowly
forward
and
turned
to
face
Harry
he
raised
his
wand
crucio
it
was
pain
beyond
anything
Harry
had
ever
experienced
his
very
bones
were
on
fire
his
head
was
surely
splitting
along
his
scar
his
eyes
were
rolling
madly
in
his
head
he
wanted
it
to
end
to
black
out
to
die
and
then
it
was
gone
he
was
hanging
limply
in
the
ropes
binding
him
to
the
headstone
of
voldemort's
father
looking
up
into
those
bright
red
eyes
through
a
kind
of
mist
the
night
was
ringing
with
the
sound
of
the
Death
Eaters
laughter
you
see
I
think
how
foolish
it
was
to
suppose
that
this
boy
could
ever
have
been
stronger
than
me
said
Voldemort
but
I
want
there
to
be
no
mistake
in
anybody's
mind
harry
Potter
escaped
me
by
a
lucky
chance
and
I
am
now
going
to
prove
my
power
by
killing
him
here
and
now
in
front
of
you
all
when
there
is
no
Dumbledore
to
help
him
and
no
mother
to
die
for
him
i
will
give
him
his
chance
he
will
be
allowed
to
fight
and
you
will
be
left
in
no
doubt
which
of
us
is
the
stronger
just
a
little
longer
Nagini
he
whispered
and
the
snake
glided
away
through
the
grass
to
where
the
Death
Eaters
stood
watching
now
untie
him
Wormtail
and
give
him
back
his
wand
chapter
thirtyfour
priori
incantatem
wormtail
approached
Harry
who
scrambled
to
find
his
feet
to
support
his
own
weight
before
the
ropes
were
untied
wormtail
raised
his
new
silver
hand
pulled
out
the
wad
of
material
gagging
Harry
and
then
with
one
swipe
cut
through
the
bonds
tying
Harry
to
the
gravestone
there
was
a
split
second
perhaps
when
Harry
might
have
considered
running
for
it
but
his
injured
leg
shook
under
him
as
he
stood
on
the
overgrown
grave
as
the
Death
Eaters
closed
ranks
forming
a
tighter
circle
around
him
and
Voldemort
so
that
the
gaps
where
the
missing
Death
Eaters
should
have
stood
were
filled
wormtail
walked
out
of
the
circle
to
the
place
where
cedric's
body
lay
and
returned
with
harry's
wand
which
he
thrust
roughly
into
harry's
hand
without
looking
at
him
then
Wormtail
resumed
his
place
in
the
circle
of
watching
Death
Eaters
you
have
been
taught
how
to
duel
harry
Potter
said
Voldemort
softly
his
red
eyes
glinting
through
the
darkness
at
these
words
Harry
remembered
as
though
from
a
former
life
the
dueling
club
at
Hogwarts
he
had
attended
briefly
two
years
ago
all
he
had
learned
there
was
the
Disarming
Spell
Expelliarmus
and
what
use
would
it
be
to
deprive
Voldemort
of
his
wand
even
if
he
could
when
he
was
surrounded
by
Death
Eaters
outnumbered
by
at
least
thirty
to
one
he
had
never
learned
anything
that
could
possibly
fit
him
for
this
he
knew
he
was
facing
the
thing
against
which
Moody
had
always
warned
the
unblockable
Avada
Kedavra
curse
and
Voldemort
was
right
his
mother
was
not
here
to
die
for
him
this
time
he
was
quite
unprotected
we
bow
to
each
other
harry
said
Voldemort
bending
a
little
but
keeping
his
snakelike
face
upturned
to
Harry
come
the
niceties
must
be
observed
dumbledore
would
like
you
to
show
manners
bow
to
death
Harry
the
Death
Eaters
were
laughing
again
voldemorts
lipless
mouth
was
smiling
harry
did
not
bow
he
was
not
going
to
let
Voldemort
play
with
him
before
killing
him
he
was
not
going
to
give
him
that
satisfaction
i
said
bow
Voldemort
said
raising
his
wand
and
Harry
felt
his
spine
curve
as
though
a
huge
invisible
hand
were
bending
him
ruthlessly
forward
and
the
Death
Eaters
laughed
harder
than
ever
very
good
said
Voldemort
softly
and
as
he
raised
his
wand
the
pressure
bearing
down
upon
Harry
lifted
too
and
now
you
face
me
like
a
man
straightbacked
and
proud
the
way
your
father
died
and
now
we
duel
voldemort
raised
his
wand
and
before
Harry
could
do
anything
to
defend
himself
before
he
could
even
move
he
had
been
hit
again
by
the
Cruciatus
Curse
the
pain
was
so
intense
so
allconsuming
that
he
no
longer
knew
where
he
was
whitehot
knives
were
piercing
every
inch
of
his
skin
his
head
was
surely
going
to
burst
with
pain
he
was
screaming
more
loudly
than
he'd
ever
screamed
in
his
life
And
then
it
stopped
harry
rolled
over
and
scrambled
to
his
feet
he
was
shaking
as
uncontrollably
as
Wormtail
had
done
when
his
hand
had
been
cut
off
he
staggered
sideways
into
the
wall
of
watching
Death
Eaters
and
they
pushed
him
away
back
toward
Voldemort
a
little
break
said
Voldemort
the
slitlike
nostrils
dilating
with
excitement
a
little
pause
that
hurt
didn't
it
harry
you
don't
want
me
to
do
that
again
do
you
harry
didn't
answer
he
was
going
to
die
like
Cedric
those
pitiless
red
eyes
were
telling
him
so
he
was
going
to
die
and
there
was
nothing
he
could
do
about
it
but
he
wasn't
going
to
play
along
he
wasn't
going
to
obey
Voldemort
he
wasn't
going
to
beg
i
asked
you
whether
you
want
me
to
do
that
again
said
Voldemort
softly
answer
me
imperial
and
Harry
felt
for
the
third
time
in
his
life
the
sensation
that
his
mind
had
been
wiped
of
all
thought
ah
it
was
bliss
not
to
think
it
was
as
though
he
were
floating
dreaming
just
answer
no
say
no
just
answer
no
i
will
not
said
a
stronger
voice
in
the
back
of
his
head
I
won't
answer
just
answer
no
i
won't
do
it
I
won't
say
it
just
answer
no
i
won't
and
these
words
burst
from
harry's
mouth
they
echoed
through
the
graveyard
and
the
dream
state
was
lifted
as
suddenly
as
though
cold
water
had
been
thrown
over
him
back
rushed
the
aches
that
the
Cruciatus
Curse
had
left
all
over
his
body
back
rushed
the
realization
of
where
he
was
and
what
he
was
facing
you
won't
said
Voldemort
quietly
and
the
Death
Eaters
were
not
laughing
now
you
won't
say
no
harry
obedience
is
a
virtue
I
need
to
teach
you
before
you
die
perhaps
another
little
dose
of
pain
voldemort
raised
his
wand
but
this
time
Harry
was
ready
with
the
reflexes
born
of
his
Quidditch
training
he
flung
himself
sideways
onto
the
ground
he
rolled
behind
the
marble
headstone
of
Voldemort
s
father
and
he
heard
it
crack
as
the
curse
missed
him
we
are
not
playing
hideandseek
Harry
said
voldemort's
soft
cold
voice
drawing
nearer
as
the
Death
Eaters
laughed
you
cannot
hide
from
me
does
this
mean
you
are
tired
of
our
duel
does
this
mean
that
you
would
prefer
me
to
finish
it
now
Harry
come
out
Harry
come
out
and
play
then
it
will
be
quick
it
might
even
be
painless
i
would
not
know
i
have
never
died
harry
crouched
behind
the
headstone
and
knew
the
end
had
come
there
was
no
hope
no
help
to
be
had
and
as
he
heard
Voldemort
draw
nearer
still
he
knew
one
thing
only
and
it
was
beyond
fear
or
reason
He
was
not
going
to
die
crouching
here
like
a
child
playing
hideandseek
he
was
not
going
to
die
kneeling
at
Voldemort
s
feet
he
was
going
to
die
upright
like
his
father
and
he
was
going
to
die
trying
to
defend
himself
even
if
no
defense
was
possible
before
Voldemort
could
stick
his
snakelike
face
around
the
headstone
harry
stood
up
he
gripped
his
wand
tightly
in
his
hand
thrust
it
out
in
front
of
him
and
threw
himself
around
the
headstone
facing
Voldemort
voldemort
was
ready
as
Harry
shouted
Expelliarmus
voldemort
cried
Avada
Kedavra
a
jet
of
green
light
issued
from
Voldemorts
wand
just
as
a
jet
of
red
light
blasted
from
harry's
they
met
in
midair
and
suddenly
harry's
wand
was
vibrating
as
though
an
electric
charge
were
surging
through
it
his
hand
seized
up
around
it
he
couldn't
have
released
it
if
he'd
wanted
to
and
a
narrow
beam
of
light
connected
the
two
wands
neither
red
nor
green
but
bright
deep
gold
harry
following
the
beam
with
his
astonished
gaze
saw
that
voldemort's
long
white
fingers
too
were
gripping
a
wand
that
was
shaking
and
vibrating
and
then
nothing
could
have
prepared
Harry
for
this
he
felt
his
feet
lift
from
the
ground
he
and
Voldemort
were
both
being
raised
into
the
air
their
wands
still
connected
by
that
thread
of
shimmering
golden
light
they
glided
away
from
the
tombstone
of
voldemort's
father
and
then
came
to
rest
on
a
patch
of
ground
that
was
clear
and
free
of
graves
the
Death
Eaters
were
shouting
they
were
asking
Voldemort
for
instructions
they
were
closing
in
reforming
the
circle
around
Harry
and
Voldemort
the
snake
slithering
at
their
heels
some
of
them
drawing
their
wands
The
golden
thread
connecting
Harry
and
Voldemort
splintered
though
the
wands
remained
connected
a
thousand
more
beams
arced
high
over
Harry
and
Voldemort
crisscrossing
all
around
them
until
they
were
enclosed
in
a
golden
domeshaped
web
a
cage
of
light
beyond
which
the
Death
Eaters
circled
like
jackals
their
cries
strangely
muffled
now
do
nothing
voldemort
shrieked
to
the
Death
Eaters
and
Harry
saw
his
red
eyes
wide
with
astonishment
at
what
was
happening
saw
him
fighting
to
break
the
thread
of
light
still
connecting
his
wand
with
harry's
Harry
held
onto
his
wand
more
tightly
with
both
hands
and
the
golden
thread
remained
unbroken
do
nothing
unless
I
command
you
voldemort
shouted
to
the
Death
Eaters
and
then
an
unearthly
and
beautiful
sound
filled
the
air
it
was
coming
from
every
thread
of
the
lightspun
web
vibrating
around
Harry
and
Voldemort
it
was
a
sound
Harry
recognized
though
he
had
heard
it
only
once
before
in
his
life
phoenix
song
it
was
the
sound
of
hope
to
Harry
the
most
beautiful
and
welcome
thing
he
had
ever
heard
in
his
life
he
felt
as
though
the
song
were
inside
him
instead
of
just
around
him
it
was
the
sound
he
connected
with
Dumbledore
and
it
was
almost
as
though
a
friend
were
speaking
in
his
ear
don't
break
the
connection
i
know
harry
told
the
music
I
know
I
mustn't
but
no
sooner
had
he
thought
it
than
the
thing
became
much
harder
to
do
his
wand
began
to
vibrate
more
powerfully
than
ever
and
now
the
beam
between
him
and
Voldemort
changed
too
it
was
as
though
large
beads
of
light
were
sliding
up
and
down
the
thread
connecting
the
wands
Harry
felt
his
wand
give
a
shudder
under
his
hand
as
the
light
beads
began
to
slide
slowly
and
steadily
his
way
the
direction
of
the
beams
movement
was
now
toward
him
from
Voldemort
and
he
felt
his
wand
shudder
angrily
as
the
closest
bead
of
light
moved
nearer
to
Harrys
wand
tip
the
wood
beneath
his
fingers
grew
so
hot
he
feared
it
would
burst
into
flame
the
closer
that
bead
moved
the
harder
harry's
wand
vibrated
he
was
sure
his
wand
would
not
survive
contact
with
it
it
felt
as
though
it
was
about
to
shatter
under
his
fingers
He
concentrated
every
last
particle
of
his
mind
upon
forcing
the
bead
back
toward
Voldemort
his
ears
full
of
phoenix
song
his
eyes
furious
fixed
and
slowly
very
slowly
the
beads
quivered
to
a
halt
and
then
just
as
slowly
they
began
to
move
the
other
way
and
it
was
voldemort's
wand
that
was
vibrating
extrahard
now
voldemort
who
looked
astonished
and
almost
fearful
one
of
the
beads
of
light
was
quivering
inches
from
the
tip
of
Voldemorts
wand
harry
didn't
understand
why
he
was
doing
it
didn't
know
what
it
might
achieve
but
he
now
concentrated
as
he
had
never
done
in
his
life
on
forcing
that
bead
of
light
right
back
into
Voldemort
s
wand
and
slowly
very
slowly
it
moved
along
the
golden
thread
it
trembled
for
a
moment
and
then
it
connected
at
once
Voldemorts
wand
began
to
emit
echoing
screams
of
pain
then
voldemort's
red
eyes
widened
with
shock
a
dense
smoky
hand
flew
out
of
the
tip
of
it
and
vanished
the
ghost
of
the
hand
he
had
made
Wormtail
more
shouts
of
pain
and
then
something
much
larger
began
to
blossom
from
Voldemorts
wand
tip
a
great
grayish
something
that
looked
as
though
it
were
made
of
the
solidest
densest
smoke
it
was
a
head
now
a
chest
and
arms
the
torso
of
Cedric
Diggory
if
ever
Harry
might
have
released
his
wand
from
shock
it
would
have
been
then
but
instinct
kept
him
clutching
his
wand
tightly
so
that
the
thread
of
golden
light
remained
unbroken
even
though
the
thick
gray
ghost
of
Cedric
Diggory
was
it
a
ghost
it
looked
so
solid
emerged
in
its
entirety
from
the
end
of
Voldemort
s
wand
as
though
it
were
squeezing
itself
out
of
a
very
narrow
tunnel
and
this
shade
of
Cedric
stood
up
and
looked
up
and
down
the
golden
thread
of
light
and
spoke
hold
on
harry
it
said
its
voice
was
distant
and
echoing
harry
looked
at
Voldemort
his
wide
red
eyes
were
still
shocked
he
had
no
more
expected
this
than
Harry
had
and
very
dimly
harry
heard
the
frightened
yells
of
the
Death
Eaters
prowling
around
the
edges
of
the
golden
dome
more
screams
of
pain
from
the
wand
and
then
something
else
emerged
from
its
tip
the
dense
shadow
of
a
second
head
quickly
followed
by
arms
and
torso
an
old
man
Harry
had
seen
only
in
a
dream
was
now
pushing
himself
out
of
the
end
of
the
wand
just
as
Cedric
had
done
and
his
ghost
or
his
shadow
or
whatever
it
was
fell
next
to
cedric's
and
surveyed
Harry
and
Voldemort
and
the
golden
web
and
the
connected
wands
with
mild
surprise
leaning
on
his
walking
stick
he
was
a
real
wizard
then
the
old
man
said
his
eyes
on
Voldemort
killed
me
that
one
did
you
fight
him
boy
but
already
yet
another
head
was
emerging
and
this
head
gray
as
a
smoky
statue
was
a
woman's
harry
both
arms
shaking
now
as
he
fought
to
keep
his
wand
still
saw
her
drop
to
the
ground
and
straighten
up
like
the
others
staring
the
shadow
of
Bertha
Jorkins
surveyed
the
battle
before
her
with
wide
eyes
don't
let
go
now
she
cried
and
her
voice
echoed
like
Cedrics
as
though
from
very
far
away
don't
let
him
get
you
Harry
don't
let
go
she
and
the
other
two
shadowy
figures
began
to
pace
around
the
inner
walls
of
the
golden
web
while
the
Death
Eaters
flitted
around
the
outside
of
it
and
voldemort's
dead
victims
whispered
as
they
circled
the
duelers
whispered
words
of
encouragement
to
Harry
and
hissed
words
Harry
couldn't
hear
to
Voldemort
and
now
another
head
was
emerging
from
the
tip
of
Voldemorts
wand
and
Harry
knew
when
he
saw
it
who
it
would
be
he
knew
as
though
he
had
expected
it
from
the
moment
when
Cedric
had
appeared
from
the
wand
knew
because
the
man
appearing
was
the
one
he'd
thought
of
more
than
any
other
tonight
the
smoky
shadow
of
a
tall
man
with
untidy
hair
fell
to
the
ground
as
Bertha
had
done
straightened
up
and
looked
at
him
and
Harry
his
arms
shaking
madly
now
looked
back
into
the
ghostly
face
of
his
father
your
mother's
coming
he
said
quietly
she
wants
to
see
you
it
will
be
all
right
hold
on
and
she
came
first
her
head
then
her
body
a
young
woman
with
long
hair
the
smoky
shadowy
form
of
Lily
Potter
blossomed
from
the
end
of
voldemort's
wand
fell
to
the
ground
and
straightened
like
her
husband
she
walked
close
to
Harry
looking
down
at
him
and
she
spoke
in
the
same
distant
echoing
voice
as
the
others
but
quietly
so
that
Voldemort
his
face
now
livid
with
fear
as
his
victims
prowled
around
him
could
not
hear
when
the
connection
is
broken
we
will
linger
for
only
moments
but
we
will
give
you
time
you
must
get
to
the
Portkey
it
will
return
you
to
Hogwarts
do
you
understand
Harry
yes
Harry
gasped
fighting
now
to
keep
a
hold
on
his
wand
which
was
slipping
and
sliding
beneath
his
fingers
harry
whispered
the
figure
of
Cedric
take
my
body
back
will
you
take
my
body
back
to
my
parents
i
will
said
Harry
his
face
screwed
up
with
the
effort
of
holding
the
wand
do
it
now
whispered
his
father's
voice
be
ready
to
run
do
it
now
now
harry
yelled
he
didn't
think
he
could
have
held
on
for
another
moment
anyway
he
pulled
his
wand
upward
with
an
almighty
wrench
and
the
golden
thread
broke
the
cage
of
light
vanished
the
phoenix
song
died
but
the
shadowy
figures
of
voldemort's
victims
did
not
disappear
they
were
closing
in
upon
Voldemort
shielding
Harry
from
his
gaze
And
Harry
ran
as
he
had
never
run
in
his
life
knocking
two
stunned
Death
Eaters
aside
as
he
passed
he
zigzagged
behind
headstones
feeling
their
curses
following
him
hearing
them
hit
the
headstones
he
was
dodging
curses
and
graves
pelting
toward
cedric's
body
no
longer
aware
of
the
pain
in
his
leg
his
whole
being
concentrated
on
what
he
had
to
do
Stun
him
he
heard
Voldemort
scream
ten
feet
from
Cedric
Harry
dived
behind
a
marble
angel
to
avoid
the
jets
of
red
light
and
saw
the
tip
of
its
wing
shatter
as
the
spells
hit
it
gripping
his
wand
more
tightly
he
dashed
out
from
behind
the
angel
Impedimenta
he
bellowed
pointing
his
wand
wildly
over
his
shoulder
at
the
Death
Eaters
running
at
him
from
a
muffled
yell
he
thought
he
had
stopped
at
least
one
of
them
but
there
was
no
time
to
stop
and
look
he
jumped
over
the
cup
and
dived
as
he
heard
more
wand
blasts
behind
him
more
jets
of
light
flew
over
his
head
as
he
fell
stretching
out
his
hand
to
grab
cedric's
arm
stand
aside
i
will
kill
him
he
is
mine
shrieked
Voldemort
harry's
hand
had
closed
on
cedric's
wrist
one
tombstone
stood
between
him
and
Voldemort
but
Cedric
was
too
heavy
to
carry
and
the
cup
was
out
of
reach
voldemort's
red
eyes
flamed
in
the
darkness
harry
saw
his
mouth
curl
into
a
smile
saw
him
raise
his
wand
accio
harry
yelled
pointing
his
wand
at
the
Triwizard
Cup
it
flew
into
the
air
and
soared
toward
him
harry
caught
it
by
the
handle
He
heard
Voldemort
s
scream
of
fury
at
the
same
moment
that
he
felt
the
jerk
behind
his
navel
that
meant
the
Portkey
had
worked
it
was
speeding
him
away
in
a
whirl
of
wind
and
color
and
Cedric
along
with
him
they
were
going
back
chapter
thirtyfive
veritaserum
harry
felt
himself
slam
flat
into
the
ground
his
face
was
pressed
into
grass
the
smell
of
it
filled
his
nostrils
he
had
closed
his
eyes
while
the
Portkey
transported
him
and
he
kept
them
closed
now
he
did
not
move
all
the
breath
seemed
to
have
been
knocked
out
of
him
his
head
was
swimming
so
badly
he
felt
as
though
the
ground
beneath
him
were
swaying
like
the
deck
of
a
ship
to
hold
himself
steady
he
tightened
his
hold
on
the
two
things
he
was
still
clutching
the
smooth
cold
handle
of
the
Triwizard
Cup
and
cedric's
body
he
felt
as
though
he
would
slide
away
into
the
blackness
gathering
at
the
edges
of
his
brain
if
he
let
go
of
either
of
them
shock
and
exhaustion
kept
him
on
the
ground
breathing
in
the
smell
of
the
grass
waiting
waiting
for
someone
to
do
something
something
to
happen
and
all
the
while
his
scar
burned
dully
on
his
forehead
a
torrent
of
sound
deafened
and
confused
him
there
were
voices
everywhere
footsteps
screams
he
remained
where
he
was
his
face
screwed
up
against
the
noise
as
though
it
were
a
nightmare
that
would
pass
then
a
pair
of
hands
seized
him
roughly
and
turned
him
over
harry
harry
he
opened
his
eyes
he
was
looking
up
at
the
starry
sky
and
Albus
Dumbledore
was
crouched
over
him
the
dark
shadows
of
a
crowd
of
people
pressed
in
around
them
pushing
nearer
Harry
felt
the
ground
beneath
his
head
reverberating
with
their
footsteps
he
had
come
back
to
the
edge
of
the
maze
he
could
see
the
stands
rising
above
him
the
shapes
of
people
moving
in
them
the
stars
above
harry
let
go
of
the
cup
but
he
clutched
Cedric
to
him
even
more
tightly
he
raised
his
free
hand
and
seized
dumbledore's
wrist
while
dumbledore's
face
swam
in
and
out
of
focus
he's
back
Harry
whispered
he's
back
voldemort
what's
going
on
what's
happened
the
face
of
Cornelius
Fudge
appeared
upside
down
over
Harry
it
looked
white
appalled
my
God
Diggory
it
whispered
dumbledore
he's
dead
the
words
were
repeated
the
shadowy
figures
pressing
in
on
them
gasped
it
to
those
around
them
and
then
others
shouted
it
screeched
it
into
the
night
he's
dead
he's
dead
cedric
Diggory
dead
harry
let
go
of
him
he
heard
fudge's
voice
say
and
he
felt
fingers
trying
to
pry
him
from
cedric's
limp
body
but
Harry
wouldn't
let
him
go
then
dumbledore's
face
which
was
still
blurred
and
misted
came
closer
harry
you
can't
help
him
now
it's
over
let
go
he
wanted
me
to
bring
him
back
Harry
muttered
it
seemed
important
to
explain
this
he
wanted
me
to
bring
him
back
to
his
parents
that's
right
harry
just
let
go
now
dumbledore
bent
down
and
with
extraordinary
strength
for
a
man
so
old
and
thin
raised
Harry
from
the
ground
and
set
him
on
his
feet
harry
swayed
his
head
was
pounding
his
injured
leg
would
no
longer
support
his
weight
the
crowd
around
them
jostled
fighting
to
get
closer
pressing
darkly
in
on
him
what's
happened
what's
wrong
with
him
diggorys
dead
he'll
need
to
go
to
the
hospital
wing
fudge
was
saying
loudly
he's
ill
he's
injured
Dumbledore
diggory's
parents
they're
here
they're
in
the
stands
i'll
take
Harry
Dumbledore
i'll
take
him
no
I
would
prefer
dumbledore
Amos
Diggorys
running
he's
coming
over
don't
you
think
you
should
tell
him
before
he
sees
harry
stay
here
girls
were
screaming
sobbing
hysterically
the
scene
flickered
oddly
before
harry's
eyes
its
all
right
son
i've
got
you
come
on
hospital
wing
dumbledore
said
stay
said
Harry
thickly
the
pounding
in
his
scar
making
him
feel
as
though
he
was
about
to
throw
up
his
vision
was
blurring
worse
than
ever
you
need
to
lie
down
come
on
now
someone
larger
and
stronger
than
he
was
was
half
pulling
half
carrying
him
through
the
frightened
crowd
harry
heard
people
gasping
screaming
and
shouting
as
the
man
supporting
him
pushed
a
path
through
them
taking
him
back
to
the
castle
across
the
lawn
past
the
lake
and
the
Durmstrang
ship
Harry
heard
nothing
but
the
heavy
breathing
of
the
man
helping
him
walk
what
happened
harry
the
man
asked
at
last
as
he
lifted
Harry
up
the
stone
steps
clunk
clunk
clunk
it
was
MadEye
Moody
cup
was
a
Portkey
said
Harry
as
they
crossed
the
entrance
hall
took
me
and
Cedric
to
a
graveyard
and
Voldemort
was
there
lord
Voldemort
clunk
clunk
clunk
up
the
marble
stairs
the
Dark
Lord
was
there
what
happened
then
killed
Cedric
they
killed
Cedric
and
then
clunk
clunk
clunk
along
the
corridor
made
a
potion
got
his
body
back
the
Dark
Lord
got
his
body
back
he's
returned
and
the
Death
Eaters
came
and
then
we
dueled
you
dueled
with
the
Dark
Lord
got
away
my
wand
did
something
funny
i
saw
my
mum
and
dad
they
came
out
of
his
wand
in
here
harry
in
here
and
sit
down
you'll
be
all
right
now
drink
this
harry
heard
a
key
scrape
in
a
lock
and
felt
a
cup
being
pushed
into
his
hands
drink
it
you'll
feel
better
come
on
now
harry
I
need
to
know
exactly
what
happened
moody
helped
tip
the
stuff
down
Harrys
throat
he
coughed
a
peppery
taste
burning
his
throat
moody's
office
came
into
sharper
focus
and
so
did
Moody
himself
he
looked
as
white
as
Fudge
had
looked
and
both
eyes
were
fixed
unblinkingly
upon
harry's
face
voldemort's
back
Harry
you're
sure
he's
back
how
did
he
do
it
he
took
stuff
from
his
father's
grave
and
from
Wormtail
and
me
said
Harry
his
head
felt
clearer
his
scar
wasn't
hurting
so
badly
he
could
now
see
Moodys
face
distinctly
even
though
the
office
was
dark
he
could
still
hear
screaming
and
shouting
from
the
distant
Quidditch
field
what
did
the
Dark
Lord
take
from
you
said
Moody
blood
said
Harry
raising
his
arm
his
sleeve
was
ripped
where
wormtail's
dagger
had
torn
it
moody
let
out
his
breath
in
a
long
low
hiss
and
the
Death
Eaters
they
returned
yes
said
Harry
loads
of
them
how
did
he
treat
them
moody
asked
quietly
did
he
forgive
them
but
Harry
had
suddenly
remembered
he
should
have
told
Dumbledore
he
should
have
said
it
straightaway
there's
a
Death
Eater
at
Hogwarts
there's
a
Death
Eater
here
they
put
my
name
in
the
Goblet
of
Fire
they
made
sure
I
got
through
to
the
end
harry
tried
to
get
up
but
Moody
pushed
him
back
down
i
know
who
the
Death
Eater
is
he
said
quietly
karkaroff
said
Harry
wildly
where
is
he
have
you
got
him
is
he
locked
up
karkaroff
said
Moody
with
an
odd
laugh
karkaroff
fled
tonight
when
he
felt
the
Dark
Mark
burn
upon
his
arm
he
betrayed
too
many
faithful
supporters
of
the
Dark
Lord
to
wish
to
meet
them
but
I
doubt
he
will
get
far
the
Dark
Lord
has
ways
of
tracking
his
enemies
karkaroff's
gone
he
ran
away
but
then
he
didn't
put
my
name
in
the
goblet
no
said
Moody
slowly
no
he
didn't
it
was
I
who
did
that
harry
heard
but
didn't
believe
no
you
didn't
he
said
you
didn't
do
that
you
can't
have
done
i
assure
you
I
did
said
Moody
and
his
magical
eye
swung
around
and
fixed
upon
the
door
and
Harry
knew
he
was
making
sure
that
there
was
no
one
outside
it
at
the
same
time
Moody
drew
out
his
wand
and
pointed
it
at
Harry
he
forgave
them
then
he
said
the
Death
Eaters
who
went
free
the
ones
who
escaped
Azkaban
what
said
Harry
he
was
looking
at
the
wand
Moody
was
pointing
at
him
this
was
a
bad
joke
it
had
to
be
i
asked
you
said
Moody
quietly
whether
he
forgave
the
scum
who
never
even
went
to
look
for
him
those
treacherous
cowards
who
wouldn't
even
brave
Azkaban
for
him
the
faithless
worthless
bits
of
filth
who
were
brave
enough
to
cavort
in
masks
at
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
but
fled
at
the
sight
of
the
Dark
Mark
when
I
fired
it
into
the
sky
you
fired
what
are
you
talking
about
i
told
you
harry
i
told
you
if
there's
one
thing
I
hate
more
than
any
other
it's
a
Death
Eater
who
walked
free
they
turned
their
backs
on
my
master
when
he
needed
them
most
i
expected
him
to
punish
them
i
expected
him
to
torture
them
tell
me
he
hurt
them
Harry
moody's
face
was
suddenly
lit
with
an
insane
smile
tell
me
he
told
them
that
I
I
alone
remained
faithful
prepared
to
risk
everything
to
deliver
to
him
the
one
thing
he
wanted
above
all
you
you
didn't
it
it
can't
be
you
who
put
your
name
in
the
Goblet
of
Fire
under
the
name
of
a
different
school
i
did
who
frightened
off
every
person
I
thought
might
try
to
hurt
you
or
prevent
you
from
winning
the
tournament
i
did
who
nudged
Hagrid
into
showing
you
the
dragons
i
did
who
helped
you
see
the
only
way
you
could
beat
the
dragon
i
did
moody's
magical
eye
had
now
left
the
door
it
was
fixed
upon
Harry
his
lopsided
mouth
leered
more
widely
than
ever
it
hasn't
been
easy
Harry
guiding
you
through
these
tasks
without
arousing
suspicion
i
have
had
to
use
every
ounce
of
cunning
I
possess
so
that
my
hand
would
not
be
detectable
in
your
success
dumbledore
would
have
been
very
suspicious
if
you
had
managed
everything
too
easily
as
long
as
you
got
into
that
maze
preferably
with
a
decent
head
start
then
I
knew
I
would
have
a
chance
of
getting
rid
of
the
other
champions
and
leaving
your
way
clear
but
I
also
had
to
contend
with
your
stupidity
the
second
task
that
was
when
I
was
most
afraid
we
would
fail
i
was
keeping
watch
on
you
Potter
i
knew
you
hadn't
worked
out
the
egg's
clue
so
I
had
to
give
you
another
hint
you
didn't
Harry
said
hoarsely
cedric
gave
me
the
clue
who
told
Cedric
to
open
it
underwater
i
did
i
trusted
that
he
would
pass
the
information
on
to
you
decent
people
are
so
easy
to
manipulate
Potter
i
was
sure
Cedric
would
want
to
repay
you
for
telling
him
about
the
dragons
and
so
he
did
but
even
then
Potter
even
then
you
seemed
likely
to
fail
i
was
watching
all
the
time
all
those
hours
in
the
library
didn't
you
realize
that
the
book
you
needed
was
in
your
dormitory
all
along
i
planted
it
there
early
on
I
gave
it
to
the
Longbottom
boy
don't
you
remember
magical
Water
Plants
of
the
Mediterranean
it
would
have
told
you
all
you
needed
to
know
about
gillyweed
i
expected
you
to
ask
everyone
and
anyone
you
could
for
help
longbottom
would
have
told
you
in
an
instant
but
you
did
not
you
did
not
you
have
a
streak
of
pride
and
independence
that
might
have
ruined
all
so
what
could
I
do
feed
you
information
from
another
innocent
source
you
told
me
at
the
Yule
Ball
a
houseelf
called
Dobby
had
given
you
a
Christmas
present
i
called
the
elf
to
the
staffroom
to
collect
some
robes
for
cleaning
i
staged
a
loud
conversation
with
Professor
McGonagall
about
the
hostages
who
had
been
taken
and
whether
Potter
would
think
to
use
gillyweed
and
your
little
elf
friend
ran
straight
to
snape's
office
and
then
hurried
to
find
you
moodys
wand
was
still
pointing
directly
at
harry's
heart
over
his
shoulder
foggy
shapes
were
moving
in
the
FoeGlass
on
the
wall
you
were
so
long
in
that
lake
Potter
I
thought
you
had
drowned
but
luckily
Dumbledore
took
your
idiocy
for
nobility
and
marked
you
high
for
it
i
breathed
again
you
had
an
easier
time
of
it
than
you
should
have
in
that
maze
tonight
of
course
said
Moody
i
was
patrolling
around
it
able
to
see
through
the
outer
hedges
able
to
curse
many
obstacles
out
of
your
way
i
Stunned
Fleur
Delacour
as
she
passed
i
put
the
Imperius
Curse
on
Krum
so
that
he
would
finish
Diggory
and
leave
your
path
to
the
cup
clear
harry
stared
at
Moody
he
just
didn't
see
how
this
could
be
dumbledore's
friend
the
famous
Auror
the
one
who
had
caught
so
many
Death
Eaters
it
made
no
sense
no
sense
at
all
the
foggy
shapes
in
the
FoeGlass
were
sharpening
had
become
more
distinct
harry
could
see
the
outlines
of
three
people
over
moody's
shoulder
moving
closer
and
closer
but
Moody
wasn't
watching
them
his
magical
eye
was
upon
Harry
the
Dark
Lord
didn't
manage
to
kill
you
potter
and
he
so
wanted
to
whispered
Moody
imagine
how
he
will
reward
me
when
he
finds
I
have
done
it
for
him
i
gave
you
to
him
the
thing
he
needed
above
all
to
regenerate
and
then
I
killed
you
for
him
i
will
be
honored
beyond
all
other
Death
Eaters
i
will
be
his
dearest
his
closest
supporter
closer
than
a
son
moody's
normal
eye
was
bulging
the
magical
eye
fixed
upon
Harry
the
door
was
barred
and
Harry
knew
he
would
never
reach
his
own
wand
in
time
the
Dark
Lord
and
I
said
Moody
and
he
looked
completely
insane
now
towering
over
Harry
leering
down
at
him
have
much
in
common
both
of
us
for
instance
had
very
disappointing
fathers
very
disappointing
indeed
both
of
us
suffered
the
indignity
Harry
of
being
named
after
those
fathers
and
both
of
us
had
the
pleasure
the
very
great
pleasure
of
killing
our
fathers
to
ensure
the
continued
rise
of
the
Dark
Order
you're
mad
Harry
said
he
couldn't
stop
himself
you're
mad
mad
am
I
said
Moody
his
voice
rising
uncontrollably
we'll
see
we'll
see
who's
mad
now
that
the
Dark
Lord
has
returned
with
me
at
his
side
he
is
back
Harry
Potter
you
did
not
conquer
him
and
now
I
conquer
you
moody
raised
his
wand
he
opened
his
mouth
Harry
plunged
his
own
hand
into
his
robes
Stupefy
there
was
a
blinding
flash
of
red
light
and
with
a
great
splintering
and
crashing
the
door
of
moody's
office
was
blasted
apart
Moody
was
thrown
backward
onto
the
office
floor
harry
still
staring
at
the
place
where
moody's
face
had
been
saw
Albus
Dumbledore
Professor
Snape
and
professor
McGonagall
looking
back
at
him
out
of
the
FoeGlass
he
looked
around
and
saw
the
three
of
them
standing
in
the
doorway
Dumbledore
in
front
his
wand
outstretched
at
that
moment
Harry
fully
understood
for
the
first
time
why
people
said
Dumbledore
was
the
only
wizard
Voldemort
had
ever
feared
the
look
upon
dumbledore's
face
as
he
stared
down
at
the
unconscious
form
of
MadEye
Moody
was
more
terrible
than
Harry
could
have
ever
imagined
there
was
no
benign
smile
upon
dumbledore's
face
no
twinkle
in
the
eyes
behind
the
spectacles
there
was
cold
fury
in
every
line
of
the
ancient
face
a
sense
of
power
radiated
from
Dumbledore
as
though
he
were
giving
off
burning
heat
he
stepped
into
the
office
placed
a
foot
underneath
Moodys
unconscious
body
and
kicked
him
over
onto
his
back
so
that
his
face
was
visible
snape
followed
him
looking
into
the
FoeGlass
where
his
own
face
was
still
visible
glaring
into
the
room
professor
McGonagall
went
straight
to
Harry
come
along
Potter
she
whispered
the
thin
line
of
her
mouth
was
twitching
as
though
she
was
about
to
cry
come
along
hospital
wing
no
said
Dumbledore
sharply
dumbledore
he
ought
to
look
at
him
he's
been
through
enough
tonight
he
will
stay
Minerva
because
he
needs
to
understand
said
Dumbledore
curtly
understanding
is
the
first
step
to
acceptance
and
only
with
acceptance
can
there
be
recovery
he
needs
to
know
who
has
put
him
through
the
ordeal
he
has
suffered
tonight
and
why
moody
Harry
said
he
was
still
in
a
state
of
complete
disbelief
how
can
it
have
been
Moody
this
is
not
Alastor
Moody
said
Dumbledore
quietly
you
have
never
known
Alastor
Moody
the
real
Moody
would
not
have
removed
you
from
my
sight
after
what
happened
tonight
the
moment
he
took
you
I
knew
and
I
followed
dumbledore
bent
down
over
moody's
limp
form
and
put
a
hand
inside
his
robes
he
pulled
out
moody's
hip
flask
and
a
set
of
keys
on
a
ring
then
he
turned
to
Professors
McGonagall
and
Snape
severus
please
fetch
me
the
strongest
Truth
Potion
you
possess
and
then
go
down
to
the
kitchens
and
bring
up
the
houseelf
called
Winky
minerva
kindly
go
down
to
hagrid's
house
where
you
will
find
a
large
black
dog
sitting
in
the
pumpkin
patch
take
the
dog
up
to
my
office
tell
him
I
will
be
with
him
shortly
then
come
back
here
if
either
Snape
or
McGonagall
found
these
instructions
peculiar
they
hid
their
confusion
both
turned
at
once
and
left
the
office
dumbledore
walked
over
to
the
trunk
with
seven
locks
fitted
the
first
key
in
the
lock
and
opened
it
it
contained
a
mass
of
spellbooks
dumbledore
closed
the
trunk
placed
a
second
key
in
the
second
lock
and
opened
the
trunk
again
the
spellbooks
had
vanished
this
time
it
contained
an
assortment
of
broken
Sneakoscopes
some
parchment
and
quills
and
what
looked
like
a
silvery
Invisibility
Cloak
harry
watched
astounded
as
Dumbledore
placed
the
third
fourth
fifth
and
sixth
keys
in
their
respective
locks
reopening
the
trunk
each
time
and
revealing
different
contents
each
time
then
he
placed
the
seventh
key
in
the
lock
threw
open
the
lid
and
Harry
let
out
a
cry
of
amazement
he
was
looking
down
into
a
kind
of
pit
an
underground
room
and
lying
on
the
floor
some
ten
feet
below
apparently
fast
asleep
thin
and
starved
in
appearance
was
the
real
MadEye
Moody
his
wooden
leg
was
gone
the
socket
that
should
have
held
the
magical
eye
looked
empty
beneath
its
lid
and
chunks
of
his
grizzled
hair
were
missing
harry
stared
thunderstruck
between
the
sleeping
Moody
in
the
trunk
and
the
unconscious
Moody
lying
on
the
floor
of
the
office
dumbledore
climbed
into
the
trunk
lowered
himself
and
fell
lightly
onto
the
floor
beside
the
sleeping
Moody
he
bent
over
him
stunned
controlled
by
the
Imperius
Curse
very
weak
he
said
of
course
they
would
have
needed
to
keep
him
alive
harry
throw
down
the
imposter's
cloak
he's
freezing
madam
Pomfrey
will
need
to
see
him
but
he
seems
in
no
immediate
danger
harry
did
as
he
was
told
Dumbledore
covered
Moody
in
the
cloak
tucked
it
around
him
and
clambered
out
of
the
trunk
again
then
he
picked
up
the
hip
flask
that
stood
upon
the
desk
unscrewed
it
and
turned
it
over
a
thick
glutinous
liquid
splattered
onto
the
office
floor
polyjuice
Potion
Harry
said
Dumbledore
you
see
the
simplicity
of
it
and
the
brilliance
for
Moody
never
does
drink
except
from
his
hip
flask
he's
well
known
for
it
the
imposter
needed
of
course
to
keep
the
real
Moody
close
by
so
that
he
could
continue
making
the
potion
you
see
his
hair
dumbledore
looked
down
on
the
Moody
in
the
trunk
the
imposter
has
been
cutting
it
off
all
year
see
where
it
is
uneven
but
I
think
in
the
excitement
of
tonight
our
fake
Moody
might
have
forgotten
to
take
it
as
frequendy
as
he
should
have
done
on
the
hour
every
hour
we
shall
see
dumbledore
pulled
out
the
chair
at
the
desk
and
sat
down
upon
it
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
unconscious
Moody
on
the
floor
harry
stared
at
him
too
minutes
passed
in
silence
then
before
harry's
very
eyes
the
face
of
the
man
on
the
floor
began
to
change
the
scars
were
disappearing
the
skin
was
becoming
smooth
the
mangled
nose
became
whole
and
started
to
shrink
the
long
mane
of
grizzled
gray
hair
was
withdrawing
into
the
scalp
and
turning
the
color
of
straw
suddenly
with
a
loud
clunk
the
wooden
leg
fell
away
as
a
normal
leg
regrew
in
its
place
next
moment
the
magical
eyeball
had
popped
out
of
the
man's
face
as
a
real
eye
replaced
it
it
rolled
away
across
the
floor
and
continued
to
swivel
in
every
direction
harry
saw
a
man
lying
before
him
paleskinned
slightly
freckled
with
a
mop
of
fair
hair
he
knew
who
he
was
he
had
seen
him
in
dumbledore's
Pensieve
had
watched
him
being
led
away
from
court
by
the
dementors
trying
to
convince
Mr
crouch
that
he
was
innocent
but
he
was
lined
around
the
eyes
now
and
looked
much
older
there
were
hurried
footsteps
outside
in
the
corridor
snape
had
returned
with
Winky
at
his
heels
professor
McGonagall
was
right
behind
them
crouch
snape
said
stopping
dead
in
the
doorway
barty
Crouch
good
heavens
said
Professor
McGonagall
stopping
dead
and
staring
down
at
the
man
on
the
floor
filthy
disheveled
Winky
peered
around
snape's
legs
her
mouth
opened
wide
and
she
let
out
a
piercing
shriek
master
Barty
Master
Barty
what
is
you
doing
here
she
flung
herself
forward
onto
the
young
man's
chest
you
is
killed
him
you
is
killed
him
you
is
killed
master's
son
he
is
simply
Stunned
Winky
said
Dumbledore
step
aside
please
severus
you
have
the
potion
snape
handed
Dumbledore
a
small
glass
bottle
of
completely
clear
liquid
the
Veritaserum
with
which
he
had
threatened
Harry
in
class
dumbledore
got
up
bent
over
the
man
on
the
floor
and
pulled
him
into
a
sitting
position
against
the
wall
beneath
the
FoeGlass
in
which
the
reflections
of
Dumbledore
Snape
and
McGonagall
were
still
glaring
down
upon
them
all
winky
remained
on
her
knees
trembling
her
hands
over
her
face
dumbledore
forced
the
mans
mouth
open
and
poured
three
drops
inside
it
then
he
pointed
his
wand
at
the
mans
chest
and
said
Ennervate
crouch's
son
opened
his
eyes
his
face
was
slack
his
gaze
unfocused
dumbledore
knelt
before
him
so
that
their
faces
were
level
can
you
hear
me
dumbledore
asked
quietly
the
man's
eyelids
flickered
yes
he
muttered
i
would
like
you
to
tell
us
said
Dumbledore
softly
how
you
came
to
be
here
how
did
you
escape
from
Azkaban
crouch
took
a
deep
shuddering
breath
then
began
to
speak
in
a
flat
expressionless
voice
my
mother
saved
me
she
knew
she
was
dying
she
persuaded
my
father
to
rescue
me
as
a
last
favor
to
her
he
loved
her
as
he
had
never
loved
me
he
agreed
they
came
to
visit
me
they
gave
me
a
draft
of
Polyjuice
Potion
containing
one
of
my
mother's
hairs
she
took
a
draft
of
Polyjuice
Potion
containing
one
of
my
hairs
we
took
on
each
other's
appearance
winky
was
shaking
her
head
trembling
say
no
more
master
Barty
say
no
more
you
is
getting
your
father
into
trouble
but
Crouch
took
another
deep
breath
and
continued
in
the
same
flat
voice
the
dementors
are
blind
they
sensed
one
healthy
one
dying
person
entering
Azkaban
they
sensed
one
healthy
one
dying
person
leaving
it
my
father
smuggled
me
out
disguised
as
my
mother
in
case
any
prisoners
were
watching
through
their
doors
my
mother
died
a
short
while
afterward
in
Azkaban
she
was
careful
to
drink
Polyjuice
Potion
until
the
end
she
was
buried
under
my
name
and
bearing
my
appearance
everyone
believed
her
to
be
me
the
man's
eyelids
flickered
and
what
did
your
father
do
with
you
when
he
had
got
you
home
said
Dumbledore
quietly
staged
my
mother's
death
a
quiet
private
funeral
that
grave
is
empty
the
houseelf
nursed
me
back
to
health
then
I
had
to
be
concealed
i
had
to
be
controlled
my
father
had
to
use
a
number
of
spells
to
subdue
me
when
I
had
recovered
my
strength
I
thought
only
of
finding
my
master
of
returning
to
his
service
how
did
your
father
subdue
you
said
Dumbledore
the
Imperius
Curse
Moody
said
i
was
under
my
fathers
control
i
was
forced
to
wear
an
Invisibility
Cloak
day
and
night
i
was
always
with
the
houseelf
she
was
my
keeper
and
caretaker
she
pitied
me
she
persuaded
my
father
to

Barty

Barty
sobbed
Winky
through
her
hands

them

trouble

discover
that

said
Dumbledore
softly
did
anyone
know
except
your
father
and
the
houseelf
yes
said
Crouch
his
eyelids
flickering
again
a
witch
in
my
father's
office
bertha
Jorkins
she
came
to
the
house
with
papers
for
my
father
s
signature
he
was
not
at
home
winky
showed
her
inside
and
returned
to
the
kitchen
to
me
but
Bertha
Jorkins
heard
Winky
talking
to
me
she
came
to
investigate
she
heard
enough
to
guess
who
was
hiding
under
the
Invisibility
Cloak
my
father
arrived
home
she
confronted
him
he
put
a
very
powerful
Memory
Charm
on
her
to
make
her
forget
what
she'd
found
out
too
powerful
he
said
it
damaged
her
memory
permanently
why
is
she
coming
to
nose
into
my
masters
private
business
sobbed
Winky
why
isn't
she
leaving
us
be
tell
me
about
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
said
Dumbledore
winky
talked
my
father
into
it
said
Crouch
still
in
the
same
monotonous
voice
she
spent
months
persuading
him
i
had
not
left
the
house
for
years
i
had
loved
Quidditch
let
him
go
she
said
he
will
be
in
his
Invisibility
Cloak
he
can
watch
let
him
smell
fresh
air
for
once
she
said
my
mother
would
have
wanted
it
she
told
my
father
that
my
mother
had
died
to
give
me
freedom
she
had
not
saved
me
for
a
life
of
imprisonment
he
agreed
in
the
end
it
was
carefully
planned
my
father
led
me
and
Winky
up
to
the
Top
Box
early
in
the
day
winky
was
to
say
that
she
was
saving
a
seat
for
my
father
i
was
to
sit
there
invisible
when
everyone
had
left
the
box
we
would
emerge
winky
would
appear
to
be
alone
nobody
would
ever
know
but
Winky
didn't
know
that
I
was
growing
stronger
i
was
starting
to
fight
my
father's
Imperius
Curse
there
were
times
when
I
was
almost
myself
again
there
were
brief
periods
when
I
seemed
outside
his
control
it
happened
there
in
the
Top
Box
it
was
like
waking
from
a
deep
sleep
i
found
myself
out
in
public
in
the
middle
of
the
match
and
I
saw
in
front
of
me
a
wand
sticking
out
of
a
boys
pocket
i
had
not
been
allowed
a
wand
since
before
Azkaban
i
stole
it
winky
didn't
know
winky
is
frightened
of
heights
she
had
her
face
hidden
master
Barty
you
bad
boy
whispered
Winky
tears
trickling
between
her
fingers
so
you
took
the
wand
said
Dumbledore
and
what
did
you
do
with
it
we
went
back
to
the
tent
said
Crouch
then
we
heard
them
we
heard
the
Death
Eaters
the
ones
who
had
never
been
to
Azkaban
the
ones
who
had
never
suffered
for
my
master
they
had
turned
their
backs
on
him
they
were
not
enslaved
as
I
was
they
were
free
to
seek
him
but
they
did
not
they
were
merely
making
sport
of
Muggles
the
sound
of
their
voices
awoke
me
my
mind
was
clearer
than
it
had
been
in
years
i
was
angry
i
had
the
wand
i
wanted
to
attack
them
for
their
disloyalty
to
my
master
my
father
had
left
the
tent
he
had
gone
to
free
the
Muggles
winky
was
afraid
to
see
me
so
angry
she
used
her
own
brand
of
magic
to
bind
me
to
her
she
pulled
me
from
the
tent
pulled
me
into
the
forest
away
from
the
Death
Eaters
i
tried
to
hold
her
back
i
wanted
to
return
to
the
campsite
i
wanted
to
show
those
Death
Eaters
what
loyalty
to
the
Dark
Lord
meant
and
to
punish
them
for
their
lack
of
it
i
used
the
stolen
wand
to
cast
the
Dark
Mark
into
the
sky
ministry
wizards
arrived
they
shot
Stunning
Spells
everywhere
one
of
the
spells
came
through
the
trees
where
Winky
and
I
stood
the
bond
connecting
us
was
broken
we
were
both
Stunned
when
Winky
was
discovered
my
father
knew
I
must
be
nearby
he
searched
the
bushes
where
she
had
been
found
and
felt
me
lying
there
he
waited
until
the
other
Ministry
members
had
left
the
forest
he
put
me
back
under
the
Imperius
Curse
and
took
me
home
he
dismissed
Winky
she
had
failed
him
she
had
let
me
acquire
a
wand
she
had
almost
let
me
escape
winky
let
out
a
wail
of
despair
now
it
was
just
Father
and
I
alone
in
the
house
and
then
and
then
crouch's
head
rolled
on
his
neck
and
an
insane
grin
spread
across
his
face
my
master
came
for
me
he
arrived
at
our
house
late
one
night
in
the
arms
of
his
servant
Wormtail
my
master
had
found
out
that
I
was
still
alive
he
had
captured
Bertha
Jorkins
in
Albania
he
had
tortured
her
she
told
him
a
great
deal
she
told
him
about
the
Triwizard
Tournament
she
told
him
the
old
Auror
Moody
was
going
to
teach
at
Hogwarts
he
tortured
her
until
he
broke
through
the
Memory
Charm
my
father
had
placed
upon
her
she
told
him
I
had
escaped
from
Azkaban
she
told
him
my
father
kept
me
imprisoned
to
prevent
me
from
seeking
my
master
and
so
my
master
knew
that
I
was
still
his
faithful
servant
perhaps
the
most
faithful
of
all
my
master
conceived
a
plan
based
upon
the
information
Bertha
had
given
him
he
needed
me
he
arrived
at
our
house
near
midnight
my
father
answered
the
door
the
smile
spread
wider
over
crouch's
face
as
though
recalling
the
sweetest
memory
of
his
life
winky's
petrified
brown
eyes
were
visible
through
her
fingers
she
seemed
too
appalled
to
speak
it
was
very
quick
my
father
was
placed
under
the
Imperius
Curse
by
my
master
now
my
father
was
the
one
imprisoned
controlled
my
master
forced
him
to
go
about
his
business
as
usual
to
act
as
though
nothing
was
wrong
and
I
was
released
i
awoke
i
was
myself
again
alive
as
I
hadn't
been
in
years
and
what
did
Lord
Voldemort
ask
you
to
do
said
Dumbledore
he
asked
me
whether
I
was
ready
to
risk
everything
for
him
i
was
ready
it
was
my
dream
my
greatest
ambition
to
serve
him
to
prove
myself
to
him
he
told
me
he
needed
to
place
a
faithful
servant
at
Hogwarts
a
servant
who
would
guide
Harry
Potter
through
the
Triwizard
Tournament
without
appearing
to
do
so
a
servant
who
would
watch
over
Harry
Potter
ensure
he
reached
the
Triwizard
Cup
turn
the
cup
into
a
Portkey
which
would
take
the
first
person
to
touch
it
to
my
master
but
first
you
needed
Alastor
Moody
said
Dumbledore
his
blue
eyes
were
blazing
though
his
voice
remained
calm
wormtail
and
I
did
it
we
had
prepared
the
Polyjuice
Potion
beforehand
we
journeyed
to
his
house
moody
put
up
a
struggle
there
was
a
commotion
we
managed
to
subdue
him
just
in
time
forced
him
into
a
compartment
of
his
own
magical
trunk
took
some
of
his
hair
and
added
it
to
the
potion
i
drank
it
I
became
moody's
double
i
took
his
leg
and
his
eye
i
was
ready
to
face
Arthur
Weasley
when
he
arrived
to
sort
out
the
Muggles
who
had
heard
a
disturbance
i
made
the
dustbins
move
around
the
yard
i
told
Arthur
Weasley
I
had
heard
intruders
in
my
yard
who
had
set
off
the
dustbins
then
I
packed
up
moody's
clothes
and
Dark
detectors
put
them
in
the
trunk
with
Moody
and
set
off
for
Hogwarts
i
kept
him
alive
under
the
Imperius
Curse
i
wanted
to
be
able
to
question
him
to
find
out
about
his
past
learn
his
habits
so
that
I
could
fool
even
Dumbledore
i
also
needed
his
hair
to
make
the
Polyjuice
Potion
the
other
ingredients
were
easy
i
stole
boomslang
skin
from
the
dungeons
when
the
Potions
master
found
me
in
his
office
I
said
I
was
under
orders
to
search
it
and
what
became
of
Wormtail
after
you
attacked
Moody
said
Dumbledore
wormtail
returned
to
care
for
my
master
in
my
father's
house
and
to
keep
watch
over
my
father
but
your
father
escaped
said
Dumbledore
yes
after
a
while
he
began
to
fight
the
Imperius
Curse
just
as
I
had
done
there
were
periods
when
he
knew
what
was
happening
my
master
decided
it
was
no
longer
safe
for
my
father
to
leave
the
house
he
forced
him
to
send
letters
to
the
Ministry
instead
he
made
him
write
and
say
he
was
ill
but
Wormtail
neglected
his
duty
he
was
not
watchful
enough
my
father
escaped
my
master
guessed
that
he
was
heading
for
Hogwarts
my
father
was
going
to
tell
Dumbledore
everything
to
confess
he
was
going
to
admit
that
he
had
smuggled
me
from
Azkaban
my
master
sent
me
word
of
my
father's
escape
he
told
me
to
stop
him
at
all
costs
so
I
waited
and
watched
i
used
the
map
I
had
taken
from
Harry
Potter
the
map
that
had
almost
ruined
everything
map
said
Dumbledore
quickly
what
map
is
this
potter's
map
of
Hogwarts
potter
saw
me
on
it
potter
saw
me
stealing
more
ingredients
for
the
Polyjuice
Potion
from
snape's
office
one
night
he
thought
I
was
my
father
we
have
the
same
first
name
i
took
the
map
from
Potter
that
night
i
told
him
my
father
hated
Dark
wizards
potter
believed
my
father
was
after
Snape
for
a
week
I
waited
for
my
father
to
arrive
at
Hogwarts
at
last
one
evening
the
map
showed
my
father
entering
the
grounds
i
pulled
on
my
Invisibility
Cloak
and
went
down
to
meet
him
he
was
walking
around
the
edge
of
the
forest
then
Potter
came
and
Krum
i
waited
i
could
not
hurt
Potter
my
master
needed
him
potter
ran
to
get
Dumbledore
i
Stunned
Krum
i
killed
my
father
noooo
wailed
Winky
master
Barty
Master
Barty
what
is
you
saying
you
killed
your
father
Dumbledore
said
in
the
same
soft
voice
what
did
you
do
with
the
body
carried
it
into
the
forest
covered
it
with
the
Invisibility
Cloak
i
had
the
map
with
me
i
watched
Potter
run
into
the
castle
he
met
Snape
dumbledore
joined
them
i
watched
Potter
bringing
Dumbledore
out
of
the
castle
i
walked
back
out
of
the
forest
doubled
around
behind
them
went
to
meet
them
i
told
Dumbledore
Snape
had
told
me
where
to
come
dumbledore
told
me
to
go
and
look
for
my
father
i
went
back
to
my
father's
body
watched
the
map
when
everyone
was
gone
I
Transfigured
my
father's
body
he
became
a
bone
i
buried
it
while
wearing
the
Invisibility
Cloak
in
the
freshly
dug
earth
in
front
of
hagrid's
cabin
there
was
complete
silence
now
except
for
winky's
continued
sobs
then
Dumbledore
said
And
tonight
i
offered
to
carry
the
Triwizard
Cup
into
the
maze
before
dinner
whispered
Barty
Crouch
turned
it
into
a
Portkey
my
master's
plan
worked
he
is
returned
to
power
and
I
will
be
honored
by
him
beyond
the
dreams
of
wizards
the
insane
smile
lit
his
features
once
more
and
his
head
drooped
onto
his
shoulder
as
Winky
wailed
and
sobbed
at
his
side
chapter
thirtysix
the
parting
of
the
ways
dumbledore
stood
up
he
stared
down
at
Barty
Crouch
for
a
moment
with
disgust
on
his
face
then
he
raised
his
wand
once
more
and
ropes
flew
out
of
it
ropes
that
twisted
themselves
around
Barty
Crouch
binding
him
tightly
he
turned
to
Professor
McGonagall
minerva
could
I
ask
you
to
stand
guard
here
while
I
take
Harry
upstairs
of
course
said
Professor
McGonagall
she
looked
slightly
nauseous
as
though
she
had
just
watched
someone
being
sick
however
when
she
drew
out
her
wand
and
pointed
it
at
Barty
Crouch
her
hand
was
quite
steady
severus
Dumbledore
turned
to
Snape
please
tell
Madam
Pomfrey
to
come
down
here
we
need
to
get
Alastor
Moody
into
the
hospital
wing
then
go
down
into
the
grounds
find
Cornelius
Fudge
and
bring
him
up
to
this
office
he
will
undoubtedly
want
to
question
Crouch
himself
tell
him
I
will
be
in
the
hospital
wing
in
half
an
hour's
time
if
he
needs
me
snape
nodded
silently
and
swept
out
of
the
room
harry
dumbledore
said
gently
harry
got
up
and
swayed
again
the
pain
in
his
leg
which
he
had
not
noticed
all
the
time
he
had
been
listening
to
Crouch
now
returned
in
full
measure
he
also
realized
that
he
was
shaking
dumbledore
gripped
his
arm
and
helped
him
out
into
the
dark
corridor
i
want
you
to
come
up
to
my
office
first
harry
he
said
quiedy
as
they
headed
up
the
passageway
sirius
is
waiting
for
us
there
harry
nodded
a
kind
of
numbness
and
a
sense
of
complete
unreality
were
upon
him
but
he
did
not
care
he
was
even
glad
of
it
he
didn't
want
to
have
to
think
about
anything
that
had
happened
since
he
had
first
touched
the
Triwizard
Cup
he
didn't
want
to
have
to
examine
the
memories
fresh
and
sharp
as
photographs
which
kept
flashing
across
his
mind
madEye
Moody
inside
the
trunk

slumped
on
the
ground
cradling
his
stump
of
an
arm

rising
from
the

asking
to

to
his
parents
professor
Harry
mumbled
where
are
mr.
and
Mrs
diggory
they
are
with
Professor
Sprout
said
Dumbledore
his
voice
which
had
been
so
calm
throughout
the
interrogation
of
Barty
Crouch
shook
very
slightly
for
the
first
time
she
was
Head
of
cedric's
house
and
knew
him
best
they
had
reached
the
stone
gargoyle
dumbledore
gave
the
password
it
sprang
aside
and
he
and
Harry
went
up
the
moving
spiral
staircase
to
the
oak
door
dumbledore
pushed
it
open
sirius
was
standing
there
his
face
was
white
and
gaunt
as
it
had
been
when
he
had
escaped
Azkaban
in
one
swift
moment
he
had
crossed
the
room
harry
are
you
all
right
i
knew
it
I
knew
something
like
this
what
happened
his
hands
shook
as
he
helped
Harry
into
a
chair
in
front
of
the
desk
what
happened
he
asked
more
urgently
dumbledore
began
to
tell
Sirius
everything
Barty
Crouch
had
said
harry
was
only
half
listening
so
tired
every
bone
in
his
body
was
aching
he
wanted
nothing
more
than
to
sit
here
undisturbed
for
hours
and
hours
until
he
fell
asleep
and
didn't
have
to
think
or
feel
anymore
there
was
a
soft
rush
of
wings
fawkes
the
phoenix
had
left
his
perch
flown
across
the
office
and
landed
on
harry's
knee
lo
Fawkes
said
Harry
quietly
he
stroked
the
phoenix's
beautiful
scarletand
gold
plumage
fawkes
blinked
peacefully
up
at
him
there
was
something
comforting
about
his
warm
weight
dumbledore
stopped
talking
he
sat
down
opposite
Harry
behind
his
desk
he
was
looking
at
Harry
who
avoided
his
eyes
dumbledore
was
going
to
question
him
he
was
going
to
make
Harry
relive
everything
i
need
to
know
what
happened
after
you
touched
the
Portkey
in
the
maze
harry
said
Dumbledore
we
can
leave
that
till
morning
can't
we
Dumbledore
said
Sirius
harshly
he
had
put
a
hand
on
Harrys
shoulder
let
him
have
a
sleep
let
him
rest
harry
felt
a
rush
of
gratitude
toward
Sirius
but
Dumbledore
took
no
notice
of
sirius's
words
he
leaned
forward
toward
Harry
very
unwillingly
Harry
raised
his
head
and
looked
into
those
blue
eyes
if
I
thought
I
could
help
you
Dumbledore
said
gently
by
putting
you
into
an
enchanted
sleep
and
allowing
you
to
postpone
the
moment
when
you
would
have
to
think
about
what
has
happened
tonight
I
would
do
it
but
I
know
better
numbing
the
pain
for
a
while
will
make
it
worse
when
you
finally
feel
it
you
have
shown
bravery
beyond
anything
I
could
have
expected
of
you
i
ask
you
to
demonstrate
your
courage
one
more
time
i
ask
you
to
tell
us
what
happened
the
phoenix
let
out
one
soft
quavering
note
it
shivered
in
the
air
and
Harry
felt
as
though
a
drop
of
hot
liquid
had
slipped
down
his
throat
into
his
stomach
warming
him
and
strengthening
him
he
took
a
deep
breath
and
began
to
tell
them
as
he
spoke
visions
of
everything
that
had
passed
that
night
seemed
to
rise
before
his
eyes
he
saw
the
sparkling
surface
of
the
potion
that
had
revived
Voldemort
he
saw
the
Death
Eaters
Apparating
between
the
graves
around
them
he
saw
cedric's
body
lying
on
the
ground
beside
the
cup
once
or
twice
Sirius
made
a
noise
as
though
about
to
say
something
his
hand
still
tight
on
harry's
shoulder
but
Dumbledore
raised
his
hand
to
stop
him
and
Harry
was
glad
of
this
because
it
was
easier
to
keep
going
now
he
had
started
it
was
even
a
relief
he
felt
almost
as
though
something
poisonous
were
being
extracted
from
him
it
was
costing
him
every
bit
of
determination
he
had
to
keep
talking
yet
he
sensed
that
once
he
had
finished
he
would
feel
better
when
Harry
told
of
Wormtail
piercing
his
arm
with
the
dagger
however
Sirius
let
out
a
vehement
exclamation
and
Dumbledore
stood
up
so
quickly
that
Harry
started
dumbledore
walked
around
the
desk
and
told
Harry
to
stretch
out
his
arm
harry
showed
them
both
the
place
where
his
robes
were
torn
and
the
cut
beneath
them
he
said
my
blood
would
make
him
stronger
than
if
he'd
used
someone
else's
harry
told
Dumbledore
he
said
the
protection
my
my
mother
left
in
me
he'd
have
it
too
and
he
was
right
he
could
touch
me
without
hurting
himself
he
touched
my
face
for
a
fleeting
instant
Harry
thought
he
saw
a
gleam
of
something
like
triumph
in
dumbledore's
eyes
but
next
second
harry
was
sure
he
had
imagined
it
for
when
Dumbledore
had
returned
to
his
seat
behind
the
desk
he
looked
as
old
and
weary
as
Harry
had
ever
seen
him
very
well
he
said
sitting
down
again
voldemort
has
overcome
that
particular
barrier
harry
continue
please
harry
went
on
he
explained
how
Voldemort
had
emerged
from
the
cauldron
and
told
them
all
he
could
remember
of
voldemort's
speech
to
the
Death
Eaters
then
he
told
how
Voldemort
had
untied
him
returned
his
wand
to
him
and
prepared
to
duel
but
when
he
reached
the
part
where
the
golden
beam
of
light
had
connected
his
and
voldemort's
wands
he
found
his
throat
obstructed
he
tried
to
keep
talking
but
the
memories
of
what
had
come
out
of
voldemort's
wand
were
flooding
into
his
mind
he
could
see
Cedric
emerging
see
the
old
man
Bertha
Jorkins
his
father
his
mother
he
was
glad
when
Sirius
broke
the
silence
the
wands
connected
he
said
looking
from
Harry
to
Dumbledore
why
harry
looked
up
at
Dumbledore
again
on
whose
face
there
was
an
arrested
look
priori
Incantatem
he
muttered
his
eyes
gazed
into
harry's
and
it
was
almost
as
though
an
invisible
beam
of
understanding
shot
between
them
the
Reverse
Spell
effect
said
Sirius
sharply
exactly
said
Dumbledore
harry's
wand
and
Voldemorts
wand
share
cores
each
of
them
contains
a
feather
from
the
tail
of
the
same
phoenix
this
phoenix
in
fact
he
added
and
he
pointed
at
the
scarletandgold
bird
perching
peacefully
on
harry's
knee
my
wand's
feather
came
from
Fawkes
harry
said
amazed
yes
said
Dumbledore
mr.
Ollivander
wrote
to
tell
me
you
had
bought
the
second
wand
the
moment
you
left
his
shop
four
years
ago
so
what
happens
when
a
wand
meets
its
brother
said
Sirius
they
will
not
work
properly
against
each
other
said
Dumbledore
if
however
the
owners
of
the
wands
force
the
wands
to
do
battle
a
very
rare
effect
will
take
place
one
of
the
wands
will
force
the
other
to
regurgitate
spells
it
has
performed
in
reverse
the
most
recent
first
and
then
those
which
preceded
it
he
looked
interrogatively
at
Harry
and
Harry
nodded
which
means
said
Dumbledore
slowly
his
eyes
upon
harry's
face
that
some
form
of
Cedric
must
have
reappeared
harry
nodded
again
diggory
came
back
to
life
said
Sirius
sharply
no
spell
can
reawaken
the
dead
said
Dumbledore
heavily
all
that
would
have
happened
is
a
kind
of
reverse
echo
a
shadow
of
the
living
Cedric
would
have
emerged
from
the
wand
am
I
correct
Harry
he
spoke
to
me
Harry
said
he
was
suddenly
shaking
again
the
the
ghost
Cedric
or
whatever
he
was
spoke
an
echo
said
Dumbledore
which
retained
cedric's
appearance
and
character
i
am
guessing
other
such
forms
appeared
less
recent
victims
of
voldemort's
wand
an
old
man
Harry
said
his
throat
still
constricted
bertha
Jorkins
and
your
parents
said
Dumbledore
quietly
yes
said
Harry
sirius's
grip
on
harry's
shoulder
was
now
so
tight
it
was
painful
the
last
murders
the
wand
performed
said
Dumbledore
nodding
in
reverse
order
more
would
have
appeared
of
course
had
you
maintained
the
connection
very
well
Harry
these
echoes
these
shadows
what
did
they
do
harry
described
how
the
figures
that
had
emerged
from
the
wand
had
prowled
the
edges
of
the
golden
web
how
Voldemort
had
seemed
to
fear
them
how
the
shadow
of
harry's
mother
had
told
him
what
to
do
how
cedric's
had
made
its
final
request
at
this
point
harry
found
he
could
not
continue
he
looked
around
at
Sirius
and
saw
that
he
had
his
face
in
his
hands
harry
suddenly
became
aware
that
Fawkes
had
left
his
knee
the
phoenix
had
fluttered
to
the
floor
it
was
resting
its
beautiful
head
against
harry's
injured
leg
and
thick
pearly
tears
were
falling
from
its
eyes
onto
the
wound
left
by
the
spider
the
pain
vanished
the
skin
mended
his
leg
was
repaired
i
will
say
it
again
said
Dumbledore
as
the
phoenix
rose
into
the
air
and
resettled
itself
upon
the
perch
beside
the
door
you
have
shown
bravery
beyond
anything
I
could
have
expected
of
you
tonight
harry
you
have
shown
bravery
equal
to
those
who
died
fighting
Voldemort
at
the
height
of
his
powers
you
have
shouldered
a
grown
wizard's
burden
and
found
yourself
equal
to
it
and
you
have
now
given
us
all
we
have
a
right
to
expect
you
will
come
with
me
to
the
hospital
wing
i
do
not
want
you
returning
to
the
dormitory
tonight
a
Sleeping
Potion
and
some
peace
sirius
would
you
like
to
stay
with
him
sirius
nodded
and
stood
up
he
transformed
back
into
the
great
black
dog
and
walked
with
Harry
and
Dumbledore
out
of
the
office
accompanying
them
down
a
flight
of
stairs
to
the
hospital
wing
when
Dumbledore
pushed
open
the
door
harry
saw
Mrs
weasley
Bill
Ron
and
Hermione
grouped
around
a
harassedlooking
Madam
Pomfrey
they
appeared
to
be
demanding
to
know
where
Harry
was
and
what
had
happened
to
him
all
of
them
whipped
around
as
Harry
Dumbledore
and
the
black
dog
entered
and
Mrs
weasley
let
out
a
kind
of
muffled
scream
harry
oh
Harry
she
started
to
hurry
toward
him
but
Dumbledore
moved
between
them
molly
he
said
holding
up
a
hand
please
listen
to
me
for
a
moment
harry
has
been
through
a
terrible
ordeal
tonight
he
has
just
had
to
relive
it
for
me
what
he
needs
now
is
sleep
and
peace
and
quiet
if
he
would
like
you
all
to
stay
with
him
he
added
looking
around
at
Ron
Hermione
and
Bill
too
you
may
do
so
but
I
do
not
want
you
questioning
him
until
he
is
ready
to
answer
and
certainly
not
this
evening
mrs
weasley
nodded
she
was
very
white
she
rounded
on
Ron
Hermione
and
Bill
as
though
they
were
being
noisy
and
hissed
Did
you
hear
he
needs
quiet
headmaster
said
Madam
Pomfrey
staring
at
the
great
black
dog
that
was
Sirius
may
I
ask
what
this
dog
will
be
remaining
with
Harry
for
a
while
said
Dumbledore
simply
i
assure
you
he
is
extremely
well
trained
harry
I
will
wait
while
you
get
into
bed
harry
felt
an
inexpressible
sense
of
gratitude
to
Dumbledore
for
asking
the
others
not
to
question
him
it
wasn't
as
though
he
didn't
want
them
there
but
the
thought
of
explaining
it
all
over
again
the
idea
of
reliving
it
one
more
time
was
more
than
he
could
stand
i
will
be
back
to
see
you
as
soon
as
I
have
met
with
Fudge
Harry
said
Dumbledore
i
would
like
you
to
remain
here
tomorrow
until
I
have
spoken
to
the
school
he
left
as
Madam
Pomfrey
led
Harry
to
a
nearby
bed
he
caught
sight
of
the
real
Moody
lying
motionless
in
a
bed
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
his
wooden
leg
and
magical
eye
were
lying
on
the
bedside
table
is
he
okay
harry
asked
he'll
be
fine
said
Madam
Pomfrey
giving
Harry
some
pajamas
and
pulling
screens
around
him
he
took
off
his
robes
pulled
on
the
pajamas
and
got
into
bed
ron
Hermione
Bill
Mrs
weasley
and
the
black
dog
came
around
the
screen
and
settled
themselves
in
chairs
on
either
side
of
him
ron
and
Hermione
were
looking
at
him
almost
cautiously
as
though
scared
of
him
i'm
all
right
he
told
them
just
tired
mrs
weasleys
eyes
filled
with
tears
as
she
smoothed
his
bedcovers
unnecessarily
madam
Pomfrey
who
had
bustled
off
to
her
office
returned
holding
a
small
bottle
of
some
purple
potion
and
a
goblet
you'll
need
to
drink
all
of
this
harry
she
said
it's
a
potion
for
dreamless
sleep
harry
took
the
goblet
and
drank
a
few
mouthfuls
he
felt
himself
becoming
drowsy
at
once
everything
around
him
became
hazy
the
lamps
around
the
hospital
wing
seemed
to
be
winking
at
him
in
a
friendly
way
through
the
screen
around
his
bed
his
body
felt
as
though
it
was
sinking
deeper
into
the
warmth
of
the
feather
matress
before
he
could
finish
the
potion
before
he
could
say
another
word
his
exhaustion
had
carried
him
off
to
sleep
harry
woke
up
so
warm
so
very
sleepy
that
he
didn't
open
his
eyes
wanting
to
drop
off
again
the
room
was
still
dimly
lit
he
was
sure
it
was
still
nighttime
and
had
a
feeling
that
he
couldn't
have
been
asleep
very
long
then
he
heard
whispering
around
him
they'll
wake
him
if
they
don't
shut
up
what
are
they
shouting
about
nothing
else
can
have
happened
can
it
harry
opened
his
eyes
blearily
someone
had
removed
his
glasses
he
could
see
the
fuzzy
outlines
of
Mrs
weasley
and
Bill
close
by
mrs
weasley
was
on
her
feet
that's
fudge's
voice
she
whispered
and
that's
Minerva
mcgonagall's
isn't
it
but
what
are
they
arguing
about
now
Harry
could
hear
them
too
people
shouting
and
running
toward
the
hospital
wing
regrettable
but
all
the
same
Minerva
Cornelius
Fudge
was
saying
loudly
you
should
never
have
brought
it
inside
the
castle
yelled
Professor
McGonagall
when
Dumbledore
finds
out
harry
heard
the
hospital
doors
burst
open
unnoticed
by
any
of
the
people
around
his
bed
all
of
whom
were
staring
at
the
door
as
Bill
pulled
back
the
screens
Harry
sat
up
and
put
his
glasses
back
on
fudge
came
striding
up
the
ward
professors
McGonagall
and
Snape
were
at
his
heels
where's
Dumbledore
fudge
demanded
of
Mrs
weasley
he's
not
here
said
Mrs
weasley
angrily
this
is
a
hospital
wing
minister
don't
you
think
you'd
do
better
to
but
the
door
opened
and
Dumbledore
came
sweeping
up
the
ward
what
has
happened
said
Dumbledore
sharply
looking
from
Fudge
to
Professor
McGonagall
why
are
you
disturbing
these
people
minerva
i'm
surprised
at
you
I
asked
you
to
stand
guard
over
Barty
Crouch
there
is
no
need
to
stand
guard
over
him
anymore
Dumbledore
she
shrieked
the
Minister
has
seen
to
that
harry
had
never
seen
Professor
McGonagall
lose
control
like
this
there
were
angry
blotches
of
color
in
her
cheeks
and
a
hands
were
balled
into
fists
she
was
trembling
with
fury
when
we
told
mr.
Fudge
that
we
had
caught
the
Death
Eater
responsible
for
tonight's
events
said
Snape
in
a
low
voice
he
seemed
to
feel
his
personal
safety
was
in
question
he
insisted
on
summoning
a
dementor
to
accompany
him
into
the
castle
he
brought
it
up
to
the
office
where
Barty
Crouch
i
told
him
you
would
not
agree
Dumbledore
mcGonagall
fumed
i
told
him
you
would
never
allow
dementors
to
set
foot
inside
the
castle
but
my
dear
woman
roared
Fudge
who
likewise
looked
angrier
than
Harry
had
ever
seen
him
as
Minister
of
Magic
it
is
my
decision
whether
I
wish
to
bring
protection
with
me
when
interviewing
a
possibly
dangerous
but
Professor
mcgonagall's
voice
drowned
fudge's
the
moment
that
that
thing
entered
the
room
she
screamed
pointing
at
Fudge
trembling
all
over
it
swooped
down
on
Crouch
and
and
harry
felt
a
chill
in
his
stomach
as
Professor
McGonagall
struggled
to
find
words
to
describe
what
had
happened
he
did
not
need
her
to
finish
her
sentence
he
knew
what
the
dementor
must
have
done
it
had
administered
its
fatal
kiss
to
Barty
Crouch
it
had
sucked
his
soul
out
through
his
mouth
he
was
worse
than
dead
by
all
accounts
he
is
no
loss
blustered
Fudge
it
seems
he
has
been
responsible
for
several
deaths
but
he
cannot
now
give
testimony
Cornelius
said
Dumbledore
he
was
staring
hard
at
Fudge
as
though
seeing
him
plainly
for
the
first
time
he
cannot
give
evidence
about
why
he
killed
those
people
why
he
killed
them
well
that's
no
mystery
is
it
blustered
Fudge
he
was
a
raving
lunatic
from
what
Minerva
and
Severus
have
told
me
he
seems
to
have
thought
he
was
doing
it
all
on
youknowwho's
instructions
lord
Voldemort
was
giving
him
instructions
Cornelius
Dumbledore
said
those
peoples
deaths
were
mere
byproducts
of
a
plan
to
restore
Voldemort
to
full
strength
again
the
plan
succeeded
voldemort
has
been
restored
to
his
body
fudge
looked
as
though
someone
had
just
swung
a
heavy
weight
into
his
face
dazed
and
blinking
he
stared
back
at
Dumbledore
as
if
he
couldn't
quite
believe
what
he
had
just
heard
he
began
to
sputter
still
goggling
at
Dumbledore
youKnowWho
returned
preposterous
come
now
Dumbledore
as
Minerva
and
Severus
have
doubtless
told
you
said
Dumbledore
we
heard
Barty
Crouch
confess
under
the
influence
of
Veritaserum
he
told
us
how
he
was
smuggled
out
of
Azkaban
and
how
Voldemort
learning
of
his
continued
existence
from
Bertha
Jorkins
went
to
free
him
from
his
father
and
used
him
to
capture
Harry
the
plan
worked
I
tell
you
crouch
has
helped
Voldemort
to
return
see
here
Dumbledore
said
Fudge
and
Harry
was
astonished
to
see
a
slight
smile
dawning
on
his
face
you
you
can't
seriously
believe
that
YouKnowWho
back
come
now
come
now
certainly
Crouch
may
have
believed
himself
to
be
acting
upon
youknowwho's
orders
but
to
take
the
word
of
a
lunatic
like
that
Dumbledore
when
Harry
touched
the
Triwizard
Cup
tonight
he
was
transported
straight
to
Voldemort
said
Dumbledore
steadily
he
witnessed
Lord
voldemort's
rebirth
will
explain
it
all
to
you
if
you
will
step
up
to
my
office
dumbledore
glanced
around
at
Harry
and
saw
that
he
was
awake
but
shook
his
head
and
said
I
am
afraid
I
cannot
permit
you
to
question
Harry
tonight
fudge's
curious
smile
lingered
he
too
glanced
at
Harry
then
looked
back
at
Dumbledore
and
said
You
are
er
prepared
to
take
harry's
word
on
this
are
you
Dumbledore
there
was
a
moment's
silence
which
was
broken
by
Sirius
growling
his
hackles
were
raised
and
he
was
baring
his
teeth
at
Fudge
certainly
I
believe
Harry
said
Dumbledore
his
eyes
were
blazing
now
i
heard
crouch's
confession
and
I
heard
harry's
account
of
what
happened
after
he
touched
the
Triwizard
Cup
the
two
stories
make
sense
they
explain
everything
that
has
happened
since
Bertha
Jorkins
disappeared
last
summer
fudge
still
had
that
strange
smile
on
his
face
once
again
he
glanced
at
Harry
before
answering
you
are
prepared
to
believe
that
Lord
Voldemort
has
returned
on
the
word
of
a
lunatic
murderer
and
a
boy
who
well
fudge
shot
Harry
another
look
and
Harry
suddenly
understood
you've
been
reading
Rita
Skeeter
mr.
Fudge
he
said
quietly
ron
Hermione
Mrs
weasley
and
Bill
all
jumped
none
of
them
had
realized
that
Harry
was
awake
fudge
reddened
slightly
but
a
defiant
and
obstinate
look
came
over
his
face
and
if
I
have
he
said
looking
at
Dumbledore
if
I
have
discovered
that
you've
been
keeping
certain
facts
about
the
boy
very
quiet
a
Parselmouth
eh
and
having
funny
turns
all
over
the
place
i
assume
that
you
are
referring
to
the
pains
Harry
has
been
experiencing
in
his
scar
said
Dumbledore
coolly
you
admit
that
he
has
been
having
these
pains
then
said
Fudge
quickly
headaches
nightmares
possibly
hallucinations
listen
to
me
Cornelius
said
Dumbledore
taking
a
step
toward
Fudge
and
once
again
he
seemed
to
radiate
that
indefinable
sense
of
power
that
Harry
had
felt
after
Dumbledore
had
Stunned
young
Crouch
harry
is
as
sane
as
you
or
I
that
scar
upon
his
forehead
has
not
addled
his
brains
i
believe
it
hurts
him
when
Lord
Voldemort
is
close
by
or
feeling
particularly
murderous
fudge
had
taken
half
a
step
back
from
Dumbledore
but
he
looked
no
less
stubborn
you'll
forgive
me
Dumbledore
but
i've
never
heard
of
a
curse
scar
acting
as
an
alarm
bell
before
look
I
saw
Voldemort
come
back
harry
shouted
he
tried
to
get
out
of
bed
again
but
Mrs
weasley
forced
him
back
i
saw
the
Death
Eaters
i
can
give
you
their
names
lucius
Malfoy
snape
made
a
sudden
movement
but
as
Harry
looked
at
him
snape's
eyes
flew
back
to
Fudge
malfoy
was
cleared
said
Fudge
visibly
affronted
a
very
old
family
donations
to
excellent
causes
macnair
harry
continued
also
cleared
now
working
for
the
Ministry
avery
Nott
Crabbe
Goyle
you
are
merely
repeating
the
names
of
those
who
were
acquitted
of
being
Death
Eaters
thirteen
years
ago
said
Fudge
angrily
you
could
have
found
those
names
in
old
reports
of
the
trials
for
heavens
sake
Dumbledore
the
boy
was
full
of
some
crackpot
story
at
the
end
of
last
year
too
his
tales
are
getting
taller
and
you're
still
swallowing
them
the
boy
can
talk
to
snakes
dumbledore
and
you
still
think
he's
trustworthy
you
fool
professor
McGonagall
cried
cedric
Diggory
mr.
Crouch
these
deaths
were
not
the
random
work
of
a
lunatic
i
see
no
evidence
to
the
contrary
shouted
Fudge
now
matching
her
anger
his
face
purpling
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
all
determined
to
start
a
panic
that
will
destabilize
everything
we
have
worked
for
these
last
thirteen
years
harry
couldn't
believe
what
he
was
hearing
he
had
always
thought
of
Fudge
as
a
kindly
figure
a
little
blustering
a
little
pompous
but
essentially
goodnatured
but
now
a
short
angry
wizard
stood
before
him
refusing
pointblank
to
accept
the
prospect
of
disruption
in
his
comfortable
and
ordered
world
to
believe
that
Voldemort
could
have
risen
voldemort
has
returned
Dumbledore
repeated
if
you
accept
that
fact
straightaway
fudge
and
take
the
necessary
measures
we
may
still
be
able
to
save
the
situation
the
first
and
most
essential
step
is
to
remove
Azkaban
from
the
control
of
the
dementors
preposterous
shouted
Fudge
again
remove
the
dementors
i'd
be
kicked
out
of
office
for
suggesting
it
half
of
us
only
feel
safe
in
our
beds
at
night
because
we
know
the
dementors
are
standing
guard
at
Azkaban
the
rest
of
us
sleep
less
soundly
in
our
beds
Cornelius
knowing
that
you
have
put
Lord
voldemort's
most
dangerous
supporters
in
the
care
of
creatures
who
will
join
him
the
instant
he
asks
them
said
Dumbledore
they
will
not
remain
loyal
to
you
Fudge
voldemort
can
offer
them
much
more
scope
for
their
powers
and
their
pleasures
than
you
can
with
the
dementors
behind
him
and
his
old
supporters
returned
to
him
you
will
be
hardpressed
to
stop
him
regaining
the
sort
of
power
he
had
thirteen
years
ago
fudge
was
opening
and
closing
his
mouth
as
though
no
words
could
express
his
outrage
the
second
step
you
must
take
and
at
once
Dumbledore
pressed
on
is
to
send
envoys
to
the
giants
envoys
to
the
giants
fudge
shrieked
finding
his
tongue
again
what
madness
is
this
extend
them
the
hand
of
friendship
now
before
it
is
too
late
said
Dumbledore
or
Voldemort
will
persuade
them
as
he
did
before
that
he
alone
among
wizards
will
give
them
their
rights
and
their
freedom
you
you
cannot
be
serious
fudge
gasped
shaking
his
head
and
retreating
further
from
Dumbledore
if
the
magical
community
got
wind
that
I
had
approached
the
giants
people
hate
them
Dumbledore
end
of
my
career
you
are
blinded
said
Dumbledore
his
voice
rising
now
the
aura
of
power
around
him
palpable
his
eyes
blazing
once
more
by
the
love
of
the
office
you
hold
Cornelius
you
place
too
much
importance
and
you
always
have
done
on
the
socalled
purity
of
blood
you
fail
to
recognize
that
it
matters
not
what
someone
is
born
but
what
they
grow
to
be
your
dementor
has
just
destroyed
the
last
remaining
member
of
a
pureblood
family
as
old
as
any
and
see
what
that
man
chose
to
make
of
his
life
i
tell
you
now
take
the
steps
I
have
suggested
and
you
will
be
remembered
in
office
or
out
as
one
of
the
bravest
and
greatest
Ministers
of
Magic
we
have
ever
known
fail
to
act
and
history
will
remember
you
as
the
man
who
stepped
aside
and
allowed
Voldemort
a
second
chance
to
destroy
the
world
we
have
tried
to
rebuild
insane
whispered
Fudge
still
backing
away
mad
and
then
there
was
silence
madam
Pomfrey
was
standing
frozen
at
the
foot
of
harry's
bed
her
hands
over
her
mouth
mrs
weasley
was
still
standing
over
Harry
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
to
prevent
him
from
rising
bill
Ron
and
Hermione
were
staring
at
Fudge
if
your
determination
to
shut
your
eyes
will
carry
you
as
far
as
this
Cornelius
said
Dumbledore
we
have
reached
a
parting
of
the
ways
you
must
act
as
you
see
fit
and
I
I
shall
act
as
I
see
fit
dumbledore's
voice
carried
no
hint
of
a
threat
it
sounded
like
a
mere
statement
but
Fudge
bristled
as
though
Dumbledore
were
advancing
upon
him
with
a
wand
now
see
here
Dumbledore
he
said
waving
a
threatening
finger
i've
given
you
free
rein
always
i've
had
a
lot
of
respect
for
you
i
might
not
have
agreed
with
some
of
your
decisions
but
i've
kept
quiet
there
aren't
many
who'd
have
let
you
hire
werewolves
or
keep
Hagrid
or
decide
what
to
teach
your
students
without
reference
to
the
Ministry
but
if
you're
going
to
work
against
me
the
only
one
against
whom
I
intend
to
work
said
Dumbledore
is
Lord
Voldemort
if
you
are
against
him
then
we
remain
Cornelius
on
the
same
side
it
seemed
Fudge
could
think
of
no
answer
to
this
he
rocked
backward
and
forward
on
his
small
feet
for
a
moment
and
spun
his
bowler
hat
in
his
hands
finally
he
said
with
a
hint
of
a
plea
in
his
voice
He
can't
be
back
Dumbledore
he
just
can't
be
snape
strode
forward
past
Dumbledore
pulling
up
the
left
sleeve
of
his
robes
as
he
went
he
stuck
out
his
forearm
and
showed
it
to
Fudge
who
recoiled
there
said
Snape
harshly
there
the
Dark
Mark
it
is
not
as
clear
as
it
was
an
hour
or
so
ago
when
it
burned
black
but
you
can
still
see
it
every
Death
Eater
had
the
sign
burned
into
him
by
the
Dark
Lord
it
was
a
means
of
distinguishing
one
another
and
his
means
of
summoning
us
to
him
when
he
touched
the
Mark
of
any
Death
Eater
we
were
to
Disapparate
and
Apparate
instantly
at
his
side
this
Mark
has
been
growing
clearer
all
year
karkaroff
s
too
why
do
you
think
Karkaroff
fled
tonight
we
both
felt
the
Mark
burn
we
both
knew
he
had
returned
karkaroff
fears
the
Dark
lord's
vengeance
he
betrayed
too
many
of
his
fellow
Death
Eaters
to
be
sure
of
a
welcome
back
into
the
fold
fudge
stepped
back
from
Snape
too
he
was
shaking
his
head
he
did
not
seem
to
have
taken
in
a
word
Snape
had
said
he
stared
apparently
repelled
by
the
ugly
mark
on
snape's
arm
then
looked
up
at
Dumbledore
and
whispered
I
don't
know
what
you
and
your
staff
are
playing
at
Dumbledore
but
I
have
heard
enough
i
have
no
more
to
add
i
will
be
in
touch
with
you
tomorrow
Dumbledore
to
discuss
the
running
of
this
school
i
must
return
to
the
Ministry
he
had
almost
reached
the
door
when
he
paused
he
turned
around
strode
back
down
the
dormitory
and
stopped
at
harry's
bed
your
winnings
he
said
shortly
taking
a
large
bag
of
gold
out
of
his
pocket
and
dropping
it
onto
Harrys
bedside
table
one
thousand
Galleons
there
should
have
been
a
presentation
ceremony
but
under
the
circumstances
he
crammed
his
bowler
hat
onto
his
head
and
walked
out
of
the
room
slamming
the
door
behind
him
the
moment
he
had
disappeared
Dumbledore
turned
to
look
at
the
group
around
harry's
bed
there
is
work
to
be
done
he
said
molly
am
I
right
in
thinking
that
I
can
count
on
you
and
Arthur
of
course
you
can
said
Mrs
weasley
she
was
white
to
the
lips
but
she
looked
resolute
we
know
what
Fudge
is
it's
arthur's
fondness
for
Muggles
that
has
held
him
back
at
the
Ministry
all
these
years
fudge
thinks
he
lacks
proper
wizarding
pride
then
I
need
to
send
a
message
to
Arthur
said
Dumbledore
all
those
that
we
can
persuade
of
the
truth
must
be
notified
immediately
and
he
is
well
placed
to
contact
those
at
the
Ministry
who
are
not
as
shortsighted
as
Cornelius
i'll
go
to
Dad
said
Bill
standing
up
i'll
go
now
excellent
said
Dumbledore
tell
him
what
has
happened
tell
him
I
will
be
in
direct
contact
with
him
shortly
he
will
need
to
be
discreet
however
if
Fudge
thinks
I
am
interfering
at
the
Ministry
leave
it
to
me
said
Bill
he
clapped
a
hand
on
harry's
shoulder
kissed
his
mother
on
the
cheek
pulled
on
his
cloak
and
strode
quickly
from
the
room
minerva
said
Dumbledore
turning
to
Professor
McGonagall
I
want
to
see
Hagrid
in
my
office
as
soon
as
possible
also
if
she
will
consent
to
come
Madame
Maxime
professor
McGonagall
nodded
and
left
without
a
word
poppy
Dumbledore
said
to
Madam
Pomfrey
would
you
be
very
kind
and
go
down
to
Professor
Moodys
office
where
I
think
you
will
find
a
houseelf
called
Winky
in
considerable
distress
do
what
you
can
for
her
and
take
her
back
to
the
kitchens
i
think
Dobby
will
look
after
her
for
us
very
very
well
said
Madam
Pomfrey
looking
startled
and
she
too
left
dumbledore
made
sure
that
the
door
was
closed
and
that
Madam
pomfrey's
footsteps
had
died
away
before
he
spoke
again
and
now
he
said
it
is
time
for
two
of
our
number
to
recognize
each
other
for
what
they
are
sirius
if
you
could
resume
your
usual
form
the
great
black
dog
looked
up
at
Dumbledore
then
in
an
instant
turned
back
into
a
man
mrs
weasley
screamed
and
leapt
back
from
the
bed
sirius
Black
she
shrieked
pointing
at
him
mum
shut
up
ron
yelled
it's
okay
snape
had
not
yelled
or
jumped
backward
but
the
look
on
his
face
was
one
of
mingled
fury
and
horror
him
he
snarled
staring
at
Sirius
whose
face
showed
equal
dislike
what
is
he
doing
here
he
is
here
at
my
invitation
said
Dumbledore
looking
between
them
as
are
you
Severus
i
trust
you
both
it
is
time
for
you
to
lay
aside
your
old
differences
and
trust
each
other
harry
thought
Dumbledore
was
asking
for
a
near
miracle
sirius
and
Snape
were
eyeing
each
other
with
the
utmost
loathing
i
will
settle
in
the
short
term
said
Dumbledore
with
a
bite
of
impatience
in
his
voice
for
a
lack
of
open
hostility
you
will
shake
hands
you
are
on
the
same
side
now
time
is
short
and
unless
the
few
of
us
who
know
the
truth
do
not
stand
united
there
is
no
hope
for
any
us
very
slowly
but
still
glaring
at
each
other
as
though
each
wished
the
other
nothing
but
ill
Sirius
and
Snape
moved
toward
each
other
and
shook
hands
they
let
go
extremely
quickly
that
will
do
to
be
going
on
with
said
Dumbledore
stepping
between
them
once
more
now
I
have
work
for
each
of
you
fudge's
attitude
though
not
unexpected
changes
everything
sirius
I
need
you
to
set
off
at
once
you
are
to
alert
Remus
Lupin
Arabella
Figg
Mundungus
Fletcher
the
old
crowd
lie
low
at
lupin's
for
a
while
I
will
contact
you
there
but
said
Harry
he
wanted
Sirius
to
stay
he
did
not
want
to
have
to
say
goodbye
again
so
quickly
you'll
see
me
very
soon
harry
said
Sirius
turning
to
him
i
promise
you
but
I
must
do
what
I
can
you
understand
don't
you
yeah
said
Harry
yeah
of
course
I
do
sirius
grasped
his
hand
briefly
nodded
to
Dumbledore
transformed
again
into
the
black
dog
and
ran
the
length
of
the
room
to
the
door
whose
handle
he
turned
with
a
paw
then
he
was
gone
severus
said
Dumbledore
turning
to
Snape
you
know
what
I
must
ask
you
to
do
if
you
are
ready
if
you
are
prepared
i
am
said
Snape
he
looked
slightly
paler
than
usual
and
his
cold
black
eyes
glittered
strangely
then
good
luck
said
Dumbledore
and
he
watched
with
a
trace
of
apprehension
on
his
face
as
Snape
swept
wordlessly
after
Sirius
it
was
several
minutes
before
Dumbledore
spoke
again
i
must
go
downstairs
he
said
finally
i
must
see
the
Diggorys
harry
take
the
rest
of
your
potion
i
will
see
all
of
you
later
harry
slumped
back
against
his
pillows
as
Dumbledore
disappeared
hermione
Ron
and
Mrs
weasley
were
all
looking
at
him
none
of
them
spoke
for
a
very
long
time
you've
got
to
take
the
rest
of
your
potion
harry
Mrs
weasley
said
at
last
her
hand
nudged
the
sack
of
gold
on
his
bedside
cabinet
as
she
reached
for
the
bottle
and
the
goblet
you
have
a
good
long
sleep
try
and
think
about
something
else
for
a
while
think
about
what
you're
going
to
buy
with
your
winnings
i
don't
want
that
gold
said
Harry
in
an
expressionless
voice
you
have
it
anyone
can
have
it
i
shouldn't
have
won
it
it
should've
been
cedric's
the
thing
against
which
he
had
been
fighting
on
and
off
ever
since
he
had
come
out
of
the
maze
was
threatening
to
overpower
him
he
could
feel
a
burning
prickling
feeling
in
the
inner
corners
of
his
eyes
he
blinked
and
stared
up
at
the
ceiling
it
wasn't
your
fault
harry
Mrs
weasley
whispered
i
told
him
to
take
the
cup
with
me
said
Harry
now
the
burning
feeling
was
in
his
throat
too
he
wished
Ron
would
look
away
mrs
weasley
set
the
potion
down
on
the
bedside
cabinet
bent
down
and
put
her
arms
around
Harry
he
had
no
memory
of
ever
being
hugged
like
this
as
though
by
a
mother
the
full
weight
of
everything
he
had
seen
that
night
seemed
to
fall
in
upon
him
as
Mrs
weasley
held
him
to
her
his
mother
s
face
his
father's
voice
the
sight
of
Cedric
dead
on
the
ground
all
started
spinning
in
his
head
until
he
could
hardly
bear
it
until
he
was
screwing
up
his
face
against
the
howl
of
misery
fighting
to
get
out
of
him
there
was
a
loud
slamming
noise
and
Mrs
weasley
and
Harry
broke
apart
hermione
was
standing
by
the
window
she
was
holding
something
tight
in
her
hand
sorry
she
whispered
your
potion
Harry
said
Mrs
weasley
quickly
wiping
her
eyes
on
the
back
of
her
hand
harry
drank
it
in
one
gulp
the
effect
was
instantaneous
heavy
irresistible
waves
of
dreamless
sleep
broke
over
him
he
fell
back
onto
his
pillows
and
thought
no
more
chapter
thirtyseven
the
beginning
when
he
looked
back
even
a
month
later
Harry
found
he
had
only
scattered
memories
of
the
next
few
days
it
was
as
though
he
had
been
through
too
much
to
take
in
any
more
the
recollections
he
did
have
were
very
painful
the
worst
perhaps
was
the
meeting
with
the
Diggorys
that
took
place
the
following
morning
they
did
not
blame
him
for
what
had
happened
on
the
contrary
both
thanked
him
for
returning
cedric's
body
to
them
mr.
Diggory
sobbed
through
most
of
the
interview
mrs
diggory's
grief
seemed
to
be
beyond
tears
he
suffered
very
little
then
she
said
when
Harry
had
told
her
how
Cedric
had
died
and
after
all
Amos
he
died
just
when
he'd
won
the
tournament
he
must
have
been
happy
when
they
got
to
their
feet
she
looked
down
at
Harry
and
said
You
look
after
yourself
now
harry
seized
the
sack
of
gold
on
the
bedside
table
you
take
this
he
muttered
to
her
it
should've
been
cedric's
he
got
there
first
you
take
it
but
she
backed
away
from
him
oh
no
it's
yours
dear
I
couldn't
you
keep
it
harry
returned
to
Gryffindor
Tower
the
following
evening
from
what
Hermione
and
Ron
told
him
Dumbledore
had
spoken
to
the
school
that
morning
at
breakfast
he
had
merely
requested
that
they
leave
Harry
alone
that
nobody
ask
him
questions
or
badger
him
to
tell
the
story
of
what
had
happened
in
the
maze
most
people
he
noticed
were
skirting
him
in
the
corridors
avoiding
his
eyes
some
whispered
behind
their
hands
as
he
passed
he
guessed
that
many
of
them
had
believed
Rita
skeeter's
article
about
how
disturbed
and
possibly
dangerous
he
was
perhaps
they
were
formulating
their
own
theories
about
how
Cedric
had
died
he
found
he
didn't
care
very
much
he
liked
it
best
when
he
was
with
Ron
and
Hermione
and
they
were
talking
about
other
things
or
else
letting
him
sit
in
silence
while
they
played
chess
he
felt
as
though
all
three
of
them
had
reached
an
understanding
they
didn't
need
to
put
into
words
that
each
was
waiting
for
some
sign
some
word
of
what
was
going
on
outside
Hogwarts
and
that
it
was
useless
to
speculate
about
what
might
be
coming
until
they
knew
anything
for
certain
the
only
time
they
touched
upon
the
subject
was
when
Ron
told
Harry
about
a
meeting
Mrs
weasley
had
had
with
Dumbledore
before
going
home
she
went
to
ask
him
if
you
could
come
straight
to
us
this
summer
he
said
but
he
wants
you
to
go
back
to
the
Dursleys
at
least
at
first
why
said
Harry
she
said
dumbledore's
got
his
reasons
said
Ron
shaking
his
head
darkly
i
suppose
we've
got
to
trust
him
haven't
we
the
only
person
apart
from
Ron
and
Hermione
that
Harry
felt
able
to
talk
to
was
Hagrid
as
there
was
no
longer
a
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
teacher
they
had
those
lessons
free
they
used
the
one
on
Thursday
afternoon
to
go
down
and
visit
Hagrid
in
his
cabin
it
was
a
bright
and
sunny
day
Fang
bounded
out
of
the
open
door
as
they
approached
barking
and
wagging
his
tail
madly
who's
that
called
Hagrid
coming
to
the
door
harry
he
strode
out
to
meet
them
pulled
Harry
into
a
onearmed
hug
ruffled
his
hair
and
said
Good
ter
see
yeh
mate
good
ter
see
yeh
they
saw
two
bucketsize
cups
and
saucers
on
the
wooden
table
in
front
of
the
fireplace
when
they
entered
hagrid's
cabin
bin
havin
a
cuppa
with
Olympe
Hagrid
said

Ron

Ron

said
Hagrid
airily
fetching
more
cups
from
the
dresser
when
he
had
made
tea
and
offered
around
a
plate
of
doughy
cookies
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
surveyed
Harry
closely
through
his
beetleblack
eyes
you

he
said
gruffly
Yeah

nothing

Hagrid
and
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione

at

Dumbledores

great
man
Dumbledore
s
long
as
we've
got

i'm
not
too
worried
hagrid
raised
his
bushy
eyebrows
at
the
disbelieving
expressions
on
their
faces
no
good
sittin
worryin

he
said

as
much
as

done
an
I
can
give
yeh
no
higher
praise
than

harry
smiled
back
at
him
it
was
the
first
time
he'd
smiled
in
days
what's
Dumbledore
asked
you
to
do
Hagrid
he
asked
he
sent
Professor
McGonagall
to
ask
you
and
Madame
Maxime
to
meet
him
that
night
got
a
little
job

hagrid
flinched
at
the
sound
of
the
name

he
said
evasively
now
who'd
like
ter
come
an
visit
the
las
skrewt
with
me
i
was
jokin
jokin
he
added
hastily
seeing
the
looks
on
their
faces
it
was
with
a
heavy
heart
that
Harry
packed
his
trunk
up
in
the
dormitory
on
the
night
before
his
return
to
Privet
Drive
he
was
dreading
the
Leaving
Feast
which
was
usually
a
cause
for
celebration
when
the
winner
of
the
InterHouse
Championship
would
be
announced
he
had
avoided
being
in
the
Great
Hall
when
it
was
full
ever
since
he
had
left
the
hospital
wing
preferring
to
eat
when
it
was
nearly
empty
to
avoid
the
stares
of
his
fellow
students
when
he
Ron
and
Hermione
entered
the
Hall
they
saw
at
once
that
the
usual
decorations
were
missing
the
Great
Hall
was
normally
decorated
with
the
winning
house's
colors
for
the
Leaving
Feast
tonight
however
there
were
black
drapes
on
the
wall
behind
the
teachers
table
harry
knew
instantly
that
they
were
there
as
a
mark
of
respect
to
Cedric
the
real
MadEye
Moody
was
at
the
staff
table
now
his
wooden
leg
and
his
magical
eye
back
in
place
he
was
extremely
twitchy
jumping
every
time
someone
spoke
to
him
harry
couldn't
blame
him
Moodys
fear
of
attack
was
bound
to
have
been
increased
by
his
tenmonth
imprisonment
in
his
own
trunk
professor
Karkaroff
s
chair
was
empty
harry
wondered
as
he
sat
down
with
the
other
Gryffindors
where
Karkaroff
was
now
and
whether
Voldemort
had
caught
up
with
him
madame
Maxime
was
still
there
she
was
sitting
next
to
Hagrid
they
were
talking
quietly
together
further
along
the
table
sitting
next
to
Professor
McGonagall
was
Snape
his
eyes
lingered
on
Harry
for
a
moment
as
Harry
looked
at
him
his
expression
was
difficult
to
read
he
looked
as
sour
and
unpleasant
as
ever
harry
continued
to
watch
him
long
after
Snape
had
looked
away
what
was
it
that
Snape
had
done
on
Dumbledores
orders
the
night
that
Voldemort
had
returned
and
why
why
was
Dumbledore
so
convinced
that
Snape
was
truly
on
their
side
he
had
been
their
spy
Dumbledore
had
said
so
in
the
Pensieve
snape
had
turned
spy
against
Voldemort
at
great
personal
risk
was
that
the
job
he
had
taken
up
again
had
he
made
contact
with
the
Death
Eaters
perhaps
pretended
that
he
had
never
really
gone
over
to
Dumbledore
that
he
had
been
like
Voldemort
himself
biding
his
time
harry's
musings
were
ended
by
Professor
Dumbledore
who
stood
up
at
the
staff
table
the
Great
Hall
which
in
any
case
had
been
less
noisy
than
it
usually
was
at
the
Leaving
Feast
became
very
quiet
the
end
said
Dumbledore
looking
around
at
them
all
of
another
year
he
paused
and
his
eyes
fell
upon
the
Hufflepuff
table
theirs
had
been
the
most
subdued
table
before
he
had
gotten
to
his
feet
and
theirs
were
still
the
saddest
and
palest
faces
in
the
Hall
there
is
much
that
I
would
like
to
say
to
you
all
tonight
said
Dumbledore
but
I
must
first
acknowledge
the
loss
of
a
very
fine
person
who
should
be
sitting
here
he
gestured
toward
the
Hufflepuffs
enjoying
our
feast
with
us
i
would
like
you
all
please
to
stand
and
raise
your
glasses
to
Cedric
Diggory
they
did
it
all
of
them
the
benches
scraped
as
everyone
in
the
Hall
stood
and
raised
their
goblets
and
echoed
in
one
loud
low
rumbling
voice
Cedric
Diggory
harry
caught
a
glimpse
of
Cho
through
the
crowd
there
were
tears
pouring
silently
down
her
face
he
looked
down
at
the
table
as
they
all
sat
down
again
cedric
was
a
person
who
exemplified
many
of
the
qualities
that
distinguish
Hufflepuff
house
Dumbledore
continued
he
was
a
good
and
loyal
friend
a
hard
worker
he
valued
fair
play
his
death
has
affected
you
all
whether
you
knew
him
well
or
not
i
think
that
you
have
the
right
therefore
to
know
exactly
how
it
came
about
harry
raised
his
head
and
stared
at
Dumbledore
cedric
Diggory
was
murdered
by
Lord
Voldemort
a
panicked
whisper
swept
the
Great
Hall
people
were
staring
at
Dumbledore
in
disbelief
in
horror
he
looked
perfectly
calm
as
he
watched
them
mutter
themselves
into
silence
the
Ministry
of
Magic
Dumbledore
continued
does
not
wish
me
to
tell
you
this
it
is
possible
that
some
of
your
parents
will
be
horrified
that
I
have
done
so
either
because
they
will
not
believe
that
Lord
Voldemort
has
returned
or
because
they
think
I
should
not
tell
you
so
young
as
you
are
it
is
my
belief
however
that
the
truth
is
generally
preferable
to
lies
and
that
any
attempt
to
pretend
that
Cedric
died
as
the
result
of
an
accident
or
some
sort
of
blunder
of
his
own
is
an
insult
to
his
memory
stunned
and
frightened
every
face
in
the
Hall
was
turned
toward
Dumbledore
now
or
almost
every
face
over
at
the
Slytherin
table
harry
saw
Draco
Malfoy
muttering
something
to
Crabbe
and
Goyle
harry
felt
a
hot
sick
swoop
of
anger
in
his
stomach
he
forced
himself
to
look
back
at
Dumbledore
there
is
somebody
else
who
must
be
mentioned
in
connection
with
Cedrics
death
Dumbledore
went
on
i
am
talking
of
course
about
Harry
Potter
a
kind
of
ripple
crossed
the
Great
Hall
as
a
few
heads
turned
in
harry's
direction
before
flicking
back
to
face
Dumbledore
harry
Potter
managed
to
escape
Lord
Voldemort
said
Dumbledore
he
risked
his
own
life
to
return
cedric's
body
to
Hogwarts
he
showed
in
every
respect
the
sort
of
bravery
that
few
wizards
have
ever
shown
in
facing
Lord
Voldemort
and
for
this
I
honor
him
dumbledore
turned
gravely
to
Harry
and
raised
his
goblet
once
more
nearly
everyone
in
the
Great
Hall
followed
suit
they
murmured
his
name
as
they
had
murmured
cedric's
and
drank
to
him
but
through
a
gap
in
the
standing
figures
harry
saw
that
Malfoy
Crabbe
Goyle
and
many
of
the
other
Slytherins
had
remained
defiantly
in
their
seats
their
goblets
untouched
dumbledore
who
after
all
possessed
no
magical
eye
did
not
see
them
when
everyone
had
once
again
resumed
their
seats
Dumbledore
continued
The
Triwizard
tournament's
aim
was
to
further
and
promote
magical
understanding
in
the
light
of
what
has
happened
of
Lord
Voldemorts
return
such
ties
are
more
important
than
ever
before
dumbledore
looked
from
Madame
Maxime
and
Hagrid
to
Fleur
Delacour
and
her
fellow
Beauxbatons
students
to
Viktor
Krum
and
the
Durmstrangs
at
the
Slytherin
table
krum
Harry
saw
looked
wary
almost
frightened
as
though
he
expected
Dumbledore
to
say
something
harsh
every
guest
in
this
Hall
said
Dumbledore
and
his
eyes
lingered
upon
the
Durmstrang
students
will
be
welcomed
back
here
at
any
time
should
they
wish
to
come
i
say
to
you
all
once
again
in
the
light
of
Lord
voldemort's
return
we
are
only
as
strong
as
we
are
united
as
weak
as
we
are
divided
lord
Voldemorts
gift
for
spreading
discord
and
enmity
is
very
great
we
can
fight
it
only
by
showing
an
equally
strong
bond
of
friendship
and
trust
differences
of
habit
and
language
are
nothing
at
all
if
our
aims
are
identical
and
our
hearts
are
open
it
is
my
belief
and
never
have
I
so
hoped
that
I
am
mistaken
that
we
are
all
facing
dark
and
difficult
times
some
of
you
in
this
Hall
have
already
suffered
directly
at
the
hands
of
Lord
Voldemort
many
of
your
families
have
been
torn
asunder
a
week
ago
a
student
was
taken
from
our
midst
remember
Cedric
remember
if
the
time
should
come
when
you
have
to
make
a
choice
between
what
is
right
and
what
is
easy
remember
what
happened
to
a
boy
who
was
good
and
kind
and
brave
because
he
strayed
across
the
path
of
Lord
voldemort
remember
Cedric
Diggory
harry's
trunk
was
packed
Hedwig
was
back
in
her
cage
on
top
of
it
he
Ron
and
Hermione
were
waiting
in
the
crowded
entrance
hall
with
the
rest
of
the
fourth
years
for
the
carriages
that
would
take
them
back
to
Hogsmeade
station
it
was
another
beautiful
summer's
day
he
supposed
that
Privet
Drive
would
be
hot
and
leafy
its
flower
beds
a
riot
of
color
when
he
arrived
there
that
evening
the
thought
gave
him
no
pleasure
at
all
arry
he
looked
around
fleur
Delacour
was
hurrying
up
the
stone
steps
into
the
castle
beyond
her
far
across
the
grounds
harry
could
see
Hagrid
helping
Madame
Maxime
to
back
two
of
the
giant
horses
into
their
harness
the
Beauxbatons
carriage
was
about
to
take
off
we
will
see
each
uzzer
again
I
ope
said
Fleur
as
she
reached
him
holding
out
her
hand
i
am
oping
to
get
a
job
ere
to
improve
my
Eenglish
it's
very
good
already
said
Ron
in
a
strangled
sort
of
voice
fleur
smiled
at
him
Hermione
scowled
goodbye
Arry
said
Fleur
turning
to
go
it
az
been
a
pleasure
meeting
you
harrys
spirits
couldn't
help
but
lift
slightly
as
he
watched
Fleur
hurry
back
across
the
lawns
to
Madame
Maxime
her
silvery
hair
rippling
in
the
sunlight
wonder
how
the
Durmstrang
students
are
getting
back
said
Ron
d
you
reckon
they
can
steer
that
ship
without
Karkaroff
karkaroff
did
not
steer
said
a
gruff
voice
he
stayed
in
his
cabin
and
let
us
do
the
vork
krum
had
come
to
say
goodbye
to
Hermione
could
I
have
a
vord
he
asked
her
oh
yes
all
right
said
Hermione
looking
slightly
flustered
and
following
Krum
through
the
crowd
and
out
of
sight
you'd
better
hurry
up
ron
called
loudly
after
her
the
carriages'll
be
here
in
a
minute
he
let
Harry
keep
a
watch
for
the
carriages
however
and
spent
the
next
few
minutes
craning
his
neck
over
the
crowd
to
try
and
see
what
Krum
and
Hermione
might
be
up
to
they
returned
quite
soon
ron
stared
at
Hermione
but
her
face
was
quite
impassive
i
liked
Diggory
said
Krum
abruptly
to
Harry
he
vos
alvays
polite
to
me
alvays
even
though
I
vos
from
Durmstrang
with
Karkaroff
he
added
scowling
have
you
got
a
new
headmaster
yet
said
Harry
Krum
shrugged
he
held
out
his
hand
as
Fleur
had
done
shook
harry's
hand
and
then
ron's
ron
looked
as
though
he
was
suffering
some
sort
of
painful
internal
struggle
krum
had
already
started
walking
away
when
Ron
burst
out
Can
I
have
your
autograph
hermione
turned
away
smiling
at
the
horseless
carriages
that
were
now
trundling
toward
them
up
the
drive
as
Krum
looking
surprised
but
gratified
signed
a
fragment
of
parchment
for
Ron
the
weather
could
not
have
been
more
different
on
the
journey
back
to
king's
Cross
than
it
had
been
on
their
way
to
Hogwarts
the
previous
September
there
wasn't
a
single
cloud
in
the
sky
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
had
managed
to
get
a
compartment
to
themselves
pigwidgeon
was
once
again
hidden
under
Rons
dress
robes
to
stop
him
from
hooting
continually
Hedwig
was
dozing
her
head
under
her
wing
and
Crookshanks
was
curled
up
in
a
spare
seat
like
a
large
furry
ginger
cushion
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
talked
more
fully
and
freely
than
they
had
all
week
as
the
train
sped
them
southward
harry
felt
as
though
dumbledore's
speech
at
the
Leaving
Feast
had
unblocked
him
somehow
it
was
less
painful
to
discuss
what
had
happened
now
they
broke
off
their
conversation
about
what
action
Dumbledore
might
be
taking
even
now
to
stop
Voldemort
only
when
the
lunch
trolley
arrived
when
Hermione
returned
from
the
trolley
and
put
her
money
back
into
her
schoolbag
she
dislodged
a
copy
of
the
Daily
Prophet
that
she
had
been
carrying
in
there
harry
looked
at
it
unsure
whether
he
really
wanted
to
know
what
it
might
say
but
Hermione
seeing
him
looking
at
it
said
calmly
there's
nothing
in
there
you
can
look
for
yourself
but
there's
nothing
at
all
i've
been
checking
every
day
just
a
small
piece
the
day
after
the
third
task
saying
you
won
the
tournament
they
didn't
even
mention
Cedric
nothing
about
any
of
it
if
you
ask
me
fudge
is
forcing
them
to
keep
quiet
he'll
never
keep
Rita
quiet
said
Harry
not
on
a
story
like
this
oh
Rita
hasn't
written
anything
at
all
since
the
third
task
said
Hermione
in
an
oddly
constrained
voice
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
added
her
voice
now
trembling
slightly
Rita
Skeeter
isn't
going
to
be
writing
anything
at
all
for
a
while
not
unless
she
wants
me
to
spill
the
beans
on
her
what
are
you
talking
about
said
Ron
i
found
out
how
she
was
listening
in
on
private
conversations
when
she
wasn't
supposed
to
be
coming
onto
the
grounds
said
Hermione
in
a
rush
harry
had
the
impression
that
Hermione
had
been
dying
to
tell
them
this
for
days
but
that
she
had
restrained
herself
in
light
of
everything
else
that
had
happened
how
was
she
doing
it
said
Harry
at
once
how
did
you
find
out
said
Ron
staring
at
her
well
it
was
you
really
who
gave
me
the
idea
harry
she
said
did
I
said
Harry
perplexed
how
bugging
said
Hermione
happily
but
you
said
they
didn't
work
oh
not
electronic
bugs
said
Hermione
no
you
see
rita
Skeeter
Hermiones
voice
trembled
with
quiet
triumph
is
an
unregistered
Animagus
she
can
turn
hermione
pulled
a
small
sealed
glass
jar
out
other
bag
into
a
beetle
you're
kidding
said
Ron
you
haven't
she's
not
oh
yes
she
is
said
Hermione
happily
brandishing
the
jar
at
them
inside
were
a
few
twigs
and
leaves
and
one
large
fat
beetle
that's
never
you're
kidding
Ron
whispered
lifting
the
jar
to
his
eyes
no
i'm
not
said
Hermione
beaming
i
caught
her
on
the
windowsill
in
the
hospital
wing
look
very
closely
and
you'll
notice
the
markings
around
her
antennae
are
exactly
like
those
foul
glasses
she
wears
harry
looked
and
saw
that
she
was
quite
right
he
also
remembered
something
there
was
a
beetle
on
the
statue
the
night
we
heard
Hagrid
telling
Madame
Maxime
about
his
mum
exactly
said
Hermione
and
Viktor
pulled
a
beetle
out
of
my
hair
after
we'd
had
our
conversation
by
the
lake
and
unless
i'm
very
much
mistaken
Rita
was
perched
on
the
windowsill
of
the
Divination
class
the
day
your
scar
hurt
she's
been
buzzing
around
for
stories
all
year
when
we
saw
Malfoy
under
that
tree
said
Ron
slowly
he
was
talking
to
her
in
his
hand
said
Hermione
he
knew
of
course
that's
how
she's
been
getting
all
those
nice
little
interviews
with
the
Slytherins
they
wouldn't
care
that
she
was
doing
something
illegal
as
long
as
they
were
giving
her
horrible
stuff
about
us
and
Hagrid
hermione
took
the
glass
jar
back
from
Ron
and
smiled
at
the
beetle
which
buzzed
angrily
against
the
glass
i've
told
her
i'll
let
her
out
when
we
get
back
to
London
said
Hermione
i've
put
an
Unbreakable
Charm
on
the
jar
you
see
so
she
can't
transform
and
i've
told
her
she's
to
keep
her
quill
to
herself
for
a
whole
year
see
if
she
can't
break
the
habit
of
writing
horrible
lies
about
people
smiling
serenely
Hermione
placed
the
beetle
back
inside
her
schoolbag
the
door
of
the
compartment
slid
open
very
clever
granger
said
Draco
Malfoy
crabbe
and
Goyle
were
standing
behind
him
all
three
of
them
looked
more
pleased
with
themselves
more
arrogant
and
more
menacing
than
Harry
had
ever
seen
them
so
said
Malfoy
slowly
advancing
slightly
into
the
compartment
and
looking
slowly
around
at
them
a
smirk
quivering
on
his
lips
you
caught
some
pathetic
reporter
and
potter's
dumbledore's
favorite
boy
again
big
deal
his
smirk
widened
crabbe
and
Goyle
leered
trying
not
to
think
about
it
are
we
said
Malfoy
softly
looking
around
at
all
three
of
them
trying
to
pretend
it
hasn't
happened
get
out
said
Harry
he
had
not
been
this
close
to
Malfoy
since
he
had
watched
him
muttering
to
Crabbe
and
Goyle
during
Dumbledores
speech
about
Cedric
he
could
feel
a
kind
of
ringing
in
his
ears
his
hand
gripped
his
wand
under
his
robes
you've
picked
the
losing
side
Potter
i
warned
you
i
told
you
you
ought
to
choose
your
company
more
carefully
remember
when
we
met
on
the
train
first
day
at
Hogwarts
i
told
you
not
to
hang
around
with
riffraff
like
this
he
jerked
his
head
at
Ron
and
Hermione
too
late
now
potter
they'll
be
the
first
to
go
now
the
Dark
lord's
back
mudbloods
and
Mugglelovers
first
well
second
Diggory
was
the
f
it
was
as
though
someone
had
exploded
a
box
of
fireworks
within
the
compartment
blinded
by
the
blaze
of
the
spells
that
had
blasted
from
every
direction
deafened
by
a
series
of
bangs
Harry
blinked
and
looked
down
at
the
floor
malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
were
all
lying
unconscious
in
the
doorway
he
Ron
and
Hermione
were
on
their
feet
all
three
of
them
having
used
a
different
hex
nor
were
they
the
only
ones
to
have
done
so
thought
we'd
see
what
those
three
were
up
to
said
Fred
matteroffactly
stepping
onto
Goyle
and
into
the
compartment
he
had
his
wand
out
and
so
did
George
who
was
careful
to
tread
on
Malfoy
as
he
followed
Fred
inside
interesting
effect
said
George
looking
down
at
Crabbe
who
used
the
Furnunculus
Curse
me
said
Harry
odd
said
George
lightly
i
used
JellyLegs
looks
as
though
those
two
shouldn't
be
mixed
he
seems
to
have
sprouted
little
tentacles
all
over
his
face
well
let's
not
leave
them
here
they
don't
add
much
to
the
decor
ron
Harry
and
George
kicked
rolled
and
pushed
the
unconscious
Malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
each
of
whom
looked
distinctly
the
worse
for
the
jumble
of
jinxes
with
which
they
had
been
hit
out
into
the
corridor
then
came
back
into
the
compartment
and
rolled
the
door
shut
exploding
Snap
anyone
said
Fred
pulling
out
a
pack
of
cards
they
were
halfway
through
their
fifth
game
when
Harry
decided
to
ask
them
you
going
to
tell
us
then
he
said
to
George
who
you
were
blackmailing
oh
said
George
darkly
that
it
doesn't
matter
said
Fred
shaking
his
head
impatiently
it
wasn't
anything
important
not
now
anyway
we've
given
up
said
George
shrugging
but
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
kept
on
asking
and
finally
Fred
said
All
right
all
right
if
you
really
want
to
know
it
was
Ludo
Bagman
bagman
said
Harry
sharply
are
you
saying
he
was
involved
in
nah
said
George
gloomily
nothing
like
that
stupid
git
he
wouldn't
have
the
brains
well
what
then
said
Ron
fred
hesitated
then
said
You
remember
that
bet
we
had
with
him
at
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
about
how
Ireland
would
win
but
Krum
would
get
the
Snitch
yeah
said
Harry
and
Ron
slowly
well
the
git
paid
us
in
leprechaun
gold
he'd
caught
from
the
Irish
mascots
so
so
said
Fred
impatiently
it
vanished
didn't
it
by
next
morning
it
had
gone
but
it
must've
been
an
accident
mustn't
it
said
Hermione
george
laughed
very
bitterly
yeah
that's
what
we
thought
at
first
we
thought
if
we
just
wrote
to
him
and
told
him
he'd
made
a
mistake
he'd
cough
up
but
nothing
doing
ignored
our
letter
we
kept
trying
to
talk
to
him
about
it
at
Hogwarts
but
he
was
always
making
some
excuse
to
get
away
from
us
in
the
end
he
turned
pretty
nasty
said
Fred
told
us
we
were
too
young
to
gamble
and
he
wasn't
giving
us
anything
so
we
asked
for
our
money
back
said
George
glowering
he
didn't
refuse
gasped
Hermione
right
in
one
said
Fred
but
that
was
all
your
savings
said
Ron
tell
me
about
it
said
George
course
we
found
out
what
was
going
on
in
the
end
lee
jordan's
dad
had
had
a
bit
of
trouble
getting
money
off
Bagman
as
well
turns
out
he's
in
big
trouble
with
the
goblins
borrowed
loads
of
gold
off
them
a
gang
of
them
cornered
him
in
the
woods
after
the
World
Cup
and
took
all
the
gold
he
had
and
it
still
wasn't
enough
to
cover
all
his
debts
they
followed
him
all
the
way
to
Hogwarts
to
keep
an
eye
on
him
he's
lost
everything
gambling
hasn't
got
two
Galleons
to
rub
together
and
you
know
how
the
idiot
tried
to
pay
the
goblins
back
how
said
Harry
he
put
a
bet
on
you
mate
said
Fred
put
a
big
bet
on
you
to
win
the
tournament
bet
against
the
goblins
so
that's
why
he
kept
trying
to
help
me
win
said
Harry
well
I
did
win
didn't
I
so
he
can
pay
you
your
gold
nope
said
George
shaking
his
head
the
goblins
play
as
dirty
as
him
they
say
you
drew
with
Diggory
and
Bagman
was
betting
you'd
win
outright
so
Bagman
had
to
run
for
it
he
did
run
for
it
right
after
the
third
task
george
sighed
deeply
and
started
dealing
out
the
cards
again
the
rest
of
the
journey
passed
pleasantly
enough
Harry
wished
it
could
have
gone
on
all
summer
in
fact
and
that
he
would
never
arrive
at
king's
Cross
but
as
he
had
learned
the
hard
way
that
year
time
will
not
slow
down
when
something
unpleasant
lies
ahead
and
all
too
soon
the
Hogwarts
Express
was
pulling
in
at
platform
nine
and
threequarters
the
usual
confusion
and
noise
filled
the
corridors
as
the
students
began
to
disembark
ron
and
Hermione
struggled
out
past
Malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
carrying
their
trunks
harry
however
stayed
put
fred
George
wait
a
moment
the
twins
turned
harry
pulled
open
his
trunk
and
drew
out
his
Triwizard
winnings
take
it
he
said
and
he
thrust
the
sack
into
george's
hands
what
said
Fred
looking
flabbergasted
take
it
Harry
repeated
firmly
i
don't
want
it
you're
mental
said
George
trying
to
push
it
back
at
Harry
no
i'm
not
said
Harry
you
take
it
and
get
inventing
it's
for
the
joke
shop
he
is
mental
Fred
said
in
an
almost
awed
voice
listen
said
Harry
firmly
if
you
don't
take
it
i'm
throwing
it
down
the
drain
i
don't
want
it
and
I
don't
need
it
but
I
could
do
with
a
few
laughs
we
could
all
do
with
a
few
laughs
i've
got
a
feeling
we're
going
to
need
them
more
than
usual
before
long
harry
said
George
weakly
weighing
the
money
bag
in
his
hands
there's
got
to
be
a
thousand
Galleons
in
here
yeah
said
Harry
grinning
think
how
many
Canary
Creams
that
is
the
twins
stared
at
him
just
don't
tell
your
mum
where
you
got
it
although
she
might
not
be
so
keen
for
you
to
join
the
Ministry
anymore
come
to
think
of
it
harry
Fred
began
but
Harry
pulled
out
his
wand
look
he
said
flatly
take
it
or
i'll
hex
you
i
know
some
good
ones
now
just
do
me
one
favor
okay
buy
Ron
some
different
dress
robes
and
say
they're
from
you
he
left
the
compartment
before
they
could
say
another
word
stepping
over
Malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
who
were
still
lying
on
the
floor
covered
in
hex
marks
uncle
Vernon
was
waiting
beyond
the
barrier
mrs
weasley
was
close
by
him
she
hugged
Harry
very
tightly
when
she
saw
him
and
whispered
in
his
ear
I
think
Dumbledore
will
let
you
come
to
us
later
in
the
summer
keep
in
touch
Harry
see
you
harry
said
Ron
clapping
him
on
the
back
bye
Harry
said
Hermione
and
she
did
something
she
had
never
done
before
and
kissed
him
on
the
cheek
harry
thanks
George
muttered
while
Fred
nodded
fervently
at
his
side
harry
winked
at
them
turned
to
Uncle
Vernon
and
followed
him
silently
from
the
station
there
was
no
point
worrying
yet
he
told
himself
as
he
got
into
the
back
of
the
Dursleys
car
as
Hagrid
had
said
what
would
come
would
come
and
he
would
have
to
meet
it
when
it
did
