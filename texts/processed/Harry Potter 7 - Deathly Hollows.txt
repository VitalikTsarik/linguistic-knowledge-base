chapter
One
The
Dark
Lord
Ascending
the
two
men
appeared
out
of
nowhere
a
few
yards
apart
in
the
narrow
moonlit
lane
for
a
second
they
stood
quite
still
wands
directed
at
each
other's
chests
then
recognizing
each
other
they
stowed
their
wands
beneath
their
cloaks
and
started
walking
briskly
in
the
same
direction
news
asked
the
taller
of
the
two
the
best
replied
Severus
Snape
the
lane
was
bordered
on
the
left
by
wild
low-growing
brambles
on
the
right
by
a
high
neatly
manicured
hedge
the
men's
long
cloaks
flapped
around
their
ankles
as
they
marched
thought
I
might
be
late
said
Yaxley
his
blunt
features
sliding
in
and
out
of
sight
as
the
branches
of
overhanging
trees
broke
the
moonlight
it
was
a
little
trickier
than
I
expected
but
I
hope
he
will
be
satisfied
you
sound
confident
that
your
reception
will
be
good
snape
nodded
but
did
not
elaborate
they
turned
right
into
a
wide
driveway
that
led
off
the
lane
the
high
hedge
curved
into
them
running
off
into
the
distance
beyond
the
pair
of
imposing
wrought-iron
gates
barring
the
mens
way
neither
of
them
broke
step
In
silence
both
raised
their
left
arms
in
a
kind
of
salute
and
passed
straight
through
as
though
the
dark
metal
was
smoke
the
yew
hedges
muffled
the
sound
of
the
mens
footsteps
there
was
a
rustle
somewhere
to
their
right
Yaxley
drew
his
wand
again
pointing
it
over
his
companions
head
but
the
source
of
the
noise
proved
to
be
nothing
more
than
a
pure-white
peacock
strutting
majestically
along
the
top
of
the
hedge
he
always
did
himself
well
Lucius
peacocks
yaxley
thrust
his
wand
back
under
his
cloak
with
a
snort
a
handsome
manor
house
grew
out
of
the
darkness
at
the
end
of
the
straight
drive
lights
glinting
in
the
diamond
paned
downstairs
windows
somewhere
in
the
dark
garden
beyond
the
hedge
a
fountain
was
playing
gravel
crackled
beneath
their
feet
as
Snape
and
Yaxley
sped
toward
the
front
door
which
swung
inward
at
their
approach
though
nobody
had
visibly
opened
it
the
hallway
was
large
dimly
lit
and
sumptuously
decorated
with
a
magnificent
carpet
covering
most
of
the
stone
floor
the
eyes
of
the
pale-faced
portraits
on
the
wall
followed
Snape
and
Yaxley
as
they
strode
past
the
two
men
halted
at
a
heavy
wooden
door
leading
into
the
next
room
hesitated
for
the
space
of
a
heartbeat
then
Snape
turned
the
bronze
handle
the
drawing
room
was
full
of
silent
people
sitting
at
a
long
and
ornate
table
the
rooms
usual
furniture
had
been
pushed
carelessly
up
against
the
walls
illumination
came
from
a
roaring
fire
beneath
a
handsome
marble
mantelpiece
surmounted
by
a
gilded
mirror
snape
and
Yaxley
lingered
for
a
moment
on
the
threshold
as
their
eyes
grew
accustomed
to
the
lack
of
light
they
were
drawn
upward
to
the
strangest
feature
of
the
scene
an
apparently
unconscious
human
figure
hanging
upside
down
over
the
table
revolving
slowly
as
if
suspended
by
an
invisible
rope
and
reflected
in
the
mirror
and
in
the
bare
polished
surface
of
the
table
below
none
of
the
people
seated
underneath
this
singular
sight
were
looking
at
it
except
for
a
pale
young
man
sitting
almost
directly
below
it
he
seemed
unable
to
prevent
himself
from
glancing
upward
every
minute
or
so
yaxley
snape
said
a
high
clear
voice
from
the
head
of
the
table
you
are
very
nearly
late
the
speaker
was
seated
directly
in
front
of
the
fireplace
so
that
it
was
difficult
at
first
for
the
new
arrivals
to
make
out
more
than
his
silhouette
as
they
drew
nearer
however
his
face
shone
through
the
gloom
hairless
snakelike
with
slits
for
nostrils
and
gleaming
red
eyes
whose
pupils
were
vertical
he
was
so
pale
that
he
seemed
to
emit
a
pearly
glow
severus
here
said
Voldemort
indicating
the
seat
on
his
immediate
right
yaxley
beside
Dolohov
the
two
men
took
their
allotted
places
most
of
the
eyes
around
the
table
followed
Snape
and
it
was
to
him
that
Voldemort
spoke
first
so
my
Lord
the
Order
of
the
Phoenix
intends
to
move
Harry
Potter
from
his
current
place
of
safety
on
Saturday
next
at
nightfall
the
interest
around
the
table
sharpened
palpably
Some
stiffened
others
fidgeted
all
gazing
at
Snape
and
Voldemort
saturday
at
nightfall
repeated
Voldemort
his
red
eyes
fastened
upon
Snapes
black
ones
with
such
intensity
that
some
of
the
watchers
looked
away
apparently
fearful
that
they
themselves
would
be
scorched
by
the
ferocity
of
the
gaze
snape
however
looked
calmly
back
into
Voldemorts
face
and
after
a
moment
or
two
Voldemorts
lipless
mouth
curved
into
something
like
a
smile
good
very
good
and
this
information
comes
from
the
source
we
discussed
said
Snape
my
Lord
yaxley
had
leaned
forward
to
look
down
the
long
table
at
Voldemort
and
Snape
all
faces
turned
to
him
my
Lord
I
have
heard
differently
yaxley
waited
but
Voldemort
did
not
speak
so
he
went
on
Dawlish
the
Auror
let
slip
that
Potter
will
not
be
moved
until
the
thirtieth
the
night
before
the
boy
turns
seventeen
snape
was
smiling
my
source
told
me
that
there
are
plans
to
lay
a
false
trail
this
must
be
it
no
doubt
a
Confundus
Charm
has
been
placed
upon
Dawlish
it
would
not
be
the
first
time
he
is
known
to
be
susceptible
i
assure
you
my
Lord
Dawlish
seemed
quite
certain
said
Yaxley
if
he
has
been
Confunded
naturally
he
is
certain
said
Snape
i
assure
you
Yaxley
the
Auror
Office
will
play
no
further
part
in
the
protection
of
Harry
Potter
the
Order
believes
that
we
have
infiltrated
the
Ministry
the
Orders
got
one
thing
right
then
eh
said
a
squat
man
sitting
a
short
distance
from
Yaxley
he
gave
a
wheezy
giggle
that
was
echoed
here
and
there
along
the
table
voldemort
did
not
laugh
his
gaze
had
wandered
upward
to
the
body
revolving
slowly
overhead
and
he
seemed
to
be
lost
in
thought
my
Lord
Yaxley
went
on
Dawlish
believes
an
entire
party
of
Aurors
will
be
used
to
transfer
the
boy
voldemort
held
up
a
large
white
hand
and
Yaxley
subsided
at
once
watching
resentfully
as
Voldemort
turned
back
to
Snape
where
are
they
going
to
hide
the
boy
next
at
the
home
of
one
of
the
Order
said
Snape
the
place
according
to
the
source
has
been
given
every
protection
that
the
Order
and
Ministry
together
could
provide
i
think
that
there
is
little
chance
of
taking
him
once
he
is
there
my
Lord
unless
of
course
the
Ministry
has
fallen
before
next
Saturday
which
might
give
us
the
opportunity
to
discover
and
undo
enough
of
the
enchantments
to
break
through
the
rest
well
Yaxley
voldemort
called
down
the
table
the
firelight
glinting
strangely
in
his
red
eyes
will
the
Ministry
have
fallen
by
next
Saturday
once
again
all
heads
turned
yaxley
squared
his
shoulders
my
Lord
I
have
good
news
on
that
score
i
have
with
difficulty
and
after
great
effort
succeeded
in
placing
an
Imperius
Curse
upon
Pius
Thicknesse
many
of
those
sitting
around
Yaxley
looked
impressed
his
neighbor
Dolohov
a
man
with
a
long
twisted
face
clapped
him
on
the
back
it
is
a
start
said
Voldemort
but
Thicknesse
is
only
one
man
scrimgeour
must
be
surrounded
by
our
people
before
I
act
one
failed
attempt
on
the
Ministers
life
will
set
me
back
a
long
way
yes
my
Lord
that
is
true
but
you
know
as
Head
of
the
Department
of
Magical
Law
Enforcement
Thicknesse
has
regular
contact
not
only
with
the
Minister
himself
but
also
with
the
Heads
of
all
the
other
Ministry
departments
it
will
I
think
be
easy
now
that
we
have
such
a
high-ranking
official
under
our
control
to
subjugate
the
others
and
then
they
can
all
work
together
to
bring
Scrimgeour
down
as
long
as
our
friend
Thicknesse
is
not
discovered
before
he
has
converted
the
rest
said
Voldemort
at
any
rate
it
remains
unlikely
that
the
Ministry
will
be
mine
before
next
Saturday
if
we
cannot
touch
the
boy
at
his
destination
then
it
must
be
done
while
he
travels
we
are
at
an
advantage
there
my
Lord
said
Yaxley
who
seemed
determined
to
receive
some
portion
of
approval
we
now
have
several
people
planted
within
the
Department
of
Magical
Transport
if
Potter
Apparates
or
uses
the
Floo
Network
we
shall
know
immediately
he
will
not
do
either
said
Snape
the
Order
is
eschewing
any
form
of
transport
that
is
controlled
or
regulated
by
the
Ministry
they
mistrust
everything
to
do
with
the
place
all
the
better
said
Voldemort
he
will
have
to
move
in
the
open
easier
to
take
by
far
again
Voldemort
looked
up
at
the
slowly
revolving
body
as
he
went
on
I
shall
attend
to
the
boy
in
person
there
have
been
too
many
mistakes
where
Harry
Potter
is
concerned
some
of
them
have
been
my
own
that
Potter
lives
is
due
more
to
my
errors
than
to
his
triumphs
the
company
around
the
table
watched
Voldemort
apprehensively
each
of
them
by
his
or
her
expression
afraid
that
they
might
be
blamed
for
Harry
Potters
continued
existence
voldemort
however
seemed
to
be
speaking
more
to
himself
than
to
any
of
them
still
addressing
the
unconscious
body
above
him
i
have
been
careless
and
so
have
been
thwarted
by
luck
and
chance
those
wreckers
of
all
but
the
best-laid
plans
but
I
know
better
now
i
understand
those
things
that
I
did
not
understand
before
i
must
be
the
one
to
kill
Harry
Potter
and
I
shall
be
at
these
words
seemingly
in
response
to
them
a
sudden
wail
sounded
a
terrible
drawn-out
cry
of
misery
and
pain
many
of
those
at
the
table
looked
downward
startled
for
the
sound
had
seemed
to
issue
from
below
their
feet
wormtail
said
Voldemort
with
no
change
in
his
quiet
thoughtful
tone
and
without
removing
his
eyes
from
the
revolving
body
above
have
I
not
spoken
to
you
about
keeping
our
prisoner
quiet
yes
m-my
Lord
gasped
a
small
man
halfway
down
the
table
who
had
been
sitting
so
low
in
his
chair
that
it
appeared
at
first
glance
to
be
unoccupied
now
he
scrambled
from
his
seat
and
scurried
from
the
room
leaving
nothing
behind
him
but
a
curious
gleam
of
silver
as
I
was
saying
continued
Voldemort
looking
again
at
the
tense
faces
of
his
followers
I
understand
better
now
i
shall
need
for
instance
to
borrow
a
wand
from
one
of
you
before
I
go
to
kill
Potter
the
faces
around
him
displayed
nothing
but
shock
he
might
have
announced
that
he
wanted
to
borrow
one
of
their
arms
no
volunteers
said
Voldemort
lets
see
lucius
I
see
no
reason
for
you
to
have
a
wand
anymore
lucius
Malfoy
looked
up
his
skin
appeared
yellowish
and
waxy
in
the
firelight
and
his
eyes
were
sunken
and
shadowed
when
he
spoke
his
voice
was
hoarse
my
Lord
your
wand
Lucius
i
require
your
wand
malfoy
glanced
sideways
at
his
wife
she
was
staring
straight
ahead
quite
as
pale
as
he
was
her
long
blonde
hair
hanging
down
her
back
but
beneath
the
table
her
slim
fingers
closed
briefly
on
his
wrist
at
her
touch
Malfoy
put
his
hand
into
his
robes
withdrew
a
wand
and
passed
it
along
to
Voldemort
who
held
it
up
in
front
of
his
red
eyes
examining
it
closely
what
is
it
elm
my
Lord
whispered
Malfoy
and
the
core
dragon
dragon
heartstring
good
said
Voldemort
he
drew
out
his
wand
and
compared
the
lengths
lucius
Malfoy
made
an
involuntary
movement
for
a
fraction
of
a
second
it
seemed
he
expected
to
receive
Voldemorts
wand
in
exchange
for
his
own
the
gesture
was
not
missed
by
Voldemort
whose
eyes
widened
maliciously
give
you
my
wand
Lucius
my
wand
some
of
the
throng
sniggered
i
have
given
you
your
liberty
Lucius
is
that
not
enough
for
you
but
I
have
noticed
that
you
and
your
family
seem
less
than
happy
of
late
what
is
it
about
my
presence
in
your
home
that
displaces
you
Lucius
nothing
nothing
my
Lord
such
lies
Lucius
the
soft
voice
seemed
to
hiss
on
even
after
the
cruel
mouth
had
stopped
moving
one
or
two
of
the
wizards
barely
repressed
a
shudder
as
the
hissing
grew
louder
something
heavy
could
be
heard
sliding
across
the
floor
beneath
the
table
the
huge
snake
emerged
to
climb
slowly
up
Voldemorts
chair
it
rose
seemingly
endlessly
and
came
to
rest
across
Voldemorts
shoulders
its
neck
the
thickness
of
a
mans
thigh
its
eyes
with
their
vertical
slits
for
pupils
unblinking
voldemort
stroked
the
creature
absently
with
long
thin
fingers
still
looking
at
Lucius
Malfoy
why
do
the
Malfoys
look
so
unhappy
with
their
lot
is
my
return
my
rise
to
power
not
the
very
thing
they
professed
to
desire
for
so
many
years
of
course
my
Lord
said
Lucius
Malfoy
his
hand
shook
as
he
wiped
sweat
from
his
upper
lip
we
did
desire
it
we
do
to
Malfoys
left
his
wife
made
an
odd
stiff
nod
her
eyes
averted
from
Voldemort
and
the
snake
to
his
right
his
son
Draco
who
had
been
gazing
up
at
the
inert
body
overhead
glanced
quickly
at
Voldemort
and
away
again
terrified
to
make
eye
contact
my
Lord
said
a
dark
woman
halfway
down
the
table
her
voice
constricted
with
emotion
it
is
an
honor
to
have
you
here
in
our
familys
house
there
can
be
no
higher
pleasure
she
sat
beside
her
sister
as
unlike
her
in
looks
with
her
dark
hair
and
heavily
lidded
eyes
as
she
was
in
bearing
and
demeanor
where
Narcissa
sat
rigid
and
impassive
Bellatrix
leaned
toward
Voldemort
for
mere
words
could
not
demonstrate
her
longing
for
closeness
no
higher
pleasure
repeated
Voldemort
his
head
tilted
a
little
to
one
side
as
he
considered
Bellatrix
that
means
a
great
deal
Bellatrix
from
you
her
face
flooded
with
color
her
eyes
welled
with
tears
of
delight
my
Lord
knows
I
speak
nothing
but
the
truth
no
higher
pleasure
even
compared
with
the
happy
event
that
I
hear
has
taken
place
in
your
family
this
week
she
stared
at
him
her
lips
parted
evidently
confused
i
dont
know
what
you
mean
my
Lord
im
talking
about
your
niece
Bellatrix
and
yours
Lucius
and
Narcissa
she
has
just
married
the
werewolf
Remus
Lupin
you
must
be
so
proud
there
was
an
eruption
of
jeering
laughter
from
around
the
table
many
leaned
forward
to
exchange
gleeful
looks
a
few
thumped
the
table
with
their
fists
the
giant
snake
disliking
the
disturbance
opened
its
mouth
wide
and
hissed
angrily
but
the
Death
Eaters
did
not
hear
it
so
jubilant
were
they
at
Bellatrix
and
the
Malfoys
humiliation
bellatrixs
face
so
recently
flushed
wit
happiness
had
turned
an
ugly
blotchy
red
she
is
no
niece
of
ours
my
Lord
she
cried
over
the
outpouring
of
mirth
we
Narcissa
and
I
have
never
set
eyes
on
our
sister
since
she
married
the
Mudblood
this
brat
has
nothing
to
do
with
either
of
us
nor
any
beast
she
marries
what
say
you
Draco
asked
Voldemort
and
though
his
voice
was
quiet
it
carried
clearly
through
the
catcalls
and
jeers
will
you
babysit
the
cubs
the
hilarity
mounted
Draco
Malfoy
looked
in
terror
at
his
father
who
was
staring
down
into
his
own
lap
then
caught
his
mothers
eye
she
shook
her
head
almost
imperceptibly
then
resumed
her
own
deadpan
stare
at
the
opposite
wall
enough
said
Voldemort
stroking
the
angry
snake
enough
and
the
laughter
died
at
once
many
of
our
oldest
family
trees
become
a
little
diseased
over
time
he
said
as
Bellatrix
gazed
at
him
breathless
and
imploring
You
must
prune
yours
must
you
not
to
keep
it
healthy
cut
away
those
parts
that
threaten
the
health
of
the
rest
yes
my
Lord
whispered
Bellatrix
and
her
eyes
swam
with
tears
of
gratitude
again
at
the
first
chance
you
shall
have
it
said
Voldemort
and
in
your
family
so
in
the
world
we
shall
cut
away
the
canker
that
infects
us
until
only
those
of
the
true
blood
remain
voldemort
raised
Lucius
Malfoys
wand
pointed
it
directly
at
the
slowly
revolving
figure
suspended
over
the
table
and
gave
it
a
tiny
flick
the
figure
came
to
life
with
a
groan
and
began
to
struggle
against
invisible
bonds
do
you
recognize
our
guest
Severus
asked
Voldemort
snape
raised
his
eyes
to
the
upside
down
face
all
of
the
Death
Eaters
were
looking
up
at
the
captive
now
as
though
they
had
been
given
permission
to
show
curiosity
as
she
revolved
to
face
the
firelight
the
woman
said
in
a
cracked
and
terrified
voice
Severus
help
me
ah
yes
said
Snape
as
the
prisoner
turned
slowly
away
again
and
you
Draco
asked
Voldemort
stroking
the
snakes
snout
with
his
wand-free
hand
draco
shook
his
head
jerkily
now
that
the
woman
had
woken
he
seemed
unable
to
look
at
her
anymore
but
you
would
not
have
taken
her
classes
said
Voldemort
for
those
of
you
who
do
not
know
we
are
joined
here
tonight
by
Charity
Burbage
who
until
recently
taught
at
Hogwarts
School
of
Witchcraft
and
Wizardry
there
were
small
noises
of
comprehension
around
the
table
a
broad
hunched
woman
with
pointed
teeth
cackled
yes
professor
Burbage
taught
the
children
of
witches
and
wizards
all
about
Muggles
how
they
are
not
so
different
from
us
one
of
the
Death
Eaters
spat
on
the
floor
charity
Burbage
revolved
to
face
Snape
again
severus
please
please
silence
said
Voldemort
with
another
twitch
of
Malfoys
wand
and
Charity
fell
silent
as
if
gagged
not
content
with
corrupting
and
polluting
the
minds
of
Wizarding
children
last
week
Professor
Burbage
wrote
an
impassioned
defense
of
Mudbloods
in
the
Daily
Prophet
wizards
she
says
must
accept
these
thieves
of
their
knowledge
and
magic
the
dwindling
of
the
purebloods
is
says
Professor
Burbage
a
most
desirable
circumstance
she
would
have
us
all
mate
with
Muggles
or
no
doubt
werewolves
nobody
laughed
this
time
there
was
no
mistaking
the
anger
and
contempt
in
Voldemorts
voice
for
the
third
time
Charity
Burbage
revolved
to
face
Snape
tears
were
pouring
from
her
eyes
into
her
hair
snape
looked
back
at
her
quite
impassive
as
she
turned
slowly
away
from
him
again
avada

the
flash
of
green
light
illuminated
every
corner
of
the
room
charity
fell
with
a
resounding
crash
onto
the
table
below
which
trembled
and
creaked
several
of
the
Death
Eaters
leapt
back
in
their
chairs
draco
fell

of

onto

and

and
slithered
from

shoulders
onto
the
polished
wood
chapter
Two
in
Memorandum
harry
was
bleeding
clutching
his
right
hand
in
his
left
and
swearing
under
his
breath
he
shouldered
open
his
bedroom
door
there
was
a
crunch
of
breaking
china
he
had
trodden
on
a
cup
of
cold
tea
that
had
been
sitting
on
the
floor
outside
his
bedroom
door
what
the
he
looked
around
the
landing
of
number
four
Privet
Drive
was
deserted
possibly
the
cup
of
tea
was
dudley's
idea
of
a
clever
booby
trap
keeping
his
bleeding
hand
elevated
Harry
scraped
the
fragments
of
cup
together
with
the
other
hand
and
threw
them
into
the
already
crammed
bin
just
visible
inside
his
bedroom
door
then
he
tramped
across
to
the
bathroom
to
run
his
finger
under
the
tap
it
was
stupid
pointless
irritating
beyond
belief
that
he
still
had
four
days
left
of
being
unable
to
perform
magic
but
he
had
to
admit
to
himself
that
this
jagged
cut
in
his
finger
would
have
defeated
him
he
had
never
learned
how
to
repair
wounds
and
now
he
came
to
think
of
it
particularly
in
light
of
his
immediate
plans
this
seemed
a
serious
flaw
in
his
magical
education
making
a
mental
note
to
ask
Hermione
how
it
was
done
he
used
a
large
wad
of
toilet
paper
to
mop
up
as
much
of
the
tea
as
he
could
before
returning
to
his
bedroom
and
slamming
the
door
behind
him
harry
had
spent
the
morning
completely
emptying
his
school
trunk
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
packed
it
six
years
ago
at
the
start
of
the
intervening
school
years
he
had
merely
skimmed
off
the
topmost
three
quarters
of
the
contents
and
replaced
or
updated
them
leaving
a
layer
of
general
debris
at
the
bottom
old
quills
desiccated
beetle
eyes
single
socks
that
no
longer
fit
minutes
previously
Harry
had
plunged
his
hand
into
this
mulch
experienced
a
stabbing
pain
in
the
fourth
finger
of
his
right
hand
and
withdrawn
it
to
see
a
lot
of
blood
he
now
proceeded
a
little
more
cautiously
kneeling
down
beside
the
trunk
again
he
groped
around
in
the
bottom
and
after
retrieving
an
old
badge
that
flickered
feebly
between
support
cedric
diggory
and
potter
stinks
a
cracked
and
worn-out
Sneakoscope
and
a
gold
locket
inside
which
a
note
signed
R
a.b.
had
been
hidden
he
finally
discovered
the
sharp
edge
that
had
done
the
damage
he
recognized
it
at
once
it
was
a
two-inch-long
fragment
of
the
enchanted
mirror
that
his
dead
godfather
Sirius
had
given
him
harry
laid
it
aside
and
felt
cautiously
around
the
trunk
for
the
rest
but
nothing
more
remained
of
his
godfather's
last
gift
except
powdered
glass
which
clung
to
the
deepest
layer
of
debris
like
glittering
grit
harry
sat
up
and
examined
the
jagged
piece
on
which
he
had
cut
himself
seeing
nothing
but
his
own
bright
green
eye
reflected
back
at
him
then
he
placed
the
fragment
on
top
of
that
morning's
Daily
prophet
which
lay
unread
on
the
bed
and
attempted
to
stem
the
sudden
upsurge
of
bitter
memories
the
stabs
of
regret
and
of
longing
the
discovery
of
the
broken
mirror
had
occasioned
by
attacking
the
rest
of
the
rubbish
in
the
trunk
it
took
another
hour
to
empty
it
completely
throw
away
the
useless
items
and
sort
the
remainder
in
piles
according
to
whether
or
not
he
would
need
them
from
now
on
his
school
and
Quidditch
robes
cauldron
parchment
quills
and
most
of
his
textbooks
were
piled
in
a
corner
to
be
left
behind
he
wondered
what
his
aunt
and
uncle
would
do
with
them
burn
them
in
the
dead
of
night
probably
as
if
they
were
evidence
of
some
dreadful
crime
his
Muggle
clothing
Invisibility
Cloak
potion-making
kit
certain
books
the
photograph
album
Hagrid
had
once
given
him
a
stack
of
letters
and
his
wand
had
been
repacked
into
an
old
rucksack
in
a
front
pocket
were
the
marauder's
Map
and
the
locket
with
the
note
signed
R
a.b.
inside
it
the
locket
was
accorded
this
place
of
honor
not
because
it
was
valuable
in
all
usual
senses
it
was
worthless
but
because
of
what
it
had
cost
to
attain
it
this
left
a
sizable
stack
of
newspapers
sitting
on
his
desk
beside
his
snowy
owl
Hedwig
one
for
each
of
the
days
Harry
had
spent
at
Privet
Drive
this
summer
he
got
up
off
the
floor
stretched
and
moved
across
to
his
desk
hedwig
made
no
movement
as
he
began
to
flick
through
newspapers
throwing
them
into
the
rubbish
pile
one
by
one
the
owl
was
asleep
or
else
faking
she
was
angry
with
Harry
about
the
limited
amount
of
time
she
was
allowed
out
of
her
cage
at
the
moment
as
he
neared
the
bottom
of
the
pile
of
newspapers
Harry
slowed
down
searching
for
one
particular
issue
that
he
knew
had
arrived
shortly
after
he
had
returned
to
Privet
Drive
for
the
summer
he
remembered
that
there
had
been
a
small
mention
on
the
front
about
the
resignation
of
Charity
Burbage
the
Muggle
Studies
teacher
at
Hogwarts
at
last
he
found
it
turning
to
page
ten
he
sank
into
his
desk
chair
and
reread
the
article
he
had
been
looking
for
albus
dumbledore
remembered
by
Elphias
Doge
i
met
Albus
Dumbledore
at
the
age
of
eleven
on
our
first
day
at
Hogwarts
our
mutual
attraction
was
undoubtedly
due
to
the
fact
that
we
both
felt
ourselves
to
be
outsiders
i
had
contracted
dragon
pox
shortly
before
arriving
at
school
and
while
i
was
no
longer
contagious
my
pock-marked
visage
and
greenish
hue
did
not
encourage
many
to
approach
me
for
his
part
Albus
had
arrived
at
Hogwarts
under
the
burden
of
unwanted
notoriety
scarcely
a
year
previously
his
father
Percival
had
been
convicted
of
a
savage
and
well-publicized
attack
upon
three
young
Muggles
albus
never
attempted
to
deny
that
his
father
who
was
to
die
in
Azkaban
had
committed
this
crime
on
the
contrary
when
I
plucked
up
courage
to
ask
him
he
assured
me
that
he
knew
his
father
to
be
guilty
beyond
that
Dumbledore
refused
to
speak
of
the
sad
business
though
many
attempted
to
make
him
do
so
some
indeed
were
disposed
to
praise
his
father's
action
and
assumed
that
Albus
too
was
a
muggle-hater
they
could
not
have
been
more
mistaken
As
anybody
who
knew
Albus
would
attest
he
never
revealed
the
remotest
anti-Muggle
tendency
indeed
his
determined
support
for
Muggle
rights
gained
him
many
enemies
in
subsequent
years
in
a
matter
of
months
however
albus's
own
fame
had
begun
to
eclipse
that
of
his
father
by
the
end
of
his
first
year
he
would
never
again
be
known
as
the
son
of
a
muggle-hater
but
as
nothing
more
or
less
than
the
most
brilliant
student
ever
seen
at
the
school
those
of
us
who
were
privileged
to
be
his
friends
benefited
from
his
example
not
to
mention
his
help
and
encouragement
with
which
he
was
always
generous
he
confessed
to
me
later
in
life
that
he
knew
even
then
that
his
greatest
pleasure
lay
in
teaching
he
not
only
won
every
prize
of
note
that
the
school
offered
he
was
soon
in
regular
correspondence
with
the
most
notable
magical
names
of
the
day
including
Nicolas
Flamel
the
celebrated
alchemist
Bathilda
Bagshot
the
noted
historian
and
Adalbert
Waffling
the
magical
theoretician
several
of
his
papers
found
their
way
into
learned
publications
such
as
Transfiguration
Today
Challenges
in
Charming
and
The
Practical
Potioneer
dumbledore's
future
career
seemed
likely
to
be
meteoric
and
the
only
question
that
remained
was
when
he
would
become
Minister
of
Magic
though
it
was
often
predicted
in
later
years
that
he
was
on
the
point
of
taking
the
job
however
he
never
had
Ministerial
ambitions
three
years
after
we
had
started
at
Hogwarts
albus's
brother
Aberforth
arrived
at
school
they
were
not
alike
Aberforth
was
never
bookish
and
unlike
Albus
preferred
to
settle
arguments
by
dueling
rather
than
through
reasoned
discussion
however
it
is
quite
wrong
to
suggest
as
some
have
that
the
brothers
were
not
friends
they
rubbed
along
as
comfortably
as
two
such
different
boys
could
do
in
fairness
to
Aberforth
it
must
be
admitted
that
living
in
albus's
shadow
cannot
have
been
an
altogether
comfortable
experience
being
continually
outshone
was
an
occupational
hazard
of
being
his
friend
and
cannot
have
been
any
more
pleasurable
as
a
brother
when
Albus
and
I
left
Hogwarts
we
intended
to
take
the
then-traditional
tour
of
the
world
together
visiting
and
observing
foreign
wizards
before
pursuing
our
separate
careers
however
tragedy
intervened
on
the
very
eve
of
our
trip
albus's
mother
Kendra
died
leaving
albus
the
head
and
sole
breadwinner
of
the
family
i
postponed
my
departure
long
enough
to
pay
my
respects
at
kendra's
funeral
then
left
for
what
was
now
to
be
a
solitary
journey
with
a
younger
brother
and
sister
to
care
for
and
little
gold
left
to
them
there
could
no
longer
be
any
question
of
Albus
accompanying
me
that
was
the
period
of
our
lives
when
we
had
least
contact
i
wrote
to
Albus
describing
perhaps
insensitively
the
wonders
of
my
journey
from
narrow
escapes
from
chimaeras
in
Greece
to
the
experiments
of
the
Egyptian
alchemists
his
letters
told
me
little
of
his
day-to-day
life
which
I
guessed
to
be
frustratingly
dull
for
such
a
brilliant
wizard
immersed
in
my
own
experiences
it
was
with
horror
that
I
heard
toward
the
end
of
my
year's
travels
that
another
tragedy
had
struck
the
Dumbledores
the
death
of
his
sister
Ariana
though
Ariana
had
been
in
poor
health
for
a
long
time
the
blow
coming
so
soon
after
the
loss
of
their
mother
had
a
profound
effect
on
both
of
her
brothers
all
those
closest
to
Albus
and
I
count
myself
one
of
that
lucky
number
agree
that
ariana's
death
and
albus's
feeling
of
personal
responsibility
for
it
though
of
course
he
was
guiltless
left
their
mark
upon
him
forevermore
i
returned
home
to
find
a
young
man
who
had
experienced
a
much
older
person's
suffering
albus
was
more
reserved
than
before
and
much
less
light-hearted
to
add
to
his
misery
the
loss
of
Ariana
had
led
not
to
a
renewed
closeness
between
Albus
and
Aberforth
but
to
an
estrangement
In
time
this
would
lift
in
later
years
they
reestablished
if
not
a
close
relationship
then
certainly
a
cordial
one
However
he
rarely
spoke
of
his
parents
or
of
Ariana
from
then
on
and
his
friends
learned
not
to
mention
them
other
quills
will
describe
the
triumphs
of
the
following
years
dumbledore's
innumerable
contributions
to
the
store
of
Wizarding
knowledge
including
his
discovery
of
the
twelve
uses
of
dragon's
blood
will
benefit
generations
to
come
as
will
the
wisdom
he
displayed
in
the
many
judgments
while
Chief
Warlock
of
the
Wizengamot
they
say
still
that
no
Wizarding
duel
ever
matched
that
between
Dumbledore
and
Grindelwald
in
those
who
witnessed
it
have
written
of
the
terror
and
the
awe
they
felt
as
they
watched
these
two
extraordinary
wizards
to
battle
dumbledore's
triumph
and
its
consequences
for
the
Wizarding
world
are
considered
a
turning
point
in
magical
history
to
match
the
introduction
of
the
International
Statute
of
Secrecy
or
the
downfall
of
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
albus
Dumbledore
was
never
proud
or
vain
he
could
find
something
to
value
in
anyone
however
apparently
insignificant
or
wretched
and
I
believe
that
his
early
losses
endowed
him
with
great
humanity
and
sympathy
i
shall
miss
his
friendship
more
than
I
can
say
but
my
loss
is
nothing
compared
to
the
Wizarding
world's
that
he
was
the
most
inspiring
and
best
loved
of
all
Hogwarts
headmasters
cannot
be
in
question
he
died
as
he
lived
working
always
for
the
greater
good
and
to
his
last
hour
as
willing
to
stretch
out
a
hand
to
a
small
boy
with
dragon
pox
as
he
was
on
the
day
I
met
him
harry
finished
reading
but
continued
to
gaze
at
the
picture
accompanying
the
obituary
dumbledore
was
wearing
his
familiar
kindly
smile
but
as
he
peered
over
the
top
of
his
half-moon
spectacles
he
gave
the
impression
even
in
newsprint
of
x-raying
Harry
whose
sadness
mingled
with
a
sense
of
humiliation
he
had
thought
he
knew
Dumbledore
quite
well
but
ever
since
reading
this
obituary
he
had
been
forced
to
recognize
that
he
had
barely
known
him
at
all
never
once
had
he
imagined
dumbledore's
childhood
or
youth
it
was
as
though
he
had
sprung
into
being
as
Harry
had
known
him
venerable
and
silver-haired
and
old
the
idea
of
a
teenage
Dumbledore
was
simply
odd
like
trying
to
imagine
a
stupid
Hermione
or
a
friendly
Blast-Ended
Skrewt
he
had
never
thought
to
ask
Dumbledore
about
his
past
no
doubt
it
would
have
felt
strange
impertinent
even
but
after
all
it
had
been
common
knowledge
that
Dumbledore
had
taken
part
in
that
legendary
duel
with
Grindelwald
and
Harry
had
not
thought
to
ask
Dumbledore
what
that
had
been
like
nor
about
any
of
his
other
famous
achievements
no
they
had
always
discussed
Harry
harry's
past
harry's
future
harry's
plans
and
it
seemed
to
Harry
now
despite
the
fact
that
his
future
was
so
dangerous
and
so
uncertain
that
he
had
missed
irreplaceable
opportunities
when
he
had
failed
to
ask
Dumbledore
more
about
himself
even
though
the
only
personal
question
he
had
ever
asked
his
headmaster
was
also
the
only
one
he
suspected
that
Dumbledore
had
not
answered
honestly
what
do
you
see
when
you
look
in
the
mirror
i
see
myself
holding
a
pair
of
thick
woolen
socks
after
several
minutes
thought
Harry
tore
the
obituary
out
of
the
Prophet
folded
it
carefully
and
tucked
it
inside
the
first
volume
of
Practical
Defensive
Magic
and
its
Use
against
the
Dark
Arts
then
he
threw
the
rest
of
the
newspaper
onto
the
rubbish
pile
and
turned
to
face
the
room
it
was
much
tidier
the
only
things
left
out
of
place
were
today's
Daily
Prophet
still
lying
on
the
bed
and
on
top
of
it
the
piece
of
broken
mirror
harry
moved
across
the
room
slid
the
mirror
fragment
off
today's
Prophet
and
unfolded
the
newspaper
he
had
merely
glanced
at
the
headline
when
he
had
taken
the
rolled-up
paper
from
the
delivery
owl
early
that
morning
and
thrown
it
aside
after
noting
that
it
said
nothing
about
Voldemort
harry
was
sure
that
the
Ministry
was
leaning
on
the
Prophet
to
suppress
news
about
Voldemort
it
was
only
now
therefore
that
he
saw
what
he
had
missed
across
the
bottom
half
of
the
front
page
a
smaller
headline
was
set
over
a
picture
of
Dumbledore
striding
along
looking
harried
dumbledore
the
truth
at
last
coming
next
week
the
shocking
story
of
the
flawed
genius
considered
by
many
to
be
the
greatest
wizard
of
his
generation
striping
away
the
popular
image
of
serene
silver-bearded
wisdom
Rita
Skeeter
reveals
the
disturbed
childhood
the
lawless
youth
the
life-long
feuds
and
the
guilty
secrets
that
Dumbledore
carried
to
his
grave
why
was
the
man
tipped
to
be
the
Minister
of
Magic
content
to
remain
a
mere
headmaster
what
was
the
real
purpose
of
the
secret
organization
known
as
the
Order
of
the
Phoenix
how
did
Dumbledore
really
meet
his
end
the
answers
to
these
and
many
more
questions
are
explored
in
the
explosive
new
biography
The
Life
and
Lies
of
Albus
Dumbledore
by
Rita
Skeeter
exclusively
interviewed
by
Berry
Braithwaite
page
inside
harry
ripped
open
the
paper
and
found
page
thirteen
the
article
was
topped
with
a
picture
showing
another
familiar
face
a
woman
wearing
jeweled
glasses
with
elaborately
curled
blonde
hair
her
teeth
bared
in
what
was
clearly
supposed
to
be
a
winning
smile
wiggling
her
fingers
up
at
him
doing
his
best
to
ignore
this
nauseating
image
Harry
read
on
in
person
Rita
Skeeter
is
much
warmer
and
softer
than
her
famously
ferocious
quill-portraits
might
suggest
greeting
me
in
the
hallway
of
her
cozy
home
she
leads
me
straight
into
the
kitchen
for
a
cup
of
tea
a
slice
of
pound
cake
and
it
goes
without
saying
a
steaming
vat
of
freshest
gossip
well
of
course
Dumbledore
is
a
biographer's
dream
says
Skeeter
such
a
long
full
life
i'm
sure
my
book
will
be
the
first
of
very
very
many
skeeter
was
certainly
quick
off
the
mark
her
nine-hundred-page
book
was
completed
in
a
mere
four
weeks
after
dumbledore's
mysterious
death
in
June
i
ask
her
how
she
managed
this
superfast
feat
oh
when
you've
been
a
journalist
as
long
as
I
have
working
to
a
deadline
is
second
nature
i
knew
that
the
Wizarding
world
was
clamoring
for
the
full
story
and
I
wanted
to
be
the
first
to
meet
that
need
i
mention
the
recent
widely
publicized
remarks
of
Elphias
Doge
Special
Advisor
to
the
Wizengamot
and
longstanding
friend
of
Albus
dumbledore's
that
skeeter's
book
contains
less
fact
than
a
Chocolate
Frog
card
skeeter
throws
back
her
head
and
laughs
darling
Dodgy
i
remember
interviewing
him
a
few
years
back
about
merpeople
rights
bless
him
completely
gaga
seemed
to
think
we
were
sitting
at
the
bottom
of
Lake
Windermere
kept
telling
me
to
watch
out
for
trout
and
yet
Elphias
doge's
accusations
of
inaccuracy
have
been
echoed
in
many
places
does
Skeeter
really
feel
that
four
short
weeks
have
been
enough
to
gain
a
full
picture
of
dumbledore's
long
and
extraordinary
life
oh
my
dear
beams
Skeeter
rapping
me
affectionately
across
the
knuckles
you
know
as
well
as
I
do
how
much
information
can
be
generated
by
a
fat
bag
of
Galleons
a
refusal
to
hear
the
word
no
and
a
nice
sharp
Quick-Quotes
Quill
people
were
queuing
to
dish
the
dirt
on
Dumbledore
anyway
not
everyone
thought
he
was
so
wonderful
you
know
he
trod
on
an
awful
lot
of
important
toes
but
old
Dodgy
Doge
can
get
off
his
high
hippogriff
because
i've
had
access
to
a
source
most
journalists
would
swap
their
wands
for
one
who
has
never
spoken
in
public
before
and
who
was
close
to
Dumbledore
during
the
most
turbulent
and
disturbing
phase
of
his
youth
the
advance
publicity
for
skeeter's
biography
has
certainly
suggested
that
there
will
be
shocks
in
store
for
those
who
believe
Dumbledore
to
have
led
a
blameless
life
what
were
the
biggest
surprises
she
uncovered
I
ask
now
come
off
it
betty
i'm
not
giving
away
all
the
highlights
before
anybody's
bought
the
book
laughs
Skeeter
but
I
can
promise
that
anybody
who
still
thinks
Dumbledore
was
white
as
his
beard
is
in
for
a
rude
awakening
let's
just
say
that
nobody
hearing
him
rage
against
You-Know-Who
would
have
dreamed
that
he
dabbled
in
the
Dark
Arts
himself
in
his
youth
and
for
a
wizard
who
spent
his
later
years
pleading
for
tolerance
he
wasn't
exactly
broad-minded
when
he
was
younger
yes
Albus
Dumbledore
had
an
extremely
murky
past
not
to
mention
that
very
fishy
family
which
he
worked
so
hard
to
keep
hushed
up
i
ask
whether
Skeeter
is
referring
to
dumbledore's
brother
Aberforth
whose
conviction
by
the
Wizengamot
for
misuse
of
magic
caused
a
minor
scandal
fifteen
years
ago
oh
Aberforth
is
just
the
tip
of
the
dung
heap
laughs
Skeeter
no
no
i'm
talking
about
much
worse
than
a
brother
with
a
fondness
for
fiddling
about
with
goats
worse
even
than
the
muggle-maiming
father
Dumbledore
couldn't
keep
either
of
them
quiet
anyway
they
were
both
charged
by
the
Wizengamot
no
it's
the
mother
and
the
sister
that
intrigued
me
and
a
little
digging
uncovered
a
positive
nest
of
nastiness
but
as
I
say
you'll
have
to
wait
for
chapters
nine
to
twelve
for
full
details
all
I
can
say
now
is
it's
no
wonder
Dumbledore
never
talked
about
how
his
nose
got
broken
family
skeletons
notwithstanding
does
Skeeter
deny
the
brilliance
that
led
to
dumbledore's
many
magical
discoveries
he
had
brains
she
concedes
although
many
now
question
whether
he
could
really
take
full
credit
for
all
of
his
supposed
achievements
as
I
reveal
in
chapter
sixteen
Ivor
Dillonsby
claims
he
had
already
discovered
eight
uses
of
dragon's
blood
when
Dumbledore
borrowed
his
papers
but
the
importance
of
some
of
dumbledore's
achievements
cannot
I
venture
be
denied
what
of
his
famous
defeat
of
Grindelwald
oh
now
i'm
glad
you
mentioned
Grindelwald
says
Skeeter
with
such
a
tantalizing
smile
i'm
afraid
those
who
go
dewy-eyed
over
dumbledore's
spectacular
victory
must
brace
themselves
for
a
bombshell
or
perhaps
a
Dungbomb
very
dirty
business
indeed
all
i'll
say
is
don't
be
so
sure
that
there
really
was
a
spectacular
duel
of
legend
after
they've
read
my
book
people
may
be
forced
to
conclude
that
Grindelwald
simply
conjured
a
white
handkerchief
from
the
end
of
his
wand
and
came
quietly
skeeter
refuses
to
give
any
more
away
on
this
intriguing
subject
so
we
turn
instead
to
the
relationship
that
will
undoubtedly
fascinate
her
readers
more
than
any
other
oh
yes
says
Skeeter
nodding
briskly
I
devote
an
entire
chapter
to
the
whole
Potter-Dumbledore
relationship
it's
been
called
unhealthy
even
sinister
again
your
readers
will
have
to
buy
my
book
for
the
whole
story
but
there
is
no
question
that
Dumbledore
took
an
unnatural
interest
in
Potter
from
the
word
go
whether
that
was
really
in
the
boy's
best
interests
well
we'll
see
it's
certainly
an
open
secret
that
Potter
has
had
a
most
troubled
adolescence
i
ask
whether
Skeeter
is
still
in
touch
with
Harry
Potter
whom
she
so
famously
interviewed
last
year
a
breakthrough
piece
in
which
Potter
spoke
exclusively
of
his
conviction
that
You-Know-Who
had
returned
oh
yes
we've
developed
a
closer
bond
says
Skeeter
poor
Potter
has
few
real
friends
and
we
met
at
one
of
the
most
testing
moments
of
his
life
the
Triwizard
Tournament
i
am
probably
one
of
the
only
people
alive
who
can
say
that
they
know
the
real
Harry
Potter
which
leads
us
neatly
to
the
many
rumors
still
circulating
about
dumbledore's
final
hours
does
Skeeter
believe
that
Potter
was
there
when
Dumbledore
died
well
I
don't
want
to
say
too
much
it's
all
in
the
book
but
eyewitnesses
inside
Hogwarts
castle
saw
Potter
running
away
from
the
scene
moments
after
Dumbledore
fell
jumped
or
was
pushed
potter
later
gave
evidence
against
Severus
Snape
a
man
against
whom
he
has
a
notorious
grudge
is
everything
as
it
seems
that
is
for
the
Wizarding
community
to
decide
once
they've
read
my
book
on
that
intriguing
note
I
take
my
leave
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
Skeeter
has
quilled
an
instant
bestseller
dumbledore's
legion
of
admirers
meanwhile
may
well
be
trembling
at
what
is
soon
to
emerge
about
their
hero
harry
reached
the
bottom
of
the
article
but
continued
to
stare
blankly
at
the
page
revulsion
and
fury
rose
in
him
like
vomit
he
balled
up
the
newspaper
and
threw
it
with
all
his
force
at
the
wall
where
it
joined
the
rest
of
the
rubbish
heaped
around
his
overflowing
bin
he
began
to
stride
blindly
around
the
room
opening
empty
drawers
and
picking
up
books
only
to
replace
them
on
the
same
piles
barely
conscious
of
what
he
was
doing
as
random
phrases
from
rita's
article
echoed
in
his
head
An
entire
chapter
to
the
whole
Potter-Dumbledore
relationship
it's
been
called
unhealthy
even
sinister
he
dabbled
in
the
Dark
Arts
himself
in
his
youth
i've
had
access
to
a
source
most
journalists
would
swap
their
wands
for
lies
harry
bellowed
and
through
the
window
he
saw
the
next-door
neighbor
who
had
paused
to
restart
his
lawn
mower
look
up
nervously
harry
sat
down
hard
on
the
bed
the
broken
bit
of
mirror
danced
away
from
him
he
picked
it
up
and
turned
it
over
in
his
fingers
thinking
thinking
of
Dumbledore
and
the
lies
with
which
Rita
Skeeter
was
defaming
him
a
flash
of
brightest
blue
harry
froze
his
cut
finger
slipping
on
the
jagged
edge
of
the
mirror
again
he
had
imagined
it
he
must
have
done
he
glanced
over
his
shoulder
but
the
wall
was
a
sickly
peach
color
of
Aunt
petunia's
choosing
There
was
nothing
blue
there
for
the
mirror
to
reflect
he
peered
into
the
mirror
fragment
again
and
saw
nothing
but
his
own
bright
green
eye
looking
back
at
him
he
had
imagined
it
there
was
no
other
explanation
imagined
it
because
he
had
been
thinking
of
his
dead
headmaster
if
anything
was
certain
it
was
that
the
bright
blue
eyes
of
Albus
Dumbledore
would
never
pierce
him
again
chapter
Three
the
Dursleys
Departing
the
sound
of
the
front
door
slamming
echoed
up
the
stairs
and
a
voice
roared
Oh
you
sixteen
years
of
being
addressed
thus
left
Harry
in
no
doubt
when
his
uncle
was
calling
nevertheless
he
did
not
immediately
respond
he
was
still
at
the
narrow
fragment
in
which
for
a
split
second
he
had
thought
he
saw
Dumbledores
eye
it
was
not
until
his
uncle
bellowed
boy
that
Harry
got
slowly
out
of
bed
and
headed
for
the
bedroom
door
pausing
to
add
the
piece
of
broken
mirror
to
the
rucksack
filled
with
things
he
would
be
taking
with
him
you
took
you
time
roared
Vernon
Dursley
when
Harry
appeared
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
Get
down
here
i
want
a
word
harry
strolled
downstairs
his
hands
deep
in
his
pants
pockets
when
he
searched
the
living
room
he
found
all
three
Dursleys
they
were
dressed
for
packing
Uncle
Vernon
in
an
old
ripped-up
jacket
and
Dudley
Harrys
large
blond
muscular
cousin
in
his
leather
jacket
yes
asked
Harry
sit
down
said
Uncle
Vernon
harry
raised
his
eyebrows
please
added
Uncle
Vernon
wincing
slightly
as
though
the
word
was
sharp
in
his
throat
harry
sat
he
though
he
knew
what
was
coming
his
uncle
began
to
pace
up
and
down
Aunt
Petunia
and
Dudley
following
his
movement
with
anxious
expressions
finally
his
large
purple
face
crumpled
with
concentration
uncle
Vernon
stopped
in
front
of
Harry
and
spoke
i've
changed
my
mind
he
said
what
a
surprise
said
Harry
don't
you
take
that
tone
began
Aunt
Petunia
in
a
shrill
voice
but
Vernon
Dursley
waved
her
down
it's
all
a
lot
of
claptrap
said
Uncle
Vernon
glaring
at
Harry
with
piggy
little
eyes
i've
decided
I
don't
believe
a
word
of
it
were
staying
put
were
not
going
anywhere
harry
looked
up
at
his
uncle
and
felt
a
mixture
of
exasperation
and
amusement
vernon
Dursley
had
been
changing
his
mind
every
twenty
four
hours
for
the
past
four
weeks
packing
and
unpacking
and
repacking
the
car
with
every
change
of
heart
harrys
favorite
moment
had
been
the
one
when
Uncle
Vernon
unaware
the
Dudley
had
added
his
dumbbells
to
his
case
since
the
last
time
it
been
repacked
had
attempted
to
hoist
it
back
into
the
boot
and
collapsed
with
a
yelp
of
pain
and
much
swearing
according
to
you
Vernon
Dursley
said
now
resuming
his
pacing
up
and
down
the
living
room
we
Petunia
Dudley
and
I
are
in
danger
from
from
some
of
my
lot
right
said
Harry
well
I
dont
believe
it
repeated
Uncle
Vernon
coming
to
a
halt
in
front
of
Harry
again
i
was
awake
half
the
night
thinking
it
all
over
and
I
believe
it's
a
plot
to
get
the
house
the
house
repeated
Harry
what
house
this
house
shrieked
Uncle
Vernon
the
vein
his
forehead
starting
to
pulse
our
house
house
prices
are
skyrocketing
around
here
you
want
us
out
of
the
way
and
then
you're
going
to
do
a
bit
of
hocus
pocus
and
before
we
know
it
the
deeds
will
be
in
your
name
and
are
you
out
of
your
mind
demanded
Harry
a
plot
to
get
this
house
are
you
actually
as
stupid
as
you
look
don't
you
dare
squealed
Aunt
Petunia
but
again
Vernon
waved
her
down
slights
on
his
personal
appearance
were
it
seemed
as
nothing
to
the
danger
he
had
spotted
just
in
case
you've
forgotten
said
Harry
i've
already
got
a
house
my
godfather
left
me
one
so
why
would
I
want
this
one
all
the
happy
memories
there
was
silence
harry
thought
he
had
rather
impressed
his
uncle
with
this
argument
you
claim
said
Uncle
Vernon
starting
to
pace
yet
again
that
this
Lord
Thing
Voldemort
said
Harry
impatiently
and
we've
been
through
this
about
a
hundred
times
already
this
isn't
a
claim
it's
fact
dumbledore
told
you
last
year
and
Kingsley
and
mr.
Weasley
vernon
Dursley
hunched
his
shoulders
angrily
and
Harry
guessed
that
his
uncle
was
attempting
to
ward
off
recollections
of
the
unannounced
visit
a
few
days
into
harry's
summer
holidays
of
two
fully
grown
wizards
the
arrival
on
the
doorstep
of
Kingsley
Shacklebolt
and
Arthur
Weasley
had
come
as
a
most
unpleasant
shock
to
the
Dursleys
harry
had
to
admit
however
that
as
mr.
Weasley
had
once
demolished
half
of
the
living
room
his
reappearance
could
not
have
been
expected
to
delight
Uncle
Vernon
Kingsley
and
mr.
Weasley
explained
it
all
as
well
Harry
pressed
on
remorselessly
Once
i'm
seventeen
the
protective
charm
that
keeps
me
safe
will
break
and
that
exposes
you
as
well
as
me
the
Order
is
sure
Voldemort
will
target
you
whether
to
torture
you
to
try
and
find
out
where
I
am
or
because
he
thinks
by
holding
you
hostage
i'd
come
and
try
to
rescue
you
uncle
vernon's
and
harry's
eyes
met
harry
was
sure
that
in
that
instant
they
were
both
wondering
the
same
thing
then
Uncle
Vernon
walked
on
and
Harry
resumed
you've
got
to
go
into
hiding
and
the
Order
wants
to
help
you're
being
offered
serious
protection
the
best
there
is
uncle
Vernon
said
nothing
but
continued
to
pace
up
and
down
outside
the
sun
hung
low
over
the
privet
hedges
the
next
door
neighbor's
lawn
mower
stalled
again
i
thought
there
was
a
Ministry
of
Magic
asked
Vernon
Dursley
abruptly
there
is
said
Harry
surprised
well
then
why
can't
they
protect
us
it
seems
to
me
that
as
innocent
victims
guilty
of
nothing
more
than
harboring
a
marked
man
we
ought
to
qualify
for
government
protection
harry
laughed
he
could
not
help
himself
it
was
so
very
typical
of
his
uncle
to
put
his
hopes
in
the
establishment
even
within
this
world
that
he
despised
and
mistrusted
you
heard
what
mr.
Weasley
and
Kingsley
said
Harry
replied
we
think
the
Ministry
has
been
infiltrated
uncle
Vernon
strode
back
to
the
fireplace
and
back
breathing
so
strongly
that
his
great
black
mustache
rippled
his
face
still
purple
with
concentration
all
right
he
said
stopping
in
front
of
Harry
get
again
all
right
let's
say
for
the
sake
of
argument
we
accept
this
protection
i
still
don't
see
why
we
can't
have
that
Kingsley
bloke
harry
managed
not
to
roll
his
eyes
but
with
difficulty
this
question
had
also
been
addressed
half
a
dozen
times
as
i've
told
you
he
said
through
gritted
teeth
Kingsley
is
protecting
the
Mug
I
mean
your
Prime
Minister
exactly
he's
the
best
said
Uncle
Vernon
pointing
at
the
blank
television
screen
the
Dursleys
had
spotted
Kingsley
on
the
news
walking
along
the
Muggle
Prime
Minister
as
he
visited
a
hospital
this
and
the
fact
that
Kingsley
had
mastered
the
knack
of
dressing
like
a
Muggle
not
to
mention
a
certain
reassuring
something
in
his
slow
deep
voice
had
caused
the
Dursleys
to
take
to
Kingsley
in
a
way
that
they
had
certainly
not
done
with
any
other
wizard
although
it
was
true
that
they
had
never
seen
him
with
earring
in
well
he's
taken
said
Harry
but
Hestia
Jones
and
Dedalus
Diggle
are
more
than
up
to
the
job
if
we'd
even
seen
CVs
began
Uncle
Vernon
but
Harry
lost
patience
getting
to
his
feet
he
advanced
on
his
uncle
not
pointing
at
the
tv
set
himself
these
accidents
aren't
accidents
the
crashed
and
explosions
and
derailments
and
whatever
else
has
happened
since
we
last
watched
the
news
people
are
disappearing
and
dying
and
he's
behind
it
Voldemort
i've
told
you
this
over
and
over
again
he
kills
Muggles
for
fun
even
the
fogs
they're
caused
by
dementors
and
if
you
can't
remember
what
they
are
ask
your
son
dudley's
hands
jerked
upward
to
tower
his
mouth
with
his
parents
and
harry's
eyes
upon
him
he
slowly
lowered
them
again
and
asked
There
are
more
of
them
more
laughed
Harry
more
than
the
two
that
attacked
us
you
mean
of
course
there
are
hundreds
maybe
thousands
by
this
time
seeing
as
they
feed
off
fear
and
despair
all
right
all
right
blustered
blustered
Vernon
Dursley
you've
made
your
point
i
hope
so
said
Harry
because
once
i'm
seventeen
all
of
them
Death
Eaters
elementors
maybe
even
Inferi
which
means
dead
bodies
enchanted
by
a
Dark
wizard
will
be
able
to
find
you
and
will
certainly
attack
you
and
if
you
remember
the
last
time
you
tried
to
outrun
wizards
I
think
you'll
agree
you
need
help
there
was
a
brief
silence
in
which
the
distant
echo
of
Hagrid
smashing
down
a
wooden
front
door
seemed
to
reverberate
through
the
intervening
years
aunt
Petunia
was
looking
at
Uncle
Vernon
Dudley
was
staring
at
Harry
finally
Uncle
Vernon
blurted
out
But
what
about
my
work
what
about
dudley's
school
i
don't
suppose
those
things
matter
to
a
bunch
of
layabout
wizards
don't
you
understand
shouted
Harry
they
will
torture
and
kill
you
like
they
did
my
parents
dad
said
Dudley
in
a
loud
voice
Dad
i'm
going
with
these
Order
people
dudley
said
Harry
for
the
first
time
in
your
life
you're
talking
sense
he
knew
the
battle
was
won
if
Dudley
was
frightened
enough
to
accept
the
order's
help
his
parents
would
accompany
him
there
could
be
no
question
of
being
separated
from
their
Duddykins
harry
glanced
at
the
carriage
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
they'll
be
here
in
about
five
minutes
he
said
and
when
one
of
the
Dursleys
replied
he
left
the
room
the
prospect
of
parting-probably
forever
from
his
aunt
uncle
and
cousin
was
one
that
he
was
able
to
contemplate
quite
cheerfully
but
there
was
nevertheless
a
certain
awkwardness
in
the
air
what
did
you
say
to
one
another
at
the
end
of
sixteen
years
solid
dislike
back
in
his
bedroom
Harry
fiddled
aimlessly
with
his
rucksack
then
poked
a
couple
of
owl
nuts
through
the
bats
of
hedwig's
cage
they
fell
with
dull
thuds
to
the
bottom
where
she
ignored
them
we're
leaving
soon
really
soon
Harry
told
her
and
then
you'll
be
able
to
fly
again
the
doorbell
rang
harry
hesitated
then
headed
back
out
of
his
room
and
downstairs
it
was
too
much
to
expect
Hestia
and
Dedalus
to
cope
with
the
Dursleys
on
their
own
harry
Potter
squeaked
an
excited
voice
the
moment
Harry
had
opened
the
door
a
small
man
in
a
mauve
top
hat
that
was
sweeping
him
a
deep
bow
an
honor
as
ever
thanks
Dedalus
said
Harry
bestowing
a
small
and
embarrassed
smile
upon
the
dark
haired
Hestia
it's
really
good
of
you
to
do
this
they're
through
here
my
aunt
and
uncle
and
cousin
good
day
to
you
Harry
potter's
relatives
said
Dedalus
happily
striding
into
the
living
room
the
Dursleys
did
not
look
at
all
happy
to
be
addressed
thus
Harry
half
expected
another
change
of
mind
dudley
shrank
neared
to
his
mother
at
the
sight
of
the
witch
and
wizard
i
see
you
are
packed
and
ready
excellent
the
plan
as
Harry
has
told
you
is
a
simple
one
said
Dedalus
pulling
an
immense
pocket
watch
out
of
his
waistcoat
and
examining
it
we
shall
be
leaving
before
Harry
does
due
to
the
danger
of
using
magic
in
your
house
Harry
being
still
underage
it
could
provide
the
Ministry
with
an
excuse
to
arrest
him
we
shall
be
driving
say
ten
miles
or
so
before
Disapparating
to
the
safe
location
we
have
picked
out
for
you
you
know
how
to
drive
I
take
it
he
asked
Uncle
Vernon
politely
know
how
to
of
course
I
ruddy
well
know
how
to
drive
spluttered
Uncle
Vernon
very
clever
of
you
sir
very
clever
i
personally
would
be
utterly
bamboozled
by
all
those
buttons
and
knobs
said
Dedalus
he
was
clearly
under
the
impression
that
he
was
flattering
Vernon
Dursley
who
was
visibly
losing
confidence
in
the
plan
with
every
word
Dedalus
spoke
can't
even
drive
he
muttered
under
his
breath
his
mustache
rippling
indignantly
but
fortunately
neither
Dedalus
nor
Hestia
seemed
to
hear
him
you
Harry
Dedalus
continued
will
wait
here
for
your
guard
there
has
been
a
little
change
in
the
arrangements
what
d'you
mean
said
Harry
at
once
i
thought
Mad-Eye
was
going
to
come
and
take
me
by
Side
Along-Apparition
can't
do
it
said
Hestia
tersely
Mad-Eye
will
explain
the
Dursleys
who
had
listened
to
all
of
this
with
looks
of
utter
incomprehension
on
their
faces
jumped
as
a
loud
voice
screeched
Hurry
up
harry
looked
all
around
the
room
before
realizing
the
voice
had
issued
from
dedalus's
pocket
watch
quite
right
were
operating
to
a
very
tight
schedule
said
Dedalus
nodding
at
his
watch
and
tucking
it
back
into
his
waist
coat
we
are
attempting
to
time
your
departure
from
the
house
with
your
family's
Disapparition
Harry
thus
the
charm
breaks
the
moment
you
all
head
for
safety
he
turned
to
the
Dursleys
Well
are
we
all
packed
and
ready
to
go
none
of
them
answered
him
uncle
Vernon
was
still
staring
appalled
at
the
bulge
in
dedalus's
waistcoat
pocket
perhaps
we
should
wait
outside
in
the
hall
Dedalus
murmured
Hestia
she
clearly
felt
that
it
would
be
tactless
for
them
to
remain
the
room
while
Harry
and
the
Dursleys
exchanged
loving
possibly
tearful
farewells
there's
no
need
Harry
muttered
but
Uncle
Vernon
made
any
further
explanation
unnecessary
by
saying
loudly
well
this
is
good-bye
then
boy
he
swung
his
right
arm
upward
to
shake
harry's
hand
but
at
the
last
moment
seemed
unable
to
face
it
and
merely
closed
his
fist
and
began
swinging
it
backward
and
forward
like
a
metronome
ready
Duddy
asked
Petunia
fussily
checking
the
clasp
of
her
handbag
so
as
to
avoid
looking
at
Harry
altogether
dudley
did
not
answer
but
stood
there
with
his
mouth
slightly
ajar
reminding
Harry
a
little
of
the
giant
Grawp
come
along
then
said
Uncle
Vernon
he
had
already
reached
the
living
room
door
when
Dudley
mumbled
I
don't
understand
what
don't
you
understand
popkin
asked
Petunia
looking
up
at
her
son
dudley
raised
a
large
hamlike
hand
to
point
at
Harry
why
isn't
he
coming
with
us
uncle
Vernon
and
Aunt
Petunia
froze
when
they
stood
staring
at
Dudley
as
though
he
had
just
expressed
a
desire
to
become
a
ballerina
what
said
Uncle
Vernon
loudly
why
isn't
he
coming
too
asked
Dudley
well
he-doesn't
want
to
said
Uncle
Vernon
turning
to
glare
at
Harry
and
adding
You
don't
want
to
do
you
not
in
the
slightest
said
Harry
there
you
are
Uncle
Vernon
told
Dudley
now
come
on
we're
off
he
marched
out
of
the
room
they
heard
the
front
door
open
but
Dudley
did
not
move
and
after
a
few
faltering
steps
Aunt
Petunia
stopped
too
what
now
barked
Uncle
Vernon
reappearing
in
the
doorway
it
seemed
that
Dudley
was
struggling
with
concepts
too
difficult
to
put
into
words
after
several
moments
of
apparently
painful
internal
struggle
he
said
But
where's
he
going
to
go
aunt
Petunia
and
Uncle
Vernon
looked
at
each
other
it
was
clear
that
Dudley
was
frightening
them
hestia
Jones
broke
the
silence
but
surely
you
know
where
your
nephew
is
going
she
asked
looking
bewildered
certainly
we
know
said
Vernon
Dursley
he's
off
with
some
of
your
lot
isn't
he
right
Dudley
let's
get
in
the
car
you
heard
the
man
we're
in
a
hurry
again
Vernon
Dursley
marched
as
far
as
the
front
door
but
Dudley
did
not
follow
off
with
some
of
our
lot
hestia
looked
outraged
harry
had
met
this
attitude
before
Witches
and
wizards
seemed
stunned
that
his
closed
living
relatives
took
so
little
interest
in
the
famous
Harry
Potter
it's
fine
Harry
assured
her
it
doesn't
matter
honestly
doesn't
matter
repeated
Hestia
her
voice
rising
considerably
don't
these
people
realize
what
you've
been
through
what
danger
you
are
in
the
unique
position
you
hold
in
the
hearts
of
the
anti
Voldemort
movement
er
no
they
don't
said
Harry
they
think
i'm
a
waste
of
space
actually
but
i'm
used
to
i
don't
think
you're
a
waste
of
space
if
Harry
had
not
seen
dudley's
lips
move
he
might
not
have
believed
it
as
it
was
he
stared
at
Dudley
for
several
seconds
before
accepting
that
it
must
have
been
his
cousin
who
had
spoken
for
one
thing
Dudley
had
turned
red
harry
was
embarrassed
and
astonished
himself
well
er
thanks
Dudley
again
Dudley
appeared
to
grapple
with
thoughts
too
unwieldy
for
expression
before
mumbling
You
saved
my
life
not
really
said
Harry
it
was
your
soul
the
dementor
would
have
taken
he
looked
curiously
at
his
cousin
they
had
had
virtually
no
contact
during
this
summer
or
last
as
Harry
had
come
back
to
Privet
Drive
so
briefly
and
kept
to
his
room
so
much
it
now
dawned
on
Harry
however
that
the
cup
of
cold
tea
on
which
he
had
trodden
that
morning
might
not
have
been
a
booby
trap
at
all
although
rather
touched
he
was
nevertheless
quite
relieved
that
Dudley
appeared
to
have
exhausted
his
ability
to
express
his
feelings
after
opening
his
mouth
once
or
twice
more
Dudley
subsided
into
scarlet-faced
silence
aunt
Petunia
burst
into
tears
hestia
Jones
gave
her
an
approving
look
that
changed
to
outrage
as
Aunt
Petunia
ran
forward
and
embraced
Dudley
rather
than
Harry
s-so
sweet
Dudders
she
sobbed
into
his
massive
chest
s-such
a
lovely
b-boy
s-saying
thank
you
but
he
hasn't
said
thank
you
at
all
said
Hestia
indignantly
he
only
said
he
didn't
think
Harry
was
a
waste
of
space
yea
but
coming
from
Dudley
that's
like
I
love
you
said
Harry
torn
between
annoyance
and
a
desire
to
laugh
as
Aunt
Petunia
continued
to
clutch
at
Dudley
as
if
he
had
just
saved
Harry
from
a
burning
building
are
we
going
or
not
roared
Uncle
Vernon
reappearing
yet
again
at
the
living
room
door
i
thought
we
were
on
a
tight
schedule
yes
yes
we
are
said
Dedalus
Diggle
who
had
been
watching
these
exchanged
with
an
air
of
bemusement
and
now
seemed
to
pull
himself
together
we
really
must
be
off
harry
he
tripped
forward
and
wrung
harry's
hand
with
both
of
his
own
good
luck
i
hope
we
meet
again
the
hopes
of
the
Wizarding
world
rest
upon
your
shoulders
oh
said
Harry
right
thanks
farwell
Harry
said
Hestia
also
clasping
his
hand
our
thoughts
go
with
you
i
hope
everything's
okay
said
Harry
with
a
glance
toward
Aunt
Petunia
and
Dudley
oh
i'm
sure
we
shall
end
up
the
best
of
chums
said
Diggle
slightly
waving
his
hat
as
he
left
the
room
hestia
followed
him
dudley
gently
released
himself
from
his
mother's
clutches
and
walked
toward
Harry
who
had
to
repress
an
urge
to
threaten
him
with
magic
then
Dudley
held
out
his
large
pink
hand
blimey
Dudley
said
Harry
over
Aunt
petunia's
renewed
sobs
did
the
dementors
blow
a
different
personality
into
you
dunno
muttered
Dudley
See
you
Harry
yea
said
Harry
raking
dudley's
hand
and
shaking
it
maybe
take
care
Big
D
dudley
nearly
smiled
they
lumbered
from
the
room
harry
heard
his
heavy
footfalls
on
the
graveled
drive
and
then
a
car
door
slammed
aunt
Petunia
whose
face
had
been
buried
in
her
handkerchief
looked
around
at
the
sound
she
did
not
seem
to
have
expected
to
find
herself
alone
with
Harry
hastily
stowing
her
wet
handkerchief
into
her
pocket
she
said
Well
good-bye
and
marched
towards
the
door
without
looking
at
him
good-bye
said
Harry
she
stopped
and
looked
back
for
a
moment
Harry
had
the
strangest
feeling
that
she
wanted
to
say
something
to
him
She
gave
him
an
odd
tremulous
look
and
seemed
to
teeter
on
the
edge
of
speech
but
then
with
a
little
of
her
head
she
hustled
out
of
the
room
after
he
husband
and
son

Four
the
Seven
Potters
harry
ran
back
upstairs
to
his
bedroom
arriving
at
the
window
just
in
time
to
see
the
Dursleys
car
swinging
out
of
the
drive
and
off
up
the
road
dedaluss
top
hat
was
visible
between
Aunt
Petunia
and
Dudley
in
the
backseat
the
car
turned
right
at
the
end
of
Privet
Drive
its
windows
burned
scarlet
for
a
moment
in
the
now
setting
sun
and
then
it
was
gone
harry
picked
up
Hedwigs
cage
his
Firebolt
and
his
rucksack
gave
his
unnaturally
tidy
bedroom
one
last
sweeping
look
and
then
made
his
ungainly
way
back
downstairs
to
the
hall
where
he
deposited
cage
broomstick
and
bag
near
the
foot
of
the
stairs
the
light
was
fading
rapidly
the
hall
full
of
shadows
in
the
evening
light
it
felt
most
strange
to
stand
here
in
the
silence
and
know
that
he
was
about
to
leave
the
house
for
the
last
time
long
ago
when
he
had
been
left
alone
while
the
Dursleys
went
out
to
enjoy
themselves
the
hours
of
solitude
had
been
a
rare
treat
pausing
only
to
sneak
something
tasty
from
the
fridge
he
had
rushed
upstairs
to
play
on
Dudleys
computer
or
put
on
the
television
and
flicked
through
the
channels
to
his
hearts
content
it
gave
him
an
odd
empty
feeling
remembering
those
times
it
was
like
remembering
a
younger
brother
whom
he
had
lost
dont
you
want
to
take
a
last
look
at
the
place
he
asked
Hedwig
who
was
still
sulking
with
her
head
under
her
wing
well
never
be
here
again
dont
you
want
to
remember
all
the
good
times
i
mean
look
at
this
doormat
what
memories
dudley
sobbed
on
it
after
I
saved
him
from
the
dementors
turns
out
he
was
grateful
after
all
can
you
believe
it
and
last
summer
Dumbledore
walked
through
that
front
door
harry
lost
the
thread
of
his
thoughts
for
a
moment
and
Hedwig
did
nothing
to
help
him
retrieve
it
but
continued
to
sit
with
her
head
under
her
wing
harry
turned
his
back
on
the
front
door
and
under
here
Hedwig
Harry
pulled
open
a
door
under
the
stairs
is
where
I
used
to
sleep
you
never
knew
me
then
Blimey
its
small
Id
forgotten
harry
looked
around
at
the
stacked
shoes
and
umbrellas
remembering
how
he
used
to
wake
every
morning
looking
up
at
the
underside
of
the
staircase
which
was
more
often
than
not
adorned
with
a
spider
or
two
those
had
been
the
days
before
he
had
known
anything
about
his
true
identity
before
he
had
found
out
how
his
parents
had
died
or
why
such
strange
things
often
happened
around
him
but
Harry
could
still
remember
the
dreams
that
had
dogged
him
even
in
those
days
confused
dreams
involving
flashes
of
green
light
and
once
Uncle
Vernon
had
nearly
crashed
the
car
when
Harry
had
recounted
it
a
flying
motorbike
there
was
a
sudden
deafening
roar
from
somewhere
nearby
harry
straightened
up
with
a
jerk
and
smacked
the
top
of
his
head
on
the
low
door
frame
pausing
only
to
employ
a
few
of
Uncle
Vernons
choicest
swear
words
he
staggered
back
into
the
kitchen
clutching
his
head
and
staring
out
of
the
window
into
the
back
garden
the
darkness
seemed
to
be
rippling
the
air
itself
quivering
then
one
by
one
figures
began
to
pop
into
sight
as
their
Disillusionment
Charms
lifted
dominating
the
scene
was
Hagrid
wearing
a
helmet
and
goggles
and
sitting
astride
an
enormous
motorbike
with
a
black
sidecar
attached
all
around
him
other
people
were
dismounting
from
brooms
and
in
two
cases
skeletal
black
winged
horses
wrenching
open
the
back
door
Harry
hurtled
into
their
midst
there
was
a
general
cry
of
greeting
as
Hermione
flung
her
arms
around
him
Ron
clapped
him
on
the
back
and
Hagrid
said
All
righ
Harry
ready
fer
the
off
definitely
said
Harry
beaming
around
at
them
all
but
I
wasnt
expecting
this
many
of
you
change
of
plan
growled
Mad-Eye
who
was
holding
two
enormous
bulging
sacks
and
whose
magical
eye
was
spinning
from
darkening
sky
to
house
to
garden
with
dizzying
rapidity
lets
get
undercover
before
we
talk
you
through
it
harry
led
them
all
back
into
the
kitchen
where
laughing
and
chattering
they
settled
on
chairs
sat
themselves
upon
Aunt
Petunias
gleaming
work
surfaces
or
leaned
up
against
her
spotless
appliances
Ron
long
and
lanky
Hermione
her
bushy
hair
tied
back
in
a
long
plait
Fred
and
George
grinning
identically
Bill
badly
scarred
and
long-haired
mr.
Weasley
kind-faced
balding
his
spectacles
a
little
awry
Mad-Eye
battle-worn
one-legged
his
bright
blue
magical
eye
whizzing
in
its
socket
Tonks
whose
short
hair
was
her
favorite
shade
of
bright
pink
Lupin
grayer
more
lined
Fleur
slender
and
beautiful
with
her
long
silvery
blonde
hair
Kingsley
bald
and
broad-shouldered
Hagrid
with
his
wild
hair
and
beard
standing
hunchbacked
to
avoid
hitting
his
head
on
the
ceiling
and
Mundungus
Fletcher
small
dirty
and
hangdog
with
his
droopy
beady
hounds
eyes
and
matted
hair
harrys
heart
seemed
to
expand
and
glow
at
the
sight
He
felt
incredibly
fond
of
all
of
them
even
Mundungus
whom
he
had
tried
to
strangle
the
last
time
they
had
met
kingsley
I
thought
you
were
looking
after
the
Muggle
Prime
Minister
he
called
across
the
room
he
can
get
along
without
me
for
one
night
said
Kingsley
Youre
more
important
harry
guess
what
said
Tonks
from
her
perch
on
top
of
the
washing
machine
and
she
wiggled
her
left
hand
at
him
a
ring
glistened
there
you
got
married
harry
yelped
looking
from
her
to
Lupin
im
sorry
you
couldnt
be
there
Harry
it
was
very
quiet
thats
brilliant
congrat
all
right
all
right
well
have
time
for
a
cozy
catch-up
later
roared
Moody
over
the
hubbub
and
silence
fell
in
the
kitchen
moody
dropped
his
sacks
at
his
feet
and
turned
to
Harry
as
Dedalus
probably
told
you
we
had
to
abandon
Plan
A
pius
Thicknesse
has
gone
over
which
gives
us
a
big
problem
hes
made
it
an
imprisonable
offense
to
connect
this
house
to
the
Floo
Network
place
a
Portkey
here
or
Apparate
in
or
out
all
done
in
the
name
of
your
protection
to
prevent
You-Know-Who
getting
in
at
you
absolutely
pointless
seeing
as
your
mothers
charm
does
that
already
what
hes
really
done
is
to
stop
you
getting
out
of
here
safely
second
problem
Youre
underage
which
means
youve
still
got
the
Trace
on
you
i
dont
the
Trace
the
Trace
said
Mad-Eye
impatiently
the
charm
that
detects
magical
activity
around
under-seventeens
the
way
the
Ministry
finds
out
about
underage
magic
if
you
or
anyone
around
you
casts
a
spell
to
get
you
out
of
here
Thicknesse
is
going
to
know
about
it
and
so
will
the
Death
Eaters
we
cant
wait
for
the
Trace
to
break
because
the
moment
you
turn
seventeen
youll
lose
all
the
protection
your
mother
gave
you
in
short
Pius
Thicknesse
thinks
hes
got
you
cornered
good
and
proper
harry
could
not
help
but
agree
with
the
unknown
Thicknesse
so
what
are
we
going
to
do
were
going
to
use
the
only
means
of
transport
left
to
us
the
only
ones
the
Trace
cant
detect
because
we
dont
need
to
cast
spells
to
use
them
brooms
thestrals
and
Hagrids
motorbike
harry
could
see
flaws
in
this
plan
however
he
held
his
tongue
to
give
Mad-Eye
the
chance
to
address
them
now
your
mothers
charm
will
only
break
under
two
conditions
when
you
come
of
age
or
Moody
gestured
around
the
pristine
kitchen
you
no
longer
call
this
place
home
you
and
your
aunt
and
uncle
are
going
your
separate
ways
tonight
in
the
full
understanding
that
youre
never
going
to
live
together
again
correct
harry
nodded
so
this
time
when
you
leave
therell
be
no
going
back
and
the
charm
will
break
the
moment
you
get
outside
its
range
were
choosing
to
break
it
early
because
the
alternative
is
waiting
for
You-Know-Who
to
come
and
seize
you
the
moment
you
turn
seventeen
the
one
thing
weve
got
on
our
side
is
that
You-Know-Who
doesnt
know
were
moving
you
tonight
weve
leaked
a
fake
trail
to
the
Ministry
They
think
youre
not
leaving
until
the
thirtieth
however
this
is
You-Know-Who
were
dealing
with
so
we
cant
rely
on
him
getting
the
date
wrong
hes
bound
to
have
a
couple
of
Death
Eaters
patrolling
the
skies
in
this
general
area
just
in
case
so
weve
given
a
dozen
different
houses
every
protection
we
can
throw
at
them
they
all
look
like
they
could
be
the
place
were
going
to
hide
you
theyve
all
got
some
connection
with
the
Order
my
house
Kingsleys
place
Mollys
Auntie
Muriels
you
get
the
idea
yeah
said
Harry
not
entirely
truthfully
because
he
could
still
spot
a
gaping
hole
in
the
plan
youll
be
going
to
Tonkss
parents
once
youre
within
the
boundaries
of
the
protective
enchantments
weve
put
on
their
house
youll
be
able
to
use
a
Portkey
to
the
Burrow
any
questions
er
yes
said
Harry
maybe
they
wont
know
which
of
the
twelve
secure
houses
Im
heading
for
at
first
but
wont
it
be
sort
of
obvious
once
he
performed
a
quick
headcount
fourteen
of
us
fly
off
toward
Tonkss
parents
ah
said
Moody
I
forgot
to
mention
the
key
point
fourteen
of
us
wont
be
flying
to
Tonkss
parents
there
will
be
seven
Harry
Potters
moving
through
the
skies
tonight
each
of
them
with
a
companion
each
pair
heading
for
a
different
safe
house
from
inside
his
cloak
Moody
now
withdrew
a
flask
of
what
looked
like
mud
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
say
another
word
Harry
understood
the
rest
of
the
plan
immediately
no
he
said
loudly
his
voice
ringing
through
the
kitchen
no
way
i
told
them
youd
take
it
like
this
said
Hermione
with
a
hint
of
complacency
if
you
think
Im
going
to
let
six
people
risk
their
lives
because
its
the
first
time
for
all
of
us
said
Ron
this
is
different
pretending
to
be
me
well
none
of
us
really
fancy
it
Harry
said
Fred
earnestly
imagine
if
something
went
wrong
and
we
were
stuck
as
specky
scrawny
gits
forever
harry
did
not
smile
you
cant
do
it
if
I
dont
cooperate
you
need
me
to
give
you
some
hair
well
thats
the
plan
scuppered
said
George
obviously
theres
no
chance
at
all
of
us
getting
a
bit
of
your
hair
unless
you
cooperate
yeah
thirteen
of
us
against
one
bloke
whos
not
allowed
to
use
magic
weve
got
no
chance
said
Fred
funny
said
Harry
really
amusing
if
it
has
to
come
to
force
then
it
will
growled
Moody
his
magical
eye
now
quivering
a
little
in
its
socket
as
he
glared
at
Harry
everyone
heres
overage
Potter
and
theyre
all
prepared
to
take
the
risk
mundungus
shrugged
and
grimaced
the
magical
eye
swerved
sideways
to
glance
at
him
out
of
the
side
of
Moodys
head
lets
have
no
more
arguments
times
wearing
on
i
want
a
few
of
your
hairs
boy
now
but
this
is
mad
theres
no
need
no
need
snarled
Moody
with
You-Know-Who
out
there
and
half
the
Ministry
on
his
side
potter
if
were
lucky
hell
have
swallowed
the
fake
bait
and
hell
be
planning
to
ambush
you
on
the
thirtieth
but
hed
be
mad
not
to
have
a
Death
Eater
or
two
keeping
an
eye
out
its
what
Id
do
they
might
not
be
able
to
get
at
you
or
this
house
while
your
mothers
charm
holds
but
its
about
to
break
and
they
know
the
rough
position
of
the
place
our
only
chance
is
to
use
decoys
even
You-Know-Who
cant
split
himself
into
seven
harry
caught
Hermiones
eye
and
looked
away
at
once
so
Potter
some
of
your
hair
if
you
please
harry
glanced
at
Ron
who
grimaced
at
him
in
a
just-do-it
sort
of
way
now
barked
Moody
with
all
of
their
eyes
upon
him
Harry
reached
up
to
the
top
of
his
head
grabbed
a
hank
of
hair
and
pulled
good
said
Moody
limping
forward
as
he
pulled
the
stopper
out
of
the
flask
of
potion
straight
in
here
if
you
please
harry
dropped
the
hair
into
the
mudlike
liquid
the
moment
it
made
contact
with
its
surface
the
potion
began
to
froth
and
smoke
then
all
at
once
it
turned
a
clear
bright
gold
ooh
you
look
much
tastier
than
Crabbe
and
Goyle
Harry
said
Hermione
before
catching
sight
of
Rons
raised
eyebrows
blushing
slightly
and
saying
Oh
you
know
what
I
mean
Goyles
potion
tasted
like
bogies
right
then
fake
Potters
line
up
over
here
please
said
Moody
ron
Hermione
Fred
George
and
Fleur
lined
up
in
front
of
Aunt
Petunias
gleaming
sink
were
one
short
said
Lupin
here
said
Hagrid
gruffly
and
he
lifted
Mundungus
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
and
dropped
him
down
beside
Fleur
who
wrinkled
her
nose
pointedly
and
moved
along
to
stand
between
Fred
and
George
instead
im
a
soldier
Id
sooner
be
a
protector
said
Mundungus
shut
it
growled
Moody
as
Ive
already
told
you
you
spineless
worm
any
Death
Eaters
we
run
into
will
be
aiming
to
capture
Potter
not
kill
him
dumbledore
always
said
You-Know-Who
would
want
to
finish
Potter
in
person
itll
be
the
protectors
who
have
got
the
most
to
worry
about
the
Death
Eatersll
want
to
kill
them
mundungus
did
not
look
particularly
reassured
but
Moody
was
already
pulling
half
a
dozen
eggcup-sized
glasses
from
inside
his
cloak
which
he
handed
out
before
pouring
a
little
Polyjuice
Potion
into
each
one
altogether
then
ron
Hermione
Fred
George
Fleur
and
Mundungus
drank
all
of
them
gasped
and
grimaced
as
the
potion
hit
their
throats
At
once
their
features
began
to
bubble
and
distort
like
hot
wax
hermione
and
Mundungus
were
shooting
upward
Ron
Fred
and
George
were
shrinking
their
hair
was
darkening
Hermiones
and
Fleurs
appearing
to
shoot
backward
into
their
skulls
moody
quite
unconcerned
was
now
loosening
the
ties
of
the
large
sacks
he
had
brought
with
him
when
he
straightened
up
again
there
were
six
Harry
Potters
gasping
and
panting
in
front
of
him
fred
and
George
turned
to
each
other
and
said
together
Wow
were
identical
i
dunno
though
I
think
Im
still
better-looking
said
Fred
examining
his
reflection
in
the
kettle
bah
said
Fleur
checking
herself
in
the
microwave
door
Bill
dont
look
at
me
Im
ideous
those
whose
clothes
are
a
bit
roomy
Ive
got
smaller
here
said
Moody
indicating
the
first
sack
and
vice
versa
dont
forget
the
glasses
theres
six
pairs
in
the
side
pocket
and
when
youre
dressed
theres
luggage
in
the
other
sack
the
real
Harry
thought
that
this
might
just
be
the
most
bizarre
thing
he
had
ever
seen
and
he
had
seen
some
extremely
odd
things
he
watched
as
his
six
doppelgangers
rummaged
in
the
sacks
pulling
out
sets
of
clothes
putting
on
glasses
stuffing
their
own
things
away
he
felt
like
asking
them
to
show
a
little
more
respect
for
privacy
as
they
all
began
stripping
off
with
impunity
clearly
more
at
ease
with
displaying
his
body
than
they
would
have
been
with
their
own
i
knew
Ginny
was
lying
about
that
tattoo
said
Ron
looking
down
at
his
bare
chest
harry
your
eyesight
really
is
awful
said
Hermione
as
she
put
on
glasses
once
dressed
the
fake
Harrys
took
rucksacks
and
owl
cages
each
containing
a
stuffed
snowy
owl
from
the
second
sack
good
said
Moody
as
at
last
seven
dressed
bespectacled
and
luggage-laden
Harrys
faced
him
the
pairs
will
be
as
follows
Mundungus
will
be
traveling
with
me
by
broom
whym
I
with
you
grunted
the
Harry
nearest
the
back
door
because
youre
the
one
that
needs
watching
growled
Moody
and
sure
enough
his
magical
eye
did
not
waver
from
Mundungus
as
he
continued
Arthur
and
Fred
im
George
said
the
twin
at
whom
Moody
was
pointing
cant
you
even
tell
us
apart
when
were
Harry
sorry
George
im
only
yanking
your
wand
Im
Fred
really
enough
messing
around
snarled
Moody
the
other
one
George
or
Fred
or
whoever
you
are
youre
with
Remus
miss
Delacour
im
taking
Fleur
on
a
thestral
said
Bill
shes
not
that
fond
of
brooms
fleur
walked
over
to
stand
beside
him
giving
him
a
soppy
slavish
look
that
Harry
hoped
with
all
his
heart
would
never
appear
on
his
face
again
miss
Granger
with
Kingsley
again
by
thestral
hermione
looked
reassured
as
she
answered
Kingsleys
smile
Harry
knew
that
Hermione
too
lacked
confidence
on
a
broomstick
which
leaves
you
and
me
Ron
said
Tonks
brightly
knocking
over
a
mug
tree
as
she
waved
at
him
ron
did
not
look
quite
as
pleased
as
Hermione
an
youre
with
me
Harry
that
all
righ
said
Hagrid
looking
a
little
anxious
well
be
on
the
bike
brooms
an
thestrals
cant
take
me
weight
see
not
a
lot
o
room
on
the
seat
with
me
on
it
though
so
youll
be
in
the
sidecar
thats
great
said
Harry
not
altogether
truthfully
we
think
the
Death
Eaters
will
expect
you
to
be
on
a
broom
said
Moody
who
seemed
to
guess
how
Harry
was
feeling
snapes
had
plenty
of
time
to
tell
them
everything
about
you
hes
never
mentioned
before
so
if
we
do
run
into
any
Death
Eaters
were
betting
theyll
choose
one
of
the
Potters
who
looks
at
home
on
a
broomstick
all
right
then
he
went
on
tying
up
the
sack
with
the
fake
Potters
clothes
in
it
and
leading
the
way
back
to
the
door
I
make
it
three
minutes
until
were
supposed
to
leave
no
point
locking
the
back
door
it
wont
keep
the
Death
Eaters
out
when
they
come
looking
come
on
harry
hurried
to
gather
his
rucksack
Firebolt
and
Hedwigs
cage
and
followed
the
group
to
the
dark
back
garden
on
every
side
broomsticks
were
leaping
into
hands
Hermione
had
already
been
helped
up
onto
a
great
black
thestral
by
Kingsley
Fleur
onto
the
other
by
Bill
hagrid
was
standing
ready
beside
the
motorbike
goggles
on
is
this
it
is
this
Siriuss
bike
the
very
same
said
Hagrid
beaming
down
at
Harry
an
the
last
time
yeh
was
on
it
Harry
I
could
fit
yeh
in
one
hand
harry
could
not
help
but
feel
a
little
humiliated
as
he
got
into
the
sidecar
it
placed
him
several
feet
below
everybody
else
Ron
smirked
at
the
sight
of
him
sitting
there
like
a
child
in
a
bumper
car
harry
stuffed
his
rucksack
and
broomstick
down
by
his
feet
and
rammed
Hedwigs
cage
between
his
knees
he
was
extremely
uncomfortable
arthurs
done
a
bit
o
tinkerin
said
Hagrid
quite
oblivious
to
Harrys
discomfort
he
settled
himself
astride
the
motorcycle
which
creaked
slightly
and
sank
inches
into
the
ground
its
got
a
few
tricks
up
its
sleeves
now
tha
one
was
my
idea
he
pointed
a
thick
finger
at
a
purple
button
near
the
speedometer
please
be
careful
Hagrid
said
mr.
Weasley
who
was
standing
beside
them
holding
his
broomstick
i'm
still
not
sure
that
was
advisable
and
it's
certainly
only
to
be
used
in
emergencies
all
right
then
said
Moody
everyone
ready
please
i
want
us
all
to
leave
at
exactly
the
same
time
or
the
whole
point
of
the
diversion's
lost
everybody
motioned
their
heads
hold
tight
now
Ron
said
Tonks
and
Harry
saw
Ron
throw
a
forcing
guilty
look
at
Lupin
before
placing
his
hands
on
each
side
of
her
waist
hagrid
kicked
the
motorbike
into
life
It
roared
like
a
dragon
and
the
sidecar
began
to
vibrate
good
luck
everyone
shouted
Moody
see
you
all
in
about
an
hour
at
the
Burrow
on
the
count
of
three
one
two
three
there
was
a
great
roar
from
the
motorbike
and
Harry
felt
the
sidecar
give
a
nasty
lurch
he
was
rising
through
the
air
fast
his
eyes
watering
slightly
hair
whipped
back
off
his
face
around
him
brooms
were
soaring
upward
too
the
long
black
tail
of
a
thestral
flicked
past
his
legs
jammed
into
the
sidecar
by
Hedwigs
cage
and
his
rucksack
were
already
sore
and
starting
to
go
numb
so
great
was
his
discomfort
that
he
almost
forgot
to
take
a
last
glimpse
of
number
four
Privet
Drive
by
the
time
he
looked
over
the
edge
of
the
sidecar
he
could
no
longer
tell
which
one
it
was
and
then
out
of
nowhere
out
of
nothing
they
were
surrounded
at
least
thirty
hooded
figures
suspended
in
midair
formed
a
vast
circle
in
the
middle
of
which
the
Order
members
had
risen
oblivious
screams
a
blaze
of
green
light
on
every
side
Hagrid
gave
a
yell
and
the
motorbike
rolled
over
harry
lost
any
sense
of
where
they
were
streetlights
above
him
yells
around
him
he
was
clinging
to
the
sidecar
for
dear
life
hedwig's
cage
the
Firebolt
and
his
rucksack
slipped
from
beneath
his
knees
no
help
the
broomstick
spun
too
but
he
just
managed
to
seize
the
strap
of
his
rucksack
and
the
top
of
the
cage
as
the
motorbike
swung
the
right
way
up
again
a
second's
relief
and
then
another
burst
of
green
light
the
owl
screeched
and
fell
to
the
floor
of
the
cage
no
no
the
motorbike
zoomed
forward
Harry
glimpsed
hooded
Death
Eaters
scattering
as
Hagrid
blasted
through
their
circle
hedwig
Hedwig
but
the
owl
lay
motionless
and
pathetic
as
a
toy
on
the
floor
of
her
cage
he
could
not
take
it
in
and
his
terror
for
the
others
was
paramount
he
glanced
over
his
shoulder
and
saw
a
mass
of
people
moving
flares
of
green
light
two
pairs
of
people
on
brooms
soaring
off
into
the
distance
but
he
could
not
tell
who
they
were
hagrid
we've
got
to
go
back
we've
got
to
go
back
he
yelled
over
the
thunderous
roar
of
the
engine
pulling
out
his
wand
ramming
hedwig's
cage
into
the
floor
refusing
to
believe
that
she
was
dead
hagrid
turn
around
my
job's
ter
get
you
there
safe
Harry
bellow
Hagrid
and
he
opened
the
throttle
stop
stop
harry
shouted
but
as
he
looked
back
again
two
jets
of
green
light
flew
past
his
left
ear
Four
Death
Eaters
had
broken
away
from
the
circle
and
were
pursuing
them
aiming
for
hagrid's
broad
back
hagrid
swerved
but
the
Death
Eaters
were
keeping
up
with
the
bike
more
curses
shot
after
them
and
Harry
had
to
sink
low
into
the
sidecar
to
avoid
them
wriggling
around
he
cried
Stupefy
and
a
red
bolt
of
light
shot
from
his
own
wand
cleaving
a
gap
between
the
four
pursuing
Death
Eaters
as
they
scattered
to
avoid
it
hold
on
Harry
this'll
do
for
em
roared
Hagrid
and
Harry
looked
up
just
in
time
to
see
Hagrid
slamming
a
thick
finger
into
a
green
button
near
the
fuel
gauge
a
wall
a
solid
black
wall
erupted
out
of
the
exhaust
pipe
craning
his
neck
Harry
saw
it
expand
into
being
in
midair
three
of
the
Death
Eaters
swerved
and
avoided
it
but
the
fourth
was
not
so
lucky
He
vanished
from
view
and
then
dropped
like
a
boulder
from
behind
it
his
broomstick
broken
into
pieces
one
of
his
fellows
slowed
up
to
save
him
but
they
and
the
airborne
wall
were
swallowed
by
darkness
as
Hagrid
leaned
low
over
the
handlebars
and
sped
up
more
Killing
Curses
flew
past
harry's
head
from
the
two
remaining
Death
Eaters
wands
they
were
aiming
for
Hagrid
harry
responded
with
further
Stunning
Spells
Red
and
green
collided
in
midair
in
a
shower
of
multicolored
sparks
and
Harry
thought
wildly
of
fireworks
and
the
Muggles
below
who
would
have
no
idea
what
was
happening
here
we
go
again
Harry
hold
on
yelled
Hagrid
and
he
jabbed
at
a
second
button
this
time
a
great
net
burst
from
the
bike's
exhaust
but
the
Death
Eaters
were
ready
for
it
not
only
did
they
swerve
to
avoid
it
but
the
companion
who
had
slowed
to
save
their
unconscious
friend
had
caught
up
he
bloomed
suddenly
out
of
the
darkness
and
now
three
of
them
were
pursuing
the
motorbike
all
shooting
curses
after
it
this'll
do
it
Harry
hold
on
tight
yelled
Hagrid
and
Harry
saw
him
slam
his
whole
hand
onto
the
purple
button
beside
the
speedometer
with
an
unmistakable
bellowing
roar
dragon
fire
burst
from
the
exhaust
white-hot
and
blue
and
the
motorbike
shot
forward
like
a
bullet
with
a
sound
of
wrenching
metal
harry
saw
the
Death
Eaters
swerve
out
of
sight
to
avoid
the
deadly
trail
of
flame
and
at
the
same
time
felt
the
sidecar
sway
ominously
Its
metal
connections
to
the
bike
had
splintered
with
the
force
of
acceleration
it's
all
righ
Harry
bellowed
Hagrid
now
thrown
flat
onto
the
back
by
the
surge
of
speed
nobody
was
steering
now
and
the
sidecar
was
starting
to
twist
violently
in
the
bike's
slipstream
i'm
on
it
Harry
don
worry
hagrid
yelled
and
from
inside
his
jacket
pocket
he
pulled
his
flowery
pink
umbrella
hagrid
no
let
me
reparo
there
was
a
deafening
bang
and
the
sidecar
broke
away
from
the
bike
completely
harry
sped
forward
propelled
by
the
impetus
of
the
bike's
flight
then
the
sidecar
began
to
lose
height
in
desperation
Harry
pointed
his
wand
at
the
sidecar
and
shouted
Wingardium
Leviosa
the
sidecar
rose
like
a
cork
unsteerable
but
at
least
still
airborne
he
had
but
a
split
second's
relief
however
as
more
curses
streaked
past
him
The
three
Death
Eaters
were
closing
in
i'm
comin
Harry
hagrid
yelled
from
out
of
the
darkness
but
Harry
could
feel
the
sidecar
beginning
to
sink
again
Crouching
as
low
as
he
could
he
pointed
at
the
middle
of
the
oncoming
figures
and
yelled
Impedimenta
the
jinx
hit
the
middle
Death
Eater
in
the
chest
For
a
moment
the
man
was
absurdly
spread-eagled
in
midair
as
though
he
had
hit
an
invisible
barrier
One
of
his
fellows
almost
collided
with
him
then
the
sidecar
began
to
fall
in
earnest
and
the
remaining
Death
Eater
shot
a
curse
so
close
to
Harry
that
he
had
to
duck
below
the
rim
of
the
car
knocking
out
a
tooth
on
the
edge
of
his
seat
i'm
comin
Harry
i'm
comin
a
huge
hand
seized
the
back
of
harry's
robes
and
hoisted
him
out
of
the
plummeting
sidecar
Harry
pulled
his
rucksack
with
him
as
he
dragged
himself
onto
the
motorbike's
seat
and
found
himself
back-to-back
with
Hagrid
as
they
soared
upward
away
from
the
two
remaining
Death
Eaters
Harry
spat
blood
out
of
his
mouth
pointed
his
wand
at
the
falling
sidecar
and
yelled
Confringo
he
knew
a
dreadful
gut-wrenching
pang
for
Hedwig
as
it
exploded
the
Death
Eater
nearest
it
was
blasted
off
his
broom
and
fell
from
sight
his
companion
fell
back
and
vanished
harry
i'm
sorry
i'm
sorry
moaned
Hagrid
I
shouldn'ta
tried
ter
repair
it
meself
yeh've
got
no
room
it's
not
a
problem
just
keep
flying
harry
shouted
back
as
two
more
Death
Eaters
emerged
out
of
the
darkness
drawing
closer
as
the
curses
came
shooting
across
the
intervening
space
again
Hagrid
swerved
and
zigzagged
Harry
knew
that
Hagrid
did
not
dare
use
the
dragon-fire
button
again
with
Harry
seated
so
insecurely
harry
sent
Stunning
Spell
after
Stunning
Spell
back
at
their
pursuers
barely
holding
them
off
he
shot
another
blocking
jinx
at
them
The
closest
Death
Eater
swerved
to
avoid
it
and
his
hood
slipped
and
by
the
red
light
of
his
next
Stunning
Spell
Harry
saw
the
strangely
blank
face
of
Stanley
Shunpike
Stan
expelliarmus
harry
yelled
that's
him
it's
him
it's
the
real
one
the
hooded
Death
eater's
shout
reached
Harry
even
above
the
thunder
of
the
motorbike's
engine
Next
moment
both
pursuers
had
fallen
back
and
disappeared
from
view
harry
what's
happened
bellowed
Hagrid
where've
they
gone
i
don't
know
but
Harry
was
afraid
The
hooded
Death
Eater
had
shouted
it's
the
real
one
how
had
he
known
he
gazed
around
at
the
apparently
empty
darkness
and
felt
its
menace
where
were
they
he
clambered
around
on
the
seat
to
face
forward
and
seized
hold
of
the
back
of
hagrid's
jacket
hagrid
do
the
dragon-fire
thing
again
let's
get
out
of
here
hold
on
tight
then
Harry
there
was
a
deafening
screeching
roar
again
and
the
white-blue
fire
shot
from
the
exhaust
Harry
felt
himself
slipping
backwards
off
what
little
of
the
seat
he
had
hagrid
flung
backward
upon
him
barely
maintaining
his
grip
on
the
handlebars
i
think
we've
lost
em
Harry
I
think
we've
done
it
yelled
Hagrid
but
Harry
was
not
convinced
Fear
lapped
at
him
as
he
looked
left
and
right
for
pursuers
he
was
sure
would
come
why
had
they
fallen
back
one
of
them
had
still
had
a
wand
it's
him
it's
the
real
one
they
had
said
it
right
after
he
had
tried
to
Disarm
Stan
we're
nearly
there
Harry
we've
nearly
made
it
shouted
Hagrid
harry
felt
the
bike
drop
a
little
though
the
lights
down
on
the
ground
still
seemed
remote
as
stars
then
the
scar
on
his
forehead
burned
like
fire
as
a
Death
Eater
appeared
on
either
side
of
the
bike
two
Killing
Curses
missed
Harry
by
millimeters
cast
from
behind
and
then
Harry
saw
him
voldemort
was
flying
like
smoke
on
the
wind
without
broomstick
or
thestral
to
hold
him
his
snake-like
face
gleaming
out
of
the
blackness
his
white
fingers
raising
his
wand
again
hagrid
let
out
a
bellow
of
fear
and
steered
the
motorbike
into
a
vertical
dive
clinging
on
for
dear
life
Harry
sent
Stunning
Spells
flying
at
random
into
the
whirling
night
he
saw
a
body
fly
past
him
and
knew
he
had
hit
one
of
them
but
then
he
heard
a
bang
and
saw
sparks
from
the
engine
the
motorbike
spiraled
through
the
air
completely
out
of
control
green
jets
of
light
shot
past
them
again
harry
had
no
idea
which
way
was
up
which
down
His
scar
was
still
burning
he
expected
to
die
at
any
second
a
hooded
figure
on
a
broomstick
was
feet
from
him
he
saw
it
raise
its
arm
no
with
a
shout
of
fury
Hagrid
launched
himself
off
the
bike
at
the
Death
Eater
to
his
horror
Harry
saw
both
Hagrid
and
the
Death
Eater
falling
out
of
sight
their
combined
weight
too
much
for
the
broomstick
barely
gripping
the
plummeting
bike
with
his
knees
Harry
heard
Voldemort
scream
Mine
it
was
over
He
could
not
see
or
hear
where
Voldemort
was
he
glimpsed
another
Death
Eater
swooping
out
of
the
way
and
heard
Avada
as
the
pain
from
harry's
scar
forced
his
eyes
shut
his
wand
acted
of
its
own
accord
he
felt
it
drag
his
hand
around
like
some
great
magnet
saw
a
spurt
of
golden
fire
through
his
half-closed
eyelids
heard
a
crack
and
a
scream
of
fury
the
remaining
Death
Eater
yelled
Voldemort
screamed
no
somehow
Harry
found
his
nose
an
inch
from
the
dragon-fire
button
he
punched
it
with
his
wand-free
hand
and
the
bike
shot
more
flames
into
the
air
hurtling
straight
toward
the
ground
hagrid
harry
called
holding
on
to
the
bike
for
dear
life
hagrid
Accio
Hagrid
the
motorbike
sped
up
sucked
towards
the
earth
face
level
with
the
handlebars
Harry
could
see
nothing
but
distant
lights
growing
nearer
and
nearer
He
was
going
to
crash
and
there
was
nothing
he
could
do
about
it
behind
him
came
another
scream
Your
wand
Selwyn
give
me
your
wand
he
felt
Voldemort
before
he
saw
him
looking
sideways
he
stared
into
the
red
eyes
and
was
sure
they
would
be
the
last
thing
he
ever
saw
Voldemort
preparing
to
curse
him
once
more
and
then
Voldemort
vanished
harry
looked
down
and
saw
Hagrid
spread-eagled
on
the
ground
below
him
he
pulled
hard
at
the
handlebars
to
avoid
hitting
him
groped
for
the
brake
but
with
an
earsplitting
ground
trembling
crash
he
smashed
into
a
muddy
pond
chapter
Five
fallen
Warrior
hagrid
harry
struggled
to
raise
himself
out
of
the
debris
of
metal
and
leather
that
surrounded
him
his
hands
sank
into
inches
of
muddy
water
as
he
tried
to
stand
he
could
not
understand
where
Voldemort
had
gone
and
expected
him
to
swoop
out
of
the
darkness
at
any
moment
something
hot
and
wet
was
trickling
down
his
chin
and
from
his
forehead
he
crawled
out
of
the
pond
and
stumbled
toward
the
great
dark
mass
on
the
ground
that
was
Hagrid
hagrid
hagrid
talk
to
me
but
the
dark
mass
did
not
stir
who's
there
is
it
Potter
are
you
Harry
Potter
harry
did
not
recognize
the
man's
voice
then
a
woman
shouted
they've
crashed
ted
crashed
in
the
garden
harry's
head
was
swimming
hagrid
he
repeated
stupidly
and
his
knees
buckled
the
next
thing
he
knew
he
was
lying
on
his
back
on
what
felt
like
cushions
with
a
burning
sensation
in
his
ribs
and
right
arm
his
missing
tooth
had
been
regrown
the
scar
on
his
forehead
was
still
throbbing
hagrid
he
opened
his
eyes
and
saw
that
he
was
lying
on
a
sofa
in
an
unfamiliar
lamplit
sitting
room
his
rucksack
lay
on
the
floor
a
short
distance
away
wet
and
muddy
a
fair-haired
big-bellied
man
was
watching
Harry
anxiously
hagrid's
fine
son
said
the
man
the
wife's
seeing
to
him
now
how
are
you
feeling
anything
else
broken
i've
fixed
your
ribs
your
tooth
and
your
arm
i'm
Ted
by
the
way
Ted
Tonks
dora's
father
harry
sat
up
too
quickly
lights
popped
in
front
of
his
eyes
and
he
felt
sick
and
giddy
voldemort
easy
now
said
Ted
Tonks
placing
a
hand
on
harry's
shoulder
and
pushing
him
back
against
the
cushions
that
was
a
nasty
crash
you
just
had
what
happened
anyway
something
go
wrong
with
the
bike
arthur
Weasley
overstretch
himself
again
him
and
his
Muggle
contraptions
no
said
Harry
as
his
scar
pulsed
like
an
open
wound
death
Eaters
loads
of
them
we
were
chased
death
Eaters
said
Ted
sharply
what
d'you
mean
Death
Eaters
i
thought
they
didn't
know
you
were
being
moved
tonight
I
thought
they
knew
said
Harry
ted
Tonks
looked
up
at
the
ceiling
as
though
he
could
see
through
it
to
the
sky
above
well
we
know
our
protective
charms
hold
then
don't
we
they
shouldn't
be
able
to
get
within
a
hundred
yards
of
the
place
in
any
direction
now
Harry
understood
why
Voldemort
had
vanished
it
had
been
at
the
point
when
the
motorbike
crossed
the
barrier
of
the
order's
charms
he
only
hoped
they
would
continue
to
work
He
imagined
Voldemort
a
hundred
yards
above
them
as
they
spoke
looking
for
a
way
to
penetrate
what
Harry
visualized
as
a
great
transparent
bubble
he
swung
his
legs
off
the
sofa
he
needed
to
see
Hagrid
with
his
own
eyes
before
he
would
believe
that
he
was
alive
he
had
barely
stood
up
however
when
a
door
opened
and
Hagrid
squeezed
through
it
his
face
covered
in
mud
and
blood
limping
a
little
but
miraculously
alive
harry
knocking
over
two
delicate
tables
and
an
aspidistra
he
covered
the
floor
between
them
in
two
strides
and
pulled
Harry
into
a
hug
that
nearly
cracked
his
newly
repaired
ribs
blimey
Harry
how
did
yeh
get
out
o
that
i
thought
we
were
both
goners
yeah
me
too
i
can't
believe
harry
broke
off
he
had
just
noticed
the
woman
who
had
entered
the
room
behind
Hagrid
you
he
shouted
and
he
thrust
his
hand
into
his
pocket
but
it
was
empty
your
wand's
here
son
said
Ted
tapping
it
on
harry's
arm
it
fell
right
beside
you
I
picked
it
up
and
that's
my
wife
you're
shouting
at
oh
i'm
i'm
sorry
as
she
moved
forward
into
the
room
Mrs
tonks's
resemblance
to
her
sister
Bellatrix
became
much
less
pronounced
Her
hair
was
a
lights
oft
brown
and
her
eyes
were
wider
and
kinder
nevertheless
she
looked
a
little
haughty
after
harry's
exclamation
what
happened
to
our
daughter
she
asked
hagrid
said
you
were
ambushed
where
is
Nymphadora
i
don't
know
said
Harry
we
don't
know
what
happened
to
anyone
else
she
and
Ted
exchanged
looks
a
mixture
of
fear
and
guilt
gripped
Harry
at
the
sight
of
their
expressions
if
any
of
the
others
had
died
it
was
his
fault
all
his
fault
he
had
consented
to
the
plan
given
them
his
hair
the
Portkey
he
said
remembering
all
of
a
sudden
we've
got
to
get
back
to
the
Burrow
and
find
out
then
we'll
be
able
to
send
you
word
or
or
Tonks
will
once
she's
dora'll
be
ok
Dromeda
said
Ted
she
knows
her
stuff
she's
been
in
plenty
of
tight
spots
with
the
Aurors
the
portkey's
through
here
he
added
to
Harry
it's
supposed
to
leave
in
three
minutes
if
you
want
to
take
it
yeah
we
do
said
Harry
he
seized
his
rucksack
swung
it
onto
his
shoulders
i
he
looked
at
Mrs
tonks
wanting
to
apologize
for
the
state
of
fear
in
which
he
left
her
and
for
which
he
felt
so
terribly
responsible
but
no
words
occurred
to
him
that
he
did
not
seem
hollow
and
insincere
i'll
tell
Tonks
Dora
to
send
word
when
she
thanks
for
patching
us
up
thanks
for
everything
I
he
was
glad
to
leave
the
room
and
follow
Ted
Tonks
along
a
short
hallway
and
into
a
bedroom
hagrid
came
after
them
bending
low
to
avoid
hitting
his
head
on
the
door
lintel
there
you
go
son
that's
the
Portkey
mr.
Tonks
was
pointing
to
a
small
silver-backed
hairbrush
lying
on
the
dressing
table
thanks
said
Harry
reaching
out
to
place
a
finger
on
it
ready
to
leave
wait
a
moment
said
Hagrid
looking
around
harry
where's
Hedwig
she
she
got
hit
said
Harry
the
realization
crashed
over
him
He
felt
ashamed
of
himself
as
the
tears
stung
his
eyes
the
owl
had
been
his
companion
his
one
great
link
with
the
magical
world
whenever
he
had
been
forced
to
return
to
the
Dursleys
hagrid
reached
out
a
great
hand
and
patted
him
painfully
on
the
shoulder
never
mind
he
said
gruffly
Never
mind
she
had
a
great
old
life
hagrid
said
Ted
Tonks
warningly
as
the
hairbrush
glowed
bright
blue
and
Hagrid
only
just
got
his
forefinger
to
it
in
time
with
a
jerk
behind
the
navel
as
though
an
invisible
hook
and
line
had
dragged
him
forward
Harry
was
pulled
into
nothingness
spinning
uncontrollably
his
finger
glued
to
the
Portkey
as
he
and
Hagrid
hurtled
away
from
mr.
Tonks
second
later
harry's
feet
slammed
onto
hard
ground
and
he
fell
onto
his
hands
and
knees
in
the
yard
of
the
Burrow
he
heard
screams
throwing
aside
the
no
longer
glowing
hairbrush
Harry
stood
up
swaying
slightly
and
saw
Mrs
weasley
and
Ginny
running
down
the
steps
by
the
back
door
as
Hagrid
who
had
also
collapsed
on
landing
clambered
laboriously
to
his
feet
harry
you
are
the
real
Harry
what
happened
where
are
the
others
cried
Mrs
weasley
what
d'you
mean
isn't
anyone
else
back
harry
panted
the
answer
was
clearly
etched
in
Mrs
weasley's
pale
face
the
Death
Eaters
were
waiting
for
us
Harry
told
her
We
were
surrounded
the
moment
we
took
off
they
knew
it
was
tonight
I
don't
know
what
happened
to
anyone
else
four
of
them
chased
us
it
was
all
we
could
do
to
get
away
and
then
Voldemort
caught
up
with
us
he
could
hear
the
self-justifying
note
in
his
voice
the
plea
for
her
to
understand
why
he
did
not
know
what
had
happened
to
her
sons
but
thank
goodness
you're
all
right
she
said
pulling
him
into
a
hug
he
did
not
feel
he
deserved
haven't
go
any
brandy
have
yeh
Molly
asked
Hagrid
a
little
shakily
Fer
medicinal
purposes
she
could
have
summoned
it
by
magic
but
as
she
hurried
back
toward
the
crooked
house
Harry
knew
that
she
wanted
to
hide
her
face
he
turned
to
Ginny
and
she
answered
his
unspoken
plea
for
information
at
once
ron
and
Tonks
should
have
been
back
first
but
they
missed
their
Portkey
it
came
back
without
them
she
said
pointing
at
a
rusty
oil
can
lying
on
the
ground
nearby
and
that
one
she
pointed
at
an
ancient
sneaker
should
have
been
Dad
and
fred's
they
were
supposed
to
be
second
you
and
Hagrid
were
third
and
she
checked
her
watch
if
they
made
it
George
and
Lupin
aught
to
be
back
in
about
a
minute
mrs
weasley
reappeared
carrying
a
bottle
of
brandy
which
she
handed
to
Hagrid
he
uncorked
it
and
drank
it
straight
down
in
one
mum
shouted
Ginny
pointing
to
a
spot
several
feet
away
a
blue
light
had
appeared
in
the
darkness
It
grew
larger
and
brighter
and
Lupin
and
George
appeared
spinning
and
then
falling
harry
knew
immediately
that
there
was
something
wrong
Lupin
was
supporting
George
who
was
unconscious
and
whose
face
was
covered
in
blood
harry
ran
forward
and
seized
george's
legs
together
he
and
Lupin
carried
George
into
the
house
and
through
the
kitchen
to
the
living
room
where
they
laid
him
on
the
sofa
as
the
lamplight
fell
across
george's
head
Ginny
gasped
and
harry's
stomach
lurched
One
of
george's
ears
was
missing
the
side
of
his
head
and
neck
were
drenched
in
wet
shockingly
scarlet
blood
no
sooner
had
Mrs
weasley
bent
over
her
son
that
Lupin
grabbed
Harry
by
the
upper
arm
and
dragged
him
none
too
gently
back
into
the
kitchen
where
Hagrid
was
still
attempting
to
ease
his
bulk
through
the
back
door
oi
said
Hagrid
indignantly
Le
go
of
him
le
go
of
Harry
lupin
ignored
him
what
creature
sat
in
the
corner
the
first
time
that
Harry
Potter
visited
my
office
at
Hogwarts
he
said
giving
Harry
a
small
shake
answer
me
a
a
grindylow
in
a
tank
wasn't
it
lupin
released
Harry
and
fell
back
against
a
kitchen
cupboard
wha
was
tha
about
roared
Hagrid
i'm
sorry
Harry
but
I
had
to
check
said
Lupin
tersely
we've
been
betrayed
voldemort
knew
that
you
were
being
moved
tonight
and
the
only
people
who
could
have
told
him
were
directly
involved
in
the
plan
you
might
have
been
an
impostor
so
why
aren
you
checkin
me
panted
Hagrid
still
struggling
with
the
door
you're
half-giant
said
Lupin
looking
up
at
Hagrid
the
Polyjuice
Potion
is
designed
for
human
use
only
none
of
the
Order
would
have
told
Voldemort
we
were
moving
tonight
said
Harry
the
idea
was
dreadful
to
him
he
could
not
believe
it
of
any
of
them
voldemort
only
caught
up
with
me
toward
the
end
he
didn't
know
which
one
I
was
in
the
beginning
if
he'd
been
in
on
the
plan
he'd
have
known
from
the
start
I
was
the
one
with
Hagrid
voldemort
caught
up
with
you
said
Lupin
sharply
what
happened
how
did
you
escape
harry
explained
how
the
Death
Eaters
pursuing
them
had
seemed
to
recognize
him
as
the
true
Harry
how
they
had
abandoned
the
chase
how
they
must
have
summoned
Voldemort
who
had
appeared
just
before
he
and
Hagrid
had
reached
the
sanctuary
of
tonks's
parents
they
recognized
you
but
how
what
had
you
done
harry
tried
to
remember
the
whole
journey
seemed
like
a
blur
of
panic
and
confusion
i
saw
Stan
Shunpike
you
know
the
bloke
who
was
the
conductor
on
the
Knight
Bus
and
I
tried
to
Disarm
him
instead
of
well
he
doesn't
know
what
he's
doing
does
he
he
must
be
Imperiused
lupin
looked
aghast
harry
the
time
for
Disarming
is
past
these
people
are
trying
to
capture
and
kill
you
at
least
Stun
if
you
aren't
prepared
to
kill
we
were
hundreds
of
feet
up
stan's
not
himself
and
if
I
Stunned
him
and
he'd
fallen
he'd
have
died
the
same
as
if
i'd
used
Avada
Kedavra
expelliarmus
saved
me
from
Voldemort
two
years
ago
Harry
added
defiantly
lupin
was
reminding
him
of
the
sneering
Hufflepuff
Zacharias
Smith
who
had
jeered
at
Harry
for
wanting
to
teach
dumbledore's
Army
how
to
Disarm
yes
Harry
said
Lupin
with
painful
restraint
and
a
great
number
of
Death
Eaters
witnessed
that
happening
forgive
me
but
it
was
a
very
unusual
move
then
under
the
imminent
threat
of
death
repeating
it
tonight
in
front
of
Death
Eaters
who
either
witnessed
or
heard
about
the
first
occasion
was
close
to
suicidal
so
you
think
I
should
have
killed
Stan
Shunpike
said
Harry
angrily
of
course
not
said
Lupin
but
the
Death
Eaters
frankly
most
people
would
have
expected
you
to
attack
back
expelliarmus
is
a
useful
spell
Harry
but
the
Death
Eaters
seem
to
think
it
is
your
signature
move
and
I
urge
you
not
to
let
it
become
so
lupin
was
making
Harry
feel
idiotic
and
yet
there
was
still
a
grain
of
defiance
inside
him
i
won't
blast
people
out
of
my
way
just
because
they're
there
said
Harry
that's
voldemort's
job
lupin's
retort
was
lost
Finally
succeeding
in
squeezing
through
the
door
Hagrid
staggered
to
a
chair
and
sat
down
it
collapsed
beneath
him
ignoring
his
mingled
oaths
and
apologies
Harry
addressed
Lupin
again
will
George
be
okay
all
lupin's
frustration
with
Harry
seemed
to
drain
away
at
the
question
i
think
so
although
there's
no
chance
of
replacing
his
ear
not
when
it's
been
cursed
off
there
was
a
scuffling
from
outside
lupin
dived
for
the
back
door
Harry
leapt
over
hagrid's
legs
and
sprinted
into
the
yard
two
figures
had
appeared
in
the
yard
and
as
Harry
ran
toward
them
he
realized
they
were
Hermione
now
returning
to
her
normal
appearance
and
Kingsley
both
clutching
a
bent
coat
hanger
Hermione
flung
herself
into
harry's
arms
but
Kingsley
showed
no
pleasure
at
the
sight
of
any
of
them
over
hermione's
shoulder
Harry
saw
him
raise
his
wand
and
point
it
at
lupin's
chest
the
last
words
Albus
Dumbledore
spoke
to
the
pair
of
us
harry
is
the
best
hope
we
have
trust
him
said
Lupin
calmly
kingsley
turned
his
wand
on
Harry
but
Lupin
said
it's
him
i've
checked
all
right
all
right
said
Kingsley
stowing
his
wand
back
beneath
his
cloak
But
somebody
betrayed
us
they
knew
they
knew
it
was
tonight
so
it
seems
replied
Lupin
but
apparently
they
did
not
realize
that
there
would
be
seven
Harrys
small
comfort
snarled
Kingsley
who
else
is
back
only
Harry
Hagrid
George
and
me
hermione
stifled
a
little
moan
behind
her
hand
what
happened
to
you
lupin
asked
Kingsley
followed
by
five
injured
two
might've
killed
one
Kingsley
reeled
off
and
we
saw
You-Know-Who
as
well
he
joined
the
chase
halfway
through
but
vanished
pretty
quickly
remus
he
can
fly
supplied
Harry
i
saw
him
too
he
came
after
Hagrid
and
me
so
that's
why
he
left
to
follow
you
said
Kingsley
I
couldn't
understand
why
he'd
vanished
but
what
made
him
change
targets
harry
behaved
a
little
too
kindly
to
Stan
Shunpike
said
Lupin
stan
repeated
Hermione
but
I
thought
he
was
in
Azkaban
kingsley
let
out
a
mirthless
laugh
hermione
there's
obviously
been
a
mass
breakout
which
the
Ministry
has
hushed
up
travers's
hood
fell
off
when
I
cursed
him
he's
supposed
to
be
inside
too
but
what
happened
to
you
Remus
where's
George
he
lost
an
ear
said
Lupin
lost
an
repeated
Hermione
in
a
high
voice
snape's
work
said
Lupin
snape
shouted
Harry
you
didn't
say
he
lost
his
hood
during
the
chase
sectumsempra
was
always
a
specialty
of
snape's
i
wish
I
could
say
i'd
paid
him
back
in
kind
but
it
was
all
I
could
do
to
keep
George
on
the
broom
after
he
was
injured
he
was
losing
so
much
blood
silence
fell
between
the
four
of
them
as
they
looked
up
at
the
sky
there
was
no
sign
of
movement
the
stars
stared
back
unblinking
indifferent
unobscured
by
flying
friends
where
was
Ron
where
were
Fred
and
mr.
Weasley
where
were
Bill
Fleur
Tonks
Mad-Eye
and
Mundungus
harry
give
us
a
hand
called
Hagrid
hoarsely
from
the
door
in
which
he
was
stuck
again
glad
of
something
to
do
Harry
pulled
him
free
the
headed
through
the
empty
kitchen
and
back
into
the
sitting
room
where
Mrs
weasley
and
Ginny
were
still
tending
to
George
mrs
weasley
had
staunched
his
bleeding
now
and
by
the
lamplight
Harry
saw
a
clean
gaping
hole
where
george's
ear
had
been
how
is
he
mrs
weasley
looked
around
and
said
I
can't
make
it
grow
back
not
when
it's
been
removed
by
Dark
Magic
but
it
could've
been
so
much
worse
he's
alive
yeah
said
Harry
thank
God
did
I
hear
someone
else
in
the
yard
ginny
asked
hermione
and
Kingsley
said
Harry
thank
goodness
Ginny
whispered
they
looked
at
each
other
Harry
wanted
to
hug
her
hold
on
to
her
he
did
not
even
care
much
that
Mrs
weasley
was
there
but
before
he
could
act
on
the
impulse
there
was
a
great
crash
from
the
kitchen
i'll
prove
who
I
am
Kingsley
after
i've
seen
my
son
now
back
off
if
you
know
what's
good
for
you
harry
had
never
heard
mr.
Weasley
shout
like
that
before
he
burst
into
the
living
room
his
bald
patch
gleaming
with
sweat
his
spectacles
askew
Fred
right
behind
him
both
pale
but
uninjured
arthur
sobbed
Mrs
weasley
oh
thank
goodness
how
is
he
mr.
Weasley
dropped
to
his
knees
beside
George
for
the
first
time
since
Harry
had
known
him
Fred
seemed
to
be
lost
for
words
he
gaped
over
the
back
of
the
sofa
at
his
twin's
wound
as
if
he
could
not
believe
what
he
was
seeing
perhaps
roused
by
the
sound
of
Fred
and
their
father's
arrival
George
stirred
how
do
you
feel
Georgie
whispered
Mrs
weasley
george's
fingers
groped
for
the
side
of
his
head
saintlike
he
murmured
what's
wrong
with
him
croaked
Fred
looking
terrified
is
his
mind
affected
saintlike
repeated
George
opening
his
eyes
and
looking
up
at
his
brother
you
see
i'm
holy
holey
Fred
geddit
mrs
weasley
sobbed
harder
than
ever
color
flooded
fred's
pale
face
pathetic
he
told
George
pathetic
with
the
whole
wide
world
of
ear-related
humor
before
you
you
go
for
holey
ah
well
said
George
grinning
at
his
tear-soaked
mother
you'll
be
able
to
tell
us
apart
now
anyway
Mum
he
looked
around
hi
Harry
you
are
Harry
right
yeah
I
am
said
Harry
moving
closer
to
the
sofa
well
at
least
we
got
you
back
okay
said
George
why
aren't
Ron
and
Bill
huddled
round
my
sickbed
they're
not
back
yet
George
said
Mrs
weasley
george's
grin
faded
harry
glanced
at
Ginny
and
motioned
to
her
to
accompany
him
back
outside
as
they
walked
through
the
kitchen
she
said
in
a
low
voice
ron
and
Tonks
should
be
back
by
now
they
didn't
have
a
long
journey
Auntie
muriel's
not
that
far
from
here
harry
said
nothing
he
had
been
trying
to
keep
fear
at
bay
ever
since
reaching
the
Burrow
but
now
it
enveloped
him
seeming
to
crawl
over
his
skin
throbbing
in
his
chest
clogging
his
throat
as
they
walked
down
the
back
steps
into
the
dark
yard
Ginny
took
his
hand
kingsley
was
striding
backward
and
forward
glancing
up
at
the
sky
every
time
he
turned
harry
was
reminded
of
Uncle
Vernon
pacing
the
living
room
a
million
years
ago
hagrid
Hermione
and
Lupin
stood
shoulder
to
shoulder
gazing
upward
in
silence
none
of
them
looked
around
when
Harry
and
Ginny
joined
their
silent
vigil
the
minutes
stretched
into
what
might
as
well
have
been
years
the
slightest
breath
of
wind
made
them
all
jump
and
turn
toward
the
whispering
bush
or
tree
in
the
hope
that
one
of
the
missing
Order
members
might
leap
unscathed
from
its
leaves
and
then
a
broom
materialized
directly
above
them
and
streaked
toward
the
ground
it's
them
screamed
Hermione
tonks
landed
in
a
long
skid
that
sent
earth
and
pebbles
everywhere
remus
tonks
cried
as
she
staggered
off
the
broom
into
lupin's
arms
his
face
was
set
and
white
He
seemed
unable
to
speak
Ron
tripped
dazedly
toward
Harry
and
Hermione
you're
okay
he
mumbled
before
Hermione
flew
at
him
and
hugged
him
tightly
i
thought
I
thought
m
all
right
said
Ron
patting
her
on
the
back
m
fine
ron
was
great
said
Tonks
warmly
relinquishing
her
hold
on
Lupin
wonderful
stunned
one
of
the
Death
Eaters
straight
to
the
head
and
when
you're
aiming
at
a
moving
target
from
a
flying
broom
you
did
said
Hermione
gazing
up
at
Ron
with
her
arms
still
around
his
neck
always
the
tone
of
surprise
he
said
a
little
grumpily
breaking
free
are
we
the
last
back
no
said
Ginny
we're
still
waiting
for
Bill
and
Fleur
and
Mad-Eye
and
Mundungus
i'm
going
to
tell
Mum
and
Dad
you're
okay
Ron
she
ran
back
inside
so
what
kept
you
what
happened
lupin
sounded
almost
angry
at
Tonks
bellatrix
said
Tonks
she
wants
me
quite
as
much
as
she
wants
Harry
Remus
She
tried
very
hard
to
kill
me
i
just
wish
i'd
got
her
I
owe
Bellatrix
but
we
definitely
injured
Rodolphus
then
we
got
to
ron's
Auntie
muriel's
and
we
missed
our
Portkey
and
she
was
fussing
over
us
a
muscle
was
jumping
in
lupin's
jaw
he
nodded
but
seemed
unable
to
say
anything
else
so
what
happened
to
you
lot
tonks
asked
turning
to
Harry
Hermione
and
Kingsley
they
recounted
the
stories
of
their
own
journeys
but
all
the
time
the
continued
absence
of
Bill
Fleur
Mad-Eye
and
Mundungus
seemed
to
lie
upon
them
like
a
frost
its
icy
bite
harder
and
harder
to
ignore
i'm
going
to
have
to
get
back
to
Downing
Street
I
should
have
been
there
an
hour
ago
said
Kingsley
finally
after
a
last
sweeping
gaze
at
the
sky
let
me
know
when
they're
back
lupin
nodded
with
a
wave
to
the
others
Kingsley
walked
away
into
the
darkness
toward
the
gate
harry
thought
he
heard
the
faintest
pop
as
Kingsley
Disapparated
just
beyond
the
burrow's
boundaries
mr.
And
Mrs
weasley
came
racing
down
the
back
steps
Ginny
behind
them
both
parents
hugged
Ron
before
turning
to
Lupin
and
Tonks
thank
you
said
Mrs
weasley
for
our
sons
don't
be
silly
Molly
said
Tonks
at
once
how's
George
asked
Lupin
what's
wrong
with
him
piped
up
Ron
he's
lost
but
the
end
of
Mrs
weasley's
sentence
was
drowned
in
a
general
outcry
a
thestral
had
just
soared
into
sight
and
landed
a
few
feet
from
them
bill
and
Fleur
slid
from
its
back
windswept
but
unhurt
bill
thank
God
thank
God
mrs
weasley
ran
forward
but
the
hug
Bill
bestowed
upon
her
was
perfunctory
looking
directly
at
his
father
he
said
mad-eye's
dead
nobody
spoke
nobody
moved
harry
felt
as
though
something
inside
him
was
falling
falling
through
the
earth
leaving
him
forever
we
saw
it
said
Bill
Fleur
nodded
tear
tracks
glittering
on
her
cheeks
in
the
light
from
the
kitchen
window
it
happened
just
after
we
broke
out
of
the
circle
Mad-Eye
and
Dung
were
close
by
us
they
were
heading
north
too
voldemort
he
can
fly
went
straight
for
them
dung
panicked
I
heard
him
cry
out
Mad-Eye
tried
to
stop
him
but
he
Disapparated
voldemort's
curse
hit
Mad-Eye
full
in
the
face
he
fell
backward
off
his
broom
and
there
was
nothing
we
could
do
nothing
we
had
half
a
dozen
of
them
on
our
own
tail
bill's
voice
broke
of
course
you
couldn't
have
done
anything
said
Lupin
they
all
stood
looking
at
each
other
harry
could
not
quite
comprehend
it
mad-Eye
dead
it
could
not
be
mad-Eye
so
tough
so
brave
the
consummate
survivor
at
last
it
seemed
to
dawn
on
everyone
though
nobody
said
it
that
there
was
no
point
of
waiting
in
the
yard
anymore
and
in
silence
they
followed
mr.
And
Mrs
weasley
back
into
the
Burrow
and
into
the
living
room
where
Fred
and
George
were
laughing
together
what's
wrong
said
Fred
scanning
their
faces
as
they
entered
what's
happened
who's
mad-Eye
said
mr.
Weasley
Dead
the
twins
grins
turned
to
grimaces
of
shock
nobody
seemed
to
know
what
to
do
tonks
was
crying
silently
into
a
handkerchief
She
had
been
close
to
Mad-Eye
Harry
knew
his
favorite
and
his
protge
at
the
Ministry
of
Magic
hagrid
who
had
sat
down
on
the
floor
in
the
corner
where
he
had
most
space
was
dabbing
at
his
eyes
with
his
tablecloth-sized
handkerchief
bill
walked
over
to
the
sideboard
and
pulled
out
a
bottle
of
fire-whisky
and
some
glasses
here
he
said
and
with
a
wave
of
his
wand
eh
sent
twelve
full
glasses
soaring
through
the
room
to
each
of
them
holding
the
thirteenth
aloft
mad-Eye
mad-Eye
they
all
said
and
drank
mad-Eye
echoed
Hagrid
a
little
late
with
a
hiccup
the
firewhisky
seared
harry's
throat
it
seemed
to
burn
feeling
back
into
him
dispelling
the
numbness
and
sense
of
unreality
firing
him
with
something
that
was
like
courage
so
Mundungus
disappeared
said
Lupin
who
had
drained
his
own
glass
in
one
the
atmosphere
changed
at
once
everybody
looked
tense
watching
Lupin
both
wanting
him
to
go
on
it
seemed
to
Harry
and
slightly
afraid
of
what
they
might
hear
i
know
what
you're
thinking
said
Bill
and
I
wondered
that
too
on
the
way
back
here
because
they
seemed
to
be
expecting
us
didn't
they
but
Mundungus
can't
have
betrayed
us
they
didn't
know
there
would
be
seven
Harrys
that
confused
them
the
moment
we
appeared
and
in
case
you've
forgotten
it
was
Mundungus
who
suggested
that
little
bit
of
skullduggery
why
wouldn't
he
have
told
them
the
essential
point
i
think
Dung
panicked
it's
as
simple
as
that
he
didn't
want
to
come
in
the
first
place
but
Mad-Eye
made
him
and
You-Know-Who
went
straight
for
them
it
was
enough
to
make
anyone
panic
you-Know-Who
acted
exactly
as
Mad-Eye
expected
him
to
sniffed
Tonks
mad-Eye
said
he'd
expect
the
real
Harry
to
be
with
the
toughest
most
skilled
Aurors
he
chased
Mad-Eye
first
and
when
Mundungus
gave
them
away
he
switched
to
Kingsley
yes
and
zat
eez
all
very
good
snapped
Fleur
but
still
eet
does
not
explain
ow
zey
know
we
were
moving
Arry
tonight
does
eet
somebody
must
ave
been
careless
somebody
let
slip
ze
date
to
an
outsider
it
is
ze
only
explanation
for
zem
knowing
ze
date
but
not
ze
ole
plan
she
glared
around
at
them
all
tear
tracks
still
etched
on
her
beautiful
face
silently
daring
any
of
them
to
contradict
her
nobody
did
the
only
sound
to
break
the
silence
was
that
of
Hagrid
hiccupping
from
behind
his
handkerchief
harry
glanced
at
Hagrid
who
had
just
risked
his
own
life
to
save
harry's
Hagrid
whom
he
loved
whom
he
trusted
who
had
once
been
tricked
into
giving
Voldemort
crucial
information
in
exchange
for
a
dragon's
egg
no
Harry
said
aloud
and
they
all
looked
at
him
surprised
The
firewhisky
seemed
to
have
amplified
his
voice
i
mean
if
somebody
made
a
mistake
Harry
went
on
and
let
something
slip
I
know
they
didn't
mean
to
do
it
it's
not
their
fault
he
repeated
again
a
little
louder
than
he
would
usually
have
spoken
we've
got
to
trust
each
other
i
trust
all
of
you
I
don't
think
anyone
in
this
room
would
ever
sell
me
to
Voldemort
more
silence
followed
his
words
they
were
all
looking
at
him
Harry
felt
a
little
hot
again
and
drank
some
more
firewhisky
for
something
to
do
as
he
drank
he
thought
of
Mad-Eye
mad-Eye
had
always
been
scathing
about
dumbledore's
willingness
to
trust
people
well
said
Harry
said
Fred
unexpectedly
year
ear
ear
said
George
with
half
a
glance
at
Fred
the
corner
of
whose
mouth
twitched
lupin
was
wearing
an
odd
expression
as
he
looked
at
Harry
it
was
close
to
pitying
you
think
i'm
a
fool
demanded
Harry
no
I
think
you're
like
James
said
Lupin
who
would
have
regarded
it
as
the
height
of
dishonor
to
mistrust
his
friends
harry
knew
what
Lupin
was
getting
at
that
his
father
had
been
betrayed
by
his
friend
Peter
Pettigrew
he
felt
irrationally
angry
he
wanted
to
argue
but
Lupin
had
turned
away
from
him
set
down
his
glass
upon
a
side
table
and
addressed
Bill
there's
work
to
do
i
can
ask
Kingsley
whether
no
said
Bill
at
once
i'll
do
it
i'll
come
where
are
you
going
said
Tonks
and
Fleur
together
mad-eye's
body
said
Lupin
we
need
to
recover
it
can't
it
began
Mrs
weasley
with
an
appealing
look
at
Bill
wait
said
Bill
Not
unless
you'd
rather
the
Death
Eaters
took
it
nobody
spoke
lupin
and
Bill
said
good
bye
and
left
the
rest
of
them
now
dropped
into
chairs
all
except
for
Harry
who
remained
standing
the
suddenness
and
completeness
of
death
was
with
them
like
a
presence
i've
got
to
go
too
said
Harry
ten
pairs
of
startled
eyes
looked
at
him
don't
be
silly
Harry
said
Mrs
weasley
What
are
you
talking
about
i
can't
stay
here
he
rubbed
his
forehead
it
was
prickling
again
he
had
not
hurt
like
this
for
more
than
a
year
you're
all
in
danger
while
i'm
here
i
don't
want
but
don't
be
so
silly
said
Mrs
weasley
the
whole
point
of
tonight
was
to
get
you
here
safely
and
thank
goodness
it
worked
and
fleur's
agreed
to
get
married
here
rather
than
in
France
we've
arranged
everything
so
that
we
can
all
stay
together
and
look
after
you
she
did
not
understand
she
was
making
him
feel
worse
not
better
if
Voldemort
finds
out
i'm
here
but
why
should
he
asked
Mrs
weasley
there
are
a
dozen
places
you
might
be
now
Harry
said
mr.
Weasley
he's
got
no
way
of
knowing
which
safe
house
you're
in
it's
not
me
i'm
worried
for
said
Harry
we
know
that
said
mr.
Weasley
quietly
but
it
would
make
our
efforts
tonight
seem
rather
pointless
if
you
left
yer
not
goin
anywhere
growled
Hagrid
blimey
Harry
after
all
we
wen
through
ter
get
you
here
yeah
what
about
my
bleeding
ear
said
George
hoisting
himself
up
on
his
cushions
i
know
that
mad-Eye
wouldn't
want
i
know
harry
bellowed
he
felt
beleaguered
and
blackmailed
Did
they
think
he
did
not
know
what
they
had
done
for
him
didn't
they
understand
that
it
was
for
precisely
that
reason
that
he
wanted
to
go
now
before
they
had
to
suffer
any
more
on
his
behalf
there
was
a
long
and
awkward
silence
in
which
his
scar
continued
to
prickle
and
throb
and
which
was
broken
at
last
by
Mrs
weasley
where's
Hedwig
Harry
she
said
coaxingly
we
can
put
her
up
with
Pidwidgeon
and
give
her
something
to
eat
his
insides
clenched
like
a
fist
he
could
not
tell
her
the
truth
he
drank
the
last
of
his
firewhisky
to
avoid
answering
wait
till
it
gets
out
yeh
did
it
again
Harry
said
Hagrid
escaped
him
fought
him
off
when
he
was
right
on
top
of
yeh
it
wasn't
me
said
Harry
flatly
it
was
my
wand
my
wand
acted
of
its
own
accord
after
a
few
moments
Hermione
said
gently
But
that's
impossible
Harry
you
mean
that
you
did
magic
without
meaning
to
you
reacted
instinctively
no
said
Harry
the
bike
was
falling
I
couldn't
have
told
you
where
Voldemort
was
but
my
wand
spun
in
my
hand
and
found
him
and
shot
a
spell
at
him
and
it
wasn't
even
a
spell
I
recognized
i've
never
made
gold
flames
appear
before
often
said
mr.
Weasley
when
you're
in
a
pressured
situation
you
can
produce
magic
you
never
dreamed
of
small
children
often
find
before
they're
trained
it
wasn't
like
that
said
Harry
through
gritted
teeth
his
scar
was
burning
he
felt
angry
and
frustrated
he
hated
the
idea
that
they
were
all
imagining
him
to
have
power
to
match
voldemort's
no
one
said
anything
he
knew
that
they
did
not
believe
him
now
that
he
came
to
think
of
it
he
had
never
heard
of
a
wand
performing
magic
on
its
own
before
his
scar
seared
with
pain
it
was
all
he
could
do
not
to
moan
aloud
muttering
about
fresh
air
he
set
down
his
glass
and
left
the
room
as
he
crossed
the
yard
the
great
skeletal
thestral
looked
up
rustled
its
enormous
batlike
wings
then
resumed
its
grazing
harry
stopped
at
the
gate
into
the
garden
staring
out
at
its
overgrown
plants
rubbing
his
pounding
forehead
and
thinking
of
Dumbledore
dumbledore
would
have
believed
him
he
knew
it
dumbledore
would
have
known
how
and
why
harry's
wand
had
acted
independently
because
Dumbledore
always
had
the
answers
he
had
known
about
wands
had
explained
to
Harry
the
strange
connection
that
existed
between
his
wand
and
voldemort's
but
Dumbledore
like
Mad-Eye
like
Sirius
like
his
parents
like
his
poor
owl
all
were
gone
where
Harry
could
never
talk
to
them
again
he
felt
a
burning
in
his
throat
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
firewhisky
and
then
out
of
nowhere
the
pain
in
his
scar
peaked
as
he
clutched
his
forehead
and
closed
his
eyes
a
voice
screamed
inside
his
head
you
told
me
the
problem
would
be
solved
by
using
another's
wand
and
into
his
mind
burst
the
vision
of
an
emaciated
old
man
lying
in
rags
upon
a
stone
floor
screaming
a
horrible
drawn-out
scream
a
scream
of
unendurable
agony
no
no
i
beg
you
I
beg
you
you
lied
to
Lord
Voldemort
Ollivander
i
did
not
i
swear
I
did
not
you
sought
to
help
Potter
to
help
him
escape
me
i
swear
I
did
not
i
believed
a
different
wand
would
work
explain
then
what
happened
lucius's
wand
is
destroyed
i
cannot
understand
the
connection
exists
only
between
your
two
wands
lies
please
i
beg
you
and
Harry
saw
the
white
hand
raise
its
wand
and
felt
voldemort's
surge
of
vicious
anger
saw
the
frail
old
main
on
the
floor
writhe
in
agony
harry
it
was
over
as
quickly
as
it
had
come
Harry
stood
shaking
in
the
darkness
clutching
the
gate
into
the
garden
his
heart
racing
his
scar
still
tingling
it
was
several
moments
before
he
realized
that
Ron
and
Hermione
were
at
his
side
harry
come
back
in
the
house
Hermione
whispered
You
aren't
still
thinking
of
leaving
yeah
you've
got
to
stay
mate
said
Ron
thumping
Harry
on
the
back
are
you
all
right
hermione
asked
close
enough
now
to
look
into
harry's
face
you
look
awful
well
said
Harry
shakily
I
probably
look
better
than
Ollivander
when
he
had
finished
telling
them
what
he
had
seen
Ron
looked
appalled
but
Hermione
downright
terrified
but
it
was
supposed
to
have
stopped
your
scar
it
wasn't
supposed
to
do
this
anymore
you
mustn't
let
that
connection
open
up
again
Dumbledore
wanted
you
to
close
your
mind
when
he
did
not
reply
she
gripped
his
arm
harry
he's
taking
over
the
Ministry
and
the
newspapers
and
half
the
Wizarding
world
don't
let
him
inside
your
head
too
chapter
Six
the
Ghoul
in
Pajamas
the
shock
of
losing
Mad-Eye
hung
over
the
house
in
the
days
that
followed
Harry
kept
expecting
to
see
him
stumping
in
through
the
back
door
like
the
other
Order
members
who
passed
in
and
out
to
relay
news
harry
felt
that
nothing
but
action
would
assuage
his
feelings
of
guilt
and
grief
and
that
he
ought
to
set
out
on
his
mission
to
find
and
destroy
Horcruxes
as
soon
as
possible
well
you
cant
do
anything
about
the
Ron
mouthed
the
word
Horcruxes
till
youre
seventeen
youve
still
got
the
Trace
on
you
and
we
can
plan
here
as
well
as
anywhere
cant
we
or
he
dropped
his
voice
to
a
whisper
dyou
reckon
you
already
know
where
the
You-Know-Whats
are
no
Harry
admitted
i
think
Hermiones
been
doing
a
bit
of
research
said
Ron
she
said
she
was
saving
it
for
when
you
got
here
they
were
sitting
at
the
breakfast
table
mr.
Weasley
and
Bill
had
just
left
for
work
mrs
weasley
had
gone
upstairs
to
wake
Hermione
and
Ginny
while
Fleur
had
drifted
off
to
take
a
bath
the
Tracell
break
on
the
thirty-first
said
Harry
that
means
I
only
need
to
stay
here
four
days
then
I
can
five
days
Ron
corrected
him
firmly
weve
got
to
stay
for
the
wedding
theyll
kill
us
if
we
miss
it
harry
understood
they
to
mean
Fleur
and
Mrs
weasley
its
one
extra
day
said
Ron
when
Harry
looked
mutinous
dont
they
realize
how
important
Course
they
dont
said
Ron
they
havent
got
a
clue
and
now
you
mention
it
I
wanted
to
talk
to
you
about
that
ron
glanced
toward
the
door
into
the
hall
to
check
that
Mrs
weasley
was
not
returning
yet
then
leaned
in
closer
to
Harry
mums
been
trying
to
get
it
out
of
Hermione
and
me
what
were
off
to
do
shell
try
you
next
so
brace
yourself
dad
and
Lupinve
both
asked
as
well
but
when
we
said
Dumbledore
told
you
not
to
tell
anyone
except
us
they
dropped
it
not
Mum
though
shes
determined
rons
prediction
came
true
within
hours
shortly
before
lunch
Mrs
weasley
detached
Harry
from
the
others
by
asking
him
to
help
identify
a
lone
mans
sock
that
she
thought
might
have
come
out
of
his
rucksack
once
she
had
him
cornered
in
the
tiny
scullery
off
the
kitchen
she
started
ron
and
Hermione
seem
to
think
that
the
three
of
you
are
dropping
out
of
Hogwarts
she
began
in
a
light
casual
tone
oh
said
Harry
well
yeah
we
are
the
mangle
turned
of
its
own
accord
in
a
corner
wringing
out
what
looked
like
one
of
mr.
Weasleys
vests
may
I
ask
why
you
are
abandoning
your
education
said
Mrs
weasley
well
Dumbledore
left
me
stuff
to
do
mumbled
Harry
ron
and
Hermione
know
about
it
and
they
want
to
come
too
what
sort
of
stuff
im
sorry
I
cant
well
frankly
I
think
Arthur
and
I
have
a
right
to
know
and
Im
sure
mr.
And
Mrs
granger
would
agree
said
Mrs
weasley
harry
had
been
afraid
of
the
concerned
parent
attack
he
forced
himself
to
look
directly
into
her
eyes
noticing
as
he
did
so
that
they
were
precisely
the
same
shade
of
brown
as
Ginnys
this
did
not
help
dumbledore
didnt
want
anyone
else
to
know
Mrs
weasley
im
sorry
ron
and
Hermione
dont
have
to
come
its
their
choice
i
dont
see
that
you
have
to
go
either
she
snapped
dropping
all
pretense
now
youre
barely
of
age
any
of
you
its
utter
nonsense
if
Dumbledore
needed
work
doing
he
had
the
whole
Order
at
his
command
harry
you
must
have
misunderstood
him
probably
he
was
telling
you
something
he
wanted
done
and
you
took
it
to
mean
that
he
wanted
you
i
didnt
misunderstand
said
Harry
flatly
its
got
to
be
me
he
handed
her
back
the
single
sock
he
was
supposed
to
be
identifying
which
was
patterned
with
golden
bulrushes
and
thats
not
mine
i
dont
support
Puddlemere
United
oh
of
course
not
said
Mrs
weasley
with
a
sudden
and
rather
unnerving
return
to
her
casual
tone
i
should
have
realized
well
Harry
while
weve
still
got
you
here
you
wont
mind
helping
with
the
preparations
for
Bill
and
Fleurs
wedding
will
you
theres
still
so
much
to
do
no
I
of
course
not
said
Harry
disconcerted
by
this
sudden
change
of
subject
sweet
of
you
she
replied
and
she
smiled
as
she
left
the
scullery
from
that
moment
on
Mrs
weasley
kept
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
so
busy
with
preparations
for
the
wedding
that
they
hardly
had
any
time
to
think
the
kindest
explanation
of
this
behavior
would
have
been
that
Mrs
weasley
wanted
to
distract
them
all
from
thoughts
of
Mad-Eye
and
the
terrors
of
their
recent
journey
after
two
days
of
nonstop
cutlery
cleaning
of
color-matching
favors
ribbons
and
flowers
of
de-gnoming
the
garden
and
helping
Mrs
weasley
cook
vast
batches
of
canaps
however
Harry
started
to
suspect
her
of
a
different
motive
all
the
jobs
she
handed
out
seemed
to
keep
him
Ron
and
Hermione
away
from
one
another
he
had
not
had
a
chance
to
speak
to
the
two
of
them
alone
since
the
first
night
when
he
had
told
them
about
Voldemort
torturing
Ollivander
i
think
Mum
thinks
that
if
she
can
stop
the
three
of
you
getting
together
and
planning
shell
be
able
to
delay
you
leaving
Ginny
told
Harry
in
an
undertone
as
they
laid
the
table
for
dinner
on
the
third
night
of
his
stay
and
then
what
does
she
thinks
going
to
happen
harry
muttered
someone
else
might
kill
off
Voldemort
while
shes
holding
us
here
making
vol-au-vents
he
had
spoken
without
thinking
and
saw
Ginnys
face
whiten
so
its
true
she
said
thats
what
youre
trying
to
do
i
not
I
was
joking
said
Harry
evasively
they
stared
at
each
other
and
there
was
something
more
than
shock
in
Ginnys
expression
suddenly
Harry
became
aware
that
this
was
the
first
time
that
he
had
been
alone
with
her
since
those
stolen
hours
in
secluded
corners
of
the
Hogwarts
grounds
he
was
sure
she
was
remembering
them
too
both
of
them
jumped
as
the
door
opened
and
mr.
Weasley
Kingsley
and
Bill
walked
in
they
were
often
joined
by
other
Order
members
for
dinner
now
because
the
Burrow
had
replaced
number
twelve
Grimmauld
Place
as
the
headquarters
mr.
Weasley
had
explained
that
after
the
death
of
Dumbledore
their
Secret-Keeper
each
of
the
people
to
whom
Dumbledore
had
confided
Grimmauld
Places
location
had
become
a
Secret-Keeper
in
turn
and
as
there
are
around
twenty
of
us
that
greatly
dilutes
the
power
of
the
Fidelius
Charm
twenty
times
as
many
opportunities
for
the
Death
Eaters
to
get
the
secret
out
of
somebody
we
cant
expect
it
to
hold
much
longer
but
surely
Snape
will
have
told
the
Death
Eaters
the
address
by
now
asked
Harry
well
Mad-Eye
set
up
a
couple
of
curses
against
Snape
in
case
he
turns
up
there
again
we
hope
theyll
be
strong
enough
both
to
keep
him
out
and
to
bind
his
tongue
if
he
tries
to
talk
about
the
place
but
we
cant
be
sure
it
would
have
been
insane
to
keep
using
the
place
as
headquarters
now
that
its
protection
has
become
so
shaky
the
kitchen
was
so
crowded
that
evening
it
was
difficult
to
maneuver
knives
and
forks
harry
found
himself
crammed
beside
Ginny
the
unsaid
things
that
had
just
passed
between
them
made
him
wish
they
had
been
separated
by
a
few
more
people
he
was
trying
so
hard
to
avoid
brushing
her
arm
he
could
barely
cut
his
chicken
no
news
about
Mad-Eye
harry
asked
Bill
nothing
replied
Bill
they
had
not
been
able
to
hold
a
funeral
for
Moody
because
Bill
and
Lupin
had
failed
to
recover
his
body
it
had
been
difficult
to
know
where
he
might
have
fallen
given
the
darkness
and
the
confusion
of
the
battle
the
Daily
Prophet
hasnt
said
a
word
about
him
dying
or
about
finding
the
body
Bill
went
on
but
that
doesnt
mean
much
its
keeping
a
lot
quiet
these
days
and
they
still
havent
called
a
hearing
about
all
the
underage
magic
I
used
escaping
the
Death
Eaters
harry
called
across
the
table
to
mr.
Weasley
who
shook
his
head
because
they
know
I
had
no
choice
or
because
they
dont
want
me
to
tell
the
world
Voldemort
attacked
me
the
latter
I
think
scrimgeour
doesnt
want
to
admit
that
You-Know-Who
is
as
powerful
as
he
is
nor
that
Azkabans
seen
a
mass
breakout
yeah
why
tell
the
public
the
truth
said
Harry
clenching
his
knife
so
tightly
that
the
faint
scars
on
the
back
of
his
right
hand
stood
out
white
against
his
skin
I
must
not
tell
lies
isnt
anyone
at
the
Ministry
prepared
to
stand
up
to
him
asked
Ron
angrily
of
course
Ron
but
people
are
terrified
mr.
Weasley
replied
terrified
that
they
will
be
next
to
disappear
their
children
the
next
to
be
attacked
there
are
nasty
rumors
going
around
I
for
one
dont
believe
the
Muggle
Studies
professor
at
Hogwarts
resigned
she
hasnt
been
seen
for
weeks
now
meanwhile
Scrimgeour
remains
shut
up
in
his
office
all
day
I
just
hope
hes
working
on
a
plan
there
was
a
pause
in
which
Mrs
weasley
magicked
the
empty
plates
onto
the
work
surface
and
served
apple
tart
we
must
decide
ow
you
will
be
disguised
Arry
said
Fleur
once
everyone
had
pudding
for
ze
wedding
she
added
when
he
looked
confused
of
course
none
of
our
guests
are
Death
Eaters
but
we
cannot
guarantee
zat
zey
will
not
let
something
slip
after
zey
ave
ad
champagne
from
this
Harry
gathered
that
she
still
suspected
Hagrid
yes
good
point
said
Mrs
weasley
from
the
top
of
the
table
where
she
sat
spectacles
perched
on
the
end
of
her
nose
scanning
an
immense
list
of
jobs
that
she
had
scribbled
on
a
very
long
piece
of
parchment
now
Ron
have
you
cleaned
out
your
room
yet
why
exclaimed
Ron
slamming
his
spoon
down
and
glaring
at
his
mother
why
does
my
room
have
to
be
cleaned
out
harry
and
I
are
fine
with
it
the
way
it
is
we
are
holding
your
brothers
wedding
here
in
a
few
days
time
young
man
and
are
they
getting
married
in
my
bedroom
asked
Ron
furiously
no
so
why
in
the
name
of
Merlins
saggy
left
dont
talk
to
your
mother
like
that
said
mr.
Weasley
firmly
and
do
as
youre
told
ron
scowled
at
both
his
parents
then
picked
up
his
spoon
and
attacked
the
last
few
mouthfuls
of
his
apple
tart
i
can
help
some
of
its
my
mess
harry
told
Ron
but
Mrs
weasley
cut
across
him
no
Harry
dear
Id
much
rather
you
helped
Arthur
much
out
the
chickens
and
Hermione
Id
be
ever
so
grateful
if
youd
change
the
sheets
for
Monsieur
and
Madame
Delacour
you
know
theyre
arriving
at
eleven
tomorrow
morning
but
as
it
turned
out
there
was
very
little
to
do
for
the
chickens
theres
no
need
to
er
mention
it
to
Molly
mr.
Weasley
told
Harry
blocking
his
access
to
the
coop
but
er
Ted
Tonks
sent
me
most
of
what
was
left
of
Siriuss
bike
and
er
Im
hiding
thats
to
say
keeping
it
in
here
fantastic
stuff
Theres
an
exhaust
gaskin
as
I
believe
its
called
the
most
magnificent
battery
and
itll
be
a
great
opportunity
to
find
out
how
brakes
work
im
going
to
try
and
put
it
all
back
together
again
when
Mollys
not
I
mean
when
Ive
got
time
when
they
returned
to
the
house
Mrs
weasley
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
so
Harry
slipped
upstairs
to
Rons
attic
bedroom
im
doing
it
Im
doing
oh
its
you
said
Ron
in
relief
as
Harry
entered
the
room
ron
lay
back
down
on
the
bed
which
he
had
evidently
just
vacated
the
room
was
just
as
messy
as
it
had
been
all
week
the
only
chance
was
that
Hermione
was
now
sitting
in
the
far
corner
her
fluffy
ginger
cat
Crookshanks
at
her
feet
sorting
books
some
of
which
Harry
recognized
as
his
own
into
two
enormous
piles
hi
Harry
she
said
as
he
sat
down
on
his
camp
bed
and
how
did
you
manage
to
get
away
oh
Rons
mum
forgot
that
she
asked
Ginny
and
me
to
change
the
sheets
yesterday
said
Hermione
she
threw
Numerology
and
Grammatica
onto
one
pile
and
The
Rise
and
Fall
of
the
Dark
Arts
onto
the
other
we
were
just
talking
about
Mad-Eye
Ron
told
Harry
i
reckon
he
might
have
survived
but
Bill
saw
him
hit
by
the
Killing
Curse
said
Harry
yeah
but
Bill
was
under
attack
too
said
Ron
how
can
he
be
sure
what
he
saw
even
if
the
Killing
Curse
missed
Mad-Eye
still
fell
about
a
thousand
feet
said
Hermione
now
weight
Quidditch
Teams
of
Britain
and
Ireland
in
her
hand
he
could
have
used
a
Shield
Charm
fleur
said
his
wand
was
blasted
out
of
his
hand
said
Harry
well
all
right
if
you
want
him
to
be
dead
said
Ron
grumpily
punching
his
pillow
into
a
more
comfortable
shape
of
course
we
dont
want
him
to
be
dead
said
Hermione
looking
shocked
its
dreadful
that
hes
dead
but
were
being
realistic
for
the
first
time
Harry
imagined
Mad-Eyes
body
broken
as
Dumbledores
had
been
yet
with
that
one
eye
still
whizzing
in
its
socket
he
felt
a
stab
of
revulsion
mixed
with
a
bizarre
desire
to
laugh
the
Death
Eaters
probably
tidied
up
after
themselves
thats
why
no
ones
found
him
said
Ron
wisely
yeah
said
Harry
like
Barty
Crouch
turned
into
a
bone
and
buried
in
Hagrids
front
garden
they
probably
transfigured
Moody
and
stuffed
him
dont
squealed
Hermione
startled
Harry
looked
over
just
in
time
to
see
her
burst
into
tears
over
her
copy
of
Spellmans
Syllabary
oh
no
said
Harry
struggling
to
get
up
from
the
old
camp
bed
hermione
I
wasnt
trying
to
upset
but
with
a
great
creaking
of
rusty
bedsprings
Ron
bounded
off
the
bed
and
got
there
first
one
arm
around
Hermione
he
fished
in
his
jeans
pocket
and
withdrew
a
revolting-looking
handkerchief
that
he
had
used
to
clean
out
the
oven
earlier
hastily
pulling
out
his
wand
he
pointed
it
at
the
rag
and
said
Tergeo
the
wand
siphoned
off
most
of
the
grease
looking
rather
pleased
with
himself
Ron
handed
the
slightly
smoking
handkerchief
to
Hermione
oh
thanks
Ron
im
sorry
she
blew
her
nose
and
hiccupped
its
just
so
awf-ful
isnt
it
r-right
after
Dumbledore
i
j-just
n-never
imagined
Mad-Eye
dying
somehow
he
seemed
so
tough
yeah
I
know
said
Ron
giving
her
a
squeeze
but
you
know
what
hed
say
to
us
if
he
was
here
c-constant
vigilance
said
Hermione
mopping
her
eyes
thats
right
said
Ron
nodding
hed
tell
us
to
learn
from
what
happened
to
him
and
what
Ive
learned
is
not
to
trust
that
cowardly
little
squit
Mundungus
hermione
gave
a
shaky
laugh
and
leaned
forward
to
pick
up
two
more
books
a
second
later
Ron
had
snatched
his
arm
back
from
around
her
shoulders
she
had
dropped
The
Monster
of
Monsters
on
his
foot
the
book
had
broken
free
from
its
restraining
belt
and
snapped
viciously
at
Rons
ankle
im
sorry
Im
sorry
hermione
cried
as
Harry
wrenched
the
book
from
Rons
leg
and
retied
it
shit
what
are
you
doing
with
all
those
books
anyway
ron
asked
limping
back
to
his
bed
just
trying
to
decide
which
ones
to
take
with
us
said
Hermione
When
were
looking
for
the
Horcruxes
oh
of
course
said
Ron
clapping
a
hand
to
his
forehead
i
forgot
well
be
hunting
down
Voldemort
in
a
mobile
library
ha
ha
said
Hermione
looking
down
at
Spellmans
Syllabary
i
wonder
will
we
need
to
translate
runes
its
possible
i
think
wed
better
take
it
to
be
safe
she
dropped
the
syllabary
onto
the
larger
of
the
two
piles
and
picked
up
Hogwarts
A
History
listen
said
Harry
he
had
sat
up
straight
ron
and
Hermione
looked
at
him
with
similar
mixtures
of
resignation
and
defiance
i
know
you
said
after
Dumbledores
funeral
that
you
wanted
to
come
with
me
Harry
began
here
he
goes
Ron
said
to
Hermione
rolling
his
eyes
as
we
knew
he
would
he
sighed
turning
back
to
the
books
you
know
I
think
I
will
take
Hogwarts
A
History
even
if
were
not
going
back
there
I
dont
think
Id
feel
right
if
I
didnt
have
it
with
listen
said
Harry
again
no
Harry
you
listen
said
Hermione
were
coming
with
you
that
was
decided
months
ago
years
really
but
shut
up
Ron
advised
him
are
you
sure
youve
thought
this
through
harry
persisted
lets
see
said
Hermione
slamming
Travels
with
Trolls
onto
the
discarded
pile
with
a
rather
fierce
look
ive
been
packing
for
days
so
were
ready
to
leave
at
a
moments
notice
which
for
your
information
has
included
doing
some
pretty
difficult
magic
not
to
mention
smuggling
Mad-Eyes
whole
stock
of
Polyjuice
Potion
right
under
Rons
mums
nose
ive
also
modified
my
parents
memories
so
that
theyre
convinced
theyre
really
called
Wendell
and
Monica
Wilkins
and
that
their
lifes
ambition
is
to
move
to
Australia
which
they
have
now
done
thats
to
make
it
more
difficult
for
Voldemort
to
track
them
down
and
interrogate
them
about
me
or
you
because
unfortunately
Ive
told
them
quite
a
bit
about
you
assuming
I
survive
our
hunt
for
the
Horcruxes
Ill
find
Mum
and
Dad
and
lift
the
enchantment
if
I
dont
well
I
think
Ive
cast
a
good
enough
charm
to
keep
them
safe
and
happy
wendell
and
Monica
Wilkins
dont
know
that
theyve
got
a
daughter
you
see
hermiones
eyes
were
swimming
with
tears
again
ron
got
back
off
the
bed
put
his
arm
around
her
once
more
and
frowned
at
Harry
as
though
reproaching
him
for
lack
of
tact
harry
could
not
think
of
anything
to
say
not
least
because
it
was
highly
unusual
for
Ron
to
be
teaching
anyone
else
tact
i
Hermione
Im
sorry
I
didnt
didnt
realize
that
Ron
and
I
know
perfectly
well
what
might
happen
if
we
come
with
you
well
we
do
ron
show
Harry
what
youve
done
nah
hes
just
eaten
said
Ron
go
on
he
needs
to
know
oh
all
right
harry
come
here
for
the
second
time
Ron
withdrew
his
arm
from
around
Hermione
and
stumped
over
to
the
door
cmon
why
harry
asked
following
Ron
out
of
the
room
onto
the
tiny
landing
descendo
muttered
Ron
pointing
his
wand
at
the
low
ceiling
a
hatch
opened
right
over
their
heads
and
a
ladder
slid
down
to
their
feet
a
horrible
half-sucking
half-moaning
sound
came
out
of
the
square
hole
along
with
an
unpleasant
smell
like
open
drains
thats
your
ghoul
isnt
it
asked
Harry
who
had
never
actually
met
the
creature
that
sometimes
disrupted
the
nightly
silence
yeah
it
is
said
Ron
climbing
the
ladder
come
and
have
a
look
at
him
harry
followed
Ron
up
the
few
short
steps
into
the
tiny
attic
space
his
head
and
shoulders
were
in
the
room
before
he
caught
sight
of
the
creature
curled
up
a
few
feet
from
him
fast
asleep
in
the
gloom
with
its
large
mouth
wide
open
but
it
it
looks
do
ghouls
normally
wear
pajamas
no
said
Ron
nor
have
they
usually
got
red
hair
or
that
number
of
pustules
harry
contemplated
the
thing
slightly
revolted
it
was
human
in
shape
and
size
and
was
wearing
what
now
that
Harrys
eyes
became
used
to
the
darkness
was
clearly
an
old
pair
of
Rons
pajamas
he
was
also
sure
that
ghouls
were
generally
rather
slimy
and
bald
rather
than
distinctly
hairy
and
covered
in
angry
purple
blisters
hes
me
see
said
Ron
no
said
Harry
i
dont
ill
explain
it
back
in
my
room
the
smells
getting
to
me
said
Ron
they
climbed
back
down
the
ladder
which
Ron
returned
to
the
ceiling
and
rejoined
Hermione
who
was
still
sorting
books
once
weve
left
the
ghouls
going
to
come
and
live
down
here
in
my
room
said
Ron
i
think
hes
really
looking
forward
to
it
well
its
hard
to
tell
because
all
he
can
do
is
moan
and
drool
but
he
nods
a
lot
when
you
mention
it
anyway
hes
going
to
be
me
with
spattergroit
good
eh
harry
merely
looked
his
confusion
it
is
said
Ron
clearly
frustrated
that
Harry
had
not
grasped
the
brilliance
of
the
plan
look
when
we
three
dont
turn
up
at
Hogwarts
again
everyones
going
to
think
Hermione
and
I
must
be
with
you
right
which
means
the
Death
Eaters
will
go
straight
for
our
families
to
see
if
theyve
got
information
on
where
you
are
but
hopefully
itll
look
like
Ive
gone
away
with
Mum
and
Dad
a
lot
of
muggle-borns
are
talking
about
going
into
hiding
at
the
moment
said
Hermione
we
cant
hide
my
whole
family
itll
look
too
fishy
and
they
cant
all
leave
their
jobs
said
Ron
so
were
going
to
put
out
the
story
that
Im
seriously
ill
with
spattergroit
which
is
why
I
cant
go
back
to
school
if
anyone
comes
calling
to
investigate
Mum
or
Dad
can
show
them
the
ghoul
in
my
bed
covered
in
pustules
spattergroits
really
contagious
so
theyre
not
going
to
want
to
go
near
him
it
wont
matter
that
he
cant
say
anything
either
because
apparently
you
cant
once
the
fungus
has
spread
to
your
uvula
and
your
mum
and
dad
are
in
on
this
plan
asked
Harry
dad
is
he
helped
Fred
and
George
transform
the
ghoul
mum
well
youve
seen
what
shes
like
she
wont
accept
were
going
till
were
gone
there
was
silence
in
the
room
broken
only
by
gentle
thuds
as
Hermione
continued
to
throw
books
onto
one
pile
or
the
other
ron
sat
watching
her
and
Harry
looked
from
one
to
the
other
unable
to
say
anything
the
measure
they
had
taken
to
protect
their
families
made
him
realize
more
than
anything
else
could
have
done
that
they
really
were
going
to
come
with
him
and
that
they
knew
exactly
how
dangerous
that
would
be
he
wanted
to
tell
them
what
that
meant
to
him
but
he
simply
could
not
find
words
important
enough
through
the
silence
came
the
muffled
sounds
of
Mrs
weasley
shouting
from
four
floors
below
ginnys
probably
left
a
speck
of
dust
on
a
poxy
napkin
ring
said
Ron
i
dunno
why
the
Delacours
have
got
to
come
two
days
before
the
wedding
fleurs
sisters
a
bridesmaid
she
needs
to
be
here
for
the
rehearsal
and
shes
too
young
to
come
on
her
own
said
Hermione
as
she
pored
indecisively
over
Break
with
a
Banshee
well
guests
arent
going
to
help
Mums
stress
levels
said
Ron
what
we
really
need
to
decide
said
Hermione
tossing
Defensive
Magical
Theory
into
the
bin
without
a
second
glance
and
picking
up
An
Appraisal
of
Magical
Education
in
Europe
is
where
were
going
after
we
leave
here
i
know
you
said
you
wanted
to
go
to
Godrics
Hollow
first
Harry
and
I
understand
why
but
well
shouldnt
we
make
the
Horcruxes
our
priority
if
we
knew
where
any
of
the
Horcruxes
were
Id
agree
with
you
said
Harry
who
did
not
believe
that
Hermione
really
understood
his
desire
to
return
to
Godrics
Hollow
his
parents
graves
were
only
part
of
the
attraction
He
had
a
strong
though
inexplicable
feeling
that
the
place
held
answers
for
him
perhaps
it
was
simply
because
it
was
there
that
he
had
survived
Voldemorts
Killing
Curse
now
that
he
was
facing
the
challenge
of
repeating
the
feat
Harry
was
drawn
to
the
place
where
it
had
happened
wanting
to
understand
dont
you
think
theres
a
possibility
that
Voldemorts
keeping
a
watch
on
Godrics
Hollow
hermione
asked
he
might
expect
you
to
go
back
and
visit
your
parents
graves
once
youre
free
to
go
wherever
you
like
this
had
not
occurred
to
Harry
while
he
struggled
to
find
a
counterargument
Ron
spoke
up
evidently
following
his
own
train
of
thought
this
R
a.b.
person
he
said
you
know
the
one
who
stole
the
real
locket
hermione
nodded
he
said
in
his
note
he
was
going
to
destroy
it
didnt
he
harry
dragged
his
rucksack
toward
him
and
pulled
out
the
fake
Horcrux
in
which
R
a.b.s
note
was
still
folded
I
have
stolen
the
real
Horcrux
and
intend
to
destroy
it
as
soon
as
I
can
Harry
read
out
well
what
if
he
did
finish
it
off
said
Ron
or
she
interposed
Hermione
whichever
said
Ron
itd
be
one
less
for
us
to
do
yes
but
were
still
going
to
have
to
try
and
trace
the
real
locket
arent
we
said
Hermione
to
find
out
whether
or
not
its
destroyed
and
once
we
get
hold
of
it
how
do
you
destroy
a
Horcrux
asked
Ron
well
said
Hermione
Ive
been
researching
that
how
asked
Harry
i
didnt
think
there
were
any
books
on
Horcruxes
in
the
library
there
werent
said
Hermione
who
had
turned
pink
dumbledore
removed
them
all
but
he
he
didnt
destroy
them
ron
sat
up
straight
wide-eyed
how
in
the
name
of
Merlins
pants
have
you
managed
to
get
your
hands
on
those
Horcrux
books
it
it
wasnt
stealing
said
Hermione
looking
from
Harry
to
Ron
with
a
kind
of
desperation
they
were
still
library
books
even
if
Dumbledore
had
taken
them
off
the
shelves
anyway
if
he
really
didnt
want
anyone
to
get
at
them
Im
sure
he
would
have
made
it
much
harder
to
get
to
the
point
said
Ron
well
it
was
easy
said
Hermione
in
a
small
voice
i
just
did
a
Summoning
Charm
you
know
Accio
and
they
zoomed
out
of
Dumbledores
study
window
right
into
the
girls
dormitory
but
when
did
you
do
this
harry
asked
regarding
Hermione
with
a
mixture
of
admiration
and
incredulity
just
after
his
Dumbledores
funeral
said
Hermione
in
an
even
smaller
voice
right
after
we
agreed
wed
leave
school
and
go
and
look
for
the
Horcruxes
when
I
went
back
upstairs
to
get
my
things
it
it
just
occurred
to
me
that
the
more
we
knew
about
them
the
better
it
would
be
and
I
was
alone
in
there
so
I
tried
and
it
worked
they
flew
straight
in
through
the
open
window
and
I
I
packed
them
she
swallowed
and
then
said
imploringly
I
cant
believe
Dumbledore
would
have
been
angry
its
not
as
though
were
going
to
use
the
information
to
make
a
Horcrux
is
it
can
you
hear
us
complaining
said
Ron
where
are
these
books
anyway
hermione
rummaged
for
a
moment
and
then
extracted
from
the
pile
a
large
volume
bound
in
faded
black
leather
she
looked
a
little
nauseated
and
held
it
as
gingerly
as
if
it
were
something
recently
dead
this
is
the
one
that
gives
explicit
instructions
on
how
to
make
a
Horcrux
secrets
of
the
Darkest
Art
its
a
horrible
book
really
awful
full
of
evil
magic
i
wonder
when
Dumbledore
removed
it
from
the
library
if
he
didnt
do
it
until
he
was
headmaster
I
bet
Voldemort
got
all
the
instruction
he
needed
from
here
why
did
he
have
to
ask
Slughorn
how
to
make
a
Horcrux
then
if
hed
already
read
that
asked
Ron
he
only
approached
Slughorn
to
find
out
what
would
happen
if
you
split
your
soul
into
seven
said
Harry
dumbledore
was
sure
Riddle
already
knew
how
to
make
a
Horcrux
by
the
time
he
asked
Slughorn
about
them
i
think
youre
right
Hermione
that
could
easily
have
been
where
he
got
the
information
and
the
more
Ive
read
about
them
said
Hermione
the
more
horrible
they
seem
and
the
less
I
can
believe
that
he
actually
made
six
it
warns
in
this
book
how
unstable
you
make
the
rest
of
your
soul
by
ripping
it
and
thats
just
by
making
one
Horcrux
harry
remembered
what
Dumbledore
had
said
about
Voldemort
moving
beyond
usual
evil
isnt
there
any
way
of
putting
yourself
back
together
ron
asked
yes
said
Hermione
with
a
hollow
smile
but
it
would
be
excruciatingly
painful
why
how
do
you
do
it
asked
Harry
remorse
said
Hermione
youve
got
to
really
feel
what
youve
done
theres
a
footnote
apparently
the
pain
of
it
can
destroy
you
i
cant
see
Voldemort
attempting
it
somehow
can
you
no
said
Ron
before
Harry
could
answer
so
does
it
say
how
to
destroy
Horcruxes
in
that
book
yes
said
Hermione
now
turning
the
fragile
pages
as
if
examining
rotting
entrails
because
it
warns
Dark
wizards
how
strong
they
have
to
make
the
enchantments
on
them
from
all
that
Ive
read
what
Harry
did
to
Riddles
diary
was
one
of
the
few
really
foolproof
ways
of
destroying
a
Horcrux
what
stabbing
it
with
a
basilisk
fang
asked
Harry
oh
well
lucky
weve
got
such
a
large
supply
of
basilisk
fangs
then
said
Ron
i
was
wondering
what
we
were
going
to
do
with
them
it
doesnt
have
to
be
a
basilisk
fang
said
Hermione
patiently
it
has
to
be
something
so
destructive
that
the
Horcrux
cant
repair
itself
basilisk
venom
only
has
one
antidote
and
its
incredibly
rare
phoenix
tears
said
Harry
nodding
exactly
said
Hermione
our
problem
is
that
there
are
very
few
substances
as
destructive
as
basilisk
venom
and
theyre
all
dangerous
to
carry
around
with
you
thats
a
problem
were
going
to
have
to
solve
though
because
ripping
smashing
or
crushing
a
Horcrux
wont
do
the
trick
youve
got
to
put
it
beyond
magical
repair
but
even
if
we
wreck
the
thing
it
lives
in
said
Ron
why
cant
the
bit
of
soul
in
it
just
go
and
live
in
something
else
because
a
Horcrux
is
the
complete
opposite
of
a
human
being
seeing
that
Harry
and
Ron
looked
thoroughly
confused
Hermione
hurried
on
look
if
I
picked
up
a
sword
right
now
Ron
and
ran
you
through
with
it
I
wouldnt
damage
your
soul
at
all
which
would
be
a
real
comfort
to
me
Im
sure
said
Ron
harry
laughed
it
should
be
actually
but
my
point
is
that
whatever
happens
to
your
body
your
soul
will
survive
untouched
said
Hermione
but
its
the
other
way
round
with
a
horcrux
the
fragment
of
soul
inside
it
depends
on
its
container
its
enchanted
body
for
survival
it
cant
exist
without
it
that
diary
sort
of
died
when
I
stabbed
it
said
Harry
remembering
ink
pouring
like
blood
from
the
punctured
pages
and
the
screams
of
the
piece
of
Voldemorts
soul
as
it
vanished
and
once
the
diary
was
properly
destroyed
the
bit
of
soul
trapped
in
it
could
no
longer
exist
ginny
tried
to
get
rid
of
the
diary
before
you
did
flushing
it
away
but
obviously
it
came
back
good
as
new
hang
on
said
Ron
frowning
the
bit
of
soul
in
that
diary
was
possessing
Ginny
wasnt
it
how
does
that
work
then
while
the
magical
container
is
still
intact
the
bit
of
soul
inside
it
can
flit
in
and
out
of
someone
if
they
get
too
close
to
the
object
i
dont
mean
holding
it
for
too
long
its
nothing
to
do
with
touching
it
she
added
before
Ron
could
speak
i
mean
close
emotionally
ginny
poured
her
heart
out
into
that
diary
she
made
herself
incredibly
vulnerable
youre
in
trouble
if
you
get
too
fond
of
or
dependent
on
the
Horcrux
i
wonder
how
Dumbledore
destroyed
the
ring
said
Harry
why
didnt
I
ask
him
i
never
really
his
voice
trailed
away
He
was
thinking
of
all
the
things
he
should
have
asked
Dumbledore
and
of
how
since
the
headmaster
had
died
it
seemed
to
Harry
that
he
had
wasted
so
many
opportunities
when
Dumbledore
had
been
alive
to
find
out
more
to
find
out
everything
the
silence
was
shattered
as
the
bedroom
door
flew
open
with
a
wall-shaking
crash
hermione
shrieked
and
dropped
Secrets
of
the
Darkest
Art
Crookshanks
streaked
under
the
bed
hissing
indignantly
Ron
jumped
off
the
bed
skidded
on
a
discarded
Chocolate
Frog
wrapper
and
smacked
his
head
on
the
opposite
wall
and
Harry
instinctively
dived
for
his
wand
before
realizing
that
he
was
looking
up
at
Mrs
weasley
whose
hair
was
disheveled
and
whose
face
was
contorted
with
rage
im
so
sorry
to
break
up
this
cozy
little
gathering
she
said
her
voice
trembling
im
sure
you
all
need
your
rest
but
there
are
wedding
presents
stacked
in
my
room
that
need
sorting
out
and
I
was
under
the
impression
that
you
had
agreed
to
help
oh
yes
said
Hermione
looking
terrified
as
she
leapt
to
her
feet
sending
books
flying
in
every
direction
we
will
were
sorry
with
an
anguished
look
at
Harry
and
Ron
Hermione
hurried
out
of
the
room
after
Mrs
weasley
its
like
being
a
house-elf
complained
Ron
in
an
undertone
still
massaging
his
head
as
he
and
Harry
followed
except
without
the
job
satisfaction
the
sooner
this
weddings
over
the
happier
Ill
be
yeah
said
Harry
then
well
have
nothing
to
do
except
find
Horcruxes
itll
be
like
a
holiday
wont
it
ron
started
to
laugh
but
at
the
sight
of
the
enormous
pile
of
wedding
presents
waiting
for
them
in
Mrs
weasleys
room
stopped
quite
abruptly
the
Delacours
arrived
the
following
morning
at
eleven
o
clock
harry
Ron
Hermione
and
Ginny
were
feeling
quite
resentful
toward
Fleurs
family
by
this
time
and
it
was
with
ill
grace
that
Ron
stumped
back
upstairs
to
put
on
matching
socks
and
Harry
attempted
to
flatten
his
hair
once
they
had
all
been
deemed
smart
enough
they
trooped
out
into
the
sunny
backyard
to
await
the
visitors
harry
had
never
seen
the
place
looking
so
tidy
the
rusty
cauldrons
and
old
Wellington
boots
that
usually
littered
the
steps
by
the
back
door
were
gone
replaced
by
two
new
Flutterby
bushes
standing
either
side
of
the
door
in
large
pots
though
there
was
no
breeze
the
leaves
waved
lazily
giving
an
attractive
rippling
effect
the
chickens
had
been
shut
away
the
yard
had
been
swept
and
the
nearby
garden
had
been
pruned
plucked
and
generally
spruced
up
although
Harry
who
liked
it
in
its
overgrown
state
thought
that
it
looked
rather
forlorn
without
its
usual
contingent
of
capering
gnomes
he
had
lost
track
of
how
many
security
enchantments
had
been
placed
upon
the
Burrow
by
both
the
Order
and
the
Ministry
all
he
knew
was
that
it
was
no
longer
possible
for
anybody
to
travel
by
magic
directly
into
the
place
mr.
Weasley
had
therefore
gone
to
meet
the
Delacours
on
top
of
a
nearby
hill
where
they
were
to
arrive
by
Portkey
the
first
sound
of
their
approach
was
an
unusually
high-pitched
laugh
which
turned
out
to
be
coming
from
mr.
Weasley
who
appeared
at
the
gate
moments
later
laden
with
luggage
and
leading
a
beautiful
blonde
woman
in
long
leaf
green
robes
who
could
be
Fleurs
mother
maman
cried
Fleur
rushing
forward
to
embrace
her
papa
monsieur
Delacour
was
nowhere
near
as
attractive
as
his
wife
he
was
a
head
shorter
and
extremely
plumb
with
a
little
pointed
black
beard
however
he
looked
good-natured
bouncing
towards
Mrs
weasley
on
high-heeled
boots
he
kissed
her
twice
on
each
cheek
leaving
her
flustered
you
ave
been
so
much
trouble
he
said
in
a
deep
voice
fleur
tells
us
you
ave
been
working
very
ard
oh
its
been
nothing
nothing
trilled
Mrs
weasley
no
trouble
at
all
ron
relieved
his
feelings
by
aiming
a
kick
at
a
gnome
who
was
peering
out
from
behind
one
of
the
new
Flutterby
bushes
dear
lady
said
Monsieur
Delacour
still
holding
Mrs
weasleys
hand
between
his
own
two
plump
ones
and
beaming
we
are
most
honored
at
the
approaching
union
of
our
two
families
let
me
present
my
wife
Apolline
madame
Delacour
glided
forward
and
stooped
to
kiss
Mrs
weasley
too
enchante
she
said
your
usband
as
been
telling
us
such
amusing
stories
mr.
Weasley
gave
a
maniacal
laugh
Mrs
weasley
threw
him
a
look
upon
which
he
became
immediately
silent
and
assumed
an
expression
appropriate
to
the
sickbed
of
a
close
friend
and
of
course
you
ave
met
my
leetle
daughter
Gabrielle
said
Monsieur
Delacour
gabrielle
was
Fleur
in
miniature
eleven
years
old
with
waist-length
hair
of
pure
silvery
blonde
she
gave
Mrs
weasley
a
dazzling
smile
and
hugged
her
then
threw
Harry
a
glowing
look
batting
her
eyelashes
ginny
cleared
her
throat
loudly
well
come
in
do
said
Mrs
weasley
brightly
and
she
ushered
the
Delacours
into
the
house
with
many
No
please
s
and
After
you
s
and
Not
at
all
the
Delacours
it
soon
transpired
were
helpful
pleasant
guests
they
were
pleased
with
everything
and
keen
to
assist
with
the
preparations
for
the
wedding
monsieur
Delacour
pronounced
everything
from
the
seating
plan
to
the
bridesmaids
shoes
Charmant
madame
Delacour
was
most
accomplished
at
household
spells
and
had
the
oven
properly
cleaned
in
a
trice
Gabrielle
followed
her
elder
sister
around
trying
to
assist
in
any
way
she
could
and
jabbering
away
in
rapid
French
on
the
downside
the
Burrow
was
not
built
to
accommodate
so
many
people
mr.
and
Mrs
weasley
were
now
sleeping
in
the
sitting
room
having
shouted
down
Monsieur
and
Madame
Delacours
protests
and
insisted
they
take
their
bedroom
gabrielle
was
sleeping
with
Fleur
in
Percys
old
room
and
Bill
would
be
sharing
with
Charlie
his
best
man
once
Charlie
arrived
from
Romania
opportunities
to
make
plans
together
became
virtually
nonexistent
and
it
was
in
desperation
that
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
took
to
volunteering
to
feed
the
chickens
just
to
escape
the
overcrowded
house
but
she
still
wont
leave
us
alone
snarled
Ron
and
their
second
attempt
at
a
meeting
in
the
yard
was
foiled
by
the
appearance
of
Mrs
weasley
carrying
a
large
basket
of
laundry
in
her
arms
oh
good
youve
fed
the
chickens
she
called
as
she
approached
them
wed
better
shut
them
away
again
before
the
men
arrive
tomorrow
to
put
up
the
tent
for
the
wedding
she
explained
pausing
to
lean
against
the
henhouse
she
looked
exhausted
millamants
Magic
Marquees
theyre
very
good
bills
escorting
them
youd
better
stay
inside
while
theyre
here
Harry
i
must
say
it
does
complicate
organizing
a
wedding
having
all
these
security
spells
around
the
place
im
sorry
said
Harry
humbly
oh
dont
be
silly
dear
said
Mrs
weasley
at
once
i
didnt
mean
well
your
safetys
much
more
important
actually
Ive
been
wanting
to
ask
you
how
you
want
to
celebrate
your
birthday
Harry
seventeen
after
all
its
an
important
day
i
dont
want
a
fuss
said
Harry
quickly
envisaging
the
additional
strain
this
would
put
on
them
all
really
Mrs
weasley
just
a
normal
dinner
would
be
fine
its
the
day
before
the
wedding
oh
well
if
youre
sure
dear
ill
invite
Remus
and
Tonks
shall
I
and
how
about
Hagrid
thatd
be
great
said
Harry
but
please
dont
go
to
loads
of
trouble
not
at
all
not
at
all
its
no
trouble
she
looked
at
him
a
long
searching
look
then
smiled
a
little
sadly
straightened
up
and
walked
away
harry
watched
as
she
waved
her
wand
near
the
washing
line
and
the
damp
clothes
rose
into
the
air
to
hang
themselves
up
and
suddenly
he
felt
a
great
wave
of
remorse
for
the
inconvenience
and
the
pain
he
was
giving
her
chapter
Seven
the
Will
of
Albus
Dumbledore
he
was
walking
along
a
mountain
road
in
the
cool
blue
light
of
dawn
far
below
swathed
in
mist
was
the
shadow
of
a
small
town
was
the
man
he
sought
down
there
the
man
he
needed
so
badly
he
could
think
of
little
else
the
man
who
held
the
answer
the
answer
to
his
problem
oi
wake
up
harry
opened
his
eyes
he
was
lying
again
on
the
camp
bed
in
ron's
dingy
attic
room
the
sun
had
not
yet
risen
and
the
room
was
still
shadowy
pigwidgeon
was
asleep
with
his
head
under
his
tiny
wing
the
scar
on
harry's
forehead
was
prickling
you
were
muttering
in
your
sleep
was
I
yeah
gregorovitch
you
kept
saying
Gregorovitch
harry
was
not
wearing
his
glasses
ron's
face
appeared
slightly
blurred
who's
Gregorovitch
i
dunno
do
I
you
were
the
one
saying
it
harry
rubbed
his
forehead
thinking
he
had
a
vague
idea
he
had
heard
the
name
before
but
he
could
not
think
where
i
think
voldemort's
looking
for
him
poor
bloke
said
Ron
fervently
harry
sat
up
still
rubbing
his
scar
now
wide
awake
he
tried
to
remember
exactly
what
he
had
seen
in
the
dream
but
all
that
came
back
was
a
mountainous
horizon
and
the
outline
of
the
little
village
cradled
in
a
deep
valley
i
think
he's
abroad
who
Gregorovitch
voldemort
i
think
he's
somewhere
abroad
looking
for
Gregorovitch
it
didn't
look
like
anywhere
in
Britain
you
reckon
you
were
seeing
into
his
mind
again
ron
sounded
worried
do
me
a
favor
and
don't
tell
Hermione
said
Harry
although
how
she
expects
me
to
stop
seeing
stuff
in
my
sleep
he
gazed
up
at
little
pigwidgeon's
cage
thinking
why
was
the
name
Gregorovitch
familiar
i
think
he
said
slowly
he's
got
something
to
do
with
Quidditch
there's
some
connection
but
I
can'ti
can't
think
what
it
is
quidditch
said
Ron
sure
you're
not
thinking
of
Gorgovitch
who
dragomir
Gorgovitch
Chaser
transferred
to
the
Chudley
Cannons
for
a
record
fee
two
years
ago
record
holder
for
most
Quaffle
drops
in
a
season
no
said
Harry
i'm
definitely
not
thinking
of
Gorgovitch
i
try
not
to
either
said
Ron
well
happy
birthday
anyway
wow
that's
right
I
forgot
i'm
seventeen
harry
seized
the
wand
lying
beside
his
camp
bed
pointed
it
at
the
cluttered
desk
where
he
had
left
his
glasses
and
said
Accio
Glasses
although
they
were
only
around
a
foot
away
there
was
something
immensely
satisfying
about
seeing
them
zoom
toward
him
at
least
until
they
poked
him
in
the
eye
slick
snorted
Ron
reveling
in
the
removal
of
his
Trace
Harry
sent
ron's
possessions
flying
around
the
room
causing
Pigwidgeon
to
wake
up
and
flutter
excitedly
around
his
cage
harry
also
tried
tying
the
laces
of
his
trainers
by
magic
the
resultant
knot
took
several
minutes
to
untie
by
hand
and
purely
for
the
pleasure
of
it
turned
the
orange
robes
on
ron's
Chudley
Cannons
posters
bright
blue
i'd
do
your
fly
by
hand
though
Ron
advised
Harry
sniggering
when
Harry
immediately
checked
it
here's
your
present
unwrap
it
up
here
it's
not
for
my
mother's
eyes
a
book
said
Harry
as
he
took
the
rectangular
parcel
bit
of
a
departure
from
tradition
isn't
it
this
isn't
your
average
book
said
Ron
it'd
pure
gold
Twelve
Fail-Safe
Ways
to
Charm
Witches
explains
everything
you
need
to
know
about
girls
if
only
i'd
had
this
last
year
i'd
have
known
exactly
how
to
get
rid
of
Lavender
and
I
would've
known
how
to
get
going
with
well
Fred
and
George
gave
me
a
copy
and
i've
learned
a
lot
you'd
be
surprised
it's
not
all
about
wandwork
either
when
they
arrived
in
the
kitchen
they
found
a
pile
of
presents
waiting
on
the
table
bill
and
Monsieur
Delacour
were
finishing
their
breakfasts
while
Mrs
weasley
stood
chatting
to
them
over
the
frying
pan
arthur
told
me
to
wish
you
a
happy
seventeenth
Harry
said
Mrs
weasley
beaming
at
him
he
had
to
leave
early
for
work
but
he'll
be
back
for
dinner
that's
our
present
on
top
harry
sat
down
took
the
square
parcel
she
had
indicated
and
unwrapped
it
inside
was
a
watch
very
like
the
one
mr.
and
Mrs
weasley
had
given
Ron
for
his
seventeenth
it
was
gold
with
stars
circling
around
the
race
instead
of
hands
it's
traditional
to
give
a
wizard
a
watch
when
he
comes
of
age
said
Mrs
weasley
watching
him
anxiously
from
beside
the
cooker
i'm
afraid
that
one
isn't
new
like
ron's
it
was
actually
my
brother
fabian's
and
he
wasn't
terribly
careful
with
his
possessions
it's
a
bit
dented
on
the
back
but
the
rest
of
her
speech
was
lost
Harry
had
got
up
and
hugged
her
he
tried
to
put
a
lot
of
unsaid
things
into
the
hug
and
perhaps
she
understood
them
because
she
patted
his
cheek
clumsily
when
he
released
her
then
waved
her
wand
in
a
slightly
random
way
causing
half
a
pack
of
bacon
to
flop
out
of
the
frying
pan
onto
the
floor
happy
birthday
Harry
said
Hermione
hurrying
into
the
kitchen
and
adding
her
own
present
to
the
top
of
the
pile
it's
not
much
but
I
hope
you
like
it
what
did
you
get
him
she
added
to
Ron
who
seemed
not
to
hear
her
come
on
then
open
hermione's
said
Ron
she
had
bought
him
a
new
Sneakoscope
the
other
packages
contained
an
enchanted
razor
from
Bill
and
Fleur
Ah
yes
zis
will
give
you
ze
smoothest
shave
you
will
ever
ave
Monsieur
Delacour
assured
him
but
you
must
tell
it
clearly
what
you
want
ozzerwise
you
might
find
you
ave
a
leetle
less
hair
zan
you
would
like
chocolates
from
the
Delacours
and
an
enormous
box
of
the
latest
Weasleys
Wizard
Wheezes
merchandise
from
Fred
and
George
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
did
not
linger
at
the
table
as
the
arrival
of
Madame
Delacour
Fleur
and
Gabrielle
made
the
kitchen
uncomfortably
crowded
i'll
pack
these
for
you
Hermione
said
brightly
taking
harry's
presents
out
of
his
arms
as
the
three
of
them
headed
back
upstairs
i'm
nearly
done
i'm
just
waiting
for
the
rest
of
your
underpants
to
come
out
of
the
wash
Ron
ron's
splutter
was
interrupted
by
the
opening
of
a
door
on
the
first-floor
landing
harry
will
you
come
in
here
a
moment
it
was
Ginny
ron
came
to
an
abrupt
halt
but
Hermione
took
him
by
the
elbow
and
tugged
him
on
up
the
stairs
feeling
nervous
Harry
followed
Ginny
into
her
room
he
had
never
been
inside
it
before
it
was
small
but
bright
there
was
a
large
poster
of
the
Wizarding
band
the
Weird
Sisters
on
one
wall
and
a
picture
of
Gwenog
Jones
Captain
of
the
all-witch
Quidditch
team
the
Holyhead
Harpies
on
the
other
a
desk
stood
facing
the
open
window
which
looked
out
over
the
orchard
where
he
and
Ginny
had
once
played
a
two-a-side
Quidditch
with
Ron
and
Hermione
and
which
now
housed
a
large
pearly
white
marquee
the
golden
flag
on
top
was
level
with
ginny's
window
ginny
looked
up
into
harry's
face
took
a
deep
breath
and
said
Happy
seventeenth
yeah
thanks
she
was
looking
at
him
steadily
he
however
found
it
difficult
to
look
back
at
her
it
was
like
gazing
into
a
brilliant
light
nice
view
he
said
feebly
pointing
toward
with
window
she
ignored
this
he
could
not
blame
her
i
couldn't
think
what
to
get
you
she
said
you
didn't
have
to
get
me
anything
she
disregarded
this
too
i
didn't
know
what
would
be
useful
nothing
too
big
because
you
wouldn't
be
able
to
take
it
with
you
he
chanced
a
glance
at
her
she
was
not
tearful
that
was
one
of
the
many
wonderful
things
about
Ginny
she
was
rarely
weepy
he
had
sometimes
thought
that
having
six
brothers
must
have
toughened
her
up
she
took
a
step
closer
to
him
so
then
I
thought
i'd
like
you
to
have
something
to
remember
me
by
you
know
if
you
meet
some
veela
when
you're
off
doing
whatever
you're
doing
i
think
dating
opportunities
are
going
to
be
pretty
thin
on
the
ground
to
be
honest
there's
the
silver
lining
i've
been
looking
for
she
whispered
and
then
she
was
kissing
him
as
she
had
never
kissed
him
before
and
Harry
was
kissing
her
back
and
it
was
blissful
oblivion
better
than
firewhisky
she
was
the
only
real
thing
in
the
world
Ginny
the
feel
of
her
one
hand
at
her
back
and
one
in
her
long
sweet-smelling
hair
the
door
banged
open
behind
them
and
they
jumped
apart
oh
said
Ron
pointedly
sorry
ron
hermione
was
just
behind
him
slight
out
of
breath
there
was
a
strained
silence
then
Ginny
had
said
in
a
flat
little
voice
well
happy
birthday
anyway
Harry
ron's
ears
were
scarlet
Hermione
looked
nervous
harry
wanted
to
slam
the
door
in
their
faces
but
it
felt
as
though
a
cold
draft
had
entered
the
room
when
the
door
opened
and
his
shining
moment
had
popped
like
a
soap
bubble
all
the
reasons
for
ending
his
relationship
with
Ginny
for
staying
well
away
from
her
seemed
to
have
slunk
inside
the
room
with
Ron
and
all
happy
forgetfulness
was
gone
he
looked
at
Ginny
wanting
to
say
something
though
he
hardly
knew
what
but
she
had
turned
her
back
on
him
he
thought
that
she
might
have
succumbed
for
once
to
tears
he
could
not
do
anything
to
comfort
her
in
front
of
Ron
i'll
see
you
later
he
said
and
followed
the
other
two
out
of
the
bedroom
ron
marched
downstairs
though
the
still-crowded
kitchen
and
into
the
yard
and
Harry
kept
pace
with
him
all
the
way
Hermione
trotting
along
behind
them
looking
scared
once
he
reached
the
seclusion
of
the
freshly
mown
lawn
Ron
rounded
on
Harry
you
ditched
her
what
are
you
doing
now
messing
her
around
i'm
not
messing
her
around
said
Harry
as
Hermione
caught
up
with
them
ron
but
Ron
held
up
a
hand
to
silence
her
she
was
really
cut
up
when
you
ended
it
so
was
I
you
know
why
I
stopped
it
and
it
wasn't
because
I
wanted
to
yeah
but
you
go
snogging
her
now
and
she's
just
going
to
get
her
hopes
up
again
she's
not
an
idiot
she
knows
it
can't
happen
she's
not
expecting
us
toto
end
up
married
or
as
he
said
it
a
vivid
picture
formed
in
harry's
mind
of
Ginny
in
a
white
dress
marrying
a
tall
faceless
and
unpleasant
stranger
in
one
spiraling
moment
it
seemed
to
hit
him
Her
future
was
free
and
unencumbered
whereas
his
he
could
see
nothing
but
Voldemort
ahead
if
you
keep
groping
her
every
chance
you
get
it
won't
happen
again
said
Harry
harshly
the
day
was
cloudless
but
he
felt
as
though
the
sun
had
gone
in
okay
ron
looked
half
resentful
half
sheepish
he
rocked
backward
and
forward
on
his
feet
for
a
moment
then
said
Right
then
well
that's
yeah
ginny
did
not
seek
another
one-to-one
meeting
with
Harry
for
the
rest
of
the
day
nor
by
any
look
or
gesture
did
she
show
that
they
had
shared
more
than
polite
conversation
in
her
room
nevertheless
charlie's
arrival
came
as
a
relief
to
Harry
it
provided
a
distraction
watching
Mrs
weasley
force
Charlie
into
a
chair
raise
her
wand
threateningly
and
announce
that
he
was
about
to
get
a
proper
haircut
as
harry's
birthday
dinner
would
have
stretched
the
burrow's
kitchen
to
breaking
point
even
before
the
arrival
of
Charlie
Lupin
Tonks
and
Hagrid
several
tables
were
placed
end
to
end
in
the
garden
fred
and
George
bewitched
a
number
of
purple
lanterns
all
emblazoned
with
a
large
number
to
hang
in
midair
over
the
guests
thanks
to
Mrs
weasley's
ministrations
george's
wound
was
neat
and
clean
but
Harry
was
not
yet
used
to
the
dark
hole
in
the
side
of
his
head
despite
the
twins
many
jokes
about
it
hermione
made
purple
and
gold
streamers
erupt
from
the
end
of
her
wand
and
drape
themselves
artistically
over
the
trees
and
bushes
nice
said
Ron
as
with
one
final
flourish
of
her
wand
Hermione
turned
the
leaves
on
the
crabapple
tree
to
gold
you've
really
got
an
eye
for
that
sort
of
thing
thank
you
Ron
said
Hermione
looking
both
pleased
and
a
little
confused
harry
turned
away
smiling
to
himself
he
had
a
funny
notion
that
he
would
find
a
chapter
on
compliments
when
he
found
time
to
peruse
his
copy
of
Twelve
Fail-Safe
Ways
to
Charm
Witches
he
caught
ginny's
eye
and
grinned
at
her
before
remembering
his
promise
to
Ron
and
hurriedly
striking
up
a
conversation
with
Monsieur
Delacour
out
of
the
way
out
of
the
way
sang
Mrs
weasley
coming
through
the
gate
with
what
appeared
to
be
a
giant
beach-ball-sized
Snitch
floating
in
front
of
her
seconds
later
Harry
realized
that
it
was
his
birthday
cake
which
Mrs
weasley
was
suspending
with
her
wand
rather
than
risk
carrying
it
over
the
uneven
ground
when
the
cake
had
finally
landed
in
the
middle
of
the
table
Harry
said
that
looks
amazing
Mrs
weasley
oh
it's
nothing
dear
she
said
fondly
over
her
shoulder
Ron
gave
Harry
the
thumbs-up
and
mouthed
Good
one
by
seven
o'clock
all
the
guests
had
arrived
led
into
the
house
by
Fred
and
George
who
had
waited
for
them
at
the
end
of
the
lane
hagrid
had
honored
the
occasion
by
wearing
his
best
and
horrible
hairy
brown
suit
although
Lupin
smiled
as
he
shook
harry's
hand
Harry
thought
he
looked
rather
unhappy
it
was
all
very
odd
Tonks
beside
him
looked
simply
radiant
happy
birthday
Harry
she
said
hugging
him
tightly
seventeen
eh
said
Hagrid
as
he
accepted
a
bucket-sized
glass
of
wine
from
Fred
six
years
ter
the
day
since
we
met
Harry
d'yeh
remember
it
vaguely
said
Harry
grinning
up
at
him
didn't

smash
down
the
front
door
give
Dudley
a
pig's
tail
and
tell
me

Hermione

newborn
unicorns

Harry
avoided
ron's
and
hermione's
gazes
as
Hagrid
rummaged
in
his
pocket
here
harry
couldn't
think
what
ter
get
teh
but
then
I
remembered
this
he
pulled
out
a
small
slightly
furry
drawstring
pouch
with
a
long
string
evidently
intended
to
be
worn
around
the
neck
mokeskin
hide
anythin
in
there
an
no
one
but
the
owner

get
it

hagrid
thanks
s'nothin
said
Hagrid
with
a
wave
of
a
dustbin-lid-sized
hand
an
there's
Charlie
always
liked
him
hey
charlie
charlie
approached
running
his
hand
slightly
ruefully
over
his
new
brutally
short
haircut
he
was
shorter
than
Ron
thickset
with
a
number
of
burns
and
scratches
up
his
muscley
arms
hi
Hagrid
how's
it

meanin

Norwegian
Ridgeback

girl
oh
yeah
said
Charlie
how
can
you
tell
asked
Hermione
they're
a
lot
more
vicious
said
Charlie
he
looked
over
his
shoulder
and
dropped
his
voice
wish
Dad
would
hurry
up
and
get
here
mum's
getting
edgy
they
all
looked
over
at
Mrs
weasley
she
was
trying
to
talk
to
Madame
Delacour
while
glancing
repeatedly
at
the
gate
i
think
we'd
better
start
without
Arthur
she
called
to
the
garden
at
large
after
a
moment
or
two
he
must
have
been
held
up
at
oh
they
all
saw
it
at
the
same
time
a
streak
of
light
that
came
flying
across
the
yard
and
onto
the
table
where
it
resolved
itself
into
a
bright
silver
weasel
which
stood
on
its
hind
legs
and
spoke
with
mr.
weasley's
voice
minister
of
Magic
coming
with
me
the
Patronus
dissolved
into
thin
air
leaving
fleur's
family
peering
in
astonishment
at
the
place
where
it
had
vanished
we
shouldn't
be
here
said
Lupin
at
once
harry
i'm
sorry
i'll
explain
some
other
time
he
seized
Tonkss
wrist
and
pulled
her
away
they
reached
the
fence
climbed
over
it
and
vanished
from
sight
mrs
weasley
looked
bewildered
the
Minister
but
why
i
don't
understand
but
there
was
no
time
to
discuss
the
matter
a
second
later
mr.
Weasley
had
appeared
out
of
thin
air
at
the
gate
accompanied
by
Rufus
Scrimgeour
instantly
recognizable
by
his
mane
of
grizzled
hair
the
two
newcomers
marched
across
the
yard
toward
the
garden
and
the
lantern-lit
table
where
everybody
sat
in
silence
watching
them
draw
closer
as
Scrimgeour
came
within
range
of
the
lantern
light
harry
saw
that
he
looked
much
older
than
the
last
time
that
had
met
scraggy
and
grim
sorry
to
intrude
said
Scrimgeour
as
he
limped
to
a
halt
before
the
table
especially
as
I
can
see
that
I
am
gate-crashing
a
party
his
eyes
lingered
for
a
moment
on
the
giant
Snitch
cake
many
happy
returns
thanks
said
Harry
i
require
a
private
word
with
you
Scrimgeour
went
on
also
with
mr.
Ronald
Weasley
and
Miss
Hermione
Granger
us
said
Ron
sounding
surprised
why
us
i
shall
tell
you
that
when
we
are
somewhere
more
private
said
Scrimgeour
is
there
such
a
place
he
demanded
of
mr.
Weasley
yes
of
course
said
mr.
Weasley
who
looked
nervous
the
er
sitting
room
why
don't
you
use
that
you
can
lead
the
way
Scrimgeour
said
to
Ron
there
will
be
no
need
for
you
to
accompany
us
Arthur
harry
saw
mr.
Weasley
exchange
a
worried
look
with
Mrs
weasley
as
he
Ron
and
Hermione
stood
up
as
they
led
the
way
back
to
the
house
in
silence
Harry
knew
that
the
other
two
were
thinking
the
same
as
he
was
Scrimgeour
must
somehow
had
learned
that
the
three
of
them
were
planning
to
drop
out
of
Hogwarts
scrimgeour
did
not
speak
as
they
all
passed
through
the
messed
kitchen
and
into
the
burrow's
sitting
room
although
the
garden
had
been
full
of
soft
golden
evening
light
it
was
already
dark
in
here
Harry
flicked
his
wand
at
the
oil
lamps
as
he
entered
and
they
illuminated
the
shabby
but
cozy
room
scrimgeour
sat
himself
in
the
sagging
armchair
that
mr.
Weasley
normally
occupied
leaving
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
to
squeeze
side
by
side
onto
the
sofa
once
they
had
done
so
Scrimgeour
spoke
i
have
some
questions
for
the
three
of
you
and
I
think
it
will
be
best
if
we
do
it
individually
if
you
two
he
pointed
at
Harry
and
Hermione
can
wait
upstairs
I
will
start
with
Ronald
we're
not
going
anywhere
said
Harry
while
Hermione
nodded
vigorously
you
can
speak
to
us
together
or
not
at
all
scrimgeour
gave
Harry
a
cold
appraising
look
harry
had
the
impression
that
the
Minister
was
wondering
whether
it
was
worthwhile
opening
hostilities
this
early
very
well
then
together
he
said
shrugging
he
cleared
his
throat
i
am
here
as
i'm
sure
you
know
because
of
Albus
dumbledore's
will
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
looked
at
one
another
a
surprise
apparently
you
were
not
aware
then
that
Dumbledore
had
left
you
anything
a-all
of
us
said
Ron
Me
and
Hermione
too
yes
all
of
but
Harry
interrupted
dumbledore
died
over
a
month
ago
why
has
it
taken
this
long
to
give
us
what
he
left
us
isn't
it
obvious
said
Hermione
before
Scrimgeour
could
answer
they
wanted
to
examine
whatever
he's
left
us
you
had
no
right
to
do
that
she
said
and
her
voice
trembled
slightly
i
had
every
right
said
Scrimgeour
dismissively
the
Decree
for
Justifiable
Confiscation
gives
the
Ministry
the
power
the
confiscate
the
contents
of
a
will
that
law
was
created
to
stop
wizards
passing
on
Dark
artifacts
said
Hermione
and
the
Ministry
is
supposed
to
have
powerful
evidence
that
the
deceased's
possessions
are
illegal
before
seizing
them
are
you
telling
me
that
you
thought
Dumbledore
was
trying
to
pass
us
something
cursed
are
you
planning
to
follow
a
career
in
Magical
Law
Miss
Granger
asked
Scrimgeour
no
i'm
not
retorted
Hermione
i'm
hoping
to
do
some
good
in
the
world
ron
laughed
scrimgeour's
eyes
flickered
toward
him
and
away
again
as
Harry
spoke
so
why
have
you
decided
to
let
us
have
our
things
now
can't
think
of
a
pretext
to
keep
them
no
it'll
be
because
thirty-one
days
are
up
said
Hermione
at
once
they
can't
keep
the
objects
longer
than
that
unless
they
can
prove
they're
dangerous
right
would
you
say
you
were
close
to
Dumbledore
Ronald
asked
Scrimgeour
ignoring
Hermione
ron
looked
startled
me
not
not
really
it
was
always
Harry
who
ron
looked
around
at
Harry
and
Hermione
to
see
Hermione
giving
him
a
stop-talking-now
sort
of
look
but
the
damage
was
done
Scrimgeour
looked
as
though
he
had
heard
exactly
what
he
had
expected
and
wanted
to
hear
he
swooped
like
a
bird
of
prey
upon
ron's
answer
if
you
were
not
very
close
to
Dumbledore
how
do
you
account
for
the
fact
that
he
remembered
you
in
his
will
he
made
exceptionally
few
personal
bequests
the
vast
majority
of
his
possessions
his
private
library
his
magical
instruments
and
other
personal
effects
were
left
to
Hogwarts
why
do
you
think
you
were
singled
out
dunno
said
Ron
when
I
say
we
weren't
close
i
mean
I
think
he
liked
me
you're
being
modest
Ron
said
Hermione
dumbledore
was
very
fond
of
you
this
was
stretching
the
truth
to
breaking
point
as
far
as
Harry
knew
Ron
and
Dumbledore
had
never
been
alone
together
and
direct
contact
between
them
had
been
negligible
however
Scrimgeour
did
not
seem
to
be
listening
he
put
his
hand
inside
his
cloak
and
drew
out
a
drawstring
pouch
much
larger
than
the
one
Hagrid
had
given
Harry
from
it
he
removed
a
scroll
of
parchment
which
he
unrolled
and
read
aloud
the
Last
Will
and
Testament
of
Albus
Percival
Wulfric
Brian
Dumbledore
yes
here
we
are
to
Ronald
Bilius
Weasley
I
leave
my
Deluminator
in
the
hope
that
he
will
remember
me
when
he
uses
it
scrimgeour
took
from
the
bag
an
object
that
Harry
had
seen
before
It
looked
something
like
a
silver
cigarette
lighter
but
it
had
he
knew
the
power
to
suck
all
light
from
a
place
and
restore
it
with
a
simple
click
scrimgeour
leaned
forward
and
passed
the
Deluminator
to
Ron
who
took
it
and
turned
it
over
in
the
fingers
looking
stunned
that
is
a
valuable
object
said
Scrimgeour
watching
Ron
it
may
even
be
unique
certainly
it
is
of
dumbledore's
own
design
why
would
he
have
left
you
and
item
so
rare
ron
shook
his
head
looking
bewildered
dumbledore
must
have
taught
thousands
of
students
Scrimgeour
persevered
yet
the
only
ones
he
remembered
in
his
will
are
you
three
why
is
that
to
what
use
did
he
think
you
would
put
to
the
Deluminator
mr.
Weasley
put
out
lights
I
s'pose
mumbled
Ron
what
else
could
I
do
with
it
evidently
Scrimgeour
had
no
suggestions
after
squinting
at
Ron
for
a
moment
or
tow
he
turned
back
to
dumbledore's
will
to
Miss
Hermione
Jean
Granger
I
leave
my
copy
of
The
Tales
of
Beedle
the
Bard
in
the
hope
that
she
will
find
it
entertaining
and
instructive
scrimgeour
now
pulled
out
of
the
bag
a
small
book
that
looked
as
ancient
as
the
copy
of
Secrets
of
the
Darkest
Art
upstairs
its
binding
was
stained
and
peeling
in
places
hermione
took
it
from
Scrimgeour
without
a
word
she
held
the
book
in
her
lap
and
gazed
at
it
harry
saw
that
the
title
was
in
runes
he
had
never
learned
to
read
them
as
he
looked
a
tear
splashed
onto
the
embossed
symbols
why
do
you
think
Dumbledore
left
you
that
book
Miss
Granger
asked
Scrimgeour
he
he
knew
I
liked
books
said
Hermione
in
a
thick
voice
mopping
her
eyes
with
her
sleeve
but
why
that
particular
book
i
don't
know
he
must
have
thought
i'd
enjoy
it
did
you
ever
discuss
codes
or
any
means
of
passing
secret
messages
with
Dumbledore
no
I
didn't
said
Hermione
still
wiping
her
eyes
on
her
sleeve
and
if
the
Ministry
hasn't
found
any
hidden
codes
in
this
book
in
thirty-one
days
I
doubt
that
I
will
she
suppressed
a
sob
they
were
wedged
together
so
tightly
that
Ron
had
difficulty
extracting
his
arm
to
put
it
around
hermione's
shoulders
scrimgeour
turned
back
to
the
will
to
Harry
James
Potter
he
read
and
harry's
insides
contracted
with
a
sudden
excitement
I
leave
the
Snitch
he
caught
in
his
first
Quidditch
match
at
Hogwarts
as
a
reminder
of
the
rewards
of
perseverance
and
skill
as
Scrimgeour
pulled
out
the
tiny
walnut-sized
golden
ball
its
silver
wings
fluttered
rather
feebly
and
Harry
could
not
help
feeling
a
definite
sense
of
anticlimax
why
did
Dumbledore
leave
you
this
Snitch
asked
Scrimgeour
no
idea
said
Harry
for
the
reasons
you
just
read
out
I
suppose
to
remind
me
what
you
can
get
if
you
persevere
and
whatever
it
was
you
think
this
a
mere
symbolic
keepsake
then
i
suppose
so
said
Harry
what
else
could
it
be
i'm
asking
the
questions
said
Scrimgeour
shifting
his
chair
a
little
closer
to
the
sofa
dusk
was
really
falling
outside
now
the
marquee
beyond
the
windows
towered
ghostly
white
over
the
hedge
i
notice
that
your
birthday
cake
is
in
the
shape
of
a
Snitch
Scrimgeour
said
to
Harry
why
is
that
hermione
laughed
derisively
oh
it
can't
be
a
reference
to
the
fact
harry's
a
great
Seeker
that's
way
too
obvious
she
said
there
must
be
a
secret
message
from
Dumbledore
hidden
in
the
icing
i
don't
think
there's
anything
hidden
in
the
icing
said
Scrimgeour
but
a
Snitch
would
be
a
very
good
hiding
place
for
a
small
object
you
know
why
i'm
sure
harry
shrugged
Hermione
however
answered
Harry
thought
that
answering
questions
correctly
was
such
a
deeply
ingrained
habit
she
could
not
suppress
the
urge
because
Snitches
have
flesh
memories
she
said
what
said
Harry
and
Ron
together
both
considered
hermione's
Quidditch
knowledge
negligible
correct
said
Scrimgeour
a
Snitch
is
not
touched
by
bare
skin
before
it
is
released
not
even
by
the
maker
who
wears
gloves
it
carries
an
enchantment
by
which
it
can
identify
the
first
human
to
lay
hands
upon
it
in
case
of
a
disputed
capture
this
Snitch
he
held
up
the
tiny
golden
ball
will
remember
your
touch
Potter
it
occurs
to
me
that
Dumbledore
who
had
prodigious
magical
skill
whatever
his
other
faults
might
have
enchanted
this
Snitch
so
that
it
will
open
only
for
you
harry's
heart
was
beating
rather
fast
he
was
sure
that
Scrimgeour
was
right
how
could
he
avoid
taking
the
Snitch
with
his
bare
hand
in
front
of
the
Minister
you
don't
say
anything
said
Scrimgeour
perhaps
you
already
know
what
the
Snitch
contains
no
said
Harry
still
wondering
how
he
could
appear
to
touch
the
Snitch
without
really
doing
so
if
only
he
knew
Legilimency
really
knew
it
and
could
read
hermione's
mind
he
could
practically
hear
her
brain
whizzing
beside
him
take
it
said
Scrimgeour
quietly
harry
met
the
minister's
yellow
eyes
and
knew
he
had
no
option
but
to
obey
he
held
out
his
hand
and
Scrimgeour
leaned
forward
again
and
place
the
Snitch
slowly
and
deliberately
into
harry's
palm
nothing
happened
as
harry's
fingers
closed
around
the
Snitch
its
tired
wings
fluttered
and
were
still
scrimgeour
Ron
and
Hermione
continued
to
gaze
avidly
at
the
now
partially
concealed
ball
as
if
still
hoping
it
might
transform
in
some
way
that
was
dramatic
said
Harry
coolly
both
Ron
and
Hermione
laughed
that's
all
then
is
it
asked
Hermione
making
to
raise
herself
off
the
sofa
not
quite
said
Scrimgeour
who
looked
bad
tempered
now
dumbledore
left
you
a
second
bequest
Potter
what
is
it
asked
Harry
excitement
rekindling
scrimgeour
did
not
bother
to
read
from
the
will
this
time
the
sword
of
Godric
Gryffindor
he
said
hermione
and
Ron
both
stiffened
harry
looked
around
for
a
sign
of
the
ruby-encrusted
hilt
but
Scrimgeour
did
not
pull
the
sword
from
the
leather
pouch
which
in
any
case
looked
much
too
small
to
contain
it
so
where
is
it
harry
asked
suspiciously
unfortunately
said
Scrimgeour
that
sword
was
not
dumbledore's
to
give
away
the
sword
of
Godric
Gryffindor
is
an
important
historical
artifact
and
as
such
belongs
it
belongs
to
Harry
said
Hermione
hotly
it
chose
him
he
was
the
one
who
found
it
it
came
to
him
out
of
the
Sorting
Hat
according
to
reliable
historical
sources
the
sword
may
present
itself
to
any
worthy
Gryffindor
said
Scrimgeour
that
does
not
make
it
the
exclusive
property
of
mr.
Potter
whatever
Dumbledore
may
have
decided
scrimgeour
scratched
his
badly
shaven
cheek
scrutinizing
Harry
why
do
you
think
dumbledore
wanted
to
give
me
the
sword
said
Harry
struggling
to
keep
his
temper
maybe
he
thought
it
would
look
nice
on
my
wall
this
is
not
a
joke
Potter
growled
Scrimgeour
was
it
because
Dumbledore
believed
that
only
the
sword
of
Godric
Gryffindor
could
defeat
the
Heir
of
Slytherin
did
he
wish
to
give
you
that
sword
Potter
because
he
believed
as
do
many
that
you
are
the
one
destined
to
destroy
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
interesting
theory
said
Harry
has
anyone
ever
tried
sticking
a
sword
in
Voldemort
maybe
the
Ministry
should
put
some
people
onto
that
instead
of
wasting
their
time
stripping
down
Deluminators
or
covering
up
breakouts
from
Azkaban
so
this
is
what
you've
been
doing
Minister
shut
up
in
your
office
trying
to
break
open
a
Snitch
people
are
dying
I
was
nearly
one
of
them
Voldemort
chased
me
across
three
countries
he
killed
Mad-Eye
Moody
but
there's
no
word
about
any
of
that
from
the
Ministry
has
there
and
you
still
expect
us
to
cooperate
with
you
you
go
too
far
shouted
Scrimgeour
standing
up
Harry
jumped
to
his
feet
too
scrimgeour
limped
toward
Harry
and
jabbed
him
hard
in
the
chest
with
the
point
of
his
wand
It
singed
a
hole
in
harry's
t-shirt
like
a
lit
cigarette
oi
said
Ron
jumping
up
and
raising
his
own
wand
but
Harry
said
no
d'you
want
to
give
him
an
excuse
to
arrest
us
remembered
you're
not
at
school
have
you
said
Scrimgeour
breathing
hard
into
harry's
face
remembered
that
I
am
not
Dumbledore
who
forgave
your
insolence
and
insubordination
you
may
wear
that
scar
like
a
crown
Potter
but
it
is
not
up
to
a
seventeen-year-old
boy
to
tell
me
how
to
do
my
job
it's
time
you
learned
some
respect
it's
time
you
earned
it
said
Harry
the
floor
trembled
there
was
a
sound
of
running
footsteps
then
the
door
to
the
sitting
room
burst
open
and
mr.
and
Mrs
weasley
ran
in
we
we
thought
we
heard
began
mr.
Weasley
looking
thoroughly
alarmed
at
the
sight
of
Harry
and
the
Minister
virtually
nose
to
nose
raised
voices
panted
Mrs
weasley
scrimgeour
took
a
couple
of
steps
back
from
Harry
glancing
at
the
hole
he
had
made
in
harry's
t-shirt
he
seemed
to
regret
his
loss
of
temper
it
it
was
nothing
he
growled
regret
your
attitude
he
said
looking
Harry
full
in
the
face
once
more
you
seem
to
think
that
the
Ministry
does
not
desire
what
you
what
Dumbledore
desired
we
ought
to
work
together
i
don't
like
your
methods
Minister
said
Harry
remember
for
the
second
time
he
raised
his
right
fist
and
displayed
to
Scrimgeour
the
scar
that
still
showed
white
on
the
back
of
it
spelling
I
must
not
tell
lies
scrimgeour's
expression
hardened
he
turned
away
without
another
word
and
limped
from
the
room
mrs
weasley
hurried
after
him
Harry
heard
her
stop
at
the
back
door
after
a
minute
or
so
she
called
he's
gone
what
did
he
want
mr.
Weasley
asked
looking
around
at
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
as
Mrs
weasley
came
hurrying
back
to
them
to
give
us
what
Dumbledore
left
us
said
Harry
they've
only
just
released
the
content
of
his
will
outside
in
the
garden
over
the
dinner
tables
the
three
objects
Scrimgeour
had
given
them
were
passed
from
hand
to
hand
everyone
exclaimed
over
the
Deluminator
and
The
Tales
of
Beedle
the
Bard
and
lamented
the
fact
that
Scrimgeour
had
refused
to
pass
on
the
sword
but
none
of
them
could
offer
any
suggestion
as
to
why
Dumbledore
would
have
left
Harry
an
old
Snitch
as
mr.
Weasley
examined
the
Deluminator
for
the
third
of
fourth
time
Mrs
weasley
said
tentatively
Harry
dear
everyone's
awfully
hungry
we
didn't
like
to
start
without
you
shall
I
serve
dinner
now
they
all
ate
rather
hurriedly
and
then
after
a
hasty
chorus
of
Happy
Birthday
and
much
gulping
of
cake
the
party
broke
up
hagrid
who
was
invited
to
the
wedding
the
following
day
but
was
far
too
bulky
to
sleep
in
the
overstretched
Burrow
left
to
set
up
a
tent
for
himself
in
a
neighboring
field
meet
us
upstairs
Harry
whispered
to
Hermione
while
they
helped
Mrs
weasley
restore
the
garden
to
its
normal
state
after
everyone's
gone
to
bed
up
in
the
attic
room
Ron
examined
his
Deluminator
and
Harry
filled
hagrid's
mokeskin
purse
not
with
gold
but
with
those
items
he
most
prized
apparently
worthless
though
some
of
them
were
the
marauder's
Map
the
shard
of
sirius's
enchanted
mirror
and
R
a.b.'s
locket
he
pulled
the
string
tight
and
slipped
the
purse
around
his
neck
then
sat
holding
the
old
Snitch
and
watching
its
wings
flutter
feebly
at
last
Hermione
tapped
on
the
door
and
tiptoed
inside
muffiato
she
whispered
waving
her
wand
in
the
direction
of
the
stairs
thought
you
didn't
approve
of
that
spell
said
Ron
times
change
said
Hermione
now
show
us
that
Deluminator
ron
obliged
at
once
holding
I
up
in
front
of
him
he
clicked
it
the
solitary
lamp
they
had
lit
went
out
at
once
the
thing
is
whispered
Hermione
through
the
dark
we
could
have
achieved
that
with
Peruvian
Instant
Darkness
Powder
there
was
a
small
click
and
the
ball
of
light
from
the
lamp
flew
back
to
the
ceiling
and
illuminated
them
all
once
more
still
it's
cool
said
Ron
a
little
defensively
and
from
what
they
said
Dumbledore
invented
it
himself
i
know
but
surely
he
wouldn't
have
singled
you
out
in
his
will
just
to
help
us
turn
out
the
lights
d'you
think
he
knew
the
Ministry
would
confiscate
his
will
and
examine
everything
he'd
left
us
asked
Harry
definitely
said
Hermione
he
couldn't
tell
us
in
the
will
why
he
was
leaving
us
these
things
but
that
will
doesn't
explain
why
he
couldn't
have
given
us
a
hint
when
he
was
alive
asked
Ron
well
exactly
said
Hermione
now
flicking
through
The
Tales
of
Beedle
the
Bard
if
these
things
are
important
enough
to
pass
on
right
under
the
nose
of
the
Ministry
you'd
think
he'd
have
left
us
know
why
unless
he
thought
it
was
obvious
thought
wrong
then
didn't
he
said
Ron
i
always
said
he
was
mental
brilliant
and
everything
but
cracked
leaving
Harry
an
old
Snitch
what
the
hell
was
that
about
i've
no
idea
said
Hermione
when
Scrimgeour
made
you
take
it
Harry
I
was
so
sure
that
something
was
going
to
happen
yeah
well
said
Harry
his
pulse
quickened
as
he
raised
the
Snitch
in
his
fingers
i
wasn't
going
to
try
too
hard
in
front
of
Scrimgeour
was
I
what
do
you
mean
asked
Hermione
the
Snitch
I
caught
in
my
first
ever
Quidditch
match
said
Harry
don't
you
remember
hermione
looked
simply
bemused
ron
however
gasped
pointing
frantically
from
Harry
to
the
Snitch
and
back
again
until
he
found
his
voice
that
was
the
one
you
nearly
swallowed
exactly
said
Harry
and
with
his
heart
beating
fast
he
pressed
his
mouth
to
the
Snitch
it
did
not
open
frustration
and
bitter
disappointment
welled
up
inside
him
He
lowered
the
golden
sphere
but
then
Hermione
cried
out
writing
there's
writing
on
it
quick
look
he
nearly
dropped
the
Snitch
in
surprise
and
excitement
hermione
was
quite
right
engraved
upon
the
smooth
golden
surface
where
seconds
before
there
had
been
nothing
were
five
words
written
in
the
thin
slanted
handwriting
that
Harry
recognized
as
dumbledore's
i
open
at
the
close
he
had
barely
read
them
when
the
words
vanished
again
i
open
at
the
close
what's
that
supposed
to
mean
hermione
and
Ron
shook
their
heads
looking
blank
i
open
at
the
close
at
the
close
i
open
at
the
close
but
no
matter
how
often
they
repeated
the
words
with
many
different
inflections
they
were
unable
to
wring
any
more
meaning
from
them
and
the
sword
said
Ron
finally
when
they
had
at
last
abandoned
their
attempts
to
divine
meaning
in
the
snitch's
inscription
why
did
he
want
Harry
to
have
the
sword
and
why
couldn't
he
just
have
told
me
harry
said
quietly
i
was
there
it
was
right
there
on
the
wall
of
his
office
during
all
our
talks
last
year
if
he
wanted
me
to
have
it
why
didn't
he
just
give
it
to
me
then
he
felt
as
thought
he
were
sitting
in
an
examination
with
a
question
he
ought
to
have
been
able
to
answer
in
front
of
him
his
brain
slow
and
unresponsive
was
there
something
he
had
missed
in
the
long
talks
with
Dumbledore
last
year
ought
he
to
know
what
it
all
meant
had
Dumbledore
expected
him
to
understand
and
as
for
this
book
said
Hermione
The
Tales
of
Beedle
the
Bard
i've
never
even
heard
of
them
you've
never
heard
of
The
Tales
of
Beedle
the
Bard
said
Ron
incredulously
you're
kidding
right
no
i'm
not
said
Hermione
in
surprise
do
you
know
them
then
well
of
course
I
do
harry
looked
up
diverted
the
circumstance
of
Ron
having
read
a
book
that
Hermione
had
not
was
unprecedented
ron
however
looked
bemused
by
their
surprise
oh
come
on
all
the
old
kids
stories
are
supposed
to
be
beedle's
aren't
they
the
Fountain
of
Fair
Fortune
the
Wizard
and
the
Hopping
Pot
babbitty
Rabbitty
and
her
Cackling
Stump
excuse
me
said
Hermione
giggling
what
was
the
last
one
come
off
it
said
Ron
looking
in
disbelief
from
Harry
to
Hermione
you
must've
heard
of
Babbitty
Rabbitty
ron
you
know
full
well
Harry
and
I
were
brought
up
by
Muggles
said
Hermione
we
didn't
hear
stories
like
that
when
we
were
little
we
heard
Snow
White
and
the
Seven
Dwarves
and
Cinderella
what's
that
an
illness
asked
Ron
so
these
are
children's
stories
asked
Hermione
bending
against
over
the
runes
yeah
said
Ron
uncertainly
i
mean
just
what
you
hear
you
know
that
all
these
old
stories
came
from
Beedle
i
dunno
what
they're
like
in
the
original
versions
but
I
wonder
why
Dumbledore
thought
I
should
read
them
something
cracked
downstairs
probably
just
Charlie
now
mum's
asleep
sneaking
off
to
regrow
his
hair
said
Ron
nervously
all
the
same
we
should
get
to
bed
whispered
Hermione
it
wouldn't
do
to
oversleep
tomorrow
no
agreed
Ron
a
brutal
triple
murder
by
the
bridegroom's
mother
might
put
a
bit
of
damper
on
the
wedding
i'll
get
the
light
and
he
clicked
the
Deluminator
once
more
as
Hermione
left
the
room
chapter
Eight
the
Wedding
three
oclock
on
the
following
afternoon
found
Harry
Ron
Fred
and
George
standing
outside
the
great
white
marquee
in
the
orchard
awaiting
the
arrival
of
the
wedding
guests
harry
had
taken
a
large
dose
of
Polyjuice
Potion
and
was
now
the
double
of
a
redheaded
Muggle
boy
from
the
local
village
Ottery
st.
Catchpole
from
whom
Fred
had
stolen
hairs
using
a
Summoning
Charm
the
plan
was
to
introduce
Harry
as
Cousin
Barny
and
trust
to
the
great
number
of
Weasley
relatives
to
camouflage
him
all
four
of
them
were
clutching
seating
plans
so
that
they
could
help
show
people
to
the
right
seats
a
host
of
white-robed
waiters
had
arrived
an
hour
earlier
along
with
a
golden
jacketed
band
and
all
of
these
wizards
were
currently
sitting
a
short
distance
away
under
a
tree
harry
could
see
a
blue
haze
of
pipe
smoke
issuing
from
the
spot
behind
Harry
the
entrance
to
the
marquee
revealed
rows
and
rows
of
fragile
golden
chairs
set
on
either
side
of
a
long
purple
carpet
the
supporting
poles
were
entwined
with
white
and
gold
flowers
fred
and
George
had
fastened
an
enormous
bunch
of
golden
balloons
over
the
exact
point
where
Bill
and
Fleur
would
shortly
become
husband
and
wife
outside
butterflies
and
bees
were
hovering
lazily
over
the
grass
and
hedgerow
harry
was
rather
uncomfortable
the
Muggle
boy
whose
appearance
he
was
affecting
was
slightly
fatter
than
him
and
his
dress
robes
felt
hot
and
tight
in
the
full
glare
of
a
summers
day
when
I
get
married
said
Fred
tugging
at
the
collar
of
his
own
robes
I
wont
be
bothering
with
any
of
this
nonsense
you
can
all
wear
what
you
like
and
Ill
put
a
full
Body
Bird
Curse
on
Mum
until
its
all
over
she
wasnt
too
bad
this
morning
considering
said
George
cried
a
bit
about
Percy
not
being
here
but
who
wants
him
oh
blimey
brace
yourselves
here
they
come
look
brightly
colored
figures
were
appearing
one
by
one
out
of
nowhere
at
the
distant
boundary
of
the
yard
within
minutes
a
procession
had
formed
which
began
to
snake
its
way
up
through
the
garden
toward
the
marquee
exotic
flowers
and
bewitched
birds
fluttered
on
the
witches
hats
while
precious
gems
glittered
from
many
of
the
wizards
cravats
a
hum
of
excited
chatter
grew
louder
and
louder
drowning
the
sound
of
the
bees
as
the
crowd
approached
the
tent
excellent
I
think
I
see
a
few
veela
cousins
said
George
craning
his
neck
for
a
better
look
theyll
need
help
understanding
our
English
customs
Ill
look
after
them
not
so
fast
Your
Holeyness
said
Fred
and
darting
past
the
gaggle
of
middle-aged
witches
heading
for
the
procession
he
said
Here
permetiez
moi
to
assister
vous
to
a
pair
of
pretty
French
girls
who
giggled
and
allowed
him
to
escort
them
inside
george
was
left
to
deal
with
the
middle-aged
witches
and
Ron
took
charge
of
mr.
Weasleys
old
ministry-colleague
Perkins
while
a
rather
deaf
old
couple
fell
to
Harrys
lot
wotcher
said
a
familiar
voice
as
he
came
out
of
the
marquee
again
and
found
Tonks
and
Lupin
at
the
front
of
the
queue
she
had
turned
blonde
for
the
occasion
arthur
told
us
you
were
the
one
with
the
curly
hair
sorry
about
last
night
she
added
in
a
whisper
as
Harry
led
them
up
the
aisle
the
Ministrys
being
very
anti-werewolf
at
the
museum
and
we
thought
our
presence
might
not
do
you
any
favors
its
fine
I
understand
said
Harry
speaking
more
to
Lupin
than
Tonks
lupin
gave
him
a
swift
smile
but
as
they
turned
away
Harry
saw
Lupins
face
fall
again
into
lines
of
misery
he
did
not
understand
it
but
there
was
no
time
to
dwell
on
the
matter
hagrid
was
causing
a
certain
amount
of
disruption
having
misunderstood
Freds
directions
as
he
had
sat
himself
not
upon
the
magically
enlarged
and
reinforced
seat
set
aside
for
him
in
the
back
row
but
on
five
sets
that
now
resembled
a
large
pile
of
golden
matchsticks
while
mr.
Weasley
repaired
the
damage
and
Hagrid
shouted
apologies
to
anybody
who
would
listen
Harry
hurried
back
to
the
entrance
to
find
Ron
face-to-face
with
a
most
eccentric-looking
wizard
slightly
cross-eyed
with
shoulder-length
white
hair
the
texture
of
candyfloss
he
wore
a
cap
whose
tassel
dangled
in
front
of
his
nose
and
robes
of
an
eye-watering
shade
of
egg-yolk
yellow
an
odd
symbol
rather
like
a
triangular
eye
glistened
from
a
golden
chain
around
his
neck
xenophilius
Lovegood
he
said
extending
a
hand
to
Harry
my
daughter
and
I
live
just
over
the
hill
so
kind
of
the
good
Weasleys
to
invite
us
but
I
think
you
know
my
Luna
he
added
to
Ron
yes
said
Ron
isnt
she
with
you
she
lingered
in
that
charming
little
garden
to
say
hello
to
the
gnomes
such
a
glorious
infestation
how
few
wizards
realize
just
how
much
we
can
learn
from
the
wise
little
gnomes
or
to
give
them
their
correct
name
the
Gernumbli
gardensi
ours
do
know
a
lot
of
excellent
swear
words
said
Ron
but
I
think
Fred
and
George
taught
them
those
he
led
a
party
of
warlocks
into
the
marquee
as
Luna
rushed
up
hello
Harry
she
said
er
my
names
Barry
said
Harry
flummoxed
oh
have
you
changed
that
too
she
asked
brightly
how
did
you
know
oh
just
your
expression
she
said
like
her
father
Luna
was
wearing
bright
yellow
robes
which
she
had
accessorized
with
a
large
sunflower
in
her
hair
once
you
get
over
the
brightness
of
it
all
the
general
effect
was
quite
pleasant
at
least
there
were
no
radishes
dangling
from
her
ears
xenophilius
who
was
deep
in
conversation
with
an
acquaintance
had
missed
the
exchange
between
Luna
and
Harry
biding
the
wizard
farewell
he
turned
to
his
daughter
who
held
up
her
finger
and
said
Daddy
look
one
of
the
gnomes
actually
bit
me
how
wonderful
gnome
saliva
is
enormously
beneficial
said
mr.
Lovegood
seizing
Lunas
outstretched
fingers
and
examining
the
bleeding
puncture
marks
luna
my
love
if
you
should
feel
any
burgeoning
talent
today
perhaps
an
unexpected
urge
to
sing
opera
or
to
declaims
in
Mermish
do
not
repress
it
you
may
have
been
gifted
by
the
Gernumblies
ron
passing
them
in
the
opposite
direction
let
out
a
loud
snort
ron
can
laugh
said
Luna
serenely
as
Harry
led
her
and
Xenophilius
toward
their
seats
but
my
father
has
done
a
lot
of
research
on
Gernumbli
magic
really
said
Harry
who
had
long
since
decided
not
to
challenge
Luna
or
her
fathers
peculiar
views
are
you
sure
you
dont
want
to
put
anything
on
that
bite
though
oh
its
fine
said
Luna
sucking
her
finger
in
a
dreamy
fashion
and
looking
Harry
up
and
down
you
look
smart
i
told
Daddy
most
people
would
probably
wear
dress
robes
but
he
believes
you
ought
to
wear
sun
colors
to
a
wedding
for
luck
you
know
as
she
drifted
off
after
her
father
Ron
reappeared
with
an
elderly
witch
clutching
his
arm
her
beaky
nose
red-rimmed
eyes
and
leathery
pink
hat
gave
her
the
look
of
a
bad-tempered
flamingo
and
your
hairs
much
too
long
Ronald
for
a
moment
I
thought
you
were
Ginevra
merlins
beard
what
is
Xenophilius
Lovegood
wearing
he
looks
like
an
omelet
and
who
are
you
she
barked
at
Harry
oh
yeah
Auntie
Muriel
this
is
our
cousin
Barny
another
Weasley
you
breed
like
gnomes
isnt
Harry
Potter
here
i
was
hoping
to
meet
him
i
thought
he
was
a
friend
of
yours
Ronald
or
have
you
merely
been
boasting
no
he
couldnt
come
hmm
made
an
excuse
did
he
not
as
gormless
as
he
looks
in
press
photographs
then
ive
just
been
instructing
the
bride
on
how
best
to
wear
my
tiara
she
shouted
at
Harry
goblin-made
you
know
and
been
in
my
family
for
centuries
shes
a
good-looking
girl
but
still
French
well
well
find
me
a
good
seat
Ronald
I
am
a
hundred
and
seven
and
I
ought
not
to
be
on
my
feet
too
long
ron
gave
Harry
a
meaningful
look
as
he
passed
and
did
not
reappear
for
some
time
when
next
they
met
at
the
entrance
Harry
had
shown
a
dozen
more
people
to
their
places
the
Marquee
was
nearly
full
now
and
for
the
first
time
there
was
no
queue
outside
nightmare
Muriel
is
said
Ron
mopping
his
forehead
on
his
sleeve
she
used
to
come
for
Christmas
every
year
then
thank
God
she
took
offense
because
Fred
and
George
set
off
a
Dungbomb
under
her
chair
at
diner
dad
always
says
shell
have
written
them
out
of
her
will
like
they
care
theyre
going
to
end
up
richer
than
anyone
in
the
family
rate
theyre
going
wow
he
added
blinking
rather
rapidly
as
Hermione
came
hurrying
toward
them
you
look
great
always
the
tone
of
surprise
said
Hermione
though
she
smiled
she
was
wearing
a
floaty
lilac-colored
dress
with
matching
high
heels
her
hair
was
sleek
and
shiny
your
Great-Aunt
Muriel
doesnt
agree
I
just
met
her
upstairs
while
she
was
giving
Fleur
the
tiara
she
said
Oh
dear
is
this
the
muggle-born
and
then
Bad
posture
and
skinny
ankles
dont
take
it
personally
shes
rude
to
everyone
said
Ron
talking
about
Muriel
inquired
George
reemerging
from
the
marquee
with
Fred
yeah
shes
just
told
me
my
ears
are
lopsided
old
bat
i
wish
old
Uncle
Bilius
was
still
with
us
though
he
was
a
right
laugh
at
weddings
wasnt
he
the
one
who
saw
a
Grim
and
died
twenty-four
hours
later
asked
Hermione
well
yeah
he
went
a
bit
odd
toward
the
end
conceded
George
but
before
he
went
loopy
he
was
the
life
and
soul
of
the
party
said
Fred
he
used
to
down
an
entire
bottle
of
firewhisky
then
run
onto
the
dance
floor
hoist
up
his
robes
and
start
pulling
bunches
of
flowers
out
of
his
yes
he
sounds
a
real
charmer
said
Hermione
while
Harry
roared
with
laughter
never
married
for
some
reason
said
Ron
you
amaze
me
said
Hermione
they
were
all
laughing
so
much
that
none
of
them
noticed
the
latecomer
a
dark-haired
young
man
with
a
large
curved
nose
and
thick
black
eyebrows
until
he
held
out
his
invitation
to
Ron
and
said
with
his
eyes
on
Hermione
You
look
vunderful
viktor
she
shrieked
and
dropped
her
small
beaded
bag
which
made
a
loud
thump
quite
disproportionate
to
its
size
as
she
scrambled
blushing
to
pick
it
up
she
said
I
didnt
know
you
were
goodness
its
lovely
to
see
how
are
you
rons
ears
had
turned
bright
red
again
after
glancing
at
Krums
invitation
as
if
he
did
not
believe
a
word
of
it
he
said
much
too
loudly
how
come
youre
here
fleur
invited
me
said
Krum
eyebrows
raised
harry
who
had
no
grudge
against
Krum
shook
hands
then
feeling
that
it
would
be
prudent
to
remove
Krum
from
Rons
vicinity
offered
to
show
him
his
seat
your
friend
is
not
pleased
to
see
me
said
Krum
as
they
entered
the
now
packed
marquee
or
is
he
a
relative
he
added
with
a
glance
at
Harrys
red
curly
hair
cousin
harry
muttered
but
Krum
was
not
really
listening
his
appearance
was
causing
a
stir
particularly
amongst
the
veela
cousins
He
was
after
all
a
famous
Quidditch
player
while
people
were
still
craning
their
necks
to
get
a
good
look
at
him
Ron
Hermione
Fred
and
George
came
hurrying
down
the
aisle
time
to
sit
down
Fred
told
Harry
or
were
going
to
get
run
over
by
the
bride
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
took
their
seats
in
the
second
row
behind
Fred
and
George
hermione
looked
rather
pink
and
Rons
ears
were
still
scarlet
after
a
few
moments
he
muttered
to
Harry
Did
you
see
hes
grown
a
stupid
little
beard
harry
gave
a
noncommittal
grunt
a
sense
of
jittery
anticipation
had
filled
the
warm
tent
the
general
murmuring
broken
by
occasional
spurts
of
excited
laughter
mr.
and
Mrs
weasley
strolled
up
the
aisle
smiling
and
waving
at
relatives
Mrs
weasley
was
wearing
a
brand-new
set
of
amethyst
colored
robes
with
a
matching
hat
a
moment
later
Bill
and
Charlie
stood
up
at
the
front
of
the
marquee
both
wearing
dress
robes
with
larger
white
roses
in
their
buttonholes
Fred
wolf-whistled
and
there
was
an
outbreak
of
giggling
from
the
veela
cousins
then
the
crowd
fell
silent
as
music
swelled
from
what
seemed
to
be
the
golden
balloons
ooooh
said
Hermione
swiveling
around
in
her
seat
to
look
at
the
entrance
a
great
collective
sigh
issued
from
the
assembled
witches
and
wizards
as
Monsieur
Delacour
and
Fleur
came
walking
up
the
aisle
Fleur
gliding
Monsieur
Delacour
bouncing
and
beaming
fleur
was
wearing
a
very
simple
white
dress
and
seemed
to
be
emitting
a
strong
silvery
glow
while
her
radiance
usually
dimmed
everyone
else
by
comparison
today
it
beautified
everybody
it
fell
upon
ginny
and
Gabrielle
both
wearing
golden
dresses
looked
even
prettier
than
usual
and
once
Fleur
had
reached
for
him
Bill
did
not
look
as
though
he
had
ever
met
Fenrit
Greyback
ladies
and
gentlemen
said
a
slightly
singsong
voice
and
with
a
slight
shock
Harry
saw
the
same
small
tufty-hired
wizard
who
had
presided
at
Dumbledores
funeral
now
standing
in
front
of
Bill
and
Fleur
we
are
gathered
here
today
to
celebrate
the
union
of
two
faithful
souls
yes
my
tiara
set
off
the
whole
thing
nicely
said
Auntie
Muriel
in
a
rather
carrying
whisper
but
I
must
say
Ginevras
dress
is
far
too
low
cut
ginny
glanced
around
grinning
winked
at
Harry
then
quickly
faced
the
front
again
harrys
mind
wandered
a
long
way
from
the
marquee
back
to
the
afternoons
spent
alone
with
Ginny
in
lonely
parts
of
the
school
grounds
they
seemed
so
long
ago
they
had
always
seemed
too
good
to
be
true
as
though
he
had
been
stealing
shining
hours
from
a
normal
persons
life
a
person
without
a
lightning-shaped
scar
on
his
forehead
do
you
William
Arthur
take
Fleur
Isabelle
in
the
front
row
Mrs
weasley
and
Madame
Delacour
were
both
sobbing
quietly
into
scraps
of
lace
trumpetlike
sounds
from
the
back
of
the
marquee
told
everyone
that
Hagrid
had
taken
out
one
of
his
own
tablecloth-sized
handkerchiefs
hermione
turned
around
and
beamed
at
Harry
her
eyes
too
were
full
of
tears
then
I
declare
you
bonded
for
life
the
tufty-haired
wizard
waved
his
hand
high
over
the
heads
of
Bill
and
Fleur
and
a
shower
of
silver
stars
fell
upon
them
spiraling
around
their
now
entwined
figures
as
Fred
and
George
led
a
round
of
applause
the
golden
balloons
overhead
burst
birds
of
paradise
and
tiny
golden
bells
flew
and
floated
out
of
them
adding
their
songs
and
chimes
to
the
din
ladies
and
gentlemen
called
the
tufty-haired
wizard
if
you
would
please
stand
up
they
all
did
so
Auntie
Muriel
grumbling
audibly
he
waved
his
wand
again
the
scars
on
which
they
had
been
sitting
rose
gracefully
into
the
air
as
the
canvas
walls
of
the
marquee
vanished
so
that
they
stood
beneath
a
canopy
supported
by
golden
poles
with
a
glorious
view
of
the
sunlit
orchard
and
surrounding
countryside
next
a
pool
of
molten
gold
spread
from
the
center
of
the
tent
to
form
a
gleaming
dance
floor
the
hovering
chairs
grouped
themselves
around
small
white-clothed
tables
which
all
floated
gracefully
back
to
earth
round
it
and
the
golden-jacketed
hand
trooped
toward
a
podium
smooth
said
Ron
approvingly
as
the
waiters
popped
up
on
all
sides
some
hearing
silver
trays
of
pumpkin
juice
butterbeer
and
firewhisky
others
tottering
piles
of
tarts
and
sandwiches
we
should
go
and
congratulate
them
said
Hermione
standing
on
tiptoe
to
see
the
place
where
Bill
and
Fleur
had
vanished
amid
a
crowd
of
well-wishers
well
have
time
later
shrugged
Ron
snatching
three
butterbeers
from
a
passing
tray
and
handing
one
to
Harry
hermione
cop
hold
lets
grab
a
table
not
there
nowhere
near
Muriel
ron
led
the
way
across
the
empty
dance
floor
glancing
left
and
right
as
he
went
Harry
felt
sure
that
he
was
keeping
an
eye
out
for
Krum
by
the
time
they
had
reached
the
other
side
of
the
marquee
most
of
the
tables
were
occupied
The
emptiest
was
the
one
where
Luna
sat
alone
all
right
if
we
join
you
asked
Ron
oh
yes
she
said
happily
daddys
just
gone
to
give
Bill
and
Fleur
our
present
what
is
it
a
lifetimes
supply
of
Gurdyroots
asked
Ron
hermione
aimed
a
kick
at
him
under
the
table
but
caught
Harry
instead
eyes
watering
in
pain
Harry
lost
track
of
the
conversation
for
a
few
moments
the
band
had
begun
to
play
Bill
and
Fleur
took
to
the
dance
floor
first
to
great
applause
after
a
while
mr.
Weasley
led
Madame
Delacour
onto
the
floor
followed
by
mr.
Weasley
and
Fleurs
father
i
like
this
song
said
Luna
swaying
in
time
to
the
waltzlike
tune
and
a
few
seconds
later
she
stood
up
and
glided
onto
the
dance
floor
where
she
revolved
on
the
spot
quite
alone
eyes
closed
and
waving
her
arms
shes
great
isnt
she
said
Ron
admiringly
always
good
value
but
the
smile
vanished
from
his
face
at
once
Viktor
Krum
had
dropped
into
Lunas
vacant
seat
hermione
looked
pleasurably
flustered
but
this
time
Krum
had
not
come
to
compliment
her
with
a
scowl
on
his
face
he
said
Who
is
that
man
in
the
yellow
thats
Xenophilius
Lovegood
hes
the
father
of
a
friend
of
ours
said
Ron
his
pugnacious
tone
indicated
that
they
were
not
about
to
laugh
at
Xenophilius
despite
the
clear
provocation
come
and
dance
he
added
abruptly
to
Hermione
she
looked
taken
aback
but
pleased
too
and
got
up
they
vanished
together
into
the
growing
throng
on
the
dance
floor
ah
they
are
together
now
asked
Krum
momentarily
distracted
er
sort
of
said
Harry
who
are
you
krum
asked
barny
Weasley
they
shook
hands
you
Barny
you
know
this
man
Lovegood
well
no
I
only
met
him
today
why
krum
glowered
over
the
top
of
his
drink
watching
Xenophilius
who
was
chatting
to
several
warlocks
on
the
other
side
of
the
dance
floor
because
said
Krum
If
he
vus
not
a
guest
of
Fleurs
I
vould
dud
him
here
and
now
for
veering
that
filthy
sign
upon
his
chest
sign
said
Harry
looking
over
at
Xenophilius
too
the
strange
triangular
eye
was
gleaming
on
his
chest
why
whats
wrong
with
it
grindelvald
that
is
Grindelvalds
sign
grindelwald
the
Dark
wizard
Dumbledore
defeated
exactly
krums
jaw
muscles
worked
as
if
he
were
chewing
then
he
said
Grindelvald
killed
many
people
my
grandfather
for
instance
of
course
he
vos
never
powerful
in
this
country
they
said
he
feared
Dumbledore
and
rightly
seeing
how
he
vos
finished
but
this
he
pointed
a
finger
at
Xenophilius
this
is
his
symbol
I
recognized
it
at
vunce
Grindelvald
carved
it
into
a
vall
at
Durmstrang
ver
he
vos
a
pupil
there
some
idiots
copied
it
onto
their
books
and
clothes
thinking
to
shock
make
themselves
impressive
until
those
of
us
who
had
lost
family
members
to
Grindelvald
taught
them
better
krum
cracked
his
knuckles
menacingly
and
glowered
at
Xenophilius
harry
felt
perplexed
it
seemed
incredibly
unlikely
that
Lunas
father
was
a
supporter
of
the
Dark
Arts
and
nobody
else
in
the
tent
seemed
to
have
recognized
the
triangular
finlike
shape
are
you
er
quite
sure
its
Grindelwalds
i
am
not
mistaken
said
Krum
coldly
i
walked
past
that
sign
for
several
years
I
know
it
vell
well
theres
a
chance
said
Harry
that
Xenophilius
doesnt
actually
know
what
the
symbol
means
the
Lovegoods
are
quite
unusual
he
could
have
easily
picked
it
up
somewhere
and
think
its
a
cross
section
of
the
head
of
a
Crumple-Horned
Snorkack
or
something
the
cross
section
of
a
vot
well
I
dont
know
what
they
are
but
apparently
he
and
his
daughter
go
on
holiday
looking
for
them
harry
felt
he
was
doing
a
bad
job
explaining
Luna
and
her
father
thats
her
he
said
pointing
at
Luna
who
was
still
dancing
alone
waving
her
arms
around
her
head
like
someone
attempting
to
beat
off
midges
vy
is
she
doing
that
asked
Krum
probably
trying
to
get
rid
of
a
Wrackspurt
said
Harry
who
recognized
the
symptoms
krum
did
not
seem
to
know
whether
or
not
Harry
was
making
fun
of
him
he
drew
his
hand
from
inside
his
robe
and
tapped
it
menacingly
on
his
thighs
sparks
flew
out
of
the
end
gregorovitch
said
Harry
loudly
and
Krum
started
but
Harry
was
too
excited
to
care
the
memory
had
come
back
to
him
at
the
sight
of
Krums
wand
Ollivander
taking
it
and
examining
it
carefully
before
the
Triwizard
Tournament
vot
about
him
asked
Krum
suspiciously
hes
a
wandmaker
i
know
that
said
Krum
he
made
your
wand
thats
why
I
thought
Quidditch
krum
was
looking
more
and
more
suspicious
how
do
you
know
Gregorovitch
made
my
wand
i
read
it
somewhere
I
think
said
Harry
in
a
a
fan
magazine
he
improvised
wildly
and
Krum
looked
mollified
i
had
not
realized
I
ever
discussed
my
vand
with
fans
he
said
so
er
where
is
Gregorowitch
these
days
krum
looked
puzzled
he
retired
several
years
ago
i
was
one
of
the
last
to
purchase
a
Gregorovitch
vand
they
are
the
best
although
I
know
of
course
that
your
Britons
set
much
store
by
Ollivander
harry
did
not
answer
he
pretended
to
watch
the
dancers
like
Krum
but
he
was
thinking
hard
so
Voldemort
was
looking
for
a
celebrated
wandmaker
and
Harry
did
not
have
to
search
far
for
a
reason
it
was
surely
because
of
what
Harry
wand
had
done
on
the
night
that
Voldemort
pursued
him
across
the
skies
the
holly
and
phoenix
feather
wand
had
conquered
the
borrowed
wand
some
thing
that
Ollivander
had
not
anticipated
or
understood
would
Gregorowitch
know
better
was
he
truly
more
skilled
than
Ollivander
did
he
know
secrets
of
wands
that
Ollivander
did
not
this
girl
is
very
nice-looking
Krum
said
recalling
Harry
to
his
surroundings
krum
was
pointing
at
Ginny
who
had
just
joined
Luna
she
is
also
a
relative
of
yours
yeah
said
Harry
suddenly
irritated
and
shes
seeing
someone
jealous
type
big
bloke
you
wouldnt
want
to
cross
him
krum
grunted
vot
he
said
draining
his
goblet
and
getting
to
his
feet
again
is
the
point
of
being
an
international
Quidditch
player
if
all
the
good-looking
girls
are
taken
and
he
strode
off
leaving
Harry
to
take
a
sandwich
from
a
passing
waiter
and
make
his
way
around
the
edge
of
the
crowded
dance
floor
he
wanted
to
find
Ron
to
tell
him
about
Gregorovitch
but
he
was
dancing
with
Hermione
out
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
harry
leaned
up
against
one
of
the
golden
pillars
and
watched
Ginny
who
was
now
dancing
with
Fred
and
Georges
friend
Lee
Jordan
trying
not
to
feel
resentful
about
the
promise
he
had
given
Ron
he
had
never
been
to
a
wedding
before
so
he
could
not
judge
how
Wizarding
celebrations
differed
from
Muggle
ones
though
he
was
pretty
sure
that
the
latter
would
not
involve
a
wedding
cake
topped
with
two
model
phoenixes
that
took
flight
when
the
cake
was
cut
or
bottles
of
champagne
that
floated
unsupported
through
the
crowd
as
the
evening
drew
in
and
moths
began
to
swoop
under
the
canopy
now
lit
with
floating
golden
lanterns
the
revelry
became
more
and
more
uncontained
fred
and
George
had
long
since
disappeared
into
the
darkness
with
a
pair
of
Fleurs
cousins
Charlie
Hagrid
and
a
squat
wizard
in
a
purple
porkpie
hat
were
singing
Odo
the
Hero
in
the
corner
wandering
through
the
crowd
so
as
to
escape
a
drunken
uncle
of
Rons
who
seemed
unsure
whether
or
not
Harry
was
his
son
Harry
spotted
an
old
wizard
sitting
alone
at
a
table
his
cloud
of
white
hair
made
him
look
rather
like
an
aged
dandelion
clock
and
was
topped
by
a
moth-eaten
fez
he
was
vaguely
familiar
Racking
his
brains
Harry
suddenly
realized
that
this
was
Elphias
Doge
member
of
the
Order
of
the
Phoenix
and
the
writer
of
Dumbledores
obituary
harry
approached
him
may
I
sit
down
of
course
of
course
said
Doge
he
had
a
rather
high-pitched
wheezy
voice
harry
leaned
in
mr.
Doge
Im
Harry
Potter
doge
gasped
my
dear
boy
arthur
told
me
you
were
here
disguised
i
am
so
glad
so
honored
in
a
flutter
of
nervous
pleasure
Doge
poured
Harry
a
goblet
of
champagne
i
thought
of
writing
to
you
he
whispered
after
Dumbledore
the
shock
and
for
you
I
am
sure
doges
tiny
eyes
filled
with
sudden
tears
i
saw
the
obituary
you
wrote
for
the
Daily
Prophet
said
Harry
i
didnt
realize
you
knew
Professor
Dumbledore
so
well
as
well
as
anyone
said
Doge
dabbing
his
eyes
with
a
napkin
certainly
I
knew
him
longest
if
you
dont
count
Aberforth
and
somehow
people
never
do
seem
to
count
Aberforth
speaking
of
the
Daily
Prophet
i
dont
know
whether
you
saw
mr.
Doge
oh
please
call
me
Elphias
dear
boy
elphias
I
dont
know
whether
you
saw
the
interview
Rita
Skeeter
gave
about
Dumbledore
doges
face
flooded
with
angry
color
oh
yes
Harry
I
saw
it
that
woman
or
vulture
might
be
a
more
accurate
term
positively
pestered
me
to
talk
to
her
I
am
ashamed
to
say
that
I
became
rather
rude
called
her
an
interfering
trout
which
resulted
as
you
my
have
seen
in
aspersions
cast
upon
my
sanity
well
in
that
interview
Harry
went
on
Rita
Skeeter
hinted
that
Professor
Dumbledore
was
involved
in
the
Dark
Arts
when
he
was
young
dont
believe
a
word
of
it
said
Doge
at
once
not
a
word
Harry
let
nothing
tarnish
your
memories
of
Albus
Dumbledore
harry
looked
into
Doges
earnest
pained
face
and
felt
not
reassured
but
frustrated
did
Doge
really
think
it
was
that
easy
that
Harry
could
simply
choose
not
to
believe
didnt
Doge
understand
Harrys
need
to
be
sure
to
know
everything
perhaps
Doge
suspected
Harrys
feelings
for
he
looked
concerned
and
hurried
on
Harry
Rita
Skeeter
is
a
dreadful
but
he
was
interrupted
by
a
shrill
cackle
rita
Skeeter
oh
I
love
her
always
read
her
harry
and
Doge
looked
up
to
see
Auntie
Muriel
standing
there
the
plumes
dancing
on
her
hair
a
goblet
of
champagne
in
her
hand
shes
written
a
book
about
Dumbledore
you
know
hello
Muriel
said
Doge
Yes
we
were
just
discussing
you
there
give
me
your
chair
Im
a
hundred
and
seven
another
redheaded
Weasley
cousin
jumped
off
his
seat
looking
alarmed
and
Auntie
Muriel
swung
it
around
with
surprising
strength
and
plopped
herself
down
upon
it
between
Doge
and
Harry
hello
again
Barry
or
whatever
your
name
is
she
said
to
Harry
Now
what
were
you
saying
about
Rita
Skeeter
Elphias
you
know
shes
written
a
biography
of
Dumbledore
i
cant
wait
to
read
it
i
must
remember
to
place
an
order
at
Flourish
and
Blotts
doge
looked
stiff
and
solemn
at
this
but
Auntie
Muriel
drained
her
goblet
and
clicked
her
bony
fingers
at
a
passing
waiter
for
a
replacement
she
took
another
large
gulp
of
champagne
belched
and
then
said
Theres
no
need
to
look
like
a
pair
of
stuffed
frogs
before
he
became
so
respected
and
respectable
and
all
that
tosh
there
were
some
mighty
funny
rumors
about
Albus
ill-informed
sniping
said
Doge
turning
radish-colored
again
you
would
say
that
Elphias
cackled
Auntie
Muriel
i
noticed
how
you
skated
over
the
sticky
patches
in
that
obituary
of
yours
im
sorry
you
think
so
said
Doge
more
coldly
still
i
assure
you
I
was
writing
from
the
heart
oh
we
all
know
you
worshipped
Dumbledore
I
daresay
youll
still
think
he
was
a
saint
even
if
it
does
turn
out
that
he
did
away
with
his
Squib
sister
muriel
exclaimed
Doge
a
chill
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
iced
champagne
was
stealing
through
Harrys
chest
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
Muriel
who
said
his
sister
was
a
Squib
i
thought
she
was
ill
thought
wrong
then
didnt
you
Barry
said
Auntie
Muriel
looking
delighted
at
the
effect
she
had
produced
anyway
how
could
you
expect
to
know
anything
about
it
it
all
happened
years
and
years
before
you
were
even
thought
of
my
dear
and
the
truth
is
that
those
of
us
who
were
alive
then
never
knew
what
really
happened
thats
why
I
cant
wait
to
find
out
what
Skeeters
unearthed
dumbledore
kept
that
sister
of
his
quiet
for
a
long
time
untrue
wheezed
Doge
Absolutely
untrue
he
never
told
me
his
sister
as
a
Squib
said
Harry
without
thinking
still
cold
inside
and
why
on
earth
would
he
tell
you
screeched
Muriel
swaying
a
little
in
her
seat
as
she
attempted
to
focus
upon
Harry
the
reason
Albus
never
spoke
about
Ariana
began
Elphias
in
a
voice
stiff
with
emotion
is
I
should
have
thought
quite
clear
he
was
so
devastated
by
her
death
why
did
nobody
ever
see
her
Elphias
squawked
Muriel
Why
did
half
of
us
never
even
know
she
existed
until
they
carried
the
coffin
out
of
the
house
and
held
a
funeral
for
her
where
was
saintly
Albus
while
Ariana
was
locked
in
the
cellar
off
being
brilliant
at
Hogwarts
and
never
mind
what
was
going
on
in
his
own
house
what
dyou
mean
locked
in
the
cellar
asked
Harry
what
is
this
doge
looked
wretched
auntie
Muriel
cackled
again
and
answered
Harry
dumbledores
mother
was
a
terrifying
woman
simply
terrifying
muggle-born
though
I
heard
she
pretended
otherwise
she
never
pretended
anything
of
the
sort
kendra
was
a
fine
woman
whispered
Doge
miserably
but
Auntie
Muriel
ignored
him
proud
and
very
domineering
the
sort
of
witch
who
would
have
been
mortified
to
produce
a
Squib
ariana
was
not
a
Squib
wheezed
Doge
so
you
say
Elphias
but
explain
then
why
she
never
attended
Hogwarts
said
Auntie
Muriel
she
turned
back
to
Harry
in
our
day
Squibs
were
often
hushed
up
thought
to
take
it
to
the
extreme
of
actually
imprisoning
a
little
girl
in
the
house
and
pretending
she
didnt
exist
i
tell
you
thats
not
what
happened
said
Doge
but
Auntie
Muriel
steamrollered
on
still
addressing
Harry
squibs
were
usually
shipped
off
to
Muggle
schools
and
encouraged
to
integrate
into
the
Muggle
community
much
kinder
than
trying
to
find
them
a
place
in
the
Wizarding
world
where
they
must
always
be
second
class
but
naturally
Kendra
Dumbledore
wouldnt
have
dreamed
of
letting
her
daughter
go
to
a
Muggle
school
ariana
was
delicate
said
Doge
desperately
her
health
was
always
too
poor
to
permit
her
to
permit
her
to
leave
the
house
cackled
Muriel
and
yet
she
was
never
taken
to
st.
Mungos
and
no
Healer
was
ever
summoned
to
see
her
really
Muriel
how
can
you
possibly
know
whether
for
your
information
Elphias
my
cousin
Lancelot
was
a
Healer
at
st.
Mungos
at
the
time
and
he
told
my
family
in
strictest
confidence
that
Ariana
had
never
been
seen
there
all
most
suspicious
Lancelot
thought
doge
looked
to
be
on
the
verge
of
tears
auntie
Muriel
who
seemed
to
be
enjoying
herself
hugely
snapped
her
fingers
for
more
champagne
numbly
Harry
thought
of
how
the
Dursleys
had
once
shut
him
up
locked
him
away
kept
him
out
of
sight
all
for
the
crime
of
being
a
wizard
had
Dumbledores
sister
suffered
the
same
fate
in
reverse
imprisoned
for
her
lack
of
magic
and
had
Dumbledore
truly
left
her
to
her
fate
while
he
went
off
to
Hogwarts
to
prove
himself
brilliant
and
talented
now
if
Kendra
hadnt
died
first
Muriel
resumed
Id
have
said
that
it
was
she
who
finished
off
Ariana
how
can
you
Muriel
groaned
Doge
a
mother
kill
her
own
daughter
think
what
youre
saying
if
the
mother
in
question
was
capable
of
imprisoning
her
daughter
for
years
on
end
why
not
shrugged
Auntie
Muriel
but
as
I
say
it
doesnt
fit
because
Kendra
died
before
Ariana
of
what
nobody
ever
seemed
sure
yes
Ariana
might
have
made
a
desperate
bid
for
freedom
and
killed
Kendra
in
the
struggle
said
Auntie
Muriel
thoughtfully
shake
your
head
all
you
like
Elphias
you
were
at
Arianas
funeral
were
you
not
yes
I
was
said
Doge
through
trembling
lips
and
a
more
desperately
sad
occasion
I
cannot
remember
albus
was
heartbroken
his
heart
wasnt
the
only
thing
didnt
Aberforth
break
Albus
nose
halfway
through
the
service
if
Doge
had
looked
horrified
before
this
it
was
nothing
to
how
he
looked
now
muriel
might
have
stabbed
him
she
cackled
loudly
and
took
another
swig
of
champagne
which
dribbled
down
her
chin
how
do
you
croaked
Doge
my
mother
was
friendly
with
old
Bathilda
Bagshot
said
Auntie
Muriel
happily
bathilda
described
the
whole
thing
to
mother
while
I
was
listening
at
the
door
a
coffin-side
brawl
the
way
Bathilda
told
it
Aberforth
shouted
that
it
was
all
Albus
fault
that
Ariana
was
dead
and
then
punched
him
in
the
face
according
to
Bathilda
Albus
did
not
even
defend
himself
and
thats
odd
enough
in
itself
albus
could
have
destroyed
Aberforth
in
a
duel
with
both
hands
tied
behind
his
back
muriel
swigged
yet
more
champagne
the
recitation
of
those
old
scandals
seemed
to
elate
her
as
much
as
they
horrified
Doge
harry
did
not
know
what
to
think
what
to
believe
he
wanted
the
truth
and
yet
all
Doge
did
was
sit
there
and
bleat
feebly
that
Ariana
had
been
ill
harry
could
hardly
believe
that
Dumbledore
would
not
have
intervened
if
such
cruelty
was
happening
inside
his
own
house
and
yet
there
was
undoubtedly
something
odd
about
the
story
and
Ill
tell
you
something
else
Muriel
said
hiccupping
slightly
as
she
lowered
her
goblet
i
think
Bathilda
has
spilled
the
beans
to
Rita
Skeeter
all
those
hints
in
Skeeters
interview
about
an
important
source
close
to
the
Dumbledores
goodness
knows
she
was
there
all
through
the
Ariana
business
and
it
would
fit
bathilda
would
never
talk
to
Rita
Skeeter
whispered
Doge
bathilda
Bagshot
harry
said
the
author
of
A
History
of
Magic
the
name
was
printed
on
the
front
of
one
of
Harrys
textbooks
though
admittedly
not
one
of
the
ones
he
had
read
more
attentively
yes
said
Doge
clutching
at
Harrys
question
like
a
drowning
man
at
a
life
heir
a
most
gifted
magical
historian
and
an
old
friend
of
Albuss
quite
gaga
these
days
Ive
heard
said
Auntie
Muriel
cheerfully
if
that
is
so
it
is
even
more
dishonorable
for
Skeeter
to
have
taken
advantage
of
her
said
Doge
and
no
reliance
can
be
placed
on
anything
Bathilda
may
have
said
oh
there
are
ways
of
bringing
back
memories
and
Im
sure
Rita
Skeeter
knows
them
all
said
Auntie
Muriel
But
even
if
Bathildas
completely
cuckoo
Im
sure
shed
still
have
old
photographs
maybe
even
letters
she
knew
the
Dumbledores
for
years
well
worth
a
trip
to
Godrics
Hollow
Id
have
thought
harry
who
had
been
taking
a
sip
of
butterbeer
choked
doge
banged
him
on
the
back
as
Harry
coughed
looking
at
Auntie
Muriel
through
streaming
eyes
once
he
had
control
of
his
voice
again
he
asked
Bathilda
Bagshot
lives
in
Godrics
Hollow
oh
yes
shes
been
there
forever
the
Dumbledores
moved
there
after
Percival
was
imprisoned
and
she
was
their
neighbor
the
Dumbledores
lived
in
Godrics
Hollows
yes
Barry
thats
what
I
just
said
said
Auntie
Muriel
testily
harry
felt
drained
empty
never
once
in
six
years
had
Dumbledore
told
Harry
that
they
had
both
lived
and
lost
loved
ones
in
Godrics
Hollow
why
were
Lily
and
James
buried
close
to
Dumbledores
mother
and
sister
had
Dumbledore
visited
their
graves
perhaps
walked
past
Lilys
and
Jamess
to
do
so
and
he
had
never
once
told
Harry
never
bothered
to
say
and
why
it
was
so
important
Harry
could
not
explain
even
to
himself
yet
he
felt
it
had
been
tantamount
to
a
lie
not
to
tell
him
that
they
had
this
place
and
these
experiences
in
common
he
stared
ahead
of
him
barely
noticing
what
was
going
on
around
him
and
did
not
realize
that
Hermione
had
appeared
out
of
the
crowd
until
she
drew
up
a
chair
beside
him
i
simply
cant
dance
anymore
she
panted
slipping
of
one
of
her
shoes
and
rubbing
the
sole
of
her
foot
rons
gone
looking
to
find
more
butterbeers
its
a
bit
odd
ive
just
seen
Viktor
storming
away
from
Lunas
father
it
looked
like
theyd
been
arguing
She
dropped
her
voice
staring
at
him
harry
are
you
okay
harry
did
not
know
where
to
begin
but
it
did
not
matter
at
that
moment
something
large
and
silver
came
falling
through
the
canopy
over
the
dance
floor
graceful
and
gleaming
the
lynx
landed
lightly
in
the
middle
of
the
astonished
dancers
heads
turned
as
those
nearest
it
froze
absurdly
in
mid-dance
then
the
Patronuss
mouth
opened
wide
and
it
spoke
in
the
loud
deep
slow
voice
of
Kingsley
Shacklebolt
the
Ministry
has
fallen
scrimgeour
is
dead
they
are
coming
chapter
Nine
a
Place
to
Hide
everything
seemed
fuzzy
slow
harry
and
Hermione
jumped
to
their
feet
and
drew
their
wands
many
people
were
only
just
realizing
that
something
strange
had
happened
heads
were
still
turning
toward
the
silver
cat
as
it
vanished
silence
spread
outward
in
cold
ripples
from
the
place
where
the
Patronus
had
landed
then
somebody
screamed
harry
and
Hermione
threw
themselves
into
the
panicking
crowd
guests
were
sprinting
in
all
directions
many
were
Disapparating
the
protective
enchantments
around
the
Burrow
had
broken
ron
hermione
cried
ron
where
are
you
as
they
pushed
their
way
across
the
dance
floor
Harry
saw
cloaked
and
masked
figures
appearing
in
the
crowd
then
he
saw
Lupin
and
Tonks
their
wands
raised
and
heard
both
of
them
shout
Protego
a
cry
that
was
echoed
on
all
sides
ron
ron
hermione
called
half
sobbing
as
she
and
Harry
were
buffered
by
terrified
guests
Harry
seized
her
hand
to
make
sure
they
werent
separated
as
a
streak
of
light
whizzed
over
their
heads
whether
a
protective
charm
or
something
more
sinister
he
did
not
know
and
then
Ron
was
there
he
caught
hold
of
Hermiones
free
arm
and
Harry
felt
her
turn
on
the
spot
sight
and
sound
were
extinguished
as
darkness
pressed
in
upon
him
all
he
could
feel
was
Hermiones
hand
as
he
was
squeezed
through
space
and
time
away
from
the
Burrow
away
from
the
descending
Death
Eaters
away
perhaps
from
Voldemort
himself
where
are
we
said
Rons
voice
harry
opened
his
eyes
for
a
moment
he
thought
they
had
not
left
the
wedding
after
all
They
still
seemed
to
be
surrounded
by
people
tottenham
Court
Road
panted
Hermione
walk
just
walk
we
need
to
find
somewhere
for
you
to
change
harry
did
as
she
asked
they
half
walked
half
ran
up
the
wide
dark
street
thronged
with
late-night
revelers
and
lined
with
closed
shops
stars
twinkling
above
them
a
double-decker
bus
rumbled
by
and
a
group
of
merry
pub-goers
ogled
them
as
they
passed
Harry
and
Ron
were
still
wearing
dress
robes
hermione
we
havent
got
anything
to
change
into
Ron
told
her
as
a
young
woman
burst
into
raucous
giggles
at
the
sight
of
him
why
didnt
I
make
sure
I
had
the
Invisibility
Cloak
with
me
said
Harry
inwardly
cursing
his
own
stupidity
all
last
year
I
kept
it
on
me
and
its
okay
Ive
got
the
Cloak
Ive
got
clothes
for
both
of
you
said
Hermione
Just
try
and
act
naturally
until
this
will
do
she
led
them
down
a
side
street
then
into
the
shelter
of
a
shadowy
alleyway
when
you
say
youve
got
the
Cloak
and
clothes
said
Harry
frowning
at
Hermione
who
was
carrying
nothing
except
her
small
beaded
handbag
in
which
she
was
now
rummaging
yes
theyre
here
said
Hermione
and
to
Harry
and
Rons
utter
astonishment
she
pulled
out
a
pair
of
jeans
a
sweatshirt
some
maroon
socks
and
finally
the
silvery
Invisibility
Cloak
how
the
ruddy
hell
undetectable
Extension
Charm
said
Hermione
tricky
but
I
think
Ive
done
it
okay
anyway
I
managed
to
fit
everything
we
need
in
here
she
gave
the
fragile-looking
bag
a
little
shake
and
it
echoed
like
a
cargo
hold
as
a
number
of
heavy
objects
rolled
around
inside
it
oh
damn
thatll
be
the
books
she
said
peering
into
it
and
I
had
them
all
stacked
by
subject
oh
well
harry
youd
better
take
the
Invisibility
Cloak
ron
hurry
up
and
change
when
did
you
do
all
this
harry
asked
as
Ron
stripped
off
his
robes
i
told
you
at
the
Burrow
Ive
had
the
essentials
packed
for
days
you
know
in
case
we
needed
to
make
a
quick
getaway
i
packed
your
rucksack
this
morning
Harry
after
you
changed
and
put
it
in
here
i
just
had
a
feeling
youre
amazing
you
are
said
Ron
handing
her
his
bundled-up
robes
thank
you
said
Hermione
managing
a
small
smile
as
she
pushed
the
robes
into
the
bag
please
Harry
get
that
Cloak
on
harry
threw
his
Invisibility
Cloak
around
his
shoulders
and
pulled
it
up
over
his
head
vanishing
from
sight
he
was
only
just
beginning
to
appreciate
what
had
happened
the
others
everybody
at
the
wedding
we
cant
worry
about
that
now
whispered
Hermione
its
you
theyre
after
Harry
and
well
just
put
everyone
in
even
more
danger
by
going
back
shes
right
said
Ron
who
seemed
to
know
that
Harry
was
about
to
argue
even
if
he
could
not
see
his
face
most
of
the
Order
was
there
theyll
look
after
everyone
harry
nodded
then
remembered
that
they
could
not
see
him
and
said
Yeah
but
he
thought
of
Ginny
and
fear
bubbled
like
acid
in
his
stomach
come
on
I
think
we
ought
to
keep
moving
said
Hermione
they
moved
back
up
the
side
street
and
onto
the
main
road
again
where
a
group
of
men
on
the
opposite
side
was
singing
and
weaving
across
the
pavement
just
as
a
matter
of
interest
why
Tottenham
Court
Road
ron
asked
Hermione
ive
no
idea
it
just
popped
into
my
head
but
Im
sure
were
safer
out
in
the
Muggle
world
its
not
where
theyll
expect
us
to
be
true
said
Ron
looking
around
but
dont
you
feel
a
bit
exposed
where
else
is
there
asked
Hermione
cringing
as
the
men
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
started
wolf-whistling
at
her
we
can
hardly
book
rooms
at
the
Leaky
Cauldron
can
we
and
Grimmauld
Place
is
out
if
Snape
can
get
in
there
i
suppose
we
could
try
my
parents
home
though
I
think
theres
a
chance
they
might
check
there
oh
I
wish
theyd
shut
up
all
right
darling
the
drunkest
of
the
men
on
the
other
pavement
was
yelling
fancy
a
drink
ditch
ginger
and
come
and
have
a
pint
lets
sit
down
somewhere
Hermione
said
hastily
as
Ron
opened
his
mouth
to
shout
back
across
the
road
look
this
will
do
in
here
it
was
a
small
and
shabby
all-night
caf
a
light
layer
of
grease
lay
on
all
the
formica-topped
tables
but
it
was
at
least
empty
harry
slipped
into
a
booth
first
and
Ron
sat
next
to
him
opposite
Hermione
who
had
her
back
to
the
entrance
and
did
not
like
it
She
glanced
over
her
shoulder
so
frequently
she
appeared
to
have
a
twitch
harry
did
not
like
being
stationary
walking
had
given
the
illusion
that
they
had
a
goal
beneath
the
Cloak
he
could
feel
the
last
vestiges
of
Polyjuice
leaving
him
his
hands
returning
to
their
usual
length
and
shape
he
pulled
his
glasses
out
of
his
pocket
and
put
them
on
again
after
a
minute
or
two
Ron
said
You
know
were
not
far
from
the
Leaky
Cauldron
here
its
only
in
Charing
Cross
ron
we
cant
said
Hermione
at
once
not
to
stay
there
but
to
find
out
whats
going
on
we
know
whats
going
on
voldemorts
taken
over
the
Ministry
what
else
do
we
need
to
know
okay
okay
it
was
just
an
idea
they
relapsed
into
a
prickly
silence
the
gum-chewing
waitress
shuffled
over
and
Hermione
ordered
two
cappuccinos
As
Harry
was
invisible
it
would
have
looked
odd
to
order
him
one
a
pair
of
burly
workmen
entered
the
caf
and
squeezed
into
the
next
booth
hermione
dropped
her
voice
to
a
whisper
i
say
we
find
a
quiet
place
to
Disapparate
and
head
for
the
countryside
once
were
there
we
could
send
a
message
to
the
Order
can
you
do
that
talking
Patronus
thing
then
asked
Ron
ive
been
practicing
and
I
think
so
said
Hermione
well
as
long
as
it
doesnt
get
them
into
trouble
though
they
mightve
been
arrested
already
god
thats
revolting
Ron
added
after
one
sip
of
the
foamy
grayish
coffee
the
waitress
had
heard
she
shot
Ron
a
nasty
look
as
she
shuffled
off
to
take
the
new
customers
orders
the
larger
of
the
two
workmen
who
was
blond
and
quite
huge
now
that
Harry
came
to
look
at
him
waved
her
away
she
stared
affronted
lets
get
going
then
I
dont
want
to
drink
this
muck
said
Ron
hermione
have
you
got
Muggle
money
to
pay
for
this
yes
I
took
out
all
my
Building
Society
savings
before
I
came
to
the
Burrow
ill
bet
all
the
change
is
at
the
bottom
sighed
Hermione
reaching
for
her
beaded
bag
the
two
workmen
made
identical
movements
and
Harry
mirrored
them
without
conscious
thought
All
three
of
them
drew
their
wands
ron
a
few
seconds
late
in
realizing
what
was
going
on
lunged
across
the
table
pushing
Hermione
sideways
onto
her
bench
the
force
of
the
Death
Eaters
spells
shattered
the
tiled
wall
where
Rons
head
had
just
been
as
Harry
still
invisible
yelled
Stupefy
the
great
blond
Death
Eater
was
hit
in
the
face
by
a
jet
of
red
light
He
slumped
sideways
unconscious
his
companion
unable
to
see
who
had
cast
the
spell
fired
another
at
Ron
Shining
black
ropes
flew
from
his
wand-tip
and
bound
Ron
head
to
foot
the
waitress
screamed
and
ran
for
the
door
Harry
sent
another
Stunning
Spell
at
the
Death
Eater
with
the
twisted
face
who
had
tied
up
Ron
but
the
spell
missed
rebounded
on
the
window
and
hit
the
waitress
who
collapsed
in
front
of
the
door
expulso
bellowed
the
Death
Eater
and
the
table
behind
which
Harry
was
standing
blew
up
The
force
of
the
explosion
slammed
him
into
the
wall
and
he
felt
his
wand
leave
his
hand
as
the
Cloak
slipped
off
him
petrificus
Totalus
screamed
Hermione
from
out
of
sight
and
the
Death
Eater
fell
forward
like
a
statue
to
land
with
a
crunching
thud
on
the
mess
of
broken
china
table
and
coffee
hermione
crawled
out
from
underneath
the
bench
shaking
bits
of
glass
ashtray
out
of
her
hair
and
trembling
all
over
d-diffindo
she
said
pointing
her
wand
at
Ron
who
roared
in
pain
as
she
slashed
open
the
knee
of
his
jeans
leaving
a
deep
cut
oh
Im
so
sorry
Ron
my
hands
shaking
diffindo
the
severed
ropes
fell
away
ron
got
to
his
feet
shaking
his
arms
to
regain
feeling
in
them
harry
picked
up
his
wand
and
climbed
over
all
the
debris
to
where
the
large
blond
Death
Eater
was
sprawled
across
the
bench
i
shouldve
recognized
him
he
was
there
the
night
Dumbledore
died
he
said
he
turned
over
the
darker
Death
Eater
with
his
foot
the
mans
eyes
moved
rapidly
between
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
thats
Dolohov
said
Ron
i
recognize
him
from
the
old
wanted
posters
i
think
the
big
ones
Thorfinn
Rowle
never
mind
what
theyre
called
said
Hermione
a
little
hysterically
how
did
they
find
us
what
are
we
going
to
do
somehow
her
panic
seemed
to
clear
Harrys
head
lock
the
door
he
told
her
and
Ron
turn
out
the
lights
he
looked
down
at
the
paralyzed
Dolohov
thinking
fast
as
the
lock
clicked
and
Ron
used
the
Deluminator
to
plunge
the
caf
into
darkness
harry
could
hear
the
men
who
had
jeered
at
Hermione
earlier
yelling
at
another
girl
in
the
distance
what
are
we
going
to
do
with
them
ron
whispered
to
Harry
through
the
dark
then
even
more
quietly
Kill
them
theyd
kill
us
they
had
a
good
go
just
now
hermione
shuddered
and
took
a
step
backward
harry
shook
his
head
we
just
need
to
wipe
their
memories
said
Harry
its
better
like
that
itll
throw
them
off
the
scent
if
we
killed
them
itd
be
obvious
we
were
here
youre
the
boss
said
Ron
sounding
profoundly
relieved
but
Ive
never
down
a
Memory
Charm
nor
have
I
said
Hermione
but
I
know
the
theory
she
took
a
deep
calming
breath
then
pointed
her
wand
at
Dolohovs
forehead
and
said
Obliviate
at
once
Dolohovs
eyes
became
unfocused
and
dreamy
brilliant
said
Harry
clapping
her
on
the
back
take
care
of
the
other
one
and
the
waitress
while
Ron
and
I
clear
up
clear
up
said
Ron
looking
around
at
the
partly
destroyed
caf
why
dont
you
think
they
might
wonder
whats
happened
if
they
wake
up
and
find
themselves
in
a
place
that
looks
like
its
just
been
bombed
oh
right
yeah
ron
struggled
for
a
moment
before
managing
to
extract
his
wand
from
his
pocket
its
no
wonder
I
cant
get
it
out
Hermione
you
packed
my
old
jeans
theyre
tight
oh
Im
so
sorry
hissed
Hermione
and
as
she
dragged
the
waitress
out
of
sight
of
the
windows
Harry
heard
her
mutter
a
suggestion
as
to
where
Ron
could
stick
his
wand
instead
once
the
caf
was
restored
to
its
previous
condition
they
heaved
the
Death
Eaters
back
into
their
booth
and
propped
them
up
facing
each
other
but
how
did
they
find
us
hermione
asked
looking
from
one
inert
man
to
the
other
how
did
they
know
where
we
were
she
turned
to
Harry
you
you
dont
think
youve
still
got
your
Trace
on
you
do
you
Harry
he
cant
have
said
Ron
the
Trace
breaks
at
seventeen
thats
Wizarding
law
you
cant
put
it
on
an
adult
as
far
as
you
know
said
Hermione
what
if
the
Death
Eaters
have
found
a
way
to
put
it
on
a
seventeen-year-old
but
Harry
hasnt
been
near
a
Death
Eater
in
the
last
twenty-four
hours
whos
supposed
to
have
put
a
Trace
back
on
him
hermione
did
not
reply
harry
felt
contaminated
tainted
Was
that
really
how
the
Death
Eaters
had
found
them
if
I
cant
use
magic
and
you
cant
use
magic
near
me
without
us
giving
away
our
position
he
began
were
not
splitting
up
said
Hermione
firmly
we
need
a
safe
place
to
hide
said
Ron
give
us
time
to
think
things
through
grimmauld
Place
said
Harry
the
other
two
gaped
dont
be
silly
Harry
Snape
can
get
in
there
rons
dad
said
theyve
put
up
jinxes
against
him
and
even
if
they
havent
worked
he
pressed
on
as
Hermione
began
to
argue
so
what
i
swear
Id
like
nothing
better
than
to
meet
Snape
but
hermione
where
else
is
there
its
the
best
chance
weve
got
snapes
only
one
Death
Eater
if
Ive
still
got
the
Trace
on
me
well
have
whole
crowds
of
them
on
us
wherever
else
we
go
she
could
not
argue
though
she
looked
as
if
she
would
have
liked
to
while
she
unlocked
the
caf
door
Ron
clicked
the
Deluminator
to
release
the
cafs
light
then
on
Harrys
count
of
three
they
reversed
the
spells
upon
their
three
victims
and
before
the
waitress
or
either
of
the
Death
Eaters
could
do
more
than
stir
sleepily
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
had
turned
on
the
spot
and
vanished
into
the
compressing
darkness
once
more
seconds
later
Harrys
lungs
expanded
gratefully
and
he
opened
his
eyes
They
were
now
standing
in
the
middle
of
a
familiar
small
and
shabby
square
tall
dilapidated
houses
looked
down
on
them
from
every
side
number
twelve
was
visible
to
them
for
they
had
been
told
of
its
existence
by
Dumbledore
its
Secret-Keeper
and
they
rushed
toward
it
checking
every
few
yards
that
they
were
not
being
followed
or
observed
they
raced
up
the
stone
steps
and
Harry
tapped
the
front
door
once
with
his
wand
they
heard
a
series
of
metallic
clicks
and
the
clatter
of
a
chain
then
the
door
swung
open
with
a
creak
and
they
hurried
over
the
threshold
as
Harry
closed
the
door
behind
them
the
old-fashioned
gas
lamps
sprang
into
life
casting
flickering
light
along
the
length
of
the
hallway
it
looked
just
as
Harry
remembered
it
eerie
cobwebbed
the
outlines
of
the
house-elf
heads
on
the
wall
throwing
odd
shadows
up
the
staircase
long
dark
curtains
concealed
the
portrait
of
Siriuss
mother
the
only
thing
that
was
out
of
place
was
the
trolls
leg
umbrella
stand
which
was
lying
on
its
side
as
if
Tonks
had
just
knocked
it
over
again
i
think
somebodys
been
in
here
Hermione
whispered
pointing
toward
it
that
couldve
happened
as
the
Order
left
Ron
murmured
back
so
where
are
these
jinxes
they
put
up
against
Snape
harry
asked
maybe
theyre
only
activated
if
he
shows
up
suggested
Ron
yet
they
remained
close
together
on
the
doormat
backs
against
the
door
scared
to
move
farther
into
the
house
well
we
cant
stay
here
forever
said
Harry
and
he
took
a
step
forward
severus
Snape
mad-Eye
Moodys
voice
whispered
out
of
the
darkness
making
all
three
of
them
jump
back
in
fright
were
not
Snape
croaked
Harry
before
something
whooshed
over
him
like
cold
air
and
his
tongue
curled
backward
on
itself
making
it
impossible
to
speak
before
he
had
time
to
feel
inside
his
mouth
however
his
tongue
had
unraveled
again
the
other
two
seemed
to
have
experienced
the
same
unpleasant
sensation
ron
was
making
retching
noises
Hermione
stammered
That
m-must
have
b-been
the
T-Tongue-Tying
Curse
Mad-Eye
set
up
for
Snape
gingerly
Harry
took
another
step
forward
something
shifted
in
the
shadows
at
the
end
of
the
hall
and
before
any
of
them
could
say
another
word
a
figure
had
risen
up
out
of
the
carpet
tall
dust-colored
and
terrible
Hermione
screamed
and
so
did
Mrs
black
her
curtains
flying
open
the
gray
figure
was
gliding
toward
them
faster
and
faster
its
waist-length
hair
and
beard
streaming
behind
it
its
face
sunken
fleshless
with
empty
eye
sockets
Horribly
familiar
dreadfully
altered
it
raised
a
wasted
arm
pointing
at
Harry
no
harry
shouted
and
though
he
had
raised
his
wand
no
spell
occurred
to
him
no
it
wasnt
us
we
didnt
kill
you
on
the
word
kill
the
figure
exploded
in
a
great
cloud
of
dust
Coughing
his
eyes
watering
Harry
looked
around
to
see
Hermione
crouched
on
the
floor
by
the
door
with
her
arms
over
her
head
and
Ron
who
was
shaking
from
head
to
foot
patting
her
clumsily
on
the
shoulder
and
saying
Its
all
r-right
its
g-gone
dust
swirled
around
Harry
like
mist
catching
the
blue
gaslight
as
Mrs
black
continued
to
scream
mudbloods
filth
stains
of
dishonor
taint
of
shame
on
the
house
of
my
fathers
shut
up
harry
bellowed
directing
his
wand
at
her
and
with
a
bang
and
a
burst
of
red
sparks
the
curtains
swung
shut
again
silencing
her
that
that
was
hermione
whimpered
as
Ron
helped
her
to
her
feet
yeah
said
Harry
but
it
wasnt
really
him
was
it
just
something
to
scare
Snape
had
it
worked
Harry
wondered
or
had
Snape
already
blasted
the
horror-figure
aside
as
casually
as
he
had
killed
the
real
Dumbledore
nerves
still
tingling
he
led
the
other
two
up
the
hall
half-expecting
some
new
terror
to
reveal
itself
but
nothing
moved
except
for
a
mouse
skittering
along
the
skirting
board
before
we
go
any
farther
I
think
wed
better
check
whispered
Hermione
and
she
raised
her
wand
and
said
Homenum
revelio
nothing
happened
well
youve
just
had
a
big
shock
said
Ron
kindly
what
was
that
supposed
to
do
it
did
what
I
meant
it
to
do
said
Hermione
rather
crossly
that
was
a
spell
to
reveal
human
presence
and
theres
nobody
here
except
us
and
old
Dusty
said
Ron
glancing
at
the
patch
of
carpet
from
which
the
corpse-figure
had
risen
lets
go
up
said
Hermione
with
a
frightened
look
at
the
same
spot
and
she
led
the
way
up
the
creaking
stairs
to
the
drawing
room
on
the
first
floor
hermione
waved
her
wand
to
ignite
the
old
gas
lamps
then
shivering
slightly
in
the
drafty
room
she
perched
on
the
sofa
her
arms
wrapped
tightly
around
her
ron
crossed
to
the
window
and
moved
the
heavy
velvet
curtains
aside
an
inch
cant
see
anyone
out
there
he
reported
and
youd
think
if
Harry
still
had
a
Trace
on
him
theyd
have
followed
us
here
i
know
they
cant
get
in
the
house
but
whats
up
Harry
harry
had
given
a
cry
of
pain
His
scar
had
burned
against
as
something
flashed
across
his
mind
like
a
bright
light
on
water
he
saw
a
large
shadow
and
felt
a
fury
that
was
not
his
own
pound
through
his
body
violent
and
brief
as
an
electric
shock
what
did
you
see
ron
asked
advancing
on
Harry
did
you
see
him
at
my
place
no
I
just
felt
anger
hes
really
angry
but
that
could
be
at
the
Burrow
said
Ron
loudly
what
else
didnt
you
see
anything
was
he
cursing
someone
no
I
just
felt
anger
I
couldnt
tell
harry
felt
badgered
confused
and
Hermione
did
not
help
as
she
said
in
a
frightened
voice
Your
scar
again
but
whats
going
on
i
thought
that
connection
had
closed
it
did
for
a
while
muttered
Harry
his
scar
was
still
painful
which
made
it
hard
to
concentrate
i
I
think
its
started
opening
again
whenever
he
loses
control
thats
how
it
used
to
but
then
youve
got
to
close
your
mind
said
Hermione
shrilly
harry
Dumbledore
didnt
want
you
to
use
that
connection
he
wanted
you
to
shut
it
down
thats
why
you
were
supposed
to
use
Occlumency
otherwise
Voldemort
can
plant
false
images
in
your
mind
remember
yeah
I
do
remember
thanks
said
Harry
through
gritted
teeth
he
did
not
need
Hermione
to
tell
him
that
Voldemort
had
once
used
this
selfsame
connection
between
them
to
lead
him
into
a
trap
nor
that
it
had
resulted
in
Siriuss
death
he
wished
that
he
had
not
told
them
what
he
had
seen
and
felt
it
made
Voldemort
more
threatening
as
though
he
were
pressing
against
the
window
of
the
room
and
still
the
pain
in
his
scar
was
building
and
he
fought
it
It
was
like
resisting
the
urge
to
be
sick
he
turned
his
back
on
Ron
and
Hermione
pretending
to
examine
the
old
tapestry
of
the
Black
family
tree
on
the
wall
then
Hermione
shrieked
Harry
drew
his
wand
again
and
spun
around
to
see
a
silver
Patronus
soar
through
the
drawing
room
window
and
land
upon
the
floor
in
front
of
them
where
it
solidified
into
the
weasel
that
spoke
with
the
voice
of
Rons
father
family
safe
do
not
reply
we
are
being
watched
the
Patronus
dissolved
into
nothingness
ron
let
out
a
noise
between
a
whimper
and
a
groan
and
dropped
onto
the
sofa
Hermione
joined
him
gripping
his
arm
theyre
all
right
theyre
all
right
she
whispered
and
Ron
half
laughed
and
hugged
her
harry
he
said
over
Hermiones
shoulder
I
its
not
a
problem
said
Harry
sickened
by
the
pain
in
his
head
its
your
family
course
you
were
worried
id
feel
the
same
way
he
thought
of
Ginny
i
do
feel
the
same
way
the
pain
in
his
scar
was
reaching
a
peak
burning
as
it
had
back
in
the
garden
of
the
Burrow
faintly
he
heard
Hermione
say
I
dont
want
to
be
on
my
own
could
we
use
the
sleeping
bags
Ive
brought
and
camp
in
here
tonight
he
heard
Ron
agree
he
could
not
fight
the
pain
much
longer
he
had
to
succumb
bathroom
he
muttered
and
he
left
the
room
as
fast
as
he
could
without
running
he
barely
made
it
Bolting
the
door
behind
him
with
trembling
hands
he
grasped
his
pounding
head
and
fell
to
the
floor
then
in
an
explosion
of
agony
he
felt
the
rage
that
did
not
belong
to
him
possess
his
soul
saw
a
long
room
lit
only
by
firelight
and
the
giant
blond
Death
Eater
on
the
floor
screaming
and
writhing
and
a
slighter
figure
standing
over
him
wand
outstretched
while
Harry
spoke
in
a
high
cold
merciless
voice
more
Rowle
or
shall
we
end
it
and
feed
you
to
Nagini
lord
Voldemort
is
not
sure
that
he
will
forgive
this
time
you
called
me
back
for
this
to
tell
me
that
Harry
Potter
has
escaped
again
draco
give
Rowle
another
taste
of
our
displeasure
do
it
or
feel
my
wrath
yourself
a
log
fell
in
the
fire
Flames
reared
their
light
darting
across
a
terrified
pointed
white
face
with
a
sense
of
emerging
from
deep
water
Harry
drew
heaving
breaths
and
opened
his
eyes
he
was
spread-eagled
on
the
cold
black
marble
floor
his
nose
inches
from
one
of
the
silver
serpent
tails
that
supported
the
large
bathtub
he
sat
up
malfoys
gaunt
petrified
face
seemed
burned
on
the
inside
of
his
eyes
harry
felt
sickened
by
what
he
had
seen
by
the
use
to
which
Draco
was
now
being
put
by
Voldemort
there
was
a
sharp
rap
on
the
door
and
Harry
jumped
as
Hermiones
voice
rang
out
harry
do
you
want
your
toothbrush
ive
got
it
here
yeah
great
thanks
he
said
fighting
to
keep
his
voice
casual
as
he
stood
up
to
let
her
in
chapter
Ten
kreachers
Tale
harry
woke
early
next
morning
wrapped
in
a
sleeping
bag
on
the
drawing
room
floor
a
chink
of
sky
was
visible
between
the
heavy
curtains
it
was
the
cool
clear
blue
of
watered
ink
somewhere
between
night
and
dawn
and
everything
was
quiet
except
for
Ron
and
Hermiones
slow
deep
breathing
harry
glanced
over
at
the
dark
shapes
they
made
on
the
floor
beside
him
ron
had
had
a
fit
of
gallantry
and
insisted
that
Hermione
sleep
on
the
cushions
from
the
sofa
so
that
her
silhouette
was
raised
above
his
her
arm
curved
to
the
floor
her
fingers
inches
from
Rons
harry
wondered
whether
they
had
fallen
asleep
holding
hands
the
idea
made
him
feel
strangely
lonely
he
looked
up
at
the
shadowy
ceiling
the
cobwebbed
chandelier
less
than
twenty-four
house
ago
he
had
been
standing
in
the
sunlight
at
the
entrance
to
the
marquee
waiting
to
show
in
wedding
guests
it
seemed
a
lifetime
away
what
was
going
to
happen
now
he
lay
on
the
floor
and
he
thought
of
the
Horcruxes
of
the
daunting
complex
mission
Dumbledore
had
left
him
dumbledore
the
grief
that
had
possessed
him
since
Dumbledores
death
felt
different
now
the
accusations
he
had
heard
from
Muriel
at
the
wedding
seemed
to
have
nested
in
his
brain
like
diseased
things
infecting
his
memories
of
the
wizard
he
had
idolized
could
Dumbledore
have
let
such
things
happen
had
he
been
like
Dudley
content
to
watch
neglect
and
abuse
as
long
as
it
did
not
affect
him
could
he
have
turned
his
back
on
a
sister
who
was
being
imprisoned
and
hidden
harry
thought
of
Godrics
Hollow
of
graves
Dumbledore
had
never
mentioned
there
he
thought
of
mysterious
objects
left
without
explanation
in
Dumbledores
will
and
resentment
swelled
in
the
darkness
why
hadnt
Dumbledore
told
him
why
hadnt
he
explained
had
Dumbledore
actually
cared
about
Harry
at
all
or
had
Harry
been
nothing
more
than
a
tool
to
be
polished
and
honed
but
not
trusted
never
confided
in
harry
could
not
stand
lying
there
with
nothing
but
bitter
thoughts
for
company
desperate
for
something
to
do
for
distraction
he
slipped
out
of
his
sleeping
bad
picked
up
his
wand
and
crept
out
of
the
room
on
the
landing
he
whispered
Lumos
and
started
to
climb
the
stairs
by
wandlight
on
the
second
landing
was
the
bedroom
in
which
he
and
Ron
had
slept
last
time
they
had
been
here
he
glanced
into
it
the
wardrobe
doors
stood
open
and
the
bedclothes
had
been
ripped
back
harry
remembered
the
overturned
troll
leg
downstairs
somebody
had
searched
the
house
since
the
Order
had
left
snape
or
perhaps
Mundungus
who
had
pilfered
plenty
from
this
house
both
before
and
after
Sirius
died
harrys
gaze
wandered
to
the
portrait
that
sometimes
contained
Phineas
Nigellus
Black
Siriuss
great-great
grandfather
but
it
was
empty
showing
nothing
but
a
stretch
of
muddy
backdrop
phineas
Nigellus
was
evidently
spending
the
night
in
the
headmasters
study
at
Hogwarts
harry
continued
up
the
stairs
until
he
reached
the
topmost
landing
where
there
were
only
two
doors
the
one
facing
him
bore
a
nameplate
reading
Sirius
harry
had
never
entered
his
godfathers
bedroom
before
he
pushed
open
the
door
holding
his
wand
high
to
cast
light
as
widely
as
possible
the
room
was
spacious
and
must
once
have
been
handsome
there
was
a
large
bed
with
a
carved
wooden
headboard
a
tall
window
obscured
by
long
velvet
curtains
and
a
chandelier
thickly
coated
in
dust
with
candle
scrubs
still
resting
in
its
sockets
solid
wax
banging
in
frostlike
drips
a
fine
film
of
dust
covered
the
pictures
on
the
walls
and
the
beds
headboard
a
spiders
web
stretched
between
the
chandelier
and
the
top
of
the
large
wooden
wardrobe
and
as
Harry
moved
deeper
into
the
room
he
head
a
scurrying
of
disturbed
mice
the
teenage
Sirius
had
plastered
the
walls
with
so
many
posters
and
pictures
that
little
of
the
walls
silvery-gray
silk
was
visible
harry
could
only
assume
that
Siriuss
parents
had
been
unable
to
remove
the
Permanent
Sticking
Charm
that
kept
them
on
the
wall
because
he
was
sure
they
would
not
have
appreciated
their
eldest
sons
taste
in
decoration
sirius
seemed
to
have
long
gone
out
of
his
way
to
annoy
his
parents
there
were
several
large
Gryffindor
banners
faded
scarlet
and
gold
just
to
underline
his
difference
from
all
the
rest
of
the
Slytherin
family
there
were
many
pictures
of
Muggle
motorcycles
and
also
Harry
had
to
admire
Siriuss
nerve
several
posters
of
bikini-clad
Muggle
girls
harry
could
tell
that
they
were
Muggles
because
they
remained
quite
stationary
within
their
pictures
faded
smiles
and
glazed
eyes
frozen
on
the
paper
this
was
in
contrast
the
only
Wizarding
photograph
on
the
walls
which
was
a
picture
of
four
Hogwarts
students
standing
arm
in
arm
laughing
at
the
camera
with
a
leap
of
pleasure
Harry
recognized
his
father
his
untidy
black
hair
stuck
up
at
the
back
like
Harrys
and
he
too
wore
glasses
beside
him
was
Sirius
carelessly
handsome
his
slightly
arrogant
face
so
much
younger
and
happier
than
Harry
had
ever
seen
it
alive
to
Siriuss
right
stood
Pettigrew
more
than
a
head
shorter
plump
and
watery-eyed
flushed
with
pleasure
at
his
inclusion
in
this
coolest
of
gangs
with
the
much-admired
rebels
that
James
and
Sirius
had
been
on
Jamess
left
was
Lupin
even
then
a
little
shabby-looking
but
he
had
the
same
air
of
delighted
surprise
at
finding
himself
liked
and
included
or
was
it
simply
because
Harry
knew
how
it
had
been
that
he
saw
these
things
in
the
picture
he
tried
to
take
it
from
the
wall
it
was
his
now
after
all
Sirius
had
left
him
everything
but
it
would
not
budge
sirius
had
taken
no
chances
in
preventing
his
parents
from
redecorating
his
room
harry
looked
around
at
the
floor
the
sky
outside
was
growing
brightest
a
shaft
of
light
revealed
bits
of
paper
books
and
small
objects
scattered
over
the
carpet
evidently
Siriuss
bedroom
had
been
reached
too
although
its
contents
seemed
to
have
been
judged
mostly
if
not
entirely
worthless
a
few
of
the
books
had
been
shaken
roughly
enough
to
part
company
with
the
covers
and
sundry
pages
littered
the
floor
harry
bent
down
picked
up
a
few
of
the
pieces
of
paper
and
examined
them
he
recognized
one
as
a
part
of
an
old
edition
of
A
History
of
Magic
by
Bathilda
Bagshot
and
another
as
belonging
to
a
motorcycle
maintenance
manual
the
third
was
handwritten
and
crumpled
he
smoothed
it
out
dear
Padfoot
thank
you
thank
you
for
Harrys
birthday
present
it
was
his
favorite
by
far
one
year
old
and
already
zooming
along
on
a
toy
broomstick
he
looked
so
pleased
with
himself
im
enclosing
a
picture
so
you
can
see
you
know
it
only
rises
about
two
feet
off
the
ground
but
he
nearly
killed
the
cat
and
he
smashed
a
horrible
vase
Petunia
sent
me
for
Christmas
no
complaints
there
of
course
James
thought
it
was
so
funny
says
hes
going
to
be
a
great
Quidditch
player
but
weve
had
to
pack
away
all
the
ornaments
and
make
sure
we
dont
take
our
eyes
off
him
when
he
gets
going
we
had
a
very
quiet
birthday
tea
just
us
and
old
Bathilda
who
has
always
been
sweet
to
us
and
who
dotes
on
Garry
we
were
so
sorry
you
couldnt
come
but
the
Orders
got
to
come
first
and
Harrys
not
old
enough
to
know
its
his
birthday
anyway
james
is
getting
a
bit
frustrated
shut
up
here
he
tries
not
to
show
it
but
I
can
tell
also
Dumbledores
still
got
his
Invisibility
Cloak
so
no
chance
of
little
excursions
if
you
could
visit
it
would
cheer
him
up
so
much
wormy
was
here
last
weekend
i
thought
he
seemed
down
but
that
was
probably
the
next
about
the
McKinnons
I
cried
all
evening
when
I
heard
bathilda
drops
in
most
days
shes
a
fascinating
old
thing
with
the
most
amazing
stories
about
Dumbledore
im
not
sure
hed
be
pleased
if
he
knew
i
dont
know
how
much
to
believe
actually
because
it
seems
incredible
that
Dumbledore
harrys
extremities
seemed
to
have
gone
numb
he
stood
quite
still
holding
the
miraculous
paper
in
his
nerveless
fingers
while
inside
him
a
kind
of
quiet
eruptions
sent
joy
and
grief
thundering
its
equal
measure
through
his
veins
lurching
to
the
bed
he
sat
down
he
read
the
letter
again
but
could
not
take
in
any
more
meaning
than
he
had
done
the
first
time
and
was
reduced
to
staring
at
the
handwriting
itself
she
had
made
her
gs
the
same
way
he
did
he
searched
through
the
letter
for
every
one
of
them
and
each
felt
like
a
friendly
little
wave
glimpsed
from
behind
a
veil
the
letter
was
an
incredible
treasure
proof
that
Lily
Potter
had
lived
really
lived
that
her
warm
hand
had
once
moved
across
this
parchment
tracing
ink
into
these
letters
these
words
words
about
him
Harry
her
son
impatiently
brushing
away
the
wetness
in
his
eyes
he
reread
the
letter
this
time
concentrating
on
the
meaning
it
was
like
listening
to
a
half-remembered
voice
they
had
a
cat
perhaps
it
had
perished
like
his
parents
at
Godrics
Hollow
or
else
fled
when
there
was
nobody
left
to
feed
it
sirius
had
bought
him
his
first
broomstick
his
parents
had
known
Bathilda
Bagshot
had
Dumbledore
introduced
them
dumbledores
still
got
his
Invisibility
Cloak
there
was
something
funny
there
harry
paused
pondering
his
mothers
words
why
had
Dumbledore
taken
Jamess
Invisibility
Cloak
harry
distinctly
remembered
his
headmaster
telling
him
years
before
I
dont
need
a
cloak
to
become
invisible
Perhaps
some
less
gifted
Order
member
had
needed
its
assistance
and
Dumbledore
had
acted
as
a
carrier
harry
passed
on
wormy
was
here
pettigrew
the
traitor
had
seemed
down
had
he
was
he
aware
that
he
was
seeing
James
and
Lily
alive
for
the
last
time
and
finally
Bathilda
again
who
told
incredible
stories
about
Dumbledore
it
seems
incredible
that
Dumbledore
that
Dumbledore
what
but
there
were
any
number
of
things
that
would
seem
incredible
about
Dumbledore
that
he
had
once
received
bottom
marks
in
a
Transfiguration
test
for
instance
or
had
taken
up
goat
charming
like
Aberforth
harry
got
to
his
feet
and
scanned
the
floor
Perhaps
the
rest
of
the
letter
was
here
somewhere
he
seized
papers
treating
them
in
his
eagerness
with
as
little
consideration
as
the
original
searcher
he
pulled
open
drawers
shook
out
books
stood
on
a
chair
to
run
his
hand
over
the
top
of
the
wardrobe
and
crawled
under
the
bed
and
armchair
at
last
lying
facedown
on
the
floor
he
spotted
what
looked
like
a
torn
piece
of
paper
under
the
chest
of
drawers
when
he
pulled
it
out
it
proved
to
be
most
of
the
photograph
that
Lily
had
described
in
her
letter
a
black-haired
baby
was
zooming
in
and
out
of
the
picture
on
a
tiny
broom
roaring
with
laughter
and
a
pair
of
legs
that
must
have
belonged
to
James
was
chasing
after
him
harry
tucked
the
photograph
into
his
pocket
with
Lilys
letter
and
continued
to
look
for
the
second
sheet
after
another
quarter
of
an
hour
however
he
was
forced
to
conclude
that
the
rest
of
his
mothers
letter
was
gone
had
it
simply
been
lost
in
the
sixteen
years
that
had
elapsed
since
it
had
been
written
or
had
it
been
taken
by
whoever
had
searched
the
room
harry
read
the
first
sheet
again
this
time
looking
for
clues
as
to
what
might
have
made
the
second
sheet
valuable
his
toy
broomstick
could
hardly
be
considered
interesting
to
the
Death
Eaters
the
only
potentially
useful
thing
he
could
see
her
was
possible
information
on
Dumbledore
it
seems
incredible
that
Dumbledore
what
harry
harry
harry
im
here
he
called
Whats
happened
there
was
a
clatter
of
footsteps
outside
the
door
and
Hermione
burst
inside
we
woke
up
and
didnt
know
where
you
were
she
said
breathlessly
she
turned
and
shouted
over
her
shoulder
Ron
ive
found
him
rons
annoyed
voice
echoed
distantly
from
several
floors
below
good
tell
him
from
me
hes
a
git
harry
dont
just
disappear
please
we
were
terrified
why
did
you
come
up
here
anyway
she
gazed
around
the
ransacked
room
what
have
you
been
doing
look
what
Ive
just
found
he
held
out
his
mothers
letter
hermione
took
it
out
and
read
it
while
Harry
watched
her
when
she
reached
the
end
of
the
page
she
looked
up
at
him
oh
Harry
and
theres
this
too
he
handed
her
the
torn
photograph
and
Hermione
smiled
at
the
baby
zooming
in
and
out
of
sight
on
the
toy
broom
ive
been
looking
for
the
rest
of
the
letter
Harry
said
but
its
not
here
hermione
glanced
around
did
you
make
all
this
mess
or
was
some
of
it
done
when
you
got
here
someone
had
searched
before
me
said
Harry
i
thought
so
every
room
I
looked
into
on
the
way
up
had
been
disturbed
what
were
they
after
do
you
think
information
on
the
Order
if
it
was
Snape
but
youd
think
hed
already
have
all
he
needed
i
mean
was
in
the
Order
wasnt
he
well
then
said
Harry
keen
to
discuss
his
theory
what
about
information
on
Dumbledore
the
second
page
of
the
letter
for
instance
you
know
this
Bathilda
my
mum
mentions
you
know
who
she
is
who
bathilda
Bagshot
the
author
of
a
History
of
Magic
said
Hermione
looking
interested
so
your
parents
knew
her
she
was
an
incredible
magic
historian
and
shes
still
alive
said
Harry
and
she
lives
in
Godrics
Hollow
rons
Auntie
Muriel
was
talking
about
her
at
the
wedding
she
knew
Dumbledores
family
too
be
pretty
interesting
to
talk
to
wouldnt
she
there
was
a
little
too
much
understanding
in
the
smile
Hermione
gave
him
for
Harrys
liking
he
took
back
the
letter
and
the
photograph
and
tucked
them
inside
the
pouch
around
his
neck
so
as
not
to
have
to
look
at
her
and
give
himself
away
i
understand
why
youd
love
to
talk
to
her
about
your
mum
and
dad
and
Dumbledore
too
said
Hermione
but
that
wouldnt
really
help
us
in
our
search
for
the
Horcruxes
would
it
harry
did
not
answer
and
she
rushed
on
Harry
I
know
you
really
want
to
go
to
Godrics
Hollow
but
Im
scared
im
scared
at
how
easily
those
Death
Eaters
found
us
yesterday
it
just
makes
me
feel
more
than
ever
that
we
ought
to
avoid
the
place
where
your
parents
are
buried
Im
sure
theyd
be
expecting
you
to
visit
it
its
not
just
that
Harry
said
still
avoiding
looking
at
her
Muriel
said
stuff
about
Dumbledore
at
the
wedding
i
want
to
know
the
truth
he
told
Hermione
everything
that
Muriel
had
told
him
when
he
had
finished
Hermione
said
Of
course
I
can
see
why
thats
upset
you
Harry
im
not
upset
he
lied
Id
just
like
to
know
whether
or
not
its
true
or
harry
do
you
really
think
youll
get
the
truth
from
a
malicious
old
woman
like
Muriel
or
from
Rita
Skeeter
how
can
you
believe
them
you
knew
Dumbledore
i
thought
I
did
he
muttered
but
you
know
how
much
truth
there
was
in
everything
Rita
wrote
about
you
doge
is
right
how
can
you
let
these
people
tarnish
your
memories
of
Dumbledore
he
looked
away
trying
not
to
betray
the
resentment
he
felt
there
it
was
again
Choose
what
to
believe
he
wanted
the
truth
why
was
everybody
so
determined
that
he
should
not
get
it
shall
we
go
down
to
the
kitchen
hermione
suggested
after
a
little
pause
find
something
for
breakfast
he
agreed
but
grudgingly
and
followed
her
out
onto
the
landing
and
past
the
second
door
that
led
off
it
there
were
deep
scratch
marks
in
the
paintwork
below
a
small
sign
that
he
had
not
noticed
in
the
dark
he
passed
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
to
read
it
it
was
a
pompous
little
sign
neatly
lettered
by
hand
the
sort
of
thing
that
Percy
Weasley
might
have
stuck
on
his
bedroom
door
do
Not
Enter
without
the
Express
Permission
of
regulus
Arcturus
Black
excitement
trickled
through
Harry
but
he
was
not
immediately
sure
why
he
read
the
sign
again
hermione
was
already
a
flight
of
stairs
below
him
hermione
he
said
and
he
was
surprised
that
his
voice
was
so
calm
come
back
up
here
whats
the
matter
a.b.
I
think
Ive
found
him
there
was
a
gasp
and
then
Hermione
ran
back
up
the
stairs
in
your
mums
letter
but
I
didnt
see
harry
shook
his
head
pointing
at
Reguluss
sign
she
read
it
then
clutched
Harrys
arm
so
tightly
that
he
winced
siriuss
brother
she
whispered
he
was
a
Death
Eater
said
Harry
sirius
told
me
about
him
he
joined
up
when
he
was
really
young
and
then
got
cold
feet
and
tried
to
leave
so
they
killed
him
that
fits
gasped
Hermione
if
he
was
a
Death
Eater
he
had
access
to
Voldemort
and
if
he
became
disenchanted
then
he
would
have
wanted
to
bring
Voldemort
down
she
released
Harry
leaned
over
the
banister
and
screamed
Ron
ron
get
up
here
quick
ron
appeared
panting
a
minute
later
his
wand
ready
in
his
hand
whats
up
if
its
massive
spiders
again
I
want
breakfast
before
I
he
frowned
at
the
sign
on
Reguluss
door
in
which
Hermione
was
silently
pointing
what
that
was
Siriuss
brother
wasnt
it
regulus
Arcturus
regulus
a.b
the
locket
you
dont
reckon
lets
find
out
said
Harry
he
pushed
the
door
It
was
locked
hermione
pointed
her
wand
at
the
handle
and
said
Alohamora
there
was
a
click
and
the
door
swung
open
they
moved
over
the
threshold
together
gazing
around
reguluss
bedroom
was
slightly
smaller
than
Siriuss
though
it
had
the
same
sense
of
former
grandeur
whereas
Sirius
had
sought
to
advertise
his
diffidence
from
the
rest
of
the
family
Regulus
had
striven
to
emphasize
the
opposite
the
Slytherin
colors
of
emerald
and
silver
were
everywhere
draping
the
bed
the
walls
and
the
windows
the
Black
family
crest
was
painstakingly
painted
over
the
bed
along
with
its
motto
toujours
pur
beneath
this
was
a
collection
of
yellow
newspaper
cuttings
all
stuck
together
to
make
a
ragged
collage
hermione
crossed
the
room
to
examine
them
theyre
all
about
Voldemort
she
said
regulus
seems
to
have
been
a
fan
for
a
few
years
before
he
joined
the
Death
Eaters
a
little
puff
of
dust
rose
from
the
bedcovers
as
she
sat
down
to
read
the
clippings
harry
meanwhile
had
noticed
another
photograph
a
Hogwarts
Quidditch
team
was
smiling
and
waving
out
of
the
frame
he
moved
closer
and
saw
the
snakes
emblazoned
on
their
chests
Slytherins
regulus
was
instantly
recognizable
as
the
boy
sitting
in
the
middle
of
the
front
row
He
had
the
same
dark
hair
and
slightly
haughty
look
of
his
brother
though
he
was
smaller
slighter
and
rather
less
handsome
than
Sirius
had
been
he
played
Seeker
said
Harry
what
said
Hermione
vaguely
she
was
still
immersed
in
Voldemorts
press
clippings
hes
sitting
in
the
middle
of
the
front
row
thats
where
the
Seeker
never
mind
said
Harry
realizing
that
nobody
was
listening
ron
was
on
his
hands
and
knees
searching
under
the
wardrobe
harry
looked
around
the
room
for
likely
hiding
places
and
approached
the
desk
yet
again
somebody
had
searched
before
them
the
drawers
contents
had
been
turned
over
recently
the
dust
disturbed
but
there
was
nothing
of
value
there
old
quills
out-of-date
textbooks
that
bore
evidence
of
being
roughly
handled
a
recently
smashed
ink
bottle
its
sticky
residue
covering
the
contents
of
the
drawer
theres
an
easier
way
said
Hermione
as
Harry
wiped
his
inky
fingers
on
his
jeans
she
raised
her
wand
and
said
Accio
Locket
nothing
happened
ron
who
had
been
searching
the
folds
of
the
faded
curtains
looked
disappointed
is
that
it
then
its
not
here
oh
it
could
still
be
here
but
under
counter-enchantments
said
Hermione
charms
to
prevent
it
from
being
summoned
magically
you
know
like
Voldemort
put
on
the
stone
basin
in
the
cave
said
Harry
remembering
how
he
had
been
unable
to
Summon
the
fake
locket
how
are
we
supposed
to
find
it
then
asked
Ron
we
search
manually
said
Hermione
thats
a
good
idea
said
Ron
rolling
his
eyes
and
he
resumed
his
examination
of
the
curtains
they
combed
every
inch
of
the
room
for
more
than
an
hour
but
were
forced
finally
to
conclude
that
the
locket
was
not
there
the
sun
had
risen
now
its
light
dazzled
them
even
through
the
grimy
landing
windows
it
could
be
somewhere
else
in
the
house
though
said
Hermione
in
a
rallying
tone
as
they
walked
back
downstairs
as
Harry
and
Ron
had
become
more
discouraged
she
seemed
to
have
become
more
determined
whether
hed
manage
to
destroy
it
or
not
hed
want
to
keep
it
hidden
from
Voldemort
wouldnt
he
remember
all
those
awful
things
we
had
to
get
rid
of
when
we
were
here
last
time
that
clock
that
shot
bolts
at
everyone
and
those
old
robes
that
tried
to
strangle
Ron
Regulus
might
have
put
them
there
to
protect
the
lockets
hiding
place
even
though
we
didnt
realize
it
at
at
harry
and
Ron
looked
at
her
she
was
standing
with
one
foot
in
midair
with
the
dumbstruck
look
of
one
who
had
just
been
Obliviated
her
eyes
had
even
drifted
out
of
focus
at
the
time
she
finished
in
a
whisper
something
wrong
asked
Ron
there
was
a
locket
what
said
Harry
and
Ron
together
in
the
cabinet
in
the
drawing
room
nobody
could
open
it
and
we
we
harry
felt
as
though
a
brick
had
slid
down
through
his
chest
into
his
stomach
he
remembered
he
had
even
handled
the
thing
as
they
passed
it
around
each
trying
in
turn
to
pry
it
open
it
had
been
tossed
into
a
sack
of
rubbish
along
with
the
snuffbox
of
Wartcap
powder
and
the
music
box
that
had
made
everyone
sleepy
kreacher
nicked
loads
of
things
back
from
us
said
Harry
it
was
the
only
chance
the
only
slender
hope
left
to
them
and
he
was
going
to
cling
to
it
until
forced
to
let
go
he
had
a
whole
stash
of
stuff
in
his
cupboard
in
the
kitchen
cmon
he
ran
down
the
stairs
taking
two
steps
at
a
time
the
other
two
thundering
along
in
his
wake
they
made
so
much
noise
that
they
woke
the
portrait
of
Siriuss
mother
as
they
passed
through
the
hall
filth
mudbloods
scum
she
screamed
after
them
as
they
dashed
down
into
the
basement
kitchen
and
slammed
the
door
behind
them
harry
ran
the
length
of
the
room
skidded
to
a
halt
at
the
door
of
Kreachers
cupboard
and
wrenched
it
open
there
was
the
nest
of
dirty
old
blankets
in
which
the
house-elf
had
once
slept
but
they
were
not
longer
glittering
with
the
trinkets
Kreacher
had
salvaged
the
only
thing
there
was
an
old
copy
of
Natures
Nobility
A
Wizarding
Genealogy
refusing
to
believe
his
eyes
Harry
snatched
up
the
blankets
and
shook
them
a
dead
mouse
fell
out
and
rolled
dismally
across
the
floor
ron
groaned
as
he
threw
himself
into
a
kitchen
chair
Hermione
closed
her
eyes
its
not
over
yet
said
Harry
and
he
raised
his
voice
and
called
Kreacher
there
was
a
loud
crack
and
the
house
elf
that
Harry
had
so
reluctantly
inherited
from
Sirius
appeared
out
of
nowhere
in
front
of
the
cold
and
empty
fireplace
tiny
half
human-sized
his
pale
skin
hanging
off
him
in
folds
white
hair
sprouting
copiously
from
his
batlike
ears
he
was
still
wearing
the
filthy
rag
in
which
they
had
first
met
him
and
the
contemptuous
look
he
bent
upon
Harry
showed
that
his
attitude
to
his
change
of
ownership
had
altered
no
more
than
his
outfit
master
croaked
Kreacher
in
his
bullfrogs
voice
and
he
bowed
low
muttering
to
his
knees
back
in
my
Mistresss
old
house
with
the
blood-traitor
Weasley
and
the
Mudblood
i
forbid
you
to
call
anyone
blood
traitor
or
Mudblood
growled
Harry
he
would
have
found
Kreacher
with
his
snoutlike
nose
and
bloodshot
eyes
a
distinctively
unlovable
object
even
if
the
elf
had
not
betrayed
Sirius
to
Voldemort
ive
got
a
question
for
you
said
Harry
his
heart
beating
rather
fast
as
he
looked
down
at
the
elf
and
I
order
you
to
answer
it
truthfully
understand
yes
Master
said
Kreacher
bowing
low
again
harry
saw
his
lips
moving
soundlessly
undoubtedly
framing
the
insults
he
was
now
forbidden
to
utter
two
years
ago
said
Harry
his
heart
now
hammering
against
his
ribs
there
was
a
big
gold
locket
in
the
drawing
room
upstairs
we
threw
it
out
did
you
steal
it
back
there
was
a
moments
silence
during
which
Kreacher
straightened
up
to
look
Harry
full
in
the
face
then
he
said
Yes
where
is
it
now
asked
Harry
jubilantly
as
Ron
and
Hermione
looked
gleeful
kreacher
closed
his
eyes
as
though
he
could
not
bear
to
see
their
reactions
to
his
next
word
gone
gone
echoed
Harry
elation
floating
out
of
him
What
do
you
mean
its
gone
the
elf
shivered
he
swayed
kreacher
said
Harry
fiercely
I
order
you
mundungus
Fletcher
croaked
the
elf
his
eyes
still
tight
shut
mundungus
Fletcher
stole
it
all
Miss
Bellas
and
Miss
Cissys
pictures
my
Mistresss
gloves
the
Order
of
Merlin
First
Class
the
goblets
with
the
family
crest
and
and
kreacher
was
gulping
for
air
His
hollow
chest
was
rising
and
falling
rapidly
then
his
eyes
flew
open
and
he
uttered
a
bloodcurdling
scream
and
the
locket
Master
Reguluss
locket
kreacher
did
wrong
Kreacher
failed
in
his
orders
harry
reacted
instinctively
As
Kreacher
lunged
for
the
poker
standing
in
the
grate
he
launched
himself
upon
the
elf
flattening
him
hermiones
scream
mingled
with
Kreachers
but
Harry
bellowed
louder
than
both
of
them
Kreacher
I
order
you
to
stay
still
he
felt
the
elf
freeze
and
released
him
kreacher
lay
flat
on
the
cold
stone
floor
tears
gushing
from
his
sagging
eyes
harry
let
him
up
hermione
whispered
so
he
can
beat
himself
up
with
the
poker
snorted
Harry
kneeling
beside
the
elf
i
dont
think
so
right
kreacher
I
want
the
truth
How
do
you
know
Mundungus
Fletcher
stole
the
locket
kreacher
saw
him
gasped
the
elf
as
tears
poured
over
his
snout
and
into
his
mouth
full
of
graying
teeth
kreacher
saw
him
coming
out
of
Kreachers
cupboard
with
his
hands
full
of
Kreachers
treasures
kreacher
told
the
sneak
thief
to
stop
but
Mundungus
Fletcher
laughed
and
r-ran
you
called
the
locket
Master
Reguluss
said
Harry
why
where
did
it
come
from
what
did
Regulus
have
to
do
with
it
kreacher
sit
up
and
tell
me
everything
you
know
about
that
locket
and
everything
Regulus
had
to
do
with
it
the
elf
sat
up
curled
into
a
ball
placed
his
wet
face
between
his
knees
and
began
to
rock
backward
and
forward
when
he
spoke
his
voice
was
muffled
but
quite
distinct
in
the
silent
echoing
kitchen
master
Sirius
ran
away
good
riddance
for
he
was
a
bad
boy
and
broke
my
Mistresss
heart
with
his
lawless
ways
but
Master
Regulus
had
proper
order
he
knew
what
was
due
to
the
name
of
Black
and
the
dignity
of
his
pure
blood
for
years
he
talked
of
the
Dark
Lord
who
was
going
to
bring
the
wizards
out
of
hiding
to
rule
the
Muggles
and
the
muggle-borns
and
when
he
was
sixteen
years
old
Master
Regulus
joined
the
Dark
Lord
so
proud
so
proud
so
happy
to
serve
and
one
day
a
year
after
he
joined
Master
Regulus
came
down
to
the
kitchen
to
see
Kreacher
master
Regulus
always
liked
Kreacher
and
Master
Regulus
said
he
said
the
old
elf
rocked
faster
than
ever
he
said
that
the
Dark
Lord
required
an
elf
voldemort
needed
an
elf
harry
repeated
looking
around
at
Ron
and
Hermione
who
looked
just
as
puzzled
as
he
did
oh
yes
moaned
Kreacher
and
Master
Regulus
had
volunteered
Kreacher
it
was
an
honor
said
Master
Regulus
an
honor
for
him
and
for
Kreacher
who
must
be
sure
to
do
whatever
the
Dark
Lord
ordered
him
to
do
and
then
to
c-come
home
kreacher
rocked
still
faster
his
breath
coming
in
sobs
so
Kreacher
went
to
the
Dark
Lord
the
Dark
Lord
did
not
tell
Kreacher
what
they
were
to
do
but
took
Kreacher
with
him
to
a
cave
beside
the
sea
and
beyond
the
cave
was
a
cavern
and
in
the
cavern
was
a
great
black
lake
the
hairs
on
the
back
of
Harrys
neck
stood
up
kreachers
croaking
voice
seemed
to
come
to
him
from
across
the
dark
water
he
saw
what
had
happened
as
clearly
as
though
he
had
been
present
there
was
a
boat
of
course
there
had
been
a
boat
Harry
knew
the
boat
ghostly
green
and
tiny
bewitched
so
as
to
carry
one
wizard
and
one
victim
toward
the
island
in
the
center
this
then
was
how
Voldemort
had
tested
the
defenses
surrounding
the
Horcrux
by
borrowing
a
disposable
creature
a
house-elf
there
was
a
b-basin
full
of
potion
on
the
island
the
D-Dark
Lord
made
Kreacher
drink
it
the
elf
quaked
from
head
to
foot
kreacher
drank
and
as
he
drank
he
saw
terrible
thing
kreachers
insides
burned
kreacher
cried
for
Master
Regulus
to
save
him
he
cried
for
his
Mistress
Black
but
the
Dark
Lord
only
laughed
he
made
Kreacher
drink
all
the
potion
he
dropped
a
locket
into
the
empty
basin
he
filled
it
with
more
potion
and
then
the
Dark
Lord
sailed
away
leaving
Kreacher
on
the
island
harry
could
see
it
happening
he
watched
Voldemorts
white
snakelike
face
vanishing
into
darkness
those
red
eyes
fixed
pitilessly
on
the
thrashing
elf
whose
death
would
occur
within
minutes
whenever
he
succumbed
to
the
desperate
thirst
that
the
burning
poison
caused
its
victim
but
here
Harrys
imagination
could
go
no
further
for
he
could
not
see
how
Kreacher
had
escaped
kreacher
needed
water
he
crawled
to
the
islands
edge
and
he
drank
from
the
black
lake
and
hands
dead
hands
came
out
of
the
water
and
dragged
Kreacher
under
the
surface
how
did
you
get
away
harry
asked
and
he
was
not
surprised
to
hear
himself
whispering
kreacher
raised
his
ugly
head
and
looked
Harry
with
his
great
bloodshot
eyes
master
Regulus
told
Kreacher
to
come
back
he
said
i
know
but
how
did
you
escape
the
Inferi
kreacher
did
not
seem
to
understand
master
Regulus
told
Kreacher
to
come
back
he
repeated
i
know
but
well
its
obvious
isnt
it
Harry
said
Ron
he
Disapparated
but
you
couldnt
Apparate
in
and
out
of
that
cave
said
Harry
otherwise
Dumbledore
elf
magic
isnt
like
wizards
magic
is
it
said
Ron
I
mean
they
can
Apparate
and
Disapparate
in
and
out
of
Hogwarts
when
we
cant
there
was
a
silence
as
Harry
digested
this
how
could
Voldemort
have
made
such
a
mistake
but
even
as
he
thought
this
Hermione
spoke
and
her
voice
was
icy
of
course
Voldemort
would
have
considered
the
ways
of
house-elves
far
beneath
his
notice
it
would
never
have
occurred
to
him
that
they
might
have
magic
that
he
didnt
the
house-elfs
highest
law
is
his
Masters
bidding
intoned
Kreacher
kreacher
was
told
to
come
home
so
Kreacher
came
home
well
then
you
did
what
you
were
told
didnt
you
said
Hermione
kindly
you
didnt
disobey
orders
at
all
kreacher
shook
his
head
rocking
as
fast
as
ever
so
what
happened
when
you
got
back
harry
asked
what
did
Regulus
say
when
you
told
him
what
happened
master
Regulus
was
very
worried
very
worried
croaked
Kreacher
master
Regulus
told
Kreacher
to
stay
hidden
and
not
to
leave
the
house
and
then
it
was
a
little
while
later
master
Regulus
came
to
find
Kreacher
in
his
cupboard
one
night
and
Master
Regulus
was
strange
not
as
he
usually
was
disturbed
in
his
mind
Kreacher
could
tell
and
he
asked
Kreacher
to
take
him
to
the
cave
the
cave
where
Kreacher
had
gone
with
the
Dark
Lord
and
so
they
had
set
off
harry
could
visualize
them
quite
clearly
the
frightened
old
elf
and
the
thin
dark
Seeker
who
had
so
resembled
Sirius
kreacher
knew
how
to
open
the
concealed
entrance
to
the
underground
cavern
knew
how
to
raise
the
tiny
boat
this
time
it
was
his
beloved
Regulus
who
sailed
with
him
to
the
island
with
its
basin
of
poison
and
he
made
you
drink
the
poison
said
Harry
disgusted
but
Kreacher
shook
his
head
and
wept
hermiones
hands
leapt
to
her
mouth
She
seemed
to
have
understood
something
m-Master
Regulus
took
from
his
pocket
a
locket
like
the
one
the
Dark
Lord
had
said
Kreacher
tears
pouring
down
either
side
of
his
snoutlike
nose
and
he
told
Kreacher
to
take
it
and
when
the
basin
was
empty
to
switch
the
lockets
kreachers
sobs
came
in
great
rasps
now
Harry
had
to
concentrate
hard
to
understand
him
and
he
order
Kreacher
to
leave
without
him
and
he
told
Kreacher
to
go
home
and
never
to
tell
my
Mistress
what
he
had
done
but
to
destroy
the
first
locket
and
he
drank
all
the
potion
and
Kreacher
swapped
the
lockets
and
watched
as
Master
Regulus
was
dragged
beneath
the
water
and
oh
Kreacher
wailed
Hermione
who
was
crying
she
dropped
to
her
knees
beside
the
elf
and
tried
to
hug
him
at
once
he
was
on
his
feet
cringing
away
from
her
quite
obviously
repulsed
the
Mudblood
touched
Kreacher
he
will
not
allow
it
what
would
his
Mistress
say
i
told
you
not
to
call
her
Mudblood
snarled
Harry
but
the
elf
was
already
punishing
himself
he
fell
to
the
ground
and
banged
his
forehead
on
the
floor
stop
him
stop
him
hermione
cried
oh
dont
you
see
now
how
sick
it
is
the
way
theyve
got
to
obey
kreacher
stop
stop
shouted
Harry
the
elf
lay
on
the
floor
panting
and
shivering
green
mucus
glistening
around
his
snot
a
bruise
already
blooming
on
his
pallid
forehead
where
he
had
struck
himself
his
eyes
swollen
and
bloodshot
and
swimming
in
tears
harry
had
never
seen
anything
so
pitiful
so
you
brought
the
locket
home
he
said
relentlessly
for
he
was
determined
to
know
the
full
story
and
you
tried
to
destroy
it
nothing
Kreacher
did
made
any
mark
upon
it
moaned
the
elf
kreacher
tried
everything
everything
he
knew
but
nothing
nothing
would
work
so
many
powerful
spells
upon
the
casing
Kreacher
was
sure
the
way
to
destroy
it
was
to
get
inside
it
but
it
would
not
open
kreacher
punished
himself
he
tried
again
he
punished
himself
he
tried
again
kreacher
failed
to
obey
orders
Kreacher
could
not
destroy
the
locket
and
his
mistress
was
mad
with
grief
because
Master
Regulus
had
disappeared
and
Kreacher
could
not
tell
her
what
had
happened
no
because
Master
Regulus
had
f-f-forbidden
him
to
tell
any
of
the
f-f-family
what
happened
in
the
c-cave
kreacher
began
to
sob
so
hard
that
there
were
no
more
coherent
words
tears
flowed
down
Hermiones
cheeks
as
she
watched
Kreacher
but
she
did
not
dare
touch
him
again
even
Ron
who
was
no
fan
of
Kreachers
looked
troubled
harry
sat
back
on
his
heels
and
shook
his
head
trying
to
clear
it
i
dont
understand
you
Kreacher
he
said
finally
voldemort
tried
to
kill
you
Regulus
died
to
bring
Voldemort
down
but
you
were
still
happy
to
betray
Sirius
to
Voldemort
you
were
happy
to
go
to
Narcissa
and
Bellatrix
and
pass
information
to
Voldemort
through
them
harry
Kreacher
doesnt
think
like
that
said
Hermione
wiping
her
eyes
on
the
back
of
her
hand
hes
a
slave
house-elves
are
used
to
bad
even
brutal
treatment
what
Voldemort
did
to
Kreacher
wasnt
that
far
out
of
the
common
way
what
do
wizard
wars
mean
to
an
elf
like
Kreacher
hes
loyal
to
people
who
are
kind
to
him
and
Mrs
black
must
have
been
and
Regulus
certainly
was
so
he
served
them
willingly
and
parroted
their
beliefs
i
know
what
youre
going
to
say
she
went
on
as
Harry
began
to
protest
that
Regulus
changed
his
mind
but
he
doesnt
seem
to
have
explained
that
to
Kreacher
does
he
and
I
think
I
know
why
kreacher
and
Reguluss
family
were
all
safest
if
they
kept
to
the
old
pure-blood
line
regulus
was
trying
to
protect
them
all
sirius
sirius
was
horrible
to
Kreacher
Harry
and
its
no
good
looking
like
that
you
know
its
true
kreacher
had
been
alone
for
such
a
long
time
when
Sirius
came
to
live
here
and
he
was
probably
starving
for
a
bit
of
affection
im
sure
Miss
Cissy
and
Miss
Bella
were
perfectly
lovely
to
Kreacher
when
he
turned
up
so
he
did
them
a
favor
and
told
them
everything
they
wanted
to
know
ive
said
all
along
that
wizards
would
pay
for
how
they
treat
house-elves
well
Voldemort
did
and
so
did
Sirius
harry
had
no
retort
as
he
watched
Kreacher
sobbing
on
the
floor
he
remembered
what
Dumbledore
had
said
to
him
mere
hours
after
Siriuss
death
I
do
not
think
Sirius
ever
saw
Kreacher
as
a
being
with
feelings
as
acute
as
a
humans
kreacher
said
Harry
after
a
while
when
you
feel
up
to
it
er
please
sit
up
it
was
several
minutes
before
Kreacher
hiccupped
himself
into
silence
then
he
pushed
himself
into
a
sitting
position
again
rubbing
his
knuckles
into
his
eyes
like
a
small
child
kreacher
I
am
going
to
ask
you
to
do
something
said
Harry
he
glanced
at
Hermione
for
assistance
he
wanted
to
give
the
order
kindly
but
at
the
same
time
he
could
not
pretend
that
it
was
not
an
order
however
the
change
in
his
tone
seemed
to
have
gained
her
approval
She
smiled
encouragingly
kreacher
I
want
you
please
to
go
and
find
Mundungus
Fletcher
we
need
to
find
out
where
the
locket
where
Master
Reguluss
locket
it
its
really
important
we
want
to
finish
the
work
Master
Regulus
started
we
want
to
er
ensure
that
he
didnt
die
in
vain
kreacher
dropped
his
fists
and
looked
up
at
Harry
find
Mundungus
Fletcher
he
croaked
and
bring
him
here
to
Grimmauld
Place
said
Harry
do
you
think
you
could
do
that
for
us
as
Kreacher
nodded
and
got
to
his
feet
Harry
had
a
sudden
inspiration
he
pulled
out
Hagrids
purse
and
took
out
the
fake
Horcrux
the
substitute
locket
in
which
Regulus
had
placed
the
note
to
Voldemort
kreacher
Id
er
like
you
to
have
this
he
said
pressing
the
locket
into
the
elfs
hand
this
belonged
to
Regulus
and
Im
sure
hed
want
you
to
have
it
as
a
token
of
gratitude
for
what
you
overkill
mate
said
Ron
as
the
elf
took
one
look
at
the
locket
let
out
a
howl
of
shock
and
misery
and
threw
himself
back
onto
the
ground
it
took
them
nearly
half
an
hour
to
calm
down
Kreacher
who
was
so
overcome
to
be
presented
with
a
Black
family
heirloom
for
his
very
own
that
he
was
too
weak
at
the
knees
to
stand
properly
when
finally
he
was
able
to
totter
a
few
steps
they
all
accompanied
him
to
his
cupboard
watched
him
tuck
up
the
locket
safely
in
his
dirty
blankets
and
assured
him
that
they
would
make
its
protection
their
first
priority
while
he
was
away
he
then
made
two
low
bows
to
Harry
and
Ron
and
even
gave
a
funny
little
spasm
in
Hermiones
direction
that
might
have
been
an
attempt
at
a
respectful
salute
before
Disapparating
with
the
usual
loud
crack
chapter
Eleven
the
Bribe
if
Kreacher
could
escape
a
lake
full
of
Inferi
Harry
was
confident
that
the
capture
of
Mundungus
would
take
a
few
hours
at
most
and
he
prowled
the
house
all
morning
in
a
state
of
high
anticipation
however
Kreacher
did
not
return
that
morning
or
even
that
afternoon
by
nightfall
Harry
felt
discouraged
and
anxious
and
a
supper
composed
largely
of
moldy
bread
upon
which
Hermione
had
tried
a
variety
of
unsuccessful
Transfigurations
did
nothing
to
help
kreacher
did
not
return
the
following
day
nor
the
day
after
that
however
two
cloaked
men
had
appeared
in
the
square
outside
number
twelve
and
they
remained
there
into
the
night
gazing
in
the
direction
of
the
house
that
they
could
not
see
death
Eaters
for
sure
said
Ron
as
he
Harry
and
Hermione
watched
from
the
drawing
room
windows
reckon
they
know
were
in
here
i
dont
think
so
said
Hermione
though
she
looked
frightened
or
theyd
have
sent
Snape
in
after
us
wouldnt
they
dyou
reckon
hes
been
in
here
and
has
his
tongue
tied
by
Moodys
curse
asked
Ron
yes
said
Hermione
otherwise
hed
have
been
able
to
tell
that
lot
how
to
get
in
wouldnt
he
but
theyre
probably
watching
to
see
whether
we
turn
up
they
know
that
Harry
owns
the
house
after
all
how
do
they
began
Harry
wizarding
wills
are
examined
by
the
Ministry
remember
theyll
know
Sirius
left
you
the
place
the
presence
of
the
Death
Eaters
outside
increased
the
ominous
mood
inside
number
twelve
they
had
not
heard
a
word
form
anyone
beyond
Grimmauld
Place
since
mr.
Weasleys
Patronus
and
the
strain
was
starting
to
tell
restless
and
irritable
Ron
had
developed
an
annoying
habit
of
playing
with
the
Deluminator
in
his
pocket
This
particularly
infuriated
Hermione
who
was
whiling
away
the
wait
for
Kreacher
by
studying
The
Tales
of
Beedle
the
Bard
and
did
not
appreciate
the
way
the
lights
kept
flashing
on
and
off
will
you
stop
it
she
cried
on
the
third
evening
of
Kreachers
absence
as
all
the
light
was
sucked
from
the
drawing
room
yet
again
sorry
sorry
said
Ron
clicking
the
Deluminator
and
restoring
the
lights
i
dont
know
Im
doing
it
well
cant
you
find
something
useful
to
occupy
yourself
what
like
reading
kids
stories
dumbledore
left
me
this
book
Ron
and
he
left
me
the
Deluminator
maybe
Im
supposed
to
use
it
unable
to
stand
the
bickering
Harry
slipped
out
of
the
room
unnoticed
by
either
of
them
he
headed
downstairs
toward
the
kitchen
which
he
kept
visiting
because
he
was
sure
that
was
where
Kreacher
was
most
likely
to
reappear
halfway
down
the
flight
of
stairs
into
the
hall
however
he
heard
a
tap
on
the
front
door
then
metallic
clicks
and
the
grinding
of
the
chain
every
nerve
in
his
body
seemed
to
tauten
He
pulled
out
his
wand
moved
into
the
shadows
beside
the
decapitated
elf
heads
and
waited
the
door
opened
He
saw
a
glimpse
of
the
lamplit
square
outside
and
a
cloaked
figure
edged
into
the
hall
and
closed
the
door
behind
it
the
intruder
took
a
step
forward
and
Moodys
voice
asked
Severus
Snape
then
the
dust
figure
rose
from
the
end
of
the
hall
and
rushed
him
raising
its
dead
hand
it
was
not
I
who
killed
you
Albus
said
a
quiet
voice
the
jinx
broke
The
dust-figure
exploded
again
and
it
was
impossible
to
make
out
the
newcomer
through
the
dense
gray
cloud
it
left
behind
harry
pointed
the
wand
into
the
middle
of
it
dont
move
he
had
forgotten
the
portrait
of
Mrs
black
At
the
sound
of
his
yell
the
curtains
hiding
her
flew
open
and
she
began
to
scream
Mudbloods
and
filth
dishonoring
my
house
ron
and
Hermione
came
crashing
down
the
stairs
behind
Harry
wands
pointing
like
his
at
the
unknown
man
now
standing
with
his
arms
raised
in
the
hall
below
hold
your
fire
its
me
Remus
oh
thank
goodness
said
Hermione
weakly
pointing
her
wand
at
Mrs
black
instead
with
a
bang
the
curtains
swished
shut
again
and
silence
fell
ron
too
lowered
his
wand
but
Harry
did
not
show
yourself
he
called
back
lupin
moved
forward
into
the
lamplight
hands
still
held
high
in
a
gesture
of
surrender
i
am
Remus
John
Lupin
werewolf
sometimes
known
as
Moony
one
of
the
four
creators
of
the
Marauders
Map
married
to
Nymphadora
usually
known
as
Tonks
and
I
taught
you
how
to
produce
a
Patronus
Harry
which
takes
the
form
of
a
stag
oh
all
right
said
Harry
lowering
his
wand
but
I
had
to
check
didnt
I
speaking
as
your
ex-Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
teacher
I
quite
agree
that
you
had
to
check
ron
Hermione
you
shouldnt
be
so
quick
to
lower
your
defenses
they
ran
down
the
stairs
towards
him
wrapped
in
a
thick
black
traveling
cloak
he
looked
exhausted
but
pleased
to
see
them
no
sign
of
Severus
then
he
asked
no
said
Harry
whats
going
on
is
everyone
okay
yes
said
Lupin
but
were
all
being
watched
there
are
a
couple
of
Death
Eaters
in
the
square
outside
we
know
i
had
to
Apparate
very
precisely
onto
the
top
step
outside
the
front
door
to
be
sure
that
they
would
not
see
me
they
cant
know
youre
in
here
or
Im
sure
theyd
have
more
people
out
there
theyre
staking
out
everywhere
thats
got
any
connection
with
you
Harry
lets
go
downstairs
theres
a
lot
to
tell
you
and
I
want
to
know
what
happened
after
you
left
the
Burrow
they
descended
into
the
kitchen
where
Hermione
pointed
her
wand
at
the
grate
a
fire
sprang
up
instantly
It
gave
the
illusion
of
coziness
to
the
stark
stone
walls
and
glistened
off
the
long
wooden
table
lupin
pulled
a
few
butterbeers
from
beneath
his
traveling
cloak
and
they
sat
down
id
have
been
here
three
days
ago
but
I
needed
to
shake
off
the
Death
Eater
tailing
me
said
Lupin
so
you
came
straight
here
after
the
wedding
no
said
Harry
only
after
we
ran
into
a
couple
of
Death
Eaters
in
a
caf
on
Tottenham
Court
Road
lupin
slopped
most
of
his
butterbeer
down
his
front
what
they
explained
what
had
happened
when
they
had
finished
Lupin
looked
aghast
but
how
did
they
find
you
so
quickly
its
impossible
to
track
anyone
who
Apparates
unless
you
grab
hold
of
them
as
they
disappear
and
it
doesnt
seem
likely
they
were
just
strolling
down
Tottenham
Court
Road
at
the
time
does
it
said
Harry
we
wondered
said
Hermione
tentatively
whether
Harry
could
still
have
the
Trace
on
him
impossible
said
Lupin
ron
looked
smug
and
Harry
felt
hugely
relieved
apart
from
anything
else
theyd
know
for
sure
Harry
was
here
if
he
still
had
the
Trace
on
him
wouldnt
they
but
I
cant
see
how
they
could
have
tracked
you
to
Tottenham
Court
Road
thats
worrying
really
worrying
he
looked
disturbed
but
as
far
as
Harry
was
concerned
that
question
could
wait
tell
us
what
happened
after
we
left
we
havent
heard
a
thing
since
Rons
dad
told
us
the
family
was
safe
well
Kingsley
saved
us
said
Lupin
thanks
to
his
warning
most
of
the
wedding
guests
were
able
to
Disapparate
before
they
arrived
were
they
Death
Eaters
or
Ministry
people
interjected
Hermione
a
mixture
but
to
all
intents
and
purposes
theyre
the
same
thing
now
said
Lupin
there
were
about
a
dozen
of
them
but
they
didnt
know
you
were
there
Harry
arthur
heard
a
rumor
that
they
tried
to
torture
your
whereabouts
out
of
Scrimgeour
before
they
killed
him
if
its
true
he
didnt
give
you
away
harry
looked
at
Ron
and
Hermione
their
expressions
reflected
the
mingled
shock
and
gratitude
he
felt
he
had
never
liked
Scrimgeour
much
but
if
what
Lupin
said
was
true
the
mans
final
act
had
been
to
try
to
protect
Harry
the
Death
Eaters
searched
the
Burrow
from
top
to
bottom
Lupin
went
on
they
found
the
ghoul
but
didnt
want
to
get
too
close
and
then
they
interrogated
those
of
us
who
remained
for
hours
they
were
trying
to
get
information
on
you
Harry
but
of
course
nobody
apart
from
the
Order
knew
that
you
had
been
there
at
the
same
time
that
they
were
smashing
up
the
wedding
more
Death
Eaters
were
forcing
their
way
into
every
order-connected
house
in
the
country
no
deaths
he
added
quickly
forestalling
the
question
but
they
were
rough
they
burned
down
Dedalus
Diggles
house
but
as
you
know
he
wasnt
there
and
they
used
the
Cruciarus
Curse
on
Tonkss
family
again
trying
to
find
out
where
you
went
after
you
visited
them
theyre
all
right
shaken
obviously
but
otherwise
okay
the
Death
Eaters
got
through
all
those
protective
charms
harry
asked
remembering
how
effective
these
had
been
on
the
night
he
had
crashed
in
Tonkss
parents
garden
what
youve
got
to
realize
Harry
is
that
the
Death
Eaters
have
got
the
full
might
of
the
Ministry
on
their
side
now
said
Lupin
theyve
got
the
power
to
perform
brutal
spells
without
fear
of
identification
or
arrest
they
managed
to
penetrate
every
defensive
spell
wed
cast
against
them
and
once
inside
they
were
completely
open
about
why
theyd
come
and
are
they
bothering
to
give
an
excuse
for
torturing
Harrys
whereabouts
out
of
people
asked
Hermione
an
edge
to
her
voice
well
Lupin
said
he
hesitated
then
pulled
out
a
folded
copy
of
the
Daily
Prophet
here
he
said
pushing
it
across
the
table
to
Harry
youll
know
sooner
or
later
anyway
thats
their
pretext
for
going
after
you
harry
smoothed
out
the
paper
a
huge
photograph
of
his
own
face
filled
the
front
page
he
read
the
headline
over
it
wanted
for
questioning
about
the
death
of
albus
dumbledore
ron
and
Hermione
gave
roars
of
outrage
but
Harry
said
nothing
he
pushed
the
newspaper
away
he
did
not
want
to
read
anymore
He
knew
what
it
would
say
nobody
but
those
who
had
been
on
top
of
the
tower
when
Dumbledore
died
knew
who
had
really
killed
him
and
as
Rita
Skeeter
had
already
told
the
Wizarding
world
Harry
had
been
seen
running
from
the
place
moments
after
Dumbledore
had
fallen
im
sorry
Harry
Lupin
said
so
Death
Eaters
have
taken
over
the
Daily
Prophet
too
asked
Hermione
furiously
lupin
nodded
but
surely
people
realize
whats
going
on
the
coup
has
been
smooth
and
virtually
silent
said
Lupin
the
official
version
of
Scrimgeours
murder
is
that
he
resigned
he
has
been
replaced
by
Pius
Thicknesse
who
is
under
the
Imperius
Curse
why
didnt
Voldemort
declare
himself
Minister
of
Magic
asked
Ron
lupin
laughed
he
doesnt
need
to
Ron
effectively
he
is
the
Minister
but
why
should
he
sit
behind
a
desk
at
the
Ministry
his
puppet
Thicknesse
is
taking
care
of
everyday
business
leaving
Voldemort
free
to
extend
his
power
beyond
the
Ministry
naturally
many
people
have
deduced
what
has
happened
There
has
been
such
a
dramatic
change
in
Ministry
policy
in
the
last
few
days
and
many
are
whispering
that
Voldemort
must
be
behind
it
however
that
is
the
point
They
whisper
they
darent
confide
in
each
other
not
knowing
whom
to
trust
they
are
scared
to
speak
out
in
case
their
suspicions
are
true
and
their
families
are
targeted
yes
Voldemort
is
playing
a
very
clever
game
declaring
himself
might
have
provoked
open
rebellion
Remaining
masked
has
created
confusion
uncertainty
and
fear
and
this
dramatic
change
in
Ministry
policy
said
Harry
involves
warning
the
Wizarding
world
against
me
instead
of
Voldemort
thats
certainly
a
part
of
it
said
Lupin
and
it
is
a
masterstroke
now
that
Dumbledore
is
dead
you
the
Boy
Who
Lived
were
sure
to
be
the
symbol
and
rallying
point
for
any
resistance
to
Voldemort
but
by
suggesting
that
you
had
a
hand
in
the
old
hats
death
Voldemort
has
not
only
set
a
price
upon
your
head
but
sown
doubt
and
fear
amongst
many
who
would
have
defended
you
meanwhile
the
Ministry
has
started
moving
against
muggle-borns
lupin
pointed
at
the
Daily
Prophet
look
at
page
two
hermione
turned
the
pages
with
much
the
same
expression
of
distaste
she
had
when
handling
Secrets
of
the
Darkest
Art
muggle-born
Register
she
read
aloud
The
Ministry
of
Magic
is
undertaking
a
survey
of
so-called
muggle-borns
the
better
to
understand
how
they
came
to
possess
magical
secrets
Recent
research
undertaken
by
the
Department
of
Mysteries
reveals
that
magic
can
only
be
passed
from
person
to
person
when
Wizards
reproduce
where
no
proven
Wizarding
ancestry
exists
therefore
the
so-called
muggle-born
is
likely
to
have
obtained
magical
power
by
theft
or
force
The
Ministry
is
determined
to
root
out
such
usurpers
of
magical
power
and
to
this
end
has
issued
an
invitation
to
every
so-called
muggle-born
to
present
themselves
for
interview
by
the
newly
appointed
muggle-born
Registration
Commission
people
wont
let
this
happen
said
Ron
it
is
happening
Ron
said
Lupin
muggle-borns
are
being
rounded
up
as
we
speak
but
how
are
they
supposed
to
have
stolen
magic
said
Ron
its
mental
if
you
could
steal
magic
there
wouldnt
be
any
Squibs
would
there
i
know
said
Lupin
nevertheless
unless
you
can
prove
that
you
have
at
least
one
close
Wizarding
relative
you
are
now
deemed
to
have
obtained
your
magical
power
illegally
and
must
suffer
the
punishment
ron
glanced
at
Hermione
then
said
What
if
purebloods
and
halfbloods
swear
a
muggle-borns
part
of
their
family
ill
tell
everyone
Hermiones
my
cousin
hermione
covered
Rons
hand
with
hers
and
squeezed
it
thank
you
Ron
but
I
couldnt
let
you
you
wont
have
a
choice
said
Ron
fiercely
gripping
her
hand
back
ill
teach
you
my
family
tree
so
you
can
answer
questions
on
it
hermione
gave
a
shaky
laugh
ron
as
were
on
the
run
with
Harry
Potter
the
most
wanted
person
in
the
country
I
dont
think
it
matters
if
I
was
going
back
to
school
it
would
be
different
whats
Voldemort
planning
for
Hogwarts
she
asked
Lupin
attendance
is
now
compulsory
for
every
young
witch
and
wizard
he
replied
that
was
announced
yesterday
its
a
change
because
it
was
never
obligatory
before
of
course
nearly
every
witch
and
wizard
in
Britain
has
been
educated
at
Hogwarts
but
their
parents
had
the
right
to
teach
them
at
home
or
send
them
abroad
if
they
preferred
this
way
Voldemort
will
have
the
whole
Wizarding
population
under
his
eye
from
a
young
age
and
its
also
another
way
of
weeding
out
muggle-borns
because
students
must
be
given
Blood
Status
meaning
that
they
have
proven
to
the
Ministry
that
they
are
of
Wizard
descent
before
they
are
allowed
to
attend
harry
felt
sickened
and
angry
At
this
moment
excited
eleven-year-olds
would
be
poring
over
stacks
of
newly
purchased
spell-books
unaware
that
they
would
never
see
Hogwarts
perhaps
never
see
their
families
again
either
its
its
he
muttered
struggling
to
find
words
that
did
justice
to
the
horror
of
his
thoughts
but
Lupin
said
quietly
i
know
lupin
hesitated
ill
understand
if
you
cant
confirm
this
Harry
but
the
Order
is
under
the
impression
that
Dumbledore
left
you
a
mission
he
did
Harry
replied
and
Ron
and
Hermione
are
in
on
it
and
theyre
coming
with
me
can
you
confide
in
me
what
the
mission
is
harry
looked
into
the
prematurely
lined
face
framed
in
thick
but
graying
hair
and
wished
that
he
could
return
a
different
answer
i
cant
Remus
Im
sorry
if
Dumbledore
didnt
tell
you
I
dont
think
I
can
i
thought
youd
say
that
said
Lupin
looking
disappointed
but
I
might
still
be
of
some
use
to
you
you
know
what
I
am
and
what
I
can
do
i
could
come
with
you
to
provide
protection
there
would
be
no
need
to
tell
me
exactly
what
you
were
up
to
harry
hesitated
it
was
a
very
tempting
offer
though
how
they
would
be
able
to
keep
their
mission
secret
from
Lupin
if
he
were
with
them
all
the
time
he
could
not
imagine
hermione
however
looked
puzzled
but
what
about
Tonks
she
asked
what
about
her
said
Lupin
well
said
Hermione
frowning
youre
married
how
does
she
feel
about
you
going
away
with
us
tonks
will
be
perfectly
safe
said
Lupin
Shell
be
at
her
parents
house
there
was
something
strange
in
Lupins
tone
it
was
almost
cold
there
was
also
something
odd
in
the
idea
of
Tonks
remaining
hidden
at
her
parents
house
she
was
after
all
a
member
of
the
Order
and
as
far
as
Harry
knew
was
likely
to
want
to
be
in
the
thick
of
the
action
remus
said
Hermione
tentatively
is
everything
all
right
you
know
between
you
and
everything
is
fine
thank
you
said
Lupin
pointedly
hermione
turned
pink
there
was
another
pause
an
awkward
and
embarrassed
one
and
then
Lupin
said
with
an
air
of
forcing
himself
to
admit
something
unpleasant
Tonks
is
going
to
have
a
baby
oh
how
wonderful
squealed
Hermione
excellent
said
Ron
enthusiastically
congratulations
said
Harry
lupin
gave
an
artificial
smile
that
was
more
like
a
grimace
then
said
So
do
you
accept
my
offer
will
three
become
four
i
cannot
believe
that
Dumbledore
would
have
disapproved
he
appointed
me
your
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
teacher
after
all
and
I
must
tell
you
that
I
believe
we
are
facing
magic
many
of
us
have
never
encountered
or
imagined
ron
and
Hermione
both
looked
at
Harry
just
just
to
be
clear
he
said
you
want
to
leave
Tonks
at
her
parents
house
and
come
away
with
us
shell
be
perfectly
safe
there
theyll
look
after
her
said
Lupin
he
spoke
with
a
finality
bordering
on
indifference
Harry
Im
sure
James
would
have
wanted
me
to
stick
with
you
well
said
Harry
slowly
Im
not
im
pretty
sure
my
father
would
have
wanted
to
know
why
you
arent
sticking
with
your
own
kid
actually
lupins
face
drained
of
color
the
temperature
in
the
kitchen
might
have
dropped
ten
degrees
ron
stared
around
the
room
as
though
he
had
been
bidden
to
memorize
it
while
Hermiones
eyes
swiveled
backward
and
forward
from
Harry
to
Lupin
you
dont
understand
said
Lupin
at
last
explain
then
said
Harry
lupin
swallowed
i
I
made
a
grave
mistake
in
marrying
Tonks
i
did
it
against
my
better
judgment
and
have
regretted
it
very
much
every
since
i
see
said
Harry
so
youre
just
going
to
dump
her
and
the
kid
and
run
off
with
us
lupin
sprang
to
his
feet
His
chair
toppled
over
backward
and
he
glared
at
them
so
fiercely
that
Harry
saw
for
the
first
time
ever
she
shadow
of
the
wolf
upon
his
human
face
dont
you
understand
what
Ive
done
to
my
wife
and
my
unborn
child
i
should
never
have
married
her
Ive
made
her
an
outcast
lupin
kicked
aside
the
chair
he
had
overturned
you
have
only
ever
seen
me
amongst
the
Order
or
under
Dumbledores
protection
at
Hogwarts
you
dont
know
how
most
of
the
Wizarding
world
sees
creatures
like
me
when
they
know
of
my
affliction
they
can
barely
talk
to
me
dont
you
see
what
Ive
done
even
her
own
family
is
disgusted
by
our
marriage
what
parents
want
their
only
daughter
to
marry
a
werewolf
and
the
child
the
child
lupin
actually
seized
handfuls
of
his
own
hair
he
looked
quite
deranged
my
kind
dont
usually
breed
it
will
be
like
me
I
am
convinced
of
it
how
can
I
forgive
myself
when
I
knowingly
risked
passing
on
my
own
condition
to
an
innocent
child
and
if
by
some
miracle
it
is
not
like
me
then
it
will
be
better
off
a
hundred
times
so
without
a
father
of
whom
it
must
always
be
ashamed
remus
whispered
Hermione
tears
in
her
eyes
dont
say
that
how
could
any
child
be
ashamed
of
you
oh
I
dont
know
Hermione
said
Harry
id
be
pretty
ashamed
of
him
harry
did
not
know
where
his
rage
was
coming
from
but
it
had
propelled
him
to
his
feet
too
lupin
looked
as
though
Harry
had
hit
him
if
the
new
regime
thinks
muggle-borns
are
bad
Harry
said
what
will
they
do
to
a
half-werewolf
whose
fathers
in
the
Order
my
father
died
trying
to
protect
my
mother
and
me
and
you
reckon
hed
tell
you
to
abandon
your
kid
to
go
on
an
adventure
with
us
how
how
dare
you
said
Lupin
this
is
not
about
a
desire
for
for
danger
or
personal
glory
how
dare
you
suggest
such
a
i
think
youre
feeling
a
bit
of
a
daredevil
Harry
said
You
fancy
stepping
into
Siriuss
shoes
harry
no
hermione
begged
him
but
he
continued
to
glare
into
Lupins
livid
face
id
never
have
believed
this
Harry
said
the
man
who
taught
me
to
fight
dementors
a
coward
lupin
drew
his
wand
so
fast
that
Harry
had
barely
reached
for
his
own
there
was
a
loud
bang
and
he
felt
himself
flying
backward
as
if
punched
as
he
slammed
into
the
kitchen
wall
and
slid
to
the
floor
he
glimpsed
the
tail
of
Lupins
cloak
disappearing
around
the
door
remus
Remus
come
back
hermione
cried
but
Lupin
did
not
respond
a
moment
later
they
heard
the
front
door
slam
harry
wailed
Hermione
how
could
you
it
was
easy
said
Harry
he
stood
up
he
could
feel
a
lump
swelling
where
his
head
had
hit
the
wall
he
was
still
so
full
of
anger
he
was
shaking
dont
look
at
me
like
that
he
snapped
at
Hermione
dont
you
start
on
her
snarled
Ron
no
no
we
mustnt
fight
said
Hermione
launching
herself
between
them
you
shouldnt
have
said
that
stuff
to
Lupin
Ron
told
Harry
he
had
it
coming
to
him
said
Harry
broken
images
were
racing
each
other
through
his
mind
Sirius
falling
through
the
veil
Dumbledore
suspended
broken
in
midair
a
flash
of
green
light
and
his
mothers
voice
begging
for
mercy
parents
said
Harry
shouldnt
leave
their
kids
unless
unless
theyve
got
to
harry
said
Hermione
stretching
out
a
consoling
hand
but
he
shrugged
it
off
and
walked
away
his
eyes
on
the
fire
Hermione
had
conjured
he
had
once
spoken
to
Lupin
out
of
that
fireplace
seeking
reassurance
about
James
and
Lupin
had
consoled
him
now
Lupins
tortured
white
face
seemed
to
swim
in
the
air
before
him
he
felt
a
sickening
surge
of
remorse
neither
Ron
nor
Hermione
spoke
but
Harry
felt
sure
that
they
were
looking
at
each
other
behind
his
back
communicating
silently
he
turned
around
and
caught
them
turning
hurriedly
away
form
each
other
i
know
I
shouldnt
have
called
him
a
coward
no
you
shouldnt
said
Ron
at
once
but
hes
acting
like
one
all
the
same
said
Hermione
i
know
said
Harry
but
if
it
makes
him
go
back
to
Tonks
itll
be
worth
it
wont
it
he
could
not
keep
the
plea
out
of
his
voice
hermione
looked
sympathetic
Ron
uncertain
harry
looked
down
at
his
feet
thinking
of
his
father
would
James
have
backed
Harry
in
what
he
had
said
to
Lupin
or
would
he
have
been
angry
at
how
his
son
had
treated
his
old
friend
the
silent
kitchen
seemed
to
hum
with
the
shock
of
the
recent
scene
and
with
Ron
and
Hermiones
unspoken
reproaches
the
Daily
Prophet
Lupin
had
brought
was
still
lying
on
the
table
Harrys
own
face
staring
up
at
the
ceiling
from
the
front
page
he
walked
over
to
it
and
sat
down
opened
the
paper
at
random
and
pretended
to
read
he
could
not
take
in
the
words
his
mind
was
still
too
full
of
the
encounter
with
Lupin
he
was
sure
that
Ron
and
Hermione
had
resumed
their
silent
communications
on
the
other
side
of
the
Prophet
he
turned
a
page
loudly
and
Dumbledores
name
leapt
out
at
him
it
was
a
moment
or
two
before
he
took
in
the
meaning
of
the
photograph
which
showed
a
family
group
beneath
the
photograph
were
the
words
The
Dumbledore
family
left
to
right
Albus
Percival
holding
newborn
Ariana
Kendra
and
Aberforth
his
attention
caught
Harry
examined
the
picture
more
carefully
dumbledores
father
Percival
was
a
good-looking
man
with
eyes
that
seemed
to
twinkle
even
in
this
faded
old
photograph
the
baby
Ariana
was
a
little
longer
than
a
loaf
of
bread
and
no
more
distinctive-looking
the
mother
Kendra
had
jet
black
hair
pulled
into
a
high
bun
her
face
had
a
carved
quality
about
it
harry
thought
of
photos
of
Native
Americans
hed
seen
as
he
studied
her
dark
eyes
high
cheekbones
and
straight
nose
formally
composed
above
a
high-necked
silk
gown
albus
and
Aberforth
wore
matching
lacy
collared
jackets
and
had
identical
shoulder-length
hairstyles
albus
looked
several
years
older
but
otherwise
the
two
boys
looked
very
alike
for
this
was
before
Albuss
nose
had
been
broken
and
before
he
started
wearing
glasses
the
family
looked
quite
happy
and
normal
smiling
serenely
up
out
of
the
newspaper
baby
Arianas
arm
waved
vaguely
out
of
her
shawl
harry
looked
above
the
picture
and
saw
the
headline
exclusive
extract
from
upcoming
biography
of
albus
dumbledore
by
Rita
Skeeter
thinking
it
could
hardly
make
him
feel
any
worse
than
he
already
did
Harry
began
to
read
proud
and
haughty
Kendra
Dumbledore
could
not
bear
to
remain
in
Mould-on-the-Wold
after
her
husband
Percivals
well-publicized
arrest
and
imprisonment
in
Azkaban
she
therefore
decided
to
uproot
the
family
and
relocate
to
Godrics
Hollow
the
village
that
was
later
to
gain
fame
as
the
scene
of
Harry
Potters
strange
escape
from
You-Know-Who
like
Mould-on-the-Wold
Godrics
Hollow
was
home
to
a
number
of
Wizarding
families
but
as
Kendra
knew
none
of
them
she
would
be
spared
the
curiosity
about
her
husbands
crime
she
had
faced
in
her
former
village
by
repeatedly
rebuffing
the
friendly
advances
of
her
new
Wizarding
neighbors
she
soon
ensured
that
her
family
was
left
well
alone
slammed
the
door
in
my
face
when
I
went
around
to
welcome
her
with
a
batch
of
homemade
Cauldron
Cakes
says
Bathilda
Bagshot
the
first
year
they
were
there
I
only
ever
saw
the
two
boys
wouldnt
have
known
there
was
a
daughter
if
I
hadnt
been
picking
Plangentines
by
moonlight
the
winter
after
they
moved
in
and
saw
Kendra
leading
Ariana
out
into
the
back
garden
walked
her
round
the
lawn
once
keeping
a
firm
grip
on
her
then
took
her
back
inside
didnt
know
what
to
make
of
it
it
seems
that
Kendra
thought
the
move
to
Godrics
Hollow
was
the
perfect
opportunity
to
hide
Ariana
once
and
for
all
something
she
had
probably
been
planning
for
years
the
timing
was
significant
ariana
was
barely
seven
years
old
when
she
vanished
from
sight
and
seven
is
the
age
by
which
most
experts
agree
that
magic
will
have
revealed
itself
if
present
nobody
now
alive
remembers
Ariana
ever
demonstrating
even
the
slightest
sign
of
magical
ability
it
seems
clear
therefore
that
Kendra
made
a
decision
to
hide
her
daughters
existence
rather
than
suffer
the
shame
of
admitting
that
she
had
produced
a
Squib
moving
away
from
the
friends
and
neighbors
who
knew
Ariana
would
of
course
make
imprisoning
her
all
the
easier
the
tiny
number
of
people
who
henceforth
knew
of
Arianas
existence
could
be
counted
upon
to
keep
the
secret
including
her
two
brothers
who
had
deflected
awkward
questions
with
the
answer
their
mother
had
taught
them
my
sister
is
too
frail
for
school
next
week
Albus
Dumbledore
at
Hogwarts
the
Prizes
and
the
Pretense
harry
had
been
wrong
What
he
had
read
had
indeed
made
him
feel
worse
he
looked
back
at
the
photograph
of
the
apparently
happy
family
was
it
true
how
could
he
find
out
he
wanted
to
go
to
Godrics
Hollow
even
if
Bathilda
was
in
no
fit
state
to
talk
to
him
he
wanted
to
visit
the
place
where
he
and
Dumbledore
had
both
lost
loved
ones
he
was
in
the
process
of
lowering
the
newspaper
to
ask
Rons
and
Hermiones
opinions
when
a
deafening
crack
echoed
around
the
kitchen
for
the
first
time
in
three
days
Harry
had
forgotten
all
about
Kreacher
his
immediate
thought
was
that
Lupin
had
burst
back
into
the
room
and
for
a
split
second
he
did
not
take
in
the
mass
of
struggling
limbs
that
had
appeared
out
of
thin
air
right
beside
his
chair
he
hurried
to
his
feet
as
Kreacher
disentangled
himself
and
bowing
low
to
Harry
croaked
Kreacher
has
returned
with
the
thief
Mundungus
Fletcher
Master
mundungus
scrambled
up
and
pulled
out
his
wand
Hermione
however
was
too
quick
for
him
expelliarmus
mundunguss
wand
soared
into
the
air
and
Hermione
caught
it
wild-eyed
Mundungus
dived
for
the
stairs
ron
rugby-tackled
him
and
Mundungus
hit
the
stone
floor
with
a
muffled
crunch
what
he
bellowed
writhing
in
his
attempts
to
free
himself
from
Rons
grip
whave
I
done
setting
a
bleedin
house-elf
on
me
what
are
you
playing
at
whave
I
done
lemme
go
lemme
go
of
youre
not
in
much
of
a
position
to
make
threats
said
Harry
he
threw
aside
the
newspaper
crossed
the
kitchen
in
a
few
strides
and
dropped
to
his
knees
beside
Mundungus
who
stopped
struggling
and
looked
terrified
ron
got
up
panting
and
watched
as
Harry
pointed
his
wand
deliberately
at
Mundunguss
nose
mundungus
stank
of
stale
sweat
and
tobacco
smoke
his
hair
was
matted
and
his
robes
stained
kreacher
apologizes
for
the
delay
in
bringing
the
thief
Master
croaked
the
elf
fletcher
knows
how
to
avoid
capture
has
many
hidey-holes
and
accomplices
nevertheless
Kreacher
cornered
the
thief
in
the
end
youve
done
really
well
Kreacher
said
Harry
and
the
elf
bowed
low
right
weve
got
a
few
questions
for
you
Harry
told
Mundungus
who
shouted
at
once
i
panicked
okay
i
never
wanted
to
come
along
no
offense
mate
but
I
never
volunteered
to
die
for
you
an
that
was
bleedin
You-Know-Who
come
flying
at
me
anyone
woulda
got
outta
there
i
said
all
along
I
didnt
wanna
do
it
for
your
information
none
of
the
rest
of
us
Disapparated
said
Hermione
well

bunch
of
bleedin
eroes
then

but
I
never
pretended
I
was
up
for
killing
meself
were
not
interested
in
why
you
ran
out
on
Mad-Eye
said
Harry
moving
his
wand
a
little
closer
to
Mundunguss
baggy
bloodshot
eyes
we
already
knew
you
were
an
unreliable
bit
of
scum
well
then
why
the
ell
am
I
being
unted
down
by
ouse-elves
or
is
this
about
them
goblets
again
i
aint
got
none
of
em
left
or
you
could
ave
em
its
not
about
the
goblets
either
although
youre
getting
warmer
said
Harry
shut
up
and
listen
it
felt
wonderful
to
have
something
to
do
someone
of
whom
he
could
demand
some
small
portion
of
truth
harrys
wand
was
now
so
close
to
the
bridge
of
Mundunguss
nose
that
Mundungus
had
gone
cross-eyed
trying
to
keep
it
in
view
when
you
cleaned
out
this
house
of
anything
valuable
Harry
began
but
Mundungus
interrupted
him
again
sirius
never
cared
about
any
of
the
junk
there
was
the
sound
of
pattering
fee
a
blaze
of
shining
copper
an
echoing
clang
and
a
shriek
of
agony
Kreacher
had
taken
a
run
at
Mundungus
and
hit
him
over
the
head
with
a
saucepan
call
im
off
call
im
off
e
should
be
locked
up
screamed
Mundungus
cowering
as
Kreacher
raised
the
heavy-bottomed
pan
again
kreacher
no
shouted
Harry
kreachers
thin
arms
trembled
with
the
weight
of
the
pan
still
held
aloft
perhaps
just
one
more
Master
Harry
for
luck
ron
laughed
we
need
him
conscious
Kreacher
but
if
he
needs
persuading
you
can
do
the
honors
said
Harry
thank
you
very
much
Master
said
Kreacher
with
a
bow
and
he
retreated
a
short
distance
his
great
pale
eyes
still
fixed
upon
Mundungus
with
loathing
when
you
stripped
this
house
of
all
the
valuables
you
could
find
Harry
began
again
you
took
a
bunch
of
stuff
from
the
kitchen
cupboard
there
was
a
locket
there
harrys
mouth
was
suddenly
dry
He
could
sense
Ron
and
Hermiones
tension
and
excitement
too
what
did
you
do
with
it
why
asked
Mundungus
is
it
valuable
youve
still
got
it
cried
Hermione
no
he
hasnt
said
Ron
shrewdly
hes
wondering
whether
he
should
have
asked
more
money
for
it
more
said
Mundungus
that
wouldnt
have
been
effing
difficult
bleedin

it

on

of

he
frowned
and
then
added
Looked

harry
dropped
his
wand
It
hit
Mundungus
on
the
nose
and
shot
red
sparks
into
his
eyebrows
which
ignited
aquamenti
screamed
Hermione
and
a
jet
of
water
streamed
from
her
wand
engulfing
a
spluttering
and
choking
Mundungus
harry
looked
up
and
saw
his
own
shock
reflected
in
Rons
and
Hermiones
faces
the
scars
on
the
back
of
his
right
hand
seemed
to
be
tingling
again
chapter
Twelve
magic
is
Might
as
August
wore
on
the
square
of
unkempt
grass
in
the
middle
of
Grimmauld
Place
shriveled
in
the
sun
until
it
was
brittle
and
brown
the
inhabitants
of
number
twelve
were
never
seen
by
anyone
in
the
surrounding
houses
and
nor
was
number
twelve
itself
the
muggles
who
lived
in
Grimmauld
Place
had
long
since
accepted
the
amusing
mistake
in
the
numbering
that
had
caused
number
eleven
to
sit
beside
number
thirteen
and
yet
the
square
was
now
attracting
a
trickle
of
visitors
who
seemed
to
find
the
anomaly
most
intriguing
barely
a
day
passed
without
one
or
two
people
arriving
in
Grimmauld
Place
with
no
other
purpose
or
so
it
seemed
than
to
lean
against
the
railings
facing
numbers
eleven
and
thirteen
watching
the
join
between
the
two
houses
the
lurkers
were
never
the
same
two
days
running
although
they
all
seemed
to
share
a
dislike
for
normal
clothing
most
of
the
Londoners
who
passed
them
were
used
to
eccentric
dressers
and
took
little
notice
though
occasionally
one
of
them
might
glance
back
wondering
why
anyone
would
wear
cloaks
in
this
heat
the
watchers
seemed
to
be
gleaning
little
satisfaction
from
their
vigil
occasionally
one
of
them
started
forward
excitedly
as
if
they
had
seen
something
interesting
at
last
only
to
fall
back
looking
disappointed
on
the
first
day
of
September
there
were
more
people
lurking
in
the
square
than
ever
before
half
a
dozen
men
in
long
cloaks
stood
silent
and
watchful
gazing
as
ever
at
houses
eleven
and
thirteen
but
the
thing
for
which
they
were
waiting
still
appeared
elusive
as
evening
drew
in
bringing
with
it
an
unexpected
gust
of
chilly
rain
for
the
first
time
in
weeks
there
occurred
one
of
those
inexplicable
moments
when
they
appeared
to
have
seen
something
interesting
the
man
with
the
twisted
face
pointed
and
his
closest
companion
a
podgy
pallid
man
started
forward
but
a
moment
later
they
had
relaxed
into
their
previous
state
of
inactivity
looking
frustrated
and
disappointed
meanwhile
inside
number
twelve
Harry
had
just
entered
the
hall
he
had
nearly
lost
his
balance
as
he
Apparated
onto
the
top
step
just
outside
the
front
door
and
thought
that
the
Death
Eaters
might
have
caught
a
glimpse
of
his
momentarily
exposed
elbow
shutting
the
front
door
carefully
behind
him
he
pulled
off
the
Invisibility
Cloak
draped
it
over
his
arm
and
hurried
along
the
gloomy
hallway
toward
the
door
that
led
to
the
basement
a
stolen
copy
of
the
Daily
Prophet
clutched
in
his
hand
the
usual
low
whisper
of
Severus
Snape
greeted
him
the
chill
wind
swept
him
and
his
tongue
rolled
up
for
a
moment
i
didnt
kill
you
he
said
once
it
had
unrolled
then
held
his
breath
as
the
dusty
jinx-figure
exploded
he
waited
until
he
was
halfway
down
the
stairs
to
the
kitchen
out
of
earshot
of
Mrs
black
and
clear
of
the
dust
cloud
before
calling
Ive
got
news
and
you
wont
like
it
the
kitchen
was
almost
unrecognizable
every
surface
now
shone
Copper
pots
and
pans
had
been
burnished
to
a
rosy
glow
the
wooden
tabletop
gleamed
the
goblets
and
plates
already
laid
for
dinner
glinted
in
the
light
from
a
merrily
blazing
fire
on
which
a
cauldron
was
simmering
nothing
in
the
room
however
was
more
dramatically
different
than
the
house-elf
who
now
came
hurrying
toward
Harry
dressed
in
a
snowy-white
towel
his
ear
hair
as
clean
and
fluffy
as
cotton
wool
Reguluss
locket
bouncing
on
his
thin
chest
shoes
off
if
you
please
Master
Harry
and
hands
washed
before
dinner
croaked
Kreacher
seizing
the
Invisibility
Cloak
and
slouching
off
to
hang
it
on
a
hook
on
the
wall
beside
a
number
of
old-fashioned
robes
that
had
been
freshly
laundered
whats
happened
ron
asked
apprehensively
he
are
Hermione
had
been
pouring
over
a
sheaf
of
scribbled
notes
and
hand
drawn
maps
that
littered
the
end
of
the
long
kitchen
table
but
now
they
watched
Harry
as
he
strode
toward
them
and
threw
down
the
newspaper
on
top
of
their
scattered
parchment
a
large
picture
of
a
familiar
hook-nosed
black-haired
man
stared
up
at
them
all
beneath
a
headline
that
read
severus
snape
confirmed
as
hogwarts
headmaster
no
said
Ron
and
Hermione
loudly
hermione
was
quickest
she
snatched
up
the
newspaper
and
began
to
read
the
accompanying
story
out
loud
severus
Snape
long-standing
Potions
master
at
Hogwarts
School
of
Witchcraft
and
wizardry
was
today
appointed
headmaster
in
the
most
important
of
several
staffing
changes
at
the
ancient
school
following
the
resignation
of
the
previous
Muggle
Studies
teacher
Alecto
Carrow
will
take
over
the
post
while
her
brother
Amycus
fills
the
position
of
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
professor
I
welcome
the
opportunity
to
uphold
our
finest
Wizarding
traditions
and
values
Like
committing
murder
and
cutting
off
peoples
ears
I
suppose
snape
headmaster
snape
in
Dumbledores
study
Merlins
pants
she
shrieked
making
both
Harry
and
Ron
jump
she
leapt
up
from
the
table
and
hurtled
from
the
room
shouting
as
she
went
Ill
be
back
in
a
minute
Merlins
pants
repeated
Ron
looking
amused
she
must
be
upset
he
pulled
the
newspaper
toward
him
and
perused
the
article
about
Snape
the
other
teachers
wont
stand
for
this
McGonagall
and
Flitwick
and
Sprout
all
know
the
truth
they
know
how
Dumbledore
died
they
wont
accept
Snape
as
headmaster
and
who
are
these
Carrows
death
Eaters
said
Harry
there
are
pictures
of
them
inside
they
were
at
the
top
of
the
tower
when
Snape
killed
Dumbledore
so
its
all
friends
together
and
Harry
went
on
bitterly
drawing
up
a
chair
I
cant
see
that
the
other
teachers
have
got
any
choice
but
to
stay
if
the
Ministry
and
Voldemort
are
behind
Snape
itll
be
a
choice
between
staying
and
teaching
or
a
nice
few
years
in
Azkaban
and
thats
if
theyre
lucky
i
reckon
theyll
stay
to
try
and
protect
the
students
kreacher
came
bustling
to
the
table
with
a
large
curcen
in
his
hands
and
ladled
out
soup
into
pristine
bowls
whistling
between
his
teeth
as
he
did
so
thanks
Kreacher
said
Harry
flipping
over
the
Prophet
so
as
not
to
have
to
look
at
Snapes
face
well
at
least
we
know
exactly
where
Snape
is
now
he
began
to
spoon
soup
into
his
mouth
the
quality
of
Kreachers
cooking
had
improved
dramatically
ever
since
he
had
been
given
Reguluss
locket
Todays
French
onion
was
as
good
as
Harry
had
ever
tasted
there
are
still
a
load
of
Death
Eaters
watching
this
house
he
told
Ron
as
he
ate
more
than
usual
its
like
theyre
hoping
well
march
out
carrying
our
school
trunks
and
head
off
for
the
Hogwarts
Express
ron
glanced
at
his
watch
ive
been
thinking
about
that
all
day
it
left
nearly
six
hours
ago
weird
not
being
on
it
isnt
it
in
his
minds
eye
Harry
seemed
to
see
the
scarlet
steam
engine
as
he
and
Ron
had
once
followed
it
by
air
shimmering
between
fields
and
hills
a
rippling
scarlet
caterpillar
he
was
sure
Ginny
Neville
and
Luna
were
sitting
together
at
this
moment
perhaps
wondering
where
he
Ron
and
Hermione
were
or
debating
how
best
to
undermine
Snapes
new
regime
they
nearly
saw
me
coming
back
in
just
now
Harry
said
I
landed
badly
on
the
top
step
and
the
Cloak
slipped
i
do
that
every
time
oh
here
she
is
Ron
added
craning
around
in
his
seat
to
watch
Hermione
reentering
the
kitchen
and
what
in
the
name
of
Merlins
most
baggy
Y
Fronts
was
that
about
i
remembered
this
Hermione
panted
she
was
carrying
a
large
framed
picture
which
she
now
lowered
to
the
floor
before
seizing
her
small
beaded
bag
from
the
kitchen
sideboard
opening
it
she
proceeded
to
force
the
painting
inside
and
despite
the
fact
that
it
was
patently
too
large
to
fit
inside
the
tiny
bag
within
a
few
seconds
it
had
vanished
like
so
much
ease
into
the
bags
capacious
depths
phineas
Nigellus
Hermione
explained
as
she
threw
the
bag
onto
the
kitchen
table
with
the
usual
sonorous
clanking
crash
sorry
said
Ron
but
Harry
understood
the
painted
image
of
Phineas
Nigellus
Black
was
able
to
travel
between
his
portrait
in
Grimmauld
Place
and
the
one
that
hung
in
the
headmasters
office
at
Hogwarts
the
circular
cower-top
room
where
Snape
was
no
doubt
sitting
right
now
in
triumphant
possession
of
Dumbledores
collection
of
delicate
silver
magical
instruments
the
stone
Pensieve
the
Sorting
Hat
and
unless
it
ad
been
moved
elsewhere
the
sword
of
Gryffindor
snape
could
send
Phineas
Nigellus
to
look
inside
this
house
for
him
Hermione
explained
to
Ron
as
she
resumed
her
seat
but
let
him
try
it
now
all
Phineas
Nigellus
will
be
able
to
see
is
the
inside
of
my
handbag
good
thinking
said
Ron
looking
impressed
thank
you
smiled
Hermione
pulling
her
soup
toward
her
so
Harry
what
else
happened
today
nothing
said
Harry
watched
the
Ministry
entrance
for
seven
hours
no
sign
of
her
saw
your
dad
though
Ron
he
looks
fine
ron
nodded
his
appreciation
of
this
news
the
had
agreed
that
it
was
far
too
dangerous
to
try
and
communicate
with
mr.
Weasley
while
he
walked
in
and
out
of
the
Ministry
because
he
was
always
surrounded
by
other
Ministry
workers
it
was
however
reassuring
to
catch
these
glimpses
of
him
even
if
he
did
look
very
strained
and
anxious
dad
always
told
us
most
Ministry
people
use
the
Floo
Network
to
get
to
work
Ron
said
thats
why
we
havent
seen
Umbridge
shed
never
walk
shed
think
shes
too
important
and
what
about
that
funny
old
witch
and
that
little
wizard
in
the
navy
robes
hermione
asked
oh
yeah
the
bloke
from
Magical
Maintenance
said
Ron
how
do
you
know
he
works
for
Magical
Maintenance
hermione
asked
her
soupspoon
suspended
in
midair
dad
said
everyone
from
Magical
Maintenance
wears
navy
blue
robes
but
you
never
told
us
that
hermione
dropped
her
spoon
and
pulled
toward
her
the
sheaf
of
notes
and
maps
that
she
and
Ron
had
been
examining
when
Harry
had
entered
the
kitchen
theres
nothing
in
here
about
navy
blue
robes
nothing
she
said
flipping
feverishly
through
the
pages
well
dies
it
really
matter
ron
it
all
matters
if
were
going
to
get
into
the
Ministry
and
not
give
ourselves
away
when
theyre
bound
to
be
on
the
lookout
for
intruders
every
little
detail
matters
weve
been
over
and
over
this
I
mean
whats
the
point
of
all
these
reconnaissance
trips
if
you
arent
even
bothering
to
tell
us
blimey
Hermione
I
forget
one
little
thing
you
do
realize
dont
you
that
theres
probably
no
more
dangerous
place
in
the
whole
world
for
us
to
be
right
now
than
the
Ministry
of
i
think
we
should
do
it
tomorrow
said
Harry
hermione
stopped
dead
her
jaw
hanging
Ron
choked
a
little
over
his
soup
tomorrow
repeated
Hermione
you
arent
serious
Harry
i
am
said
Harry
i
dont
think
were
going
to
be
much
better
prepared
than
we
are
now
even
if
we
skulk
around
the
Ministry
entrance
for
another
month
the
longer
we
put
it
off
the
farther
away
that
locket
could
be
theres
already
a
good
chance
Umbridge
has
chucked
it
away
the
thing
doesnt
open
unless
said
Ron
shes
found
a
way
of
opening
it
and
shes
now
possessed
wouldnt
make
any
difference
to
her
she
was
so
evil
in
the
first
place
Harry
shrugged
hermione
was
biting
her
lip
deep
in
thought
we
know
everything
important
Harry
went
on
addressing
Hermione
we
know
theyve
stopped
Apparition
in
and
out
of
the
Ministry
We
know
only
the
most
senior
Ministry
members
are
allowed
to
connect
their
homes
to
the
Floo
Network
now
because
Ron
heard
those
two
Unspeakables
complaining
about
it
and
we
know
roughly
where
Umbridges
office
is
because
of
what
you
heard
the
bearded
bloke
saying
to
his
mate
Ill
be
up
on
level
one
Dolores
wants
to
see
me
Hermione
recited
immediately
exactly
said
Harry
and
we
know
you
get
in
using
those
funny
coins
or
tokens
or
whatever
they
are
because
I
saw
that
witch
borrowing
one
from
her
friend
but
we
havent
got
any
if
the
plan
works
we
will
have
Harry
continued
calmly
i
dont
know
Harry
I
dont
know
there
are
an
awful
lot
of
things
that
could
go
wrong
so
much
relies
on
chance
thatll
be
true
even
if
we
spend
another
three
months
preparing
said
Harry
its
time
to
act
he
could
tell
from
Rons
and
Hermiones
faces
that
they
were
scared
he
was
not
particularly
confident
himself
and
yet
he
was
sure
the
time
had
come
to
put
their
plan
into
operation
they
had
spent
the
previous
four
weeks
taking
it
in
turns
to
don
the
Invisibility
Cloak
and
spy
on
the
official
entrance
to
the
Ministry
which
Ron
thanks
to
mr.
Weasley
had
known
since
childhood
they
had
tailed
Ministry
workers
on
their
way
in
eavesdropped
on
their
conversations
and
learned
by
careful
observation
which
of
them
could
be
relied
upon
to
appear
alone
at
the
same
time
every
day
occasionally
there
had
been
a
chance
to
sneak
a
Daily
Prophet
out
of
somebodys
briefcase
slowly
they
had
built
up
the
sketchy
maps
and
notes
now
stacked
in
front
of
Hermione
all
right
said
Ron
slowly
lets
say
we
go
for
it
tomorrow
i
think
it
should
just
be
me
and
Harry
oh
dont
start
that
again
sighed
Hermione
i
thought
wed
settled
this
its
one
thing
hanging
around
the
entrances
under
the
Cloak
but
this
is
different
hermione
Ron
jabbed
a
finger
at
a
copy
of
the
Daily
Prophet
dated
ten
days
previously
youre
on
the
list
of
muggle-borns
who
didnt
present
themselves
for
interrogation
and
youre
supposed
to
be
dying
of
spattergroit
at
the
Burrow
if
anyone
shouldnt
go
its
Harry
hes
got
a
ten-thousand-Galleon
price
on
his
head
fine
Ill
stay
here
said
Harry
let
me
know
if
you
ever
defeat
Voldemort
wont
you
as
Ron
and
Hermione
laughed
pain
shot
through
the
scar
on
Harrys
forehead
his
hand
jumped
to
it
he
saw
Hermiones
eyes
narrow
and
he
tried
to
pass
off
the
movement
by
brushing
his
hair
out
of
his
eyes
well
if
all
three
of
us
go
well
have
to
Disapparate
separately
Ron
was
saying
we
cant
all
fit
under
the
Cloak
anymore
harrys
scar
was
becoming
more
and
more
painful
he
stood
up
at
once
Kreacher
hurried
forward
master
has
not
finished
his
soup
would
master
prefer
the
savory
stew
or
else
the
treacle
tart
to
which
Master
is
so
partial
thanks
Kreacher
but
Ill
be
back
in
a
minute
er
bathroom
aware
that
Hermione
was
watching
him
suspiciously
Harry
hurried
up
the
stairs
to
the
hall
and
then
to
the
first
landing
where
he
dashed
into
the
bathroom
and
bolted
the
door
again
grunting
with
pain
he
slumped
over
the
black
basin
with
its
taps
in
the
form
of
open-mouthed
serpents
and
closed
his
eyes
he
was
gliding
along
a
twilit
street
the
buildings
on
either
side
of
him
had
high
timbered
gables
they
looked
like
gingerbread
houses
he
approached
one
of
them
then
saw
the
whiteness
of
his
own
long-fingered
hand
against
the
door
he
knocked
he
felt
a
mounting
excitement
the
door
opened
A
laughing
woman
stood
there
her
face
fell
as
she
looked
into
Harrys
face
humor
gone
terror
replacing
it
gregorovitch
said
a
high
cold
voice
she
shook
her
head
She
was
trying
to
close
the
door
a
white
hand
held
it
steady
prevented
her
shutting
him
out
i
want
Gregorovitch
er
wohnt
hier
nicht
mehr
she
cried
shaking
her
head
he
no
live
here
he
no
live
here
i
know
him
not
abandoning
the
attempt
to
close
the
door
she
began
to
back
away
down
the
dark
hall
and
Harry
followed
gliding
toward
her
and
his
long-fingered
hand
had
drawn
his
wand
where
is
he
das
weiff
ich
nicht
he
move
i
know
not
I
know
not
he
raised
his
hand
she
screamed
two
young
children
came
running
into
the
hall
she
tried
to
shield
them
with
her
arms
there
was
a
flash
of
green
light
harry
harry
he
opened
his
eyes
he
had
sunk
to
the
floor
hermione
was
pounding
on
the
door
again
harry
open
up
he
had
shouted
out
he
knew
it
he
got
up
and
unbolted
the
door
Hermione
toppled
inside
at
once
regained
her
balance
and
looked
around
suspiciously
ron
was
right
behind
her
looking
unnerved
as
he
pointed
his
wand
into
the
corners
of
the
chilly
bathroom
what
were
you
doing
asked
Hermione
sternly
what
dyou
think
I
was
doing
asked
Harry
with
feeble
bravado
you
were
yelling
your
head
off
said
Ron
oh
yeah
i
mustve
dozed
off
or
harry
please
dont
insult
our
intelligence
said
Hermione
taking
deep
breaths
we
know
your
scar
hurt
downstairs
and
youre
white
as
a
sheet
harry
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bath
fine
ive
just
seen
Voldemort
murdering
a
woman
by
now
hes
probably
killed
her
whole
family
and
he
didnt
need
to
it
was
Cedric
all
over
again
they
were
just
there
harry
you
arent
supposed
to
let
this
happen
anymore
hermione
cried
her
voice
echoing
through
the
bathroom
dumbledore
wanted
you
to
use
Occlumency
he
thought
the
connection
was
dangerous
Voldemort
can
use
it
Harry
what
good
is
it
to
watch
him
kill
and
torture
how
can
it
help
because
it
means
I
know
what
hes
doing
said
Harry
so
youre
not
even
going
to
try
to
shut
him
out
hermione
I
cant
you
know
Im
lousy
at
Occlumency
i
never
got
the
hang
of
it
you
never
really
tried
she
said
hotly
i
dont
get
it
Harry
do
you
like
having
this
special
connection
or
relationship
or
what
whatever
she
faltered
under
the
look
he
gave
her
as
he
stood
up
like
it
he
said
quietly
would
you
like
it
i
no
Im
sorry
Harry
i
just
didnt
mean
i
hate
it
I
hate
the
fact
that
he
can
get
inside
me
that
I
have
to
watch
him
when
hes
most
dangerous
but
Im
going
to
use
it
dumbledore
forget
Dumbledore
this
is
my
choice
nobody
elses
i
want
to
know
why
hes
after
Gregorovitch
who
hes
a
foreign
wandmaker
said
Harry
he
made
Krums
wand
and
Krum
reckons
hes
brilliant
but
according
to
you
said
Ron
Voldemorts
got
Ollivander
locked
up
somewhere
if
hes
already
got
a
wandmaker
what
does
he
need
another
one
for
maybe
he
agrees
with
Krum
maybe
he
thinks
Gregorovitch
is
better
or
else
he
thinks
Gregorovitch
will
be
able
to
explain
what
my
wand
did
when
he
was
chasing
me
because
Ollivander
didnt
know
harry
glanced
into
the
cracked
dusty
mirror
and
saw
Ron
and
Hermione
exchanging
skeptical
looks
behind
his
back
harry
you
keep
talking
about
what
your
wand
did
said
Hermione
but
you
made
it
happen
why
are
you
so
determined
not
to
take
responsibility
for
your
own
power
because
I
know
it
wasnt
me
and
so
does
Voldemort
Hermione
we
both
know
what
really
happened
they
glared
at
each
other
Harry
knew
that
he
had
not
convinced
Hermione
and
that
she
was
marshaling
counterarguments
against
both
his
theory
on
his
wand
and
the
fact
that
he
was
permitting
himself
to
see
into
Voldemorts
mind
to
his
relief
Ron
intervened
drop
it
he
advised
her
its
up
to
him
and
if
were
going
to
the
Ministry
tomorrow
dont
you
reckon
we
should
go
over
the
plan
reluctantly
as
the
other
two
could
tell
Hermione
let
the
matter
rest
though
Harry
was
quite
sure
she
would
attack
again
at
the
first
opportunity
in
the
meantime
they
returned
to
the
basement
kitchen
where
Kreacher
served
them
all
stew
and
treacle
tart
they
did
not
get
to
bed
until
late
that
night
after
spending
hours
going
over
and
over
their
plan
until
they
could
recite
it
word
perfect
to
each
other
harry
who
was
now
sleeping
in
Siriuss
room
lay
in
bed
with
his
wandlight
trained
on
the
old
photograph
of
his
father
Sirius
Lupin
and
Pettigrew
and
muttered
the
plan
to
himself
for
another
ten
minutes
as
he
extinguished
his
wand
however
he
was
thinking
not
of
Polyjuice
Potion
Puking
Pastilles
or
the
navy
blue
robes
of
Magical
Maintenance
he
though
of
Gregorovitch
the
wandmaker
and
how
long
he
could
hope
to
remain
hidden
while
Voldemort
sought
him
so
determinedly
dawn
seemed
to
follow
midnight
with
indecent
haste
you
look
terrible
was
Rons
greeting
as
he
entered
the
room
to
wake
Harry
not
for
long
said
Harry
yawning
they
found
Hermione
downstairs
in
the
kitchen
she
was
being
served
coffee
and
hot
rolls
by
Kreacher
and
wearing
the
slightly
manic
expression
that
Harry
associated
with
exam
review
robes
she
said
under
her
breath
acknowledging
their
presence
with
a
nervous
nod
and
continuing
to
poke
around
in
her
beaded
bag
Polyjuice
Potion
invisibiliity
Cloak
decoy
Detonators
you
should
each
take
a
couple
just
in
case
puking
Pastilles
Nosebleed
Norgat
Extendable
Ears
they
gulped
down
their
breakfast
then
set
off
upstairs
Kreacher
bowing
them
out
and
promising
to
have
a
steak-and-kidney
pie
ready
for
them
when
they
returned
bless
him
said
Ron
fondly
and
when
you
think
I
used
to
fantasize
about
cutting
off
his
head
and
sticking
it
on
the
wall
they
made
their
way
onto
the
front
step
with
immense
caution
they
could
see
a
couple
of
puffy-eyed
Death
Eaters
watching
the
house
from
across
the
misty
square
hermione
Disapparated
with
Ron
first
then
came
back
for
Harry
after
the
usual
brief
spell
of
darkness
and
near
suffocation
Harry
found
himself
in
the
tiny
alleyway
where
the
first
phase
of
their
plan
was
scheduled
to
take
place
it
was
as
yet
deserted
except
for
a
couple
of
large
bins
the
first
Ministry
workers
did
not
usually
appear
here
until
at
least
eight
oclock
right
then
said
Hermione
checking
her
watch
she
ought
to
be
here
in
about
five
minutes
when
Ive
Stunned
her
hermione
we
know
said
Ron
sternly
and
I
thought
we
were
supposed
to
open
the
door
before
she
got
here
hermione
squealed
i
nearly
forgot
stand
back
she
pointed
her
wand
at
the
padlocked
and
heavily
graffitied
fire
door
beside
them
which
burst
open
with
a
crash
the
dark
corridor
behind
it
led
as
they
knew
from
their
careful
scouting
trips
into
an
empty
theater
hermione
pulled
the
door
back
toward
her
to
make
it
look
as
thought
it
was
still
closed
and
now
she
said
turning
back
to
face
the
other
two
in
the
alleyway
we
put
on
the
Cloak
again
and
we
wait
Ron
finished
throwing
it
over
Hermiones
head
like
a
blanket
over
a
birdcage
and
rolling
his
eyes
at
Harry
little
more
than
a
minute
later
there
was
a
tiny
pop
and
a
little
Ministry
witch
with
flyaway
gray
hair
Apparated
feet
from
them
blinking
a
little
in
the
sudden
brightness
the
sun
had
just
come
out
from
behind
a
cloud
she
barely
had
time
to
enjoy
the
unexpected
warmth
however
before
Hermiones
silent
Stunning
Spell
hit
her
in
the
chest
and
she
toppled
over
nicely
done
Hermione
said
Ron
emerging
behind
a
bin
beside
the
theater
door
as
Harry
took
off
the
Invisibility
Cloak
together
they
carried
the
little
witch
into
the
dark
passageway
that
led
backstage
hermione
plucked
a
few
hairs
from
the
witchs
head
and
added
them
to
a
flask
of
muddy
Polyjuice
Potion
she
had
taken
from
the
beaded
bag
ron
was
rummaging
through
the
little
witchs
handbag
shes
Mafalda
Hopkirk
he
said
reading
a
small
card
that
identified
their
victim
as
an
assistant
in
the
Improper
Use
of
Magic
Office
youd
better
take
this
Hermione
and
here
are
the
tokens
he
passed
her
several
small
golden
coins
all
embossed
with
the
letters
M
o.m.
which
he
had
taken
from
the
witchs
purse
hermione
drank
the
Polyjuice
Potion
which
was
now
a
pleasant
heliotrope
color
and
within
seconds
stood
before
them
the
double
of
Mafalda
Hopkirk
as
she
removed
Mafaldas
spectacles
and
put
them
on
Harry
checked
his
watch
were
running
late
mr.
Magical
Maintenance
will
be
here
any
second
they
hurried
to
close
the
door
on
the
real
Mafalda
Harry
and
Ron
threw
the
Invisibility
Cloak
over
themselves
but
Hermione
remained
in
view
waiting
seconds
later
there
was
another
pop
and
a
small
ferrety
looking
wizard
appeared
before
them
oh
hello
Mafalda
hello
said
Hermione
in
a
quavery
voice
How
are
you
today
not
so
good
actually
replied
the
little
wizard
who
looked
thoroughly
downcast
as
Hermione
and
the
wizard
headed
for
the
main
road
Harry
and
Ron
crept
along
behind
them
im
sorry
to
hear
youre
under
the
weather
said
Hermione
talking
firmly
over
the
little
wizard
and
he
tried
to
expound
upon
his
problems
it
was
essential
to
stop
him
from
reaching
the
street
here
have
a
sweet
eh
oh
no
thanks
i
insist
said
Hermione
aggressively
shaking
the
bag
of
pastilles
in
his
face
looking
rather
alarmed
the
little
wizard
took
one
the
effect
was
instantaneous
the
moment
the
pastille
touched
his
tongue
the
little
wizard
started
vomiting
so
hard
that
he
did
not
even
notice
as
Hermione
yanked
a
handful
of
hairs
from
the
top
of
his
head
oh
dear
she
said
as
he
splattered
the
alley
with
sick
perhaps
youd
better
take
the
day
off
no
no
he
choked
and
retched
trying
to
continue
on
his
way
despite
being
unable
to
walk
straight
i
must
today
must
go
but
thats
just
silly
said
Hermione
alarmed
you
cant
go
to
work
in
this
state
I
think
you
ought
to
go
to
st.
Mungos
and
get
them
to
sort
you
out
the
wizard
had
collapsed
heaving
onto
all
fours
still
trying
to
crawl
toward
the
main
street
you
simply
cant
go
to
work
like
this
cried
Hermione
at
last
he
seemed
to
accept
the
truth
of
her
words
using
a
reposed
Hermione
to
claw
his
way
back
into
a
standing
position
he
turned
on
the
spot
and
vanished
leaving
nothing
behind
but
the
bag
Ron
had
snatched
from
his
hand
as
he
went
and
some
flying
chunks
of
vomit
urgh
said
Hermione
holding
up
the
skirt
of
her
robe
to
avoid
the
puddles
of
sick
it
would
have
made
much
less
mess
to
Stun
him
too
yeah
said
Ron
emerging
from
under
the
cloak
holding
the
wizards
bag
but
I
still
think
a
whole
pile
of
unconscious
bodies
would
have
drawn
more
attention
keen
on
his
job
though
isnt
he
chuck
us
the
hair
and
the
potion
then
within
two
minutes
Ron
stood
before
them
as
small
and
ferrety
as
the
sick
wizard
and
wearing
the
navy
blue
robes
that
had
been
folded
in
his
bag
weird
he
wasnt
wearing
them
today
wasnt
it
seeing
how
much
he
wanted
to
go
anyway
Im
Reg
Cattermole
according
to
the
label
in
the
back
now
wait
here
Hermione
told
Harry
who
was
still
under
the
Invisibility
Cloak
and
well
be
back
with
some
hairs
for
you
he
had
to
wait
ten
minutes
but
it
seemed
much
longer
to
Harry
skulking
alone
in
the
sick-splattered
alleyway
beside
the
door
concealing
the
Stunned
Mafalda
finally
Ron
and
Hermione
reappeared
we
dont
know
who
he
is
Hermione
said
passing
Harry
several
curly
black
hairs
but
hes
gone
home
with
a
dreadful
nosebleed
here
hes
pretty
tall
youll
need
bigger
robes
she
pulled
out
a
set
of
the
old
robes
Kreacher
had
laundered
for
them
and
Harry
retired
to
take
the
potion
and
change
once
the
painful
transformation
was
complete
he
was
more
than
six
feet
tall
and
from
what
he
could
tell
from
his
well-muscled
arms
powerfully
built
he
also
had
a
beard
stowing
the
Invisibility
Cloak
and
his
glasses
inside
his
new
robes
he
rejoined
the
other
two
blimey
thats
scary
said
Ron
looking
up
at
Harry
who
now
towered
over
him
take
one
of
Mafaldas
tokens
Hermione
told
Harry
and
lets
go
its
nearly
nine
they
stepped
out
of
the
alleyway
together
fifty
yards
along
the
crowded
pavement
there
were
spiked
black
railings
flanking
two
flights
of
stairs
one
labeled
gentlemen
the
other
ladies
see
you
in
a
moment
then
said
Hermione
nervously
and
she
tottered
off
down
the
steps
to
ladies
harry
and
Ron
joined
a
number
of
oddly
dressed
men
descending
into
what
appeared
to
be
an
ordinary
underground
public
toilet
tiled
in
grimy
black
and
white
morning
Reg
called
another
wizard
in
navy
blue
robes
as
he
let
himself
into
a
cubicle
by
inserting
his
golden
token
into
a
slot
in
the
door
blooming
pain
in
the
bum
this
eh
forcing
us
all
to
get
to
work
this
way
who
are
they
expecting
to
turn
up
Harry
Potter
the
wizard
roared
with
laughter
at
his
own
wit
ron
gave
a
forced
chuckle
yeah
he
said
stupid
isnt
it
and
he
and
Harry
let
themselves
into
adjoining
cubicles
to
Harrys
left
and
right
came
the
sound
of
flushing
he
crouched
down
and
peered
through
the
gap
at
the
bottom
of
the
cubicle
just
in
time
to
see
a
pair
of
booted
feet
climbing
into
the
toilet
next
door
he
looked
left
and
saw
Ron
blinking
at
him
we
have
to
flush
ourselves
in
he
whispered
looks
like
it
Harry
whispered
back
his
voice
came
out
deep
and
gravelly
they
both
stood
up
feeling
exceptionally
foolish
Harry
clambered
into
the
toilet
he
knew
at
once
that
he
had
done
the
right
thing
thought
he
appeared
to
be
standing
in
water
his
shoes
feet
and
robes
remained
quite
dry
he
reached
up
pulled
the
chain
and
next
moment
had
zoomed
down
a
short
chute
emerging
out
of
a
fireplace
into
the
Ministry
of
Magic
he
got
up
clumsily
there
was
a
lot
more
of
his
body
than
he
was
accustomed
to
the
great
Atrium
seemed
darker
than
Harry
remembered
it
previously
a
golden
fountain
had
filled
the
center
of
the
hall
casting
shimmering
spots
of
light
over
the
polished
wooden
floor
and
walls
now
a
gigantic
statue
of
black
stone
dominated
the
scene
it
was
rather
frightening
this
vast
sculpture
of
a
witch
and
a
wizard
sitting
on
ornately
carved
thrones
looking
down
at
the
Ministry
workers
toppling
out
of
fireplaces
below
them
engraved
in
foot-high
letters
at
the
base
of
the
statue
were
the
words
magic
is
might
harry
received
a
heavy
blow
on
the
back
of
the
legs
another
wizard
had
just
flown
out
of
the
fireplace
behind
him
out
of
the
way
cant
y
oh
sorry
Runcorn
clearly
frightened
the
balding
wizard
hurried
away
apparently
the
man
who
Harry
was
impersonating
Runcorn
was
intimidating
psst
said
a
voice
and
he
looked
around
to
see
a
whispy
little
witch
and
the
ferrety
wizard
from
Magical
Maintenance
gesturing
to
him
from
over
beside
the
statue
harry
hastened
to
join
them
you
got
in
all
right
then
hermione
whispered
to
Harry
no
hes
still
stuck
in
the
hog
said
Ron
oh
very
funny
its
horrible
isnt
it
she
said
to
Harry
who
was
staring
up
at
the
statue
have
you
seen
what
theyre
sitting
on
harry
looked
more
closely
and
realized
that
what
he
had
thought
were
decoratively
carved
thrones
were
actually
mounds
of
carved
humans
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
naked
bodies
men
women
and
children
all
with
rather
stupid
ugly
faces
twisted
and
pressed
together
to
support
the
weight
of
the
handsomely
robed
wizards
muggles
whispered
Hermione
In
their
rightful
place
come
on
lets
get
going
they
joined
the
stream
of
witches
and
wizards
moving
toward
the
golden
gates
at
the
end
of
the
hall
looking
around
as
surreptitiously
as
possible
but
there
was
no
sign
of
the
distinctive
figure
of
Dolores
Umbridge
they
passed
through
the
gates
and
into
a
smaller
hall
where
queues
were
forming
in
front
of
twenty
golden
grilles
housing
as
many
lifts
they
had
barely
joined
the
nearest
one
when
a
voice
said
Cattermole
they
looked
around
Harrys
stomach
turned
over
one
of
the
Death
Eaters
who
had
witnessed
Dumbledores
death
was
striding
toward
them
the
Ministry
workers
beside
them
fell
silent
their
eyes
downcast
Harry
could
feel
fear
rippling
through
them
the
mans
scowling
slightly
brutish
face
was
somehow
at
odds
with
his
magnificent
sweeping
robes
which
were
embroidered
with
much
gold
thread
someone
in
the
crowd
around
the
lifts
called
sycophantically
Morning
Yaxley
yaxley
ignored
them
i
requested
somebody
from
Magical
Maintenance
to
sort
out
my
office
Cattermole
its
still
raining
in
there
ron
looked
around
as
though
hoping
somebody
else
would
intervene
but
nobody
spoke
raining
in
your
office
thats
thats
not
good
is
it
ron
gave
a
nervous
laugh
yaxleys
eyes
widened
you
think
its
funny
Cattermole
do
you
a
pair
of
witches
broke
away
from
the
queue
for
the
lift
and
bustled
off
no
said
Ron
no
of
course
you
realize
that
I
am
on
my
way
downstairs
to
interrogate
your
wife
Cattermole
in
fact
Im
quite
surprised
youre
not
down
there
holding
her
hand
while
she
waits
already
given
her
up
as
a
bad
job
have
you
probably
wise
be
sure
and
marry
a
pureblood
next
time
hermione
had
let
out
a
little
squeak
of
horror
yaxley
looked
at
her
she
cough
feebly
and
turned
away
i
I
stammered
Ron
but
if
my
wife
were
accused
of
being
a
Mudblood
said
Yaxley
not
that
any
woman
I
married
would
ever
be
mistaken
for
such
filth
and
the
Head
of
Department
of
Magical
Law
Enforcement
needed
a
job
doing
I
would
make
it
my
priority
to
do
this
job
Cattermole
do
you
understand
me
yes
whispered
Ron
then
attend
to
it
Cattermole
and
if
my
office
is
not
completely
dry
within
an
hour
your
wifes
Blood
Status
will
be
in
even
greater
doubt
than
it
is
now
the
golden
grille
before
them
clattered
open
with
a
nod
and
unpleasant
smile
to
Harry
who
was
evidently
expected
to
appreciate
this
treatment
of
Cattermole
Yaxley
swept
away
toward
another
lift
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
entered
theirs
but
nobody
followed
them
It
was
as
if
they
were
infectious
the
grilles
shut
with
a
clang
and
the
lift
began
to
move
upward
what
am
I
going
to
do
ron
asked
the
other
two
at
once
he
looked
stricken
if
I
dont
turn
up
my
wife
i
mean
Cattermoles
wife
well
come
with
you
we
should
stick
together
began
Harry
but
Ron
shook
his
head
feverishly
thats
mental
we
havent
got
much
time
you

find
Umbridge
Ill
go
and
sort
out
Yaxleys
office
but
how
do
I
stop
a
raining
try
Finite
Incantatem
said
Hermione
at
once
that
should
stop
the
rain
if
its
a
hex
or
curse
if
it
doesnt
somethings
gone
wrong
with
an
Atmospheric
Charm
which
will
be
more
difficult
to
fix
so
as
an
interim
measure
try
Impervius
to
protect
his
belongings
say
it
again
slowly
said
Ron
searching
his
pockets
desperately
for
a
quill
but
at
that
moment
the
lift
juddered
to
a
halt
a
disembodied
female
voice
said

and
the
grilles
slid
open
again
admitting
a
couple
of
wizards
and
several
pale
violet
paper
airplanes
that
fluttered
around
the
lamp
in
the
ceiling
of
the
lift
morning
Albert
said
a
bushily
whiskered
man
smiling
at
Harry
he
glanced
over
at
Ron
and
Hermione
as
the
lift
creaked
upward
once
more
Hermione
was
now
whispering
frantic
instructions
to
Ron
the
wizard
leaned
toward
Harry
leering
and
muttering
Dirk
Cresswell
eh

Goblin
Liaison

one
Albert

pretty
confident

he
winked
harry
smiled

would

the

a
little
push
and
he
hurried
out
of
the
lift
followed
by
the
other
wizards
leaving
Harry
and
Hermione
alone
the
moment
the
golden
door
had
closed
Hermione
said
very
fast
Actually
Harry
I
think
Id
better
go
after
him
I
dont
think
he
knows
what
hes
doing
and
if
he
gets
caught
the
whole
thing
level
one
Minister
of
Magic
and
Support
Staff
the
golden
grilles
slid
apart
again
and
Hermione
gasped
four
people
stood
before
them
two
of
them
deep
in
conversation
a
long-haired
wizard
wearing
magnificent
robes
of
black
and
gold
and
a
squat
toadlike
witch
wearing
a
velvet
bow
in
her
short
hair
and
clutching
a
clipboard
to
her
chest

consulted

people
today
and
one
of
them
the
wife
of
a
Ministry
employee
tut
tut
even
here
in
the
heart
of
the
Ministry
she
stepped
into
the
lift
besides
Hermione
as
did
the
two
wizards
who
had
been
listening
to
Umbridges
conversation
with
the
Minister
well

straight
down
Mafalda

the
courtroom
good
morning
Albert
arent
you
getting
out
yes
of
course
said
Harry
in
Runcorns
deep
voice
harry
stepped
out
of
the
life
the
golden
grilles
clanged
shut
behind
him
glancing
over
his
shoulder
Harry
saw
Hermiones
anxious
face
sinking
back
out
of
sight
a
tall
wizard
on
either
side
of
her
Umbridges
velvet
hair-bow
level
with
her
shoulder
what
brings
you
here
Runcorn
asked
the
new
Minister
of
Magic
his
long
black
hair
and
beard
were
streaked
with
silver
and
a
great
overhanging
forehead
shadowed
his
glinting
eyes
putting
Harry
in
the
mind
of
a
crab
looking
out
from
beneath
a
rock
needed
a
quick
word
with
Harry
hesitated
for
a
fraction
of
a
second
Arthur
Weasley
someone
said
he
was
up
on
level

ah
said
Plum
Thicknesse
has
he
been
caught
having
contact
with
an
Undesirable
no
said
Harry
his
throat
dry
no
nothing
like
that
ah
well
its
only
a
matter
of
time
said
Thicknesse
if
you
ask
me
the
blood
traitors
are
as
bad
as
the
Mudbloods
good
day
Runcorn
good
day
Minister
harry
watched
Thicknesse
march
away
along
the
thickly
carpeted
corridor
the
moment
the
Minister
had
passed
out
of
sight
Harry
tugged
the
Invisibility
Cloak
out
from
under
his
heavy
black
cloak
threw
it
over
himself
and
set
off
along
the
corridor
in
the
opposite
direction
runcorn
was
so
tall
that
Harry
was
forced
to
stoop
to
make
sure
his
big
feet
were
hidden
panic
pulsed
in
the
pit
of
his
stomach
as
he
passed
gleaming
wooden
door
after
gleaming
wooden
door
each
bearing
a
small
plaque
with
the
owners
name
and
occupation
upon
it
the
might
of
the
Ministry
its
complexity
its
impenetrability
seemed
to
force
itself
upon
him
so
that
the
plan
he
had
been
carefully
concocting
with
Ron
and
Hermione
over
the
past
four
weeks
seemed
laughably
childish
they
had
concentrated
all
their
efforts
on
getting
inside
without
being
detected
They
had
not
given
a
moments
thought
to
what
they
would
do
if
they
were
forced
to
separate
now
Hermione
was
stuck
in
court
proceedings
which
would
undoubtedly
last
hours
Ron
was
struggling
to
do
magic
that
Harry
was
sure
was
beyond
him
a
womans
liberty
possibly
depending
on
the
outcome
and
he
Harry
was
wandering
around
on
the
top
floor
when
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
his
quarry
had
just
gone
down
in
the
lift
he
stopped
walking
leaned
against
a
wall
and
tried
to
decide
what
to
do
the
silence
pressed
upon
him
There
was
no
bustling
or
talk
or
swift
footsteps
here
the
purple-carpeted
corridors
were
as
hushed
as
though
the
Muffliato
charm
had
been
cast
over
the
place
her
office
must
be
up
here
Harry
thought
it
seemed
most
unlikely
that
Umbridge
would
keep
her
jewelry
in
her
office
but
on
the
other
hand
it
seemed
foolish
not
to
search
it
to
make
sure
he
therefore
set
off
along
the
corridor
again
passing
nobody
but
a
frowning
wizard
who
was
murmuring
instructions
to
a
quill
that
floated
in
front
of
him
scribbling
on
a
trail
of
parchment
now
paying
attention
to
the
names
on
the
doors
Harry
turned
a
corner
halfway
along
the
next
corridor
he
emerged
into
a
wide
open
space
where
a
dozen
witches
and
wizards
sat
in
rows
at
small
desks
not
unlike
school
desks
though
much
more
highly
polished
and
free
from
graffiti
harry
paused
to
watch
them
for
the
effect
was
quite
mesmerizing
they
were
all
waving
and
twiddling
their
wands
in
unison
and
squares
of
colored
paper
were
flying
in
every
direction
like
little
pink
kites
after
a
few
seconds
Harry
realized
that
there
was
a
rhythm
to
the
proceedings
that
the
papers
all
formed
the
same
pattern
and
after
a
few
more
seconds
he
realized
what
he
was
watching
was
the
creation
of
pamphlets
that
the
paper
squares
were
pages
which
when
assembled
folded
and
magicked
into
place
fell
into
neat
stacks
beside
each
witch
or
wizard
harry
crept
closer
although
the
workers
were
so
intent
on
what
they
were
doing
that
he
doubted
they
would
notice
a
carpet-muffled
footstep
and
he
slid
a
completed
pamphlet
from
the
pile
beside
a
young
witch
he
examined
it
beneath
the
Invisibility
Cloak
its
pink
cover
was
emblazoned
with
a
golden
title
mudbloods
and
the
Dangers
They
Pose
to
a
Peaceful
Pure-Blood
Society
beneath
the
title
was
a
picture
of
a
red
rose
with
a
simpering
face
in
the
middle
of
its
petals
being
strangled
by
a
green
weed
with
fangs
and
a
scowl
there
was
no
authors
name
upon
the
pamphlet
but
again
the
scars
on
the
back
of
his
right
hand
seemed
to
tingle
as
he
examined
it
then
the
young
witch
beside
him
confirmed
his
suspicion
as
she
said
still
waving
and
twirling
her
wand
Will
the
old
hag
be
interrogating
Mudbloods
all
day
does
anyone
know
careful
said
the
wizard
beside
her
glancing
around
nervously
one
of
his
pages
slipped
and
fell
to
the
floor
what
has
she
got
magic
ears
as
well
as
an
eye
now
the
witch
glanced
toward
the
shining
mahogany
door
facing
the
space
full
of
pamphlet-makers
Harry
looked
too
and
the
rage
reared
in
him
like
a
snake
where
there
might
have
been
a
peephole
on
a
Muggle
front
door
a
large
round
eye
with
a
bright
blue
iris
had
been
set
into
the
wood
an
eye
that
was
shockingly
familiar
to
anybody
who
had
known
Alastor
Moody
for
a
split
second
Harry
forgot
where
he
was
and
what
he
was
doing
there
He
even
forgot
that
he
was
invisible
he
strode
straight
over
to
the
door
to
examine
the
eye
it
was
not
moving
it
gazed
blindly
upward
frozen
the
plaque
beneath
it
read
dolores
Umbridge
senior
Undersecretary
to
the
Minister
below
that
a
slightly
shinier
new
plaque
read
head
of
the
Muggle-Born
registration
Commission
harry
looked
back
at
the
dozen
pamphlet-makers
Though
they
were
intent
upon
their
work
he
could
hardly
suppose
that
they
would
not
notice
if
the
door
of
an
empty
office
opened
in
front
of
them
he
therefore
withdrew
from
an
inner
pocket
an
odd
object
with
little
waving
legs
and
a
rubber-bulbed
horn
for
a
body
crouching
down
beneath
the
Cloak
he
placed
the
Decoy
Detonator
on
the
ground
it
scuttled
away
at
once
through
the
legs
of
the
witches
and
wizards
in
front
of
him
a
few
moments
later
during
which
Harry
waited
with
his
hand
upon
the
doorknob
there
came
a
loud
bang
and
a
great
deal
of
acrid
smoke
billowed
from
a
corner
the
young
witch
in
the
front
row
shrieked
Pink
pages
flew
everywhere
as
she
and
her
fellows
jumped
up
looking
around
for
the
source
of
the
commotion
harry
turned
the
doorknob
stepped
into
Umbridges
office
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
he
felt
he
had
stepped
back
in
time
the
room
was
exactly
like
Umbridges
office
at
Hogwarts
Lace
draperies
doilies
and
dried
flowers
covered
every
surface
the
walls
bore
the
same
ornamental
plates
each
featuring
a
highly
colored
beribboned
kitten
gamboling
and
frisking
with
sickening
cuteness
the
desk
was
covered
with
a
flouncy
flowered
cloth
behind
mad-eyes
eye
a
telescopic
attachment
enabled
Umbridge
to
spy
on
the
workers
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
harry
took
a
look
through
it
and
saw
that
they
were
all
still
gathered
around
the
Decoy
Detonator
he
wrenched
the
telescope
out
of
the
door
leaving
a
hole
behind
pulled
the
magical
eyeball
out
of
it
and
placed
it
in
his
pocket
the
he
turned
to
face
the
room
again
raised
his
wand
and
murmured
Accio
Locker
nothing
happened
but
he
had
not
expected
it
to
no
doubt
Umbridge
knew
all
about
protective
charms
and
spells
he
therefore
hurried
behind
her
desk
and
began
pulling
open
all
the
drawers
he
saw
quills
and
notebooks
and
Spellotape
enchanted
paper
clips
that
coiled
snakelike
from
their
drawer
and
had
be
beaten
back
a
fussy
little
lace
box
full
of
spare
hair
bows
and
clips
but
no
sign
of
a
locket
there
was
a
filing
cabinet
behind
the
desk
Harry
set
to
searching
it
like
Filchs
filing
cabinet
at
Hogwarts
it
was
full
of
folders
each
labeled
with
a
name
it
was
not
until
Harry
reached
the
bottommost
drawer
that
he
saw
something
to
distract
him
from
the
search
mr.
Weasleys
file
he
pulled
it
out
and
opened
it

Harry
muttered
under
his
breath
as
he
replaced
mr.
Weasleys
folder
and
shut
the
drawer
he
had
an
idea
he
knew
who
that
was
and
sure
enough
as
he
straightened
up
and
glanced
around
the
office
for
fresh
hiding
places
he
saw
a
poster
of
himself
on
the
wall
with
the
words
undesirable
no
emblazoned
across
his
chest
a
little
pink
note
was
stuck
to
it
with
a
picture
of
a
kitten
in
the
corner
harry
moved
across
to
read
it
and
saw
that
Umbridge
had
written
To
be
punished
angrier
than
ever
he
proceeded
to
grope
in
the
bottoms
of
the
vases
and
baskets
of
dried
flowers
but
was
not
at
all
surprised
that
the
locket
was
not
there
he
gave
the
office
one
last
sweeping
look
and
his
heart
skipped
a
beat
dumbledore
was
staring
at
him
from
a
small
rectangular
mirror
propped
up
on
a
bookcase
beside
the
desk
harry
crossed
the
room
at
a
run
and
snatched
it
up
but
realized
that
the
moment
he
touched
it
that
it
was
not
a
mirror
at
all
dumbledore
was
smiling
wistfully
out
of
the
front
cover
of
a
glossy
book
harry
had
not
immediately
noticed
the
curly
green
writing
across
his
hat
The
Life
and
Lies
of
Albus
Dumbledore
nor
the
slightly
smaller
writing
across
his
chest
by
Rita
Skeeter
bestselling
author
of
Armando
Dippet
Master
or
Moron
harry
opened
the
book
at
random
and
saw
a
full-page
photograph
of
two
teenage
boys
both
laughing
immoderately
with
their
arms
around
each
others
shoulders
dumbledore
now
with
elbow-length
hair
had
grown
a
tiny
wispy
beard
that
recalled
the
one
on
Krums
chin
that
had
so
annoyed
Ron
the
boy
who
roared
in
silent
amusement
beside
Dumbledore
had
a
gleeful
wild
look
about
him
his
golden
hair
fell
in
curls
to
his
shoulders
harry
wondered
whether
it
was
a
young
Doge
but
before
he
could
check
the
caption
the
door
of
the
office
opened
if
Thicknesse
had
not
been
looking
over
his
shoulder
as
he
entered
Harry
would
not
have
had
time
to
pull
the
Invisibility
Cloak
over
himself
as
it
was
he
thought
Thicknesse
might
have
caught
a
glimpse
of
movement
because
for
a
moment
or
two
he
remained
quite
still
staring
curiously
at
the
place
where
Harry
had
just
vanished
perhaps
deciding
that
that
all
he
had
seen
was
Dumbledore
scratching
his
nose
on
the
front
of
the
book
for
Harry
had
hastily
replaced
it
upon
the
shelf
thicknesse
finally
walked
to
the
desk
and
pointed
his
wand
at
the
quill
standing
ready
in
the
ink
pot
it
sprang
out
and
began
scribbling
a
note
to
Umbridge
very
slowly
hardly
daring
to
breathe
Harry
backed
out
of
the
office
into
the
open
area
beyond
the
pamphlet-makers
were
still
clustered
around
the
remains
of
the
Decoy
Detonator
which
continued
to
hoot
feebly
as
it
smoked
harry
hurried
off
up
the
corridor
as
the
young
witch
said
I
bet
it
sneaked
up
here
from
Experimental
Charms
theyre
so
careless
remember
that
poisonous
duck
speeding
back
toward
the
lifts
Harry
reviewed
his
options
it
had
never
been
likely
that
the
locket
was
here
at
the
Ministry
and
there
was
no
hope
of
bewitching
its
whereabouts
out
of
Umbridge
while
she
was
sitting
in
a
crowded
court
their
priority
now
had
to
be
to
leave
the
Ministry
before
they
were
exposed
and
try
again
another
day
the
first
thing
to
do
was
to
find
Ron
and
then
they
could
work
out
a
way
of
extracting
Hermione
from
the
courtroom
the
lift
was
empty
when
it
arrived
harry
jumped
in
and
pulled
off
the
Invisibility
Cloak
as
it
started
its
descent
to
his
enormous
relief
when
it
rattled
to
a
halt
at
level
two
a
soaking-wet
and
wild-eyed
Ron
got
in
m-morning
he
stammered
to
Harry
as
the
lift
set
off
again
ron
its
me
Harry
harry
blimey
I
forgot
what
you
looked
like
why
isnt
Hermione
with
you
she
had
to
go
down
to
the
courtrooms
with
Umbridge
she
couldnt
refuse
and
but
before
Harry
could
finish
the
lift
had
stopped
again
the
doors
opened
and
mr.
Weasley
walked
inside
talking
to
an
elderly
witch
whose
blonde
hair
was
teased
so
high
it
resembled
an
anthill
i
quite
understand
what
youre
saying
Wakanda
but
Im
afraid
I
cannot
be
party
to
mr.
Weasley
broke
off
he
had
noticed
Harry
it
was
very
strange
to
have
mr.
Weasley
glare
at
him
with
that
much
dislike
the
lift
doors
closed
and
the
four
of
them
trundled
downward
once
more
oh
hello
Reg
said
mr.
Weasley
looking
around
at
the
sound
of
steady
dripping
from
Rons
robes
isnt
your
wife
in
for
questioning
today
er
whats
happened
to
you
why
are
you
so
wet
yaxleys
office
is
raining
said
Ron
he
addressed
mr.
Weasleys
shoulder
and
Harry
felt
sure
he
was
scared
that
his
father
might
recognize
him
if
they
looked
directly
into
each
others
eyes
i
couldnt
stop
it
so
theyve
sent
me
to
get
Bernie
Pillsworth
I
think
they
said
yes
a
lot
of
offices
have
been
raining
lately
said
mr.
Weasley
did
you
try
Meterolojinx
Recanto
it
worked
for
Bletchley
meteolojinx
Recanto
whispered
Ron
no
I
didnt
thanks
D
I
mean
thanks
Arthur
the
lift
doors
opened
the
old
witch
with
the
anthill
hair
left
and
Ron
darted
past
her
out
of
sight
harry
made
to
follow
him
but
found
his
path
blocked
as
Percy
Weasley
strode
into
the
lift
his
nose
buried
in
some
papers
he
was
reading
not
until
the
doors
had
clanged
shut
again
did
Percy
realize
he
was
in
a
lit
with
his
father
he
glanced
up
saw
mr.
Weasley
turned
radish
red
and
left
the
lift
the
moment
the
doors
opened
again
for
the
second
time
Harry
tried
to
get
out
but
this
time
found
his
way
blocked
by
mr.
Weasleys
arm
one
moment
Runcorn
the
lift
doors
closed
and
as
they
clanked
down
another
floor
mr.
Weasley
said
I
hear
you
had
information
about
Dirk
Cresswell
harry
had
the
impression
that
mr.
Weasleys
anger
was
no
less
because
of
the
brush
with
Percy
he
decided
his
best
chance
was
to
act
stupid
sorry
he
said
dont
pretend
Runcorn
said
mr.
Weasley
fiercely
you
tracked
down
the
wizard
who
faked
his
family
tree
didnt
you
i
so
what
if
I
did
said
Harry
so
Dirk
Cresswell
is
ten
times
the
wizard
you
are
said
mr.
Weasley
quietly
as
the
lift
sank
ever
lower
and
if
he
survives
Azkaban
youll
have
to
answer
to
him
not
to
mention
his
wife
his
sons
and
his
friends
arthur
Harry
interrupted
you
know
youre
being
tracked
dont
you
is
that
a
threat
Runcorn
said
mr.
Weasley
loudly
no
said
Harry
its
a
fact
theyre
watching
your
every
move
the
lift
doors
opened
they
had
reached
the
Atrium
mr.
Weasley
gave
Harry
a
scathing
look
and
swept
from
the
lift
harry
stood
there
shaken
he
wished
he
was
impersonating
somebody
other
than
Runcorn
the
lift
doors
clanged
shut
harry
pulled
out
the
Invisibility
Cloak
and
put
it
back
on
he
would
try
to
extricate
Hermione
on
his
own
while
Ron
was
dealing
with
the
raining
office
when
the
doors
opened
he
stepped
out
into
a
torch-lit
stone
passageway
quite
different
from
the
wood-paneled
and
carpeted
corridors
above
as
the
left
rattled
away
again
Harry
shivered
slightly
looking
toward
the
distant
black
door
that
marked
the
entrance
to
the
Department
of
Mysteries
he
set
off
his
destination
not
the
black
door
but
the
doorway
he
remembered
on
the
left
hand
side
which
opened
onto
the
flight
of
stairs
down
to
the
court
chambers
his
mind
grappled
with
possibilities
as
he
crept
down
them
He
still
had
a
couple
of
Decoy
Detonators
but
perhaps
it
would
be
better
to
simply
knock
on
the
courtroom
door
enter
as
Runcorn
and
ask
for
a
quick
word
with
Mafalda
of
course
he
did
not
know
whether
Runcorn
was
sufficiently
important
to
get
away
with
this
and
even
if
he
managed
it
Hermiones
non-reappearance
might
trigger
a
search
before
they
were
clear
of
the
Ministry
lost
in
thought
he
did
not
immediately
register
the
unnatural
chill
that
was
creeping
over
him
as
if
he
were
descending
into
fog
it
was
becoming
colder
and
colder
with
every
step
he
took
a
cold
that
reached
right
down
his
throat
and
tore
at
his
lungs
and
then
he
felt
that
stealing
sense
of
despair
or
hopelessness
filling
him
expanding
inside
him
dementors
he
thought
and
as
he
reached
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
turned
to
his
right
he
saw
a
dreadful
scene
the
dark
passage
outside
the
courtrooms
was
packed
with
tall
black-hooded
figures
their
faces
completely
hidden
their
ragged
breathing
the
only
sound
in
the
place
the
petrified
muggle-borns
brought
in
for
questioning
sat
huddled
and
shivering
on
hard
wooden
benches
most
of
them
were
hiding
their
faces
in
their
hands
perhaps
in
an
instinctive
attempt
to
shield
themselves
from
the
dementors
greedy
mouths
some
were
accompanied
by
families
others
sat
alone
the
dementors
were
gliding
up
and
down
in
front
of
them
and
the
cold
and
the
hopelessness
and
the
despair
of
the
place
laid
themselves
upon
Harry
like
a
curse
fight
it
he
told
himself
but
he
knew
that
he
could
not
conjure
a
Patronus
here
without
revealing
himself
instantly
so
he
moved
forward
as
silently
as
he
could
and
with
every
step
he
took
numbness
seemed
to
steal
over
his
brain
but
he
forced
himself
to
think
of
Hermione
and
of
Ron
who
needed
him
moving
through
the
towering
black
figures
was
terrifying
The
eyeless
faces
hidden
beneath
their
hoods
turned
as
he
passed
and
he
felt
sure
that
they
sensed
him
sensed
perhaps
a
human
presence
that
still
had
some
hope
some
resilience
and
then
abruptly
and
shockingly
amid
the
frozen
silence
one
of
the
dungeon
doors
on
the
left
of
the
corridor
was
flung
open
and
screams
echoed
out
of
it
no
no
Im
half-blood
Im
half-blood
I
tell
you
my
father
was
a
wizard
he
was
look
him
up
Arkie
Alderton
hes
a
well
known
broomstick
designer
look
him
up
I
tell
you
get
your
hands
off
me
get
your
hands
off
this
is
your
final
warning
said
Umbridges
soft
voice
magically
magnified
so
that
it
sounded
clearly
over
the
mans
desperate
screams
if
you
struggle
you
will
be
subjected
to
the
Dementors
Kiss
the
mans
screams
subsided
but
dry
sobs
echoed
through
the
corridor
take
him
away
said
Umbridge
two
dementors
appeared
in
the
doorway
of
the
courtroom
their
rotting
scabbed
hands
clutching
the
upper
arms
of
a
wizard
who
appeared
to
be
fainting
they
glided
away
down
the
corridor
with
him
and
the
darkness
they
trailed
behind
them
swallowed
him
from
sight
next
Mary
Cattermole
called
Umbridge
a
small
woman
stood
up
she
was
trembling
from
head
to
foot
her
dark
hair
was
smoothed
back
into
a
bun
and
she
wore
long
plain
robes
her
face
was
completely
bloodless
as
she
passed
the
dementors
Harry
saw
her
shudder
he
did
it
instinctively
without
any
sort
of
plan
because
he
hated
the
sight
of
her
walking
alone
into
the
dungeon
As
the
door
began
to
swing
closed
he
slipped
into
the
courtroom
behind
her
it
was
not
the
same
room
in
which
he
had
once
been
interrogated
for
improper
use
of
magic
this
one
was
much
smaller
though
the
ceiling
was
quite
as
high
it
gave
the
claustrophobic
sense
of
being
stuck
at
the
bottom
of
a
deep
well
there
were
more
dementors
in
here
casting
their
freezing
aura
over
the
place
they
stood
like
faceless
sentinels
in
the
corners
farthest
from
the
high
raised
platform
here
behind
a
balustrade
sat
Umbridge
with
Yaxley
on
one
side
of
her
and
Hermione
quite
as
white-faced
as
Mrs
cattermole
on
the
other
at
the
foot
of
the
platform
a
bight-silver
long-haired
cat
prowled
up
and
down
up
and
down
and
Harry
realized
that
it
was
there
to
protect
the
prosecutors
from
the
despair
that
emanated
from
the
dementors
That
was
for
the
accused
to
feel
not
the
accusers
sit
down
said
Umbridge
in
her
soft
silky
voice
mrs
cattermole
stumbled
to
the
single
seat
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
beneath
the
raised
platform
the
moment
she
had
sat
down
chains
clinked
out
of
the
arms
of
the
chair
and
bound
her
there
you
are
Mary
Elizabeth
Cattermole
asked
Umbridge
mrs
cattermole
gave
a
single
shaky
nod
married
to
Reginald
Cattermole
of
the
Magical
Maintenance
Department
mrs
cattermole
burst
into
tears
i
dont
know
where
he
is
he
was
supposed
to
meet
me
here
umbridge
ignored
her
mother
to
Maisie
Ellie
and
Alfred
Cattermole
mrs
cattermole
sobbed
harder
than
ever
theyre
frightened
they
think
that
I
might
not
come
home
spare
us
spat
Yaxley
the
brats
of
Mudbloods
do
not
stir
our
sympathies
mrs
cattermoles
sobs
masked
Harrys
footsteps
as
he
made
his
way
carefully
toward
the
steps
that
led
up
to
the
raised
platform
the
moment
he
had
passed
the
place
where
the
Patronus
cat
patrolled
he
felt
the
change
in
temperature
It
was
warm
and
comfortable
here
the
Patronus
he
was
sure
was
Umbridges
and
it
glowed
brightly
because
she
was
so
happy
here
in
her
element
upholding
the
twisted
laws
she
had
helped
to
write
slowly
and
very
carefully
he
edged
his
way
along
the
platform
behind
Umbridge
Yaxley
and
Hermione
taking
a
seat
behind
the
latter
he
was
worried
about
making
Hermione
jump
he
thought
of
casting
the
Muffliato
charm
upon
Umbridge
and
Yaxley
but
even
murmuring
the
word
might
cause
Hermione
alarm
then
Umbridge
raised
her
voice
to
address
Mrs
cattermole
and
Harry
seized
his
chance
im
behind
you
he
whispered
into
Hermiones
ear
as
he
had
expected
she
jumped
so
violently
she
nearly
overturned
the
bottle
of
ink
with
which
she
was
supposed
to
be
recording
the
interview
but
both
Umbridge
and
Yaxley
were
concentrating
upon
Mrs
cattermole
and
this
went
unnoticed
a
wand
was
taken
from
you
upon
your
arrival
at
the
Ministry
today
Mrs
cattermole
Umbridge
was
saying
eight-and-three-quarter
inches
cherry
unicorn-hair
core
do
you
recognize
the
description
mrs
cattermole
nodded
mopping
her
eyes
on
her
sleeve
could
you
please
tell
us
from
which
witch
or
wizard
you
took
that
wand
t-took
sobbed
Mrs
cattermole
i
didnt
t-take
it
from
anybody
i
b-bought
it
when
I
was
eleven
years
old
it
it
it
chose
me
she
cried
harder
than
ever
umbridge
laughed
a
soft
girlish
laugh
that
made
Harry
want
to
attack
her
she
leaned
forward
over
the
barrier
the
better
to
observe
her
victim
and
something
gold
swung
forward
too
and
dangled
over
the
void
the
locket
hermione
had
seen
it
she
let
out
a
little
squeak
but
Umbridge
and
Yaxley
still
intent
upon
their
prey
were
deaf
to
everything
else
no
said
Umbridge
no
I
dont
think
so
Mrs
cattermole
wands
only
choose
witches
or
wizards
you
are
not
a
witch
i
have
your
responses
to
the
questionnaire
that
was
sent
to
you
here
Mafalda
pass
them
to
me
umbridge
held
out
a
small
hand
She
looked
so
toadlike
at
that
moment
that
Harry
was
quite
surprised
not
to
see
webs
between
the
stubby
fingers
hermiones
hands
were
shaking
with
shock
she
fumbled
in
a
pile
of
documents
balanced
on
the
chair
beside
her
finally
withdrawing
a
sheaf
of
parchment
with
Mrs
cattermoles
name
on
it
thats
thats
pretty
Dolores
she
said
pointing
at
the
pendant
gleaming
in
the
ruffled
folds
of
Umbridges
blouse
what
snapped
Umbridge
glancing
down
oh
yes
an
old
family
heirloom
she
said
patting
the
locket
lying
on
her
large
bosom
the
S
stands
for
Selwyn
i
am
related
to
the
Selwyns
indeed
there
are
few
pure-blood
families
to
whom
I
am
not
related
a
pity
she
continued
in
a
louder
voice
flicking
through
Mrs
cattermoles
questionnaire
that
the
same
cannot
be
said
for
you
Parents
professions
greengrocers
yaxley
laughed
jeeringly
below
the
fluffy
silver
cat
patrolled
up
and
down
and
the
dementors
stood
waiting
in
the
corners
it
was
Umbridges
lie
that
brought
the
blood
surging
into
Harrys
brain
and
obliterated
his
sense
of
caution
that
the
locket
she
had
taken
as
a
bribe
from
a
petty
criminal
was
being
used
to
bolster
her
own
pure-blood
credentials
he
raised
his
wand
not
even
troubling
to
keep
it
concealed
beneath
the
Invisibility
Cloak
and
said
Stupefy
there
was
a
flash
of
red
light
Umbridge
crumpled
and
her
forehead
hit
the
edge
of
the
balustrade
Mrs
cattermoles
papers
slid
off
her
lap
onto
the
floor
and
down
below
the
prowling
silver
cat
vanished
ice-cold
air
hit
them
like
an
oncoming
wind
Yaxley
confused
looked
around
for
the
source
of
the
trouble
and
saw
Harrys
disembodied
hand
and
wand
pointing
at
him
he
tried
to
draw
his
own
wand
but
too
late
Stupefy
yaxley
slid
to
the
ground
to
lie
curled
on
the
floor
harry
hermione
if
you
think
I
was
going
to
sit
here
and
let
her
pretend
harry
Mrs
cattermole
harry
whirled
around
throwing
off
the
Invisibility
Cloak
down
below
the
dementors
had
moved
out
of
their
corners
they
were
gliding
toward
the
woman
chained
to
the
chair
Whether
because
the
Patronus
had
vanished
or
because
they
sensed
that
their
masters
were
no
longer
in
control
they
seemed
to
have
abandoned
restraint
mrs
cattermole
let
out
a
terrible
scream
of
fear
as
a
slimy
scabbed
hand
grasped
her
chin
and
forced
her
face
back
expecto
patronum
the
silver
stag
soared
from
the
tip
of
Harrys
wand
and
leaped
toward
the
dementors
which
fell
back
and
melted
into
the
dark
shadows
again
the
stags
light
more
powerful
and
more
warming
than
the
cats
protection
filled
the
whole
dungeon
as
it
cantered
around
the
room
get
the
Horcrux
Harry
told
Hermione
he
ran
back
down
the
steps
stuffing
the
Invisibility
Cloak
into
his
back
and
approached
Mrs
cattermole
you
she
whispered
gazing
into
his
face
but
but
Reg
said
you
were
the
one
who
submitted
my
name
for
questioning

I
muttered
Harry
tugging
at
the
chains
binding
her
arms
Well

of
heart

Geminio
there

fool
her
hermione
came
running
downstairs
lets
see
relashio
the
chains
clinked
and
withdrew
into
the
arms
of
the
chair
mrs
cattermole
looked
just
as
frightened
as
ever
before
i
dont
understand
she
whispered
youre
going
to
leave
here
with
us
said
Harry
pulling
her
to
her
feet
go
home
grab
your
children
and
get
out
get
out
of
the
country
if
youve

like
a
fair
hearing

harry
said
Hermione
how
are
we
going
to
get
out
of
here
with
all
those
dementors
outside
the
door
patronuses
said
Harry
pointing
his
wand
at
his
own
the
stag
slowed
and
walked
still
gleaming
brightly
toward
the
door
as
many
as
we
can
muster
do
yours
Hermione
expec
Expecto
patronum
said
Hermione
nothing
happened
its
the
only
spell
she
ever
has
trouble
with
Harry
told
a
completely
bemused
Mrs
cattermole
bit
unfortunate
really
come
on
Hermione
Expecto
patronum
a
silver
otter
burst
from
the
end
of
Hermiones
wand
and
swam
gracefully
through
the
air
to
join
the
stag
cmon
said
Harry
and
he
led
Hermione
and
Mrs
cattermole
to
the
door
when
the
Patronuses
glided
out
of
the
dungeon
there
were
cries
of
shock
from
the
people
waiting
outside
harry
looked
around
the
dementors
were
falling
back
on
both
sides
of
them
melding
into
the
darkness
scattering
before
the
silver
creatures
its
been
decided
that
you
should
all
go
home
and
go
into
hiding
with
your
families
Harry
told
the
waiting
muggle-born
who
were
dazzled
by
the
light
of
the
Patronuses
and
still
cowering
slightly
go
abroad
if
you
can
just
get
well
away
from
the
Ministry
thats
the
er
new
official
position
now
if
youll
just
follow
the
Patronuses
youll
be
able
to
leave
the
Atrium
they
managed
to
get
up
the
stone
stops
without
being
intercepted
but
as
they
approached
the
lifts
Harry
started
to
have
misgivings
if
they
emerged
into
the
Atrium
with
a
silver
stag
and
otter
soaring
alongside
it
and
twenty
or
so
people
half
of
them
accused
muggle-borns
he
could
not
help
feeling
that
they
would
attract
unwanted
attention
he
had
just
reached
this
unwelcome
conclusion
when
the
lift
clanged
to
a
halt
in
front
of
them
reg
screamed
Mrs
cattermole
and
she
threw
herself
into
Rons
arms
runcorn
let
me
out
he
attacked
Umbridge
and
Yaxley
and
hes
told
all
of
us
to
leave
the
country
i
think
wed
better
do
it
Reg
I
really
do
lets
hurry
home
and
fetch
the
children
and
why
are
you
so
wet
water
muttered
Ron
disengaging
himself
harry
they
know
there
are
intruders
inside
the
Ministry
something
about
a
hole
in
Umbridges
office
door
i
reckon
weve
got
five
minutes
if
that
hermiones
Patronus
vanished
with
a
pop
as
she
turned
a
horror
struck
face
to
Harry
harry
if
were
trapped
here
we
wont
be
if
we
move
fast
said
Harry
he
addressed
the
silent
group
behind
them
who
were
all
gawping
at
him
whos
got
wands
about
half
of
them
raised
their
hands
okay
all
of
you
who
havent
got
wands
need
to
attach
yourself
to
somebody
who
has
well
need
to
be
fast
before
they
stop
us
come
on
they
managed
to
cram
themselves
into
two
lifts
harrys
Patronus
stood
sentinel
before
the
golden
grilles
as
they
shut
and
the
lifts
began
to
rise
level
eight
said
the
witchs
cool
voice
Atrium
harry
knew
at
once
that
they
were
in
trouble
the
Atrium
was
full
of
people
moving
from
fireplace
to
fireplace
sealing
them
off
harry
squeaked
Hermione
what
are
we
going
to
stop
harry
thundered
and
the
powerful
voice
of
Runcorn
echoed
through
the
Atrium
The
wizards
sealing
the
fireplaces
froze
follow
me
he
whispered
to
the
group
of
terrified
muggle-borns
who
moved
forward
in
a
huddle
shepherded
by
Ron
and
Hermione
whats
up
Albert
said
the
same
balding
wizard
who
had
followed
Harry
out
of
the
fireplace
earlier
he
looked
nervous
this
lot
need
to
leave
before
you
seal
the
exits
said
Harry
with
all
the
authority
he
could
muster
the
group
of
wizards
in
front
of
him
looked
at
one
another
weve
been
told
to
seal
all
exits
and
not
let
anyone
are
you
contradicting
me
harry
blustered
would
you
like
me
to
have
your
family
tree
examined
like
I
had
Dirk
Cresswells
sorry
gasped
the
balding
wizard
backing
away
i
didnt
mean
nothing
Albert
but
I
thought
i
thought
they
were
in
for
questioning
and
their
blood
is
pure
said
Harry
and
his
deep
voice
echoed
impressively
through
the
hall
purer
than
many
of
yours
I
daresay
off
you
go
he
boomed
to
the
muggle-borns
who
scurried
forward
into
the
fireplaces
and
began
to
vanish
in
pairs
the
Ministry
wizards
hung
back
some
looking
confused
others
scared
and
fearful
then
mary
mrs
cattermole
looked
over
her
shoulder
the
real
Reg
Cattermole
no
longer
vomiting
but
pale
and
wan
had
just
come
running
out
of
a
lift
r
Reg
she
looked
from
her
husband
to
Ron
who
swore
loudly
the
balding
wizard
gaped
his
head
turning
ludicrously
from
one
Reg
Cattermole
to
the
other
hey
whats
going
on
what
is
this
seal
the
exit
seal
it
yaxley
had
burst
out
of
another
lift
and
was
running
toward
the
group
beside
the
fireplaces
into
which
all
of
the
muggle-borns
but
Mrs
cattermole
had
now
vanished
as
the
balding
wizard
lifted
his
wand
Harry
raised
an
enormous
fist
and
punched
him
sending
him
flying
through
the
air
hes
been
helping
muggle-borns
escape
Yaxley
harry
shouted
the
balding
wizards
colleagues
set
up
and
uproar
under
cover
of
which
Ron
grabbed
Mrs
cattermole
pulled
her
into
the
still-open
fireplace
and
disappeared
confused
Yaxley
looked
from
Harry
to
the
punched
wizard
while
the
real
Reg
Cattermole
screamed
My
wife
who
was
that
with
my
wife
whats
going
on
harry
saw
Yaxleys
head
turn
saw
an
inkling
of
truth
dawn
on
that
brutish
face
come
on
harry
shouted
at
Hermione
he
seized
her
hand
and
they
jumped
into
the
fireplace
together
as
Yaxleys
curse
sailed
over
Harrys
head
they
spun
for
a
few
seconds
before
shooting
up
out
of
a
toilet
into
a
cubicle
harry
flung
open
the
door
Ron
was
standing
there
beside
the
sinks
still
wrestling
with
Mrs
cattermole
reg
I
dont
understand
let
go
Im
not
your
husband
youve
got
to
go
home
there
was
a
noise
in
the
cubicle
behind
them
Harry
looked
around
Yaxley
had
just
appeared
lets
go
harry
yelled
he
seized
Hermione
by
the
hand
and
Ron
by
the
arm
and
turned
on
the
stop
darkness
engulfed
them
along
with
the
sensation
of
compressing
hands
but
something
was
wrong
hermiones
hand
seemed
to
be
sliding
out
of
his
grip
he
wondered
whether
he
was
going
to
suffocate
he
could
not
breathe
or
see
and
the
only
solid
things
in
the
world
were
Rons
arm
and
Hermiones
fingers
which
were
slowly
slipping
away
and
then
he
saw
the
door
to
number
twelve
Grimmauld
Place
with
its
serpent
door
knocker
but
before
he
could
draw
breath
there
was
a
scream
and
a
flash
of
purple
light
Hermiones
hand
was
suddenly
vicelike
upon
his
and
everything
went
dark
again
chapter
Fourteen
the
Thief
harry
opened
his
eyes
and
was
dazzled
by
gold
and
green
he
had
no
idea
what
had
happened
he
only
knew
that
he
was
lying
on
what
seemed
to
be
leaves
and
twigs
struggling
to
draw
breath
into
lungs
that
felt
flattened
he
blinked
and
realized
that
the
gaudy
glare
was
sunlight
streaming
through
a
canopy
of
leaves
far
above
him
then
an
object
twitched
close
to
his
face
he
pushed
himself
onto
his
hands
and
knees
ready
to
face
some
small
fierce
creature
but
saw
that
the
object
was
Rons
foot
looking
around
Harry
saw
that
they
and
Hermione
were
lying
on
a
forest
floor
apparently
alone
harrys
first
thought
was
of
the
Forbidden
Forest
and
for
a
moment
even
though
he
knew
how
foolish
and
dangerous
it
would
be
for
them
to
appear
in
the
grounds
of
Hogwarts
his
heart
leapt
at
the
thought
of
sneaking
through
the
trees
to
Hagrids
hut
however
in
the
few
moments
it
took
for
Ron
to
give
a
low
groan
and
Harry
to
start
crawling
toward
him
he
realized
that
this
was
not
the
Forbidden
Forest
The
trees
looked
younger
they
were
more
widely
spaced
the
ground
clearer
he
met
Hermione
also
on
her
hands
and
knees
at
Rons
head
the
moment
his
eyes
fell
upon
Ron
all
other
concerns
fled
Harrys
mind
for
blood
drenched
the
whole
of
Rons
left
side
and
his
face
stood
out
grayish-white
against
the
leaf-strewn
earth
the
Polyjuice
Potion
was
wearing
off
now
Ron
was
halfway
between
Cattermole
and
himself
in
appearance
his
hair
turning
redder
and
redder
as
his
face
drained
of
the
little
color
it
had
left
whats
happened
to
him
splinched
said
Hermione
her
fingers
already
busy
at
Rons
sleeve
where
the
blood
was
wettest
and
darkest
harry
watched
horrified
as
she
tore
open
Rons
short
he
had
always
thought
of
Splinching
as
something
comical
but
this
his
insides
crawled
unpleasantly
as
Hermione
laid
bare
Rons
upper
arm
where
a
great
chunk
of
flesh
was
missing
scooped
cleanly
away
as
though
by
a
knife
harry
quickly
in
my
bag
theres
a
small
bottle
labeled
Essence
of
Dittany
bag
right
harry
sped
to
the
place
where
Hermione
had
landed
seized
the
tiny
beaded
bag
and
thrust
his
hand
inside
it
at
once
object
after
object
began
presenting
itself
to
his
touch
He
felt
the
leather
spines
of
books
woolly
sleeves
of
jumpers
heels
of
shoes
quickly
he
grabbed
his
wand
from
the
ground
and
pointed
it
into
the
depths
of
the
magical
bag
accio
Dittany
a
small
brown
bottle
zoomed
out
of
the
bag
he
caught
it
and
hastened
back
to
Hermione
and
Ron
whose
eyes
were
now
half-closed
strips
of
white
eyeball
all
that
were
visible
between
his
lids
hes
fainted
said
Hermione
who
was
also
rather
pale
she
no
longer
looked
like
Mafalda
though
her
hair
was
still
gray
in
places
unstopper
it
for
me
Harry
my
hands
are
shaking
harry
wrenched
the
stopper
off
the
little
bottle
Hermione
took
it
and
poured
three
drops
of
the
potion
onto
the
bleeding
wound
greenish
smoke
billowed
upward
and
when
it
had
cleared
Harry
saw
that
the
bleeding
had
stopped
the
wound
now
looked
several
days
old
new
skin
stretched
over
what
had
just
been
open
flesh
wow
said
Harry
its
all
I
feel
safe
doing
said
Hermione
shakily
there
are
spells
that
would
put
him
completely
right
but
I
darent
try
in
case
I
do
them
wrong
and
cause
more
damage
hes
lost
so
much
blood
already
how
did
he
get
hurt
i
mean
Harry
shook
his
head
trying
to
clear
it
to
make
sense
of
whatever
had
just
taken
place
why
are
we
here
i
thought
we
were
going
back
to
Grimmauld
Place
hermione
took
a
deep
breath
she
looked
close
to
tears
harry
I
dont
think
were
going
to
be
able
to
go
back
there
what
dyou
as
we
Disapparated
Yaxley
caught
hold
of
me
and
I
couldnt
get
rid
of
him
he
was
too
strong
and
he
was
still
holding
on
when
we
arrived
at
Grimmauld
Place
and
then
well
I
think
he
must
have
seen
the
door
and
thought
we
were
stopping
there
so
he
slackened
his
grip
and
I
managed
to
sake
him
off
and
I
brought
us
here
instead
but
then
wheres
he
hang
on
you
dont
mean
hes
at
Grimmauld
Place
he
cant
get
in
there
her
eyes
sparkled
with
unshed
tears
as
she
nodded
harry
I
think
he
can
i
I
forced
him
to
let
go
with
a
Revulsion
Jinx
but
Id
already
taken
him
inside
the
Fidelius
Charms
protection
since
Dumbledore
died
were
Secret-Keepers
so
Ive
given
him
the
secret
havent
I
there
was
no
pretending
Harry
was
sure
she
was
right
it
was
a
serious
blow
if
Yaxley
could
now
get
inside
the
house
there
was
no
way
that
they
could
return
even
now
he
could
be
bringing
other
Death
Eaters
in
there
by
Apparition
gloomy
and
oppressive
though
the
house
was
it
had
been
their
one
safe
refuge
even
now
that
Kreacher
was
so
much
happier
and
friendlier
a
kind
of
home
with
a
twinge
of
regret
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
food
Harry
imagined
the
house-elf
busying
himself
over
the
steak-and-kidney
pie
that
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
would
never
eat
harry
Im
sorry
Im
so
sorry
dont
be
stupid
it
wasnt
your
fault
if
anything
it
was
mine
harry
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
drew
out
Mad-Eyes
eye
hermione
recoiled
looking
horrified
umbridge
had
stuck
it
to
her
office
door
to
spy
on
people
i
couldnt
leave
it
there
but
thats
how
they
knew
there
were
intruders
before
Hermione
could
answer
Ron
groaned
and
opened
his
eyes
he
was
still
gray
and
his
face
glistened
with
sweat
how
dyou
feel
hermione
whispered
lousy
croaked
Ron
wincing
as
he
felt
his
injured
arm
where
are
we
in
the
woods
where
they
held
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
said
Hermione
i
wanted
somewhere
enclosed
undercover
and
this
was
the
first
place
you
thought
of
Harry
finished
for
her
glancing
around
at
the
apparently
deserted
glade
he
could
not
help
remembering
what
had
happened
the
last
time
they
had
Apparated
to
the
first
place
Hermione
had
thought
of
how
Death
Eaters
had
found
them
within
minutes
had
it
been
Legilimency
did
Voldemort
or
his
henchmen
know
even
now
where
Hermione
had
taken
them
dyou
reckon
we
should
move
on
ron
asked
Harry
and
Harry
could
tell
by
the
look
on
Rons
face
that
he
was
thinking
the
same
i
dunno
ron
still
looked
pale
and
clammy
he
had
made
no
attempt
to
sit
up
and
it
looked
as
though
he
was
too
weak
to
do
so
the
prospect
of
moving
him
was
daunting
lets
stay
here
for
now
Harry
said
looking
relieved
Hermione
sprang
to
her
feet
where
are
you
going
asked
Ron
if
were
staying
we
should
put
some
protective
enchantments
around
the
place
she
replied
and
raising
her
wand
she
began
to
walk
in
a
wide
circle
around
Harry
and
Ron
murmuring
incantations
as
she
went
harry
saw
little
disturbances
in
the
surrounding
air
It
was
as
if
Hermione
had
cast
a
heat
haze
upon
their
clearing
salvio
Hexia
protego
Totalum
repello
Muggletum
muffliato
you
could
get
out
the
tent
Harry
tent
in
the
bag
in
the
of
course
said
Harry
he
did
not
bother
to
grope
inside
it
this
time
but
used
another
Summoning
Charm
the
tent
emerged
in
a
lumpy
mass
of
canvas
ropes
and
poles
harry
recognized
it
partly
because
of
the
smell
of
cats
as
the
same
tent
in
which
they
had
slept
on
the
night
of
the
Quidditch
World
Cup
i
thought
this
belonged
to
that
bloke
Perkins
at
the
Ministry
he
asked
starting
to
disentangle
the
pent
pegs
apparently
he
didnt
want
it
back
his
lumbagos
so
bad
said
Hermione
now
performing
complicated
figure-of-eight
movements
with
her
wand
so
Rons
dad
said
I
could
borrow
it
erecto
she
added
pointing
her
wand
at
the
misshapen
canvas
which
in
one
fluid
motion
rose
into
the
air
and
settled
fully
constructed
onto
the
ground
before
Harry
out
of
whose
startled
hands
a
tent
peg
soared
to
land
with
a
final
thud
at
the
end
of
a
guy
rope
cave
Inimicum
Hermione
finished
with
a
skyward
flourish
thats
as
much
as
I
can
do
at
the
very
least
we
should
know
theyre
coming
I
cant
guarantee
it
will
keep
out
Vol
dont
say
the
name
ron
cut
across
her
his
voice
harsh
harry
and
Hermione
looked
at
each
other
im
sorry
Ron
said
moaning
a
little
as
he
raised
himself
to
look
at
them
but
it
feels
like
a
a
jinx
or
something
cant
we
call
him
You-Know-Who
please
dumbledore
said
fear
of
a
name
began
Harry
in
case
you
hadnt
noticed
mate
calling
You-Know-Who
by
his
name
didnt
do
Dumbledore
much
good
in
the
end
Ron
snapped
back
just
just
show
You-Know-Who
some
respect
will
you
respect
harry
repeated
but
Hermione
shot
him
a
warning
look
apparently
he
was
not
to
argue
with
Ron
while
the
latter
was
in
such
a
weakened
condition
harry
and
Hermione
half
carried
half
dragged
Ron
through
the
entrance
of
the
tent
the
interior
was
exactly
as
Harry
remembered
it
a
small
flat
complete
with
bathroom
and
tiny
kitchen
he
shoved
aside
an
old
armchair
and
lowered
Ron
carefully
onto
the
lower
berth
of
a
bunk
bed
even
this
very
short
journey
had
turned
Ron
whiter
still
and
once
they
had
settled
him
on
the
mattress
he
closed
his
eyes
again
and
did
not
speak
for
a
while
ill
make
some
tea
said
Hermione
breathlessly
pulling
kettle
and
mugs
from
the
depths
of
her
bag
and
heading
toward
the
kitchen
harry
found
the
hot
drink
as
welcome
as
the
firewhisky
had
been
on
the
night
that
Mad-Eye
had
died
it
seemed
to
burn
away
a
little
of
the
fear
fluttering
in
his
chest
after
a
minute
or
two
Ron
broke
the
silence
what
dyou
reckon
happened
to
the
Cattermoles
with
any
luck
theyll
have
got
away
said
Hermione
clutching
her
hot
mug
for
comfort
as
long
as
mr.
Cattermole
had
his
wits
about
him
hell
have
transported
Mrs
cattermole
by
Side-Along-Apparition
and
theyll
be
fleeing
the
country
right
now
with
their
children
thats
what
Harry
told
her
to
do
blimey
I
hope
they
escaped
said
Ron
leaning
back
on
his
pillows
the
tea
seemed
to
be
doing
him
good
a
little
of
his
color
had
returned
i
didnt
get
the
feeling
Reg
Cattermole
was
all
that
quick-witted
though
the
way
everyone
was
talking
to
me
when
I
was
him
god
I
hope
they
made
it
if
they
both
end
up
in
Azkaban
because
of
us
harry
looked
over
at
Hermione
and
the
question
he
had
been
about
to
ask
about
whether
Mrs
cattermoles
lack
of
a
wand
would
prevent
her
Apparating
alongside
her
husband
died
in
his
throat
hermione
was
watching
Ron
fret
over
the
fate
of
the
Cattermoles
and
there
was
such
tenderness
in
her
expression
that
Harry
felt
almost
as
if
he
had
surprised
her
in
the
act
of
kissing
him
so
have
you
got
it
harry
asked
her
partly
to
remind
her
that
he
was
there
got
got
what
she
said
with
a
little
start
what
did
we
just
go
through
all
that
for
the
locket
wheres
the
locket
you
got
it
shouted
Ron
raising
himself
a
little
higher
on
his
pillows
no
one
tells
me
anything
blimey
you
could
have
mentioned
it
well
we
were
running
for
our
lives
from
the
Death
Eaters
werent
we
said
Hermione
here
and
she
pulled
the
locket
out
of
the
pocket
of
her
robes
and
handed
it
to
Ron
it
was
as
large
as
a
chickens
egg
an
ornate
letter
S
inlaid
with
many
small
green
stones
glinted
dully
in
the
diffused
light
shining
through
the
tents
canvas
roof
there
isnt
any
chance
someones
destroyed
it
since
Kreacher
had
it
asked
Ron
hopefully
i
mean
are
we
sure
its
still
a
Horcrux
i
think
so
said
Hermione
taking
it
back
from
him
and
looking
at
it
closely
thered
be
some
sign
of
damage
if
it
had
been
magically
destroyed
she
passed
it
to
Harry
who
turned
it
over
in
his
fingers
the
thing
looked
perfect
pristine
he
remembered
the
mangled
remains
of
the
diary
and
how
the
stone
in
the
Horcrux
ring
had
been
cracked
open
when
Dumbledore
destroyed
it
i
reckon
Kreachers
right
said
Harry
were
going
to
have
to
work
out
how
to
open
this
thing
before
we
can
destroy
it
sudden
awareness
of
what
he
was
holding
of
what
lived
behind
the
little
golden
doors
hit
Harry
as
he
spoke
even
after
all
their
efforts
to
find
it
he
felt
a
violent
urge
to
fling
the
locket
from
him
mastering
himself
again
he
tried
to
prise
the
locket
apart
with
his
fingers
then
attempted
the
charm
Hermione
had
used
to
open
Reguluss
bedroom
door
neither
worked
he
handed
the
locket
back
to
Ron
and
Hermione
each
of
whom
did
their
best
but
were
no
more
successful
at
opening
it
than
he
had
been
can
you
feel
it
though
ron
asked
in
a
hushed
voice
as
he
held
it
tight
in
his
clenched
fist
what
dyou
mean
ron
passed
the
Horcrux
to
Harry
after
a
moment
or
two
Harry
thought
he
knew
what
Ron
meant
was
it
his
own
blood
pulsing
through
his
veins
that
he
could
feel
or
was
it
something
beating
inside
the
locket
like
a
tiny
metal
heart
what
are
we
going
to
do
with
it
hermione
asked
keep
it
safe
till
we
work
out
how
to
destroy
it
harry
replied
and
little
though
he
wanted
to
he
hung
the
chain
around
his
own
neck
dropping
the
locket
out
of
sight
beneath
his
robes
where
it
rested
against
his
chest
beside
the
pouch
Hagrid
had
given
him
i
think
we
should
take
it
in
turns
to
keep
watch
outside
the
tent
he
added
to
Hermione
standing
up
and
stretching
and
well
need
to
think
about
some
food
as
well
you
stay
there
he
added
sharply
as
Ron
attempted
to
sit
up
and
turned
a
nasty
shade
of
green
with
the
Sneakoscope
Hermione
had
given
Harry
for
his
birthday
set
carefully
upon
the
table
in
the
tent
Harry
and
Hermione
spent
the
rest
of
the
day
sharing
the
role
of
lookout
however
the
Sneakoscope
remained
silent
and
still
upon
its
point
all
day
and
whether
because
of
the
protective
enchantments
and
muggle-repelling
charms
Hermione
had
spread
around
them
or
because
people
rarely
ventured
this
way
their
patch
of
wood
remained
deserted
apart
from
occasional
birds
and
squirrels
evening
brought
no
change
Harry
lit
his
wand
as
he
swapped
places
with
Hermione
at
ten
oclock
and
looked
out
upon
a
deserted
scene
noting
the
bats
fluttering
high
above
him
across
the
single
patch
of
starry
sky
visible
from
their
protected
clearing
he
felt
hungry
now
and
a
little
light-headed
hermione
had
not
packed
any
food
in
her
magical
bag
as
she
had
assumed
that
they
would
be
returning
to
Grimmauld
Place
that
night
so
they
had
had
nothing
to
eat
except
some
wild
mushrooms
that
Hermione
had
collected
from
amongst
the
nearest
trees
and
stewed
in
a
Billycan
after
a
couple
of
mouthfuls
Ron
had
pushed
his
portion
away
looking
queasy
Harry
had
only
persevered
so
as
to
not
hurt
Hermiones
feelings
the
surrounding
silence
was
broken
by
odd
rustlings
and
what
sounded
like
crackings
of
twigs
Harry
thought
that
they
were
caused
by
animals
rather
than
people
yet
he
kept
his
wand
held
tight
at
the
ready
his
insides
already
uncomfortable
due
to
their
inadequate
helping
of
rubbery
mushrooms
tingled
with
unease
he
had
though
that
he
would
feel
elated
if
they
managed
to
steal
back
the
Horcrux
but
somehow
he
did
not
all
he
felt
as
he
sat
looking
out
at
the
darkness
of
which
his
wand
lit
only
a
tiny
part
was
worry
about
what
would
happen
next
it
was
as
though
he
had
been
hurtling
toward
this
point
for
weeks
months
maybe
even
years
but
how
he
had
come
to
an
abrupt
halt
run
out
of
road
there
were
other
Horcruxes
out
there
somewhere
but
he
did
not
have
the
faintest
idea
where
they
could
be
he
did
not
even
know
what
all
of
them
were
meanwhile
he
was
at
a
loss
to
know
how
to
destroy
the
only
one
that
they
had
found
the
Horcrux
that
currently
lay
against
the
bare
flesh
of
his
chest
curiously
it
had
not
taken
heat
from
his
body
but
lay
so
cold
against
his
skin
it
might
just
have
emerged
from
icy
water
from
time
to
time
Harry
thought
or
perhaps
imagined
that
he
could
feel
the
tiny
heartbeat
ticking
irregularly
alongside
his
own
nameless
forebodings
crept
upon
him
as
he
sat
there
in
the
dark
he
tried
to
resist
them
push
them
away
yet
they
came
at
him
relentlessly
neither
can
live
while
the
other
survives
ron
and
Hermione
now
talking
softly
behind
him
in
the
tent
could
walk
away
if
they
wanted
to
He
could
not
and
it
seemed
to
Harry
as
he
sat
there
trying
to
master
his
own
fear
and
exhaustion
that
the
Horcrux
against
his
chest
was
ticking
away
the
time
he
had
left
stupid
idea
he
told
himself
dont
think
that
his
scar
was
starting
to
prickle
again
he
was
afraid
that
he
was
making
it
happen
by
having
these
thoughts
and
tried
to
direct
them
into
another
channel
he
thought
of
poor
Kreacher
who
had
expected
them
home
and
had
received
Yaxley
instead
would
the
elf
keep
silent
or
would
he
tell
the
Death
Eater
everything
he
knew
harry
wanted
to
believe
that
Kreacher
had
changed
towards
him
in
the
past
month
that
he
would
be
loyal
now
but
who
knew
what
would
happen
what
if
the
Death
Eaters
tortured
the
elf
sick
images
swarmed
into
Harrys
head
and
he
tried
to
push
these
away
too
for
there
was
nothing
he
could
do
for
Kreacher
He
and
Hermione
had
already
decided
against
trying
to
summon
him
what
if
someone
from
the
Ministry
came
too
they
could
not
count
on
elfish
Apparition
being
free
from
the
same
flaw
that
had
taken
Yaxley
to
Grimmauld
Place
on
the
hem
of
Hermiones
sleeve
harrys
scar
was
burning
now
he
thought
that
there
was
so
much
they
did
not
know
Lupin
had
been
right
about
magic
they
had
never
encountered
or
imagined
why
hadnt
Dumbledore
explained
more
had
he
thought
that
there
would
be
time
that
he
would
live
for
years
for
centuries
perhaps
like
his
friend
Nicolas
Flamel
if
so
he
had
been
wrong
snape
had
seen
to
that
snape
the
sleeping
snake
who
had
struck
at
the
top
of
the
tower
and
Dumbledore
had
fallen
fallen
give
it
to
me
Gregorovitch
harrys
voice
was
high
clear
and
cold
his
wand
held
in
front
of
him
by
a
long-fingered
white
hand
the
man
at
whom
he
was
pointing
was
suspended
upside
down
in
midair
though
there
were
no
ropes
holding
him
he
swung
there
invisibly
and
eerily
bound
his
limbs
wrapped
about
him
his
terrified
face
on
a
level
with
Harrys
ruddy
due
to
the
blood
that
had
rushed
to
his
head
he
had
pure-white
hair
and
a
thick
bushy
beard
a
trussed-up
Father
Christmas
i
have
it
not
I
have
it
no
more
it
was
many
years
ago
stolen
from
me
do
not
lie
to
Lord
Voldemort
Gregorovitch
he
knows
he
always
knows
the
hanging
mans
pupils
were
wide
dilated
with
fear
and
they
seemed
to
swell
bigger
and
bigger
until
their
blackness
swallowed
Harry
whole
and
how
Harry
was
hurrying
along
a
dark
corridor
in
stout
little
Gregorovitchs
wake
as
he
held
a
lantern
aloft
Gregorovitch
burst
into
the
room
at
the
end
of
the
passage
and
his
lantern
illuminated
what
looked
like
a
workshop
wood
shavings
and
gold
gleamed
in
the
swinging
pool
of
light
and
there
on
the
window
ledge
sat
perched
like
a
giant
bird
a
young
man
with
golden
hair
in
the
split
second
that
the
lanterns
light
illuminated
him
Harry
saw
the
delight
upon
his
handsome
face
then
the
intruder
shot
a
Stunning
Spell
from
his
wand
and
jumped
neatly
backward
out
of
the
window
with
a
crow
of
laughter
and
Harry
was
hurtling
back
out
of
those
wide
tunnellike
pupils
and
Gregorovitchs
face
was
stricken
with
terror
who
was
the
thief
Gregorovitch
said
the
high
cold
voice
i
do
not
know
I
never
knew
a
young
man
no
please
please
a
scream
that
went
on
and
on
and
then
a
burst
of
green
light
harry
he
opened
his
eyes
panting
his
forehead
throbbing
he
had
passed
out
against
the
side
of
the
tent
had
slid
sideways
down
the
canvas
and
was
sprawled
on
the
ground
he
looked
up
at
Hermione
whose
bushy
hair
obscured
the
tiny
patch
of
sky
visible
through
the
dark
branches
high
above
them
dream
he
said
sitting
up
quickly
and
attempting
to
meet
Hermiones
glower
with
a
look
of
innocence
mustve
dozed
off
sorry
i
know
it
was
your
scar
i
can
tell
by
the
look
on
your
face
you
were
looking
into
Vol
dont
say
his
name
came
Rons
angry
voice
from
the
depths
of
the
tent
fine
retorted
Hermione
You-Know-Whos
mind
then
i
didnt
mean
it
to
happen
harry
said
it
was
a
dream
can
you
control
what
you
dream
about
Hermione
if
you
just
learned
to
apply
Occlumency
but
Harry
was
not
interested
in
being
told
off
he
wanted
to
discuss
what
he
had
just
seen
hes
found
Gregorovitch
Hermione
and
I
think
hes
killed
him
but
before
he
killed
him
he
read
Gregorovitchs
mind
and
I
saw
i
think
Id
better
take
over
the
watch
if
youre
so
tired
youre
falling
sleep
said
Hermione
coldly
i
can
finish
the
watch
no
youre
obviously
exhausted
go
and
lie
down
she
dropped
down
in
the
mouth
of
the
tent
looking
stubborn
angry
but
wishing
to
avoid
a
row
Harry
ducked
back
inside
rons
still-pale
face
was
poking
out
from
the
lower
bunk
Harry
climbed
into
the
one
above
him
lay
down
and
looked
up
at
the
dark
canvas
ceiling
after
several
moments
Ron
spoke
in
a
voice
so
low
that
it
would
not
carry
to
Hermione
huddle
in
the
entrance
whats
You-Know-Who
doing
harry
screwed
up
his
eyes
in
the
effort
to
remember
every
detail
then
whispered
into
the
darkness
he
found
Gregorovitch
he
had
him
tied
up
he
was
torturing
him
hows
Gregorovitch
supposed
to
make
him
a
new
wand
if
hes
tied
up
i
dunno
its
weird
isnt
it
harry
closed
his
eyes
thinking
of
all
that
he
had
seen
and
heard
the
more
he
recalled
the
less
sense
it
made
voldemort
had
said
nothing
about
Harrys
wand
nothing
about
the
twin
cores
nothing
about
Gregorovitch
making
a
new
and
more
powerful
wand
to
beat
Harrys
he
wanted
something
from
Gregorovitch
Harry
said
eyes
still
closed
tight
he
asked
him
to
hand
it
over
but
Gregorovitch
said
it
had
been
stolen
from
him
and
then
then
he
remembered
how
he
as
Voldemort
had
seemed
to
hurtle
through
Gregorovitchs
eyes
into
his
memories
he
read
Gregorovitchs
mind
and
I
saw
this
young
bloke
perched
on
a
windowsill
and
he
fired
a
curse
at
Gregorovitch
and
jumped
out
of
sight
he
stole
it
he
stole
whatever
You-Know-Whos
after
and
I
i
think
Ive
seen
him
somewhere
harry
wished
he
could
have
another
glimpse
of
the
laughing
boys
face
the
theft
had
happened
many
years
ago
according
to
Gregorovitch
why
did
the
young
thief
look
familiar
the
noises
of
the
surrounding
woods
were
muffled
inside
the
tent
all
Harry
could
hear
was
Rons
breathing
after
a
while
Ron
whispered
Couldnt
you
see
what
the
thief
was
holding
no
it
mustve
been
something
small
harry
the
wooden
slats
of
Rons
bunk
creaked
as
he
repositioned
himself
in
bed
harry
you
dont
reckon
You-Know-Whos
after
something
else
to
turn
into
a
Horcrux
i
dont
know
said
Harry
slowly
maybe
but
wouldnt
it
be
dangerous
for
him
to
make
another
one
didnt
Hermione
say
he
had
pushed
his
soul
to
the
limit
already
yeah
but
maybe
he
doesnt
know
that
yeah
maybe
said
Harry
he
had
been
sure
that
Voldemort
had
been
looking
for
a
way
around
the
problem
of
the
twin
cores
sure
that
Voldemort
sought
a
solution
from
the
old
wandmaker
and
yet
he
had
killed
him
apparently
without
asking
him
a
single
question
about
wandlore
what
was
Voldemort
trying
to
find
why
with
the
Ministry
of
Magic
and
the
Wizarding
world
at
his
feet
was
he
far
away
intent
on
the
pursuit
of
an
object
that
Gregorovitch
had
once
owned
and
which
had
been
stolen
by
the
unknown
thief
harry
could
still
see
the
blond-haired
youths
face
it
was
merry
wild
there
was
a
Fred
and
george-ish
air
of
triumphant
trickery
about
him
he
had
soared
from
the
windowsill
like
a
bird
and
Harry
had
seen
him
before
but
he
could
not
think
where
with
Gregorovitch
dead
it
was
the
merry-faced
thief
who
was
in
danger
now
and
it
was
on
him
that
Harrys
thoughts
dwelled
as
Rons
snores
began
to
rumble
from
the
lower
bunk
and
as
he
himself
drifted
slowly
into
sleep
once
more
chapter
Fifteen
the
Goblins
Revenge
early
next
morning
before
the
other
two
were
awake
Harry
left
the
tent
to
search
the
woods
around
them
for
the
oldest
most
gnarled
and
resilient-looking
tree
he
could
find
there
in
its
shadows
he
buried
Mad-Eye
moody's
eye
and
marked
the
spot
by
gouging
a
small
cross
in
the
bark
with
his
wand
it
was
not
much
but
Harry
felt
that
Mad-Eye
would
have
much
preferred
this
to
being
stuck
on
Dolores
umbridge's
door
then
he
returned
to
the
tent
to
wait
for
the
others
to
wake
and
discuss
what
they
were
going
to
do
next
harry
and
Hermione
felt
that
it
was
best
not
to
stay
anywhere
too
long
and
Ron
agreed
wit
the
sole
proviso
that
their
next
move
took
them
within
reach
of
a
bacon
sandwich
hermione
therefore
removed
the
enchantments
she
had
placed
around
the
clearing
while
Harry
and
Ron
obliterated
all
the
marks
and
impressions
on
the
ground
that
might
show
they
had
camped
there
then
they
Disapparated
to
the
outskirts
of
a
small
market
town
once
they
had
pitched
the
tent
in
the
shelter
of
a
small
copse
of
trees
and
surrounded
it
with
freshly
cast
defensive
enchantments
harry
ventured
out
under
the
Invisibility
Cloak
to
find
sustenance
this
however
did
not
go
as
planned
he
had
barely
entered
the
town
when
an
unnatural
chill
a
descending
mist
and
a
sudden
darkening
of
the
skies
made
him
freeze
where
he
stood
but
you
can
make
a
brilliant
Patronus
protested
Ron
when
Harry
arrived
back
at
the
tent
empty
handed
out
of
breath
and
mouthing
the
single
word
dementors
i
couldn't
make
one
he
panted
clutching
the
stitch
in
his
side
wouldn't
come
their
expressions
of
consternation
and
disappointment
made
Harry
feel
ashamed
it
had
been
a
nightmarish
experience
seeing
the
dementors
gliding
out
of
the
must
in
the
distance
and
realizing
as
the
paralyzing
cold
choked
his
lungs
and
a
distant
screaming
filled
his
ears
that
he
was
not
going
to
be
able
to
protect
himself
it
had
taken
all
harry's
willpower
to
uproot
himself
from
the
spot
and
run
leaving
the
eyeless
dementors
to
glide
amongst
the
Muggles
who
might
not
be
able
to
see
them
but
would
assuredly
feel
the
despair
they
cast
wherever
they
went
so
we
still
haven't
got
any
food
shut
up
Ron
snapped
Hermione
harry
what
happened
why
do
you
think
you
couldn't
make
your
Patronus
you
managed
perfectly
yesterday
i
don't
know
he
sat
low
in
one
of
perkins's
old
armchairs
feeling
more
humiliated
by
the
moment
he
was
afraid
that
something
had
gone
wrong
inside
him
yesterday
seemed
a
long
time
ago
Today
me
might
have
been
thirteen
years
old
again
the
only
one
who
collapsed
on
the
Hogwarts
Express
ron
kicked
a
chair
leg
what
he
snarled
at
Hermione
i'm
starving
all
i've
had
since
I
bled
half
to
death
is
a
couple
of
toadstools
you
go
and
fight
your
way
through
the
dementors
then
said
Harry
stung
i
would
but
my
arm's
in
a
sling
in
case
you
hadn't
noticed
that's
convenient
and
what's
that
supposed
to
of
course
cried
Hermione
clapping
a
hand
to
her
forehead
and
startling
both
of
them
into
silence
harry
give
me
the
locket
come
on
she
said
impatiently
clicking
her
fingers
at
him
when
he
did
not
react
to
Horcrux
Harry
you're
still
wearing
it
she
held
out
her
hands
and
Harry
lifted
the
golden
chain
over
his
head
the
moment
it
parted
contact
with
harry's
skin
he
free
and
oddly
light
he
had
not
even
realized
that
he
was
clammy
or
that
there
was
a
heavy
weight
pressing
on
his
stomach
until
both
sensations
lifted
better
asked
Hermione
yeah
loads
better
harry
she
said
crouching
down
in
front
of
him
and
using
the
kind
of
voice
he
associated
with
visiting
the
very
sick
you
don't
think
you've
been
possessed
do
you
what
no
he
said
defensively
I
remember
everything
we've
done
while
i've
bee
wearing
it
i
wouldn't
know
what
i'd
done
if
i'd
been
possessed
would
I
ginny
told
me
there
were
times
when
she
couldn't
remember
anything
hmm
said
Hermione
looking
down
at
the
heavy
locket
well
maybe
we
ought
not
to
wear
it
we
can
just
keep
it
in
the
tent
we
are
not
leaving
that
Horcrux
lying
around
Harry
stated
firmly
if
we
lose
it
if
it
gets
stolen
oh
all
right
all
right
said
Hermione
and
she
placed
it
around
her
own
neck
and
tucked
it
out
of
sight
down
the
front
of
her
shirt
but
we'll
take
turns
wearing
it
so
nobody
keeps
it
on
too
long
great
said
Ron
irritably
and
now
we've
sorted
that
out
can
we
please
get
some
food
fine
but
we'll
go
somewhere
else
to
find
it
said
Hermione
with
half
a
glance
at
Harry
there's
no
point
staying
where
we
know
dementors
are
swooping
around
in
the
end
they
settled
down
for
the
night
in
a
far
flung
field
belonging
to
a
lonely
farm
from
which
they
had
managed
to
obtain
eggs
and
bread
it's
not
stealing
is
it
asked
Hermione
in
a
troubled
voice
as
they
devoured
scrambled
eggs
on
toast
not
if
I
left
some
money
under
the
chicken
coo
ron
rolled
his
eyes
and
said
with
his
cheeks
bulging
er-my-nee
oo
worry
oo
much
elax
and
indeed
it
was
much
easier
to
relax
when
they
were
comfortably
well
fed
the
argument
about
the
dementors
was
forgotten
in
laughter
that
night
and
Harry
felt
cheerful
even
hopeful
as
he
took
the
first
of
the
three
night
watches
this
was
their
first
encounter
with
the
fact
that
a
full
stomach
meant
good
spirits
an
empty
one
bickering
and
gloom
harry
was
least
surprised
by
this
because
be
had
suffered
periods
of
near
starvation
at
the
Dursleys
hermione
bore
up
reasonably
well
on
those
nights
when
they
managed
to
scavenge
nothing
but
berries
or
stale
biscuits
her
temper
perhaps
a
little
shorter
than
usual
and
her
silences
dour
ron
however
had
always
been
used
to
three
delicious
meals
a
day
courtesy
of
his
mother
or
of
the
Hogwarts
house-elves
and
hunger
made
him
both
unreasonable
and
irascible
whenever
lack
of
food
coincided
with
ron's
turn
to
wear
the
Horcrux
he
became
downright
unpleasant
so
where
next
was
his
constant
refrain
he
did
not
seem
to
have
any
ideas
himself
but
expected
Harry
and
Hermione
to
come
up
with
plans
while
he
sat
and
brooded
over
the
low
food
supplies
accordingly
Harry
and
Hermione
spent
fruitless
hours
trying
to
decide
where
they
might
find
the
other
Horcruxes
and
how
to
destroy
the
one
they
already
got
their
conversations
becoming
increasingly
repetitive
as
they
got
no
new
information
as
Dumbledore
had
told
Harry
that
be
believed
Voldemort
had
hidden
the
Horcruxes
in
places
important
to
him
they
kept
reciting
in
a
sort
of
dreary
litany
those
locations
they
knew
that
Voldemort
had
lived
or
visited
the
orphanage
where
he
had
been
born
and
raised
Hogwarts
where
he
had
been
educated
Borgin
and
Burks
where
he
had
worked
after
completing
school
then
Albania
where
he
had
spent
his
years
of
exile
These
formed
the
basis
of
their
speculations
yeah
let's
go
to
Albania
shouldn't
take
more
than
an
afternoon
to
search
an
entire
country
said
Ron
sarcastically
there
can't
be
anything
there
he'd
already
made
five
of
his
Horcruxes
before
he
went
into
exile
and
Dumbledore
was
certain
the
snake
is
the
sixth
said
Hermione
we
know
the
snake's
not
in
Albania
it's
usually
with
Vol
didn't
I
ask
you
to
stop
say
that
fine
the
snake
is
usually
with
you-know-who-happy
not
particularly
i
can't
see
him
hiding
anything
at
Borgin
and
Burkes
said
Harry
who
had
made
this
point
many
times
before
but
said
it
again
simply
to
break
the
nasty
silence
borgin
and
Burke
were
experts
at
Dark
objects
they
would've
recognized
a
Horcrux
straightaway
ron
yawned
pointedly
repressing
a
strong
urge
to
throw
something
at
him
Harry
plowed
on
I
still
reckon
he
might
have
hidden
something
at
Hogwarts
hermione
sighed
but
Dumbledore
would
have
found
it
Harry
harry
repeated
the
argument
he
kept
bringing
out
in
favor
of
this
theory
dumbledore
said
in
front
of
me
that
he
never
assumed
he
knew
all
of
hogwart's
secrets
i'm
telling
you
if
there
was
one
place
Vol
oi
you-know-who
then
harry
shouted
goaded
past
endurance
if
there
was
one
place
that
was
really
important
to
You-Know-Who
it
was
Hogwarts
oh
come
on
scoffed
Ron
his
school
yeah
his
school
it
was
his
first
real
home
the
place
that
meant
he
was
special
it
meant
everything
to
him
and
even
after
he
left
this
is
You-Know-Who
we're
talking
about
right
not
you
inquired
Ron
he
was
tugging
at
the
chain
of
the
Horcrux
around
his
neck
Harry
was
visited
by
a
desire
to
seize
it
and
throttle
him
you
told
us
that
You-Know-Who
asked
Dumbledore
to
give
him
a
job
after
he
left
said
Hermione
that's
right
said
Harry
and
Dumbledore
thought
he
only
wanted
to
come
back
to
try
and
find
something
probably
another
founder's
object
to
make
into
another
Horcrux
yeah
said
Harry
but
he
didnt
get
the
job
did
he
said
Hermione
so
he
never
got
the
chance
to
find
a
founders
object
there
and
hide
it
in
the
school
okay
then
said
Harry
defeated
forget
Hogwarts
without
any
other
leads
they
traveled
into
London
and
hidden
beneath
the
Invisibility
Cloak
search
for
the
orphanage
in
which
Voldemort
had
been
raised
hermione
stole
into
a
library
and
discovered
from
their
records
that
the
place
had
been
demolished
many
years
before
they
visited
its
site
and
found
a
tower
block
of
offices
we
could
try
digging
in
to
foundations
hermione
suggested
halfheartedly
he
wouldnt
have
hidden
a
Horcrux
here
Harry
said
he
had
known
it
all
along
the
orphanage
had
been
the
place
Voldemort
had
been
determined
to
escape
he
would
never
have
hidden
a
part
of
his
soul
there
dumbledore
had
shown
Harry
that
Voldemort
sought
grandeur
or
mystique
in
his
hiding
places
this
dismal
gray
corner
of
London
was
as
far
removed
as
you
could
imagine
from
Hogwarts
of
the
Ministry
or
a
building
like
Gringotts
the
Wizarding
banks
with
its
gilded
doors
and
marble
floors
even
without
any
new
idea
they
continued
to
move
through
the
countryside
pitching
the
tent
in
a
different
place
each
night
for
security
every
morning
they
made
sure
that
they
had
removed
all
clues
to
their
presence
then
set
off
to
find
another
lonely
and
secluded
spot
traveling
by
Apparition
to
more
woods
to
the
shadowy
crevices
of
cliffs
to
purple
moors
gorse-covered
mountainsides
and
once
a
sheltered
and
pebbly
cove
every
twelve
hours
or
so
they
passed
the
Horcrux
between
them
as
though
they
were
playing
some
perverse
slow-motion
game
of
pass-the-parcel
where
they
dreaded
the
music
stopping
because
the
reward
was
twelve
hours
of
increased
fear
and
anxiety
harrys
scare
kept
prickling
it
happened
most
often
he
noticed
when
he
was
wearing
the
Horcrux
sometimes
he
could
not
stop
himself
reacting
to
the
pain
what
what
did
you
see
demanded
Ron
whenever
he
noticed
Harry
wince
a
face
muttered
Harry
every
time
the
same
face
the
thief
who
stole
from
Gregorovitch
and
Ron
would
turn
away
making
no
effort
to
hide
his
disappointment
harry
knew
that
Ron
was
hoping
to
bear
news
of
his
family
or
the
rest
of
the
Order
of
the
Phoenix
but
after
all
he
Harry
was
not
a
television
aerial
he
could
only
see
what
Voldemort
was
thinking
at
the
time
not
tune
in
to
whatever
took
his
fancy
apparently
Voldemort
was
dwelling
endlessly
on
the
unknown
youth
with
the
gleeful
face
whose
name
and
whereabouts
Harry
felt
sure
Voldemort
knew
no
better
than
he
did
as
Harrys
scar
continued
to
burn
and
the
merry
blond-haired
boy
swam
tantalizingly
in
his
memory
he
learned
to
suppress
any
sign
of
pain
or
discomfort
for
the
other
two
showed
nothing
but
impatience
at
the
mention
of
the
thief
he
could
not
entirely
blame
them
when
they
were
so
desperate
for
a
lean
on
the
Horcruxes
as
the
days
stretched
into
weeks
Harry
began
to
suspect
that
Ron
and
Hermione
were
having
conversations
without
and
about
him
several
times
they
stopped
talking
abruptly
when
Harry
entered
the
tent
and
twice
he
came
accidentally
upon
them
huddled
a
little
distance
away
heads
together
and
talking
fast
both
times
they
fell
silent
when
they
realized
he
was
approaching
them
and
hastened
to
appear
busy
collecting
wood
or
water
harry
could
not
help
wondering
whether
they
had
only
agreed
to
come
on
what
now
felt
like
a
pointless
and
rambling
journey
because
they
thought
he
had
some
secret
plan
that
they
would
learn
in
due
course
ton
was
making
no
effort
to
hide
his
bad
mood
and
Harry
was
starting
to
fear
that
Hermione
too
was
disappointed
by
his
poor
leadership
in
desperation
he
tried
to
think
of
further
Horcrux
locations
but
the
only
one
that
continued
to
occur
to
him
was
Hogwarts
and
as
neither
of
the
others
thought
this
at
all
likely
he
stopped
suggesting
it
autumn
rolled
over
the
countryside
as
they
moved
through
it
they
were
now
pitching
the
tent
on
mulches
of
fallen
leaves
natural
mists
joined
those
cast
by
the
dementors
wind
and
rain
added
to
their
troubles
the
fact
that
Hermione
was
getting
better
at
identifying
edible
fungi
could
not
altogether
compensate
for
their
continuing
isolation
the
lack
of
other
peoples
company
or
their
total
ignorance
of
what
was
going
on
in
the
war
against
Voldemort
my
mother
said
Ron
on
night
as
they
sat
in
the
tent
on
a
riverbank
in
Wales
can
make
good
food
appear
out
of
thin
air
he
prodded
moodily
at
the
lumps
of
charred
gray
fish
on
his
plate
harry
glanced
automatically
at
Rons
neck
and
saw
as
he
has
expected
the
golden
chain
of
the
Horcrux
glinting
there
he
managed
to
fight
down
the
impulse
to
swear
at
Ron
whose
attitude
would
he
knew
improve
slightly
when
the
time
came
to
take
off
the
locket
your
mother
cant
produce
food
out
of
thin
air
said
Hermione
no
one
can
food
is
the
first
of
the
five
Principal
Exceptions
to
Gamps
Law
of
Elemental
Transfigura
oh
speak
English
cant
you
ron
said
prising
a
fish
out
from
between
his
teeth
its
impossible
to
make
good
food
out
of
nothing
you
can
Summon
it
if
you
know
where
it
is
you
can
transform
it
you
can
increase
the
quantity
if
youve
already
got
some
well
dont
bother
increasing
this
its
disgusting
said
Ron
harry
caught
the
fish
and
I
did
my
best
with
it
i
notice
Im
always
the
one
who
ends
up
sorting
out
the
food
because
Im
a
girl
I
suppose
no
its
because
youre
supposed
to
be
the
best
at
magic
shot
back
Ron
hermione
jumped
up
and
bits
of
roast
pike
slid
off
her
tin
plate
onto
the
floor
you
can
do
the
cooking
tomorrow
Ron
you
can
find
the
ingredients
and
try
and
charm
them
into
something
worth
eating
and
Ill
sit
here
and
pull
faces
and
moan
and
you
can
see
you
shut
up
said
Harry
leaping
to
his
feet
and
holding
up
both
hands
shut
up
now
hermione
looked
outraged
how
can
you
side
with
him
he
hardly
ever
does
the
cook
hermione
be
quiet
I
can
hear
someone
he
was
listening
hard
his
hands
still
raised
warning
them
not
to
talk
then
over
the
rush
and
gush
of
the
dark
river
beside
them
he
heard
voices
again
he
looked
around
at
the
Sneakoscope
it
was
not
moving
you
cast
the
Muffliato
charm
over
us
right
he
whispered
to
Hermione
i
did
everything
she
whispered
back
Muffliato
Muggle-Repelling
and
Disillusionment
Charms
all
of
it
they
shouldnt
be
able
to
hear
of
see
us
whoever
they
are
heavy
scuffing
and
scraping
noises
plus
the
sound
of
dislodged
stones
and
twigs
told
them
that
several
people
were
clambering
down
the
steep
wooded
slope
that
descended
to
the
narrow
bank
where
they
had
pitched
the
tent
they
drew
their
wands
waiting
the
enchantments
they
had
cast
around
themselves
ought
to
be
sufficient
in
the
near
total
darkness
to
shield
them
from
the
notice
of
Muggles
and
normal
witches
and
wizards
if
these
were
Death
Eaters
then
perhaps
their
defenses
were
about
to
be
tested
by
Dark
Magic
for
the
first
time
the
voices
became
louder
but
no
more
intelligible
as
the
group
of
men
reached
the
bank
harry
estimated
that
their
owners
were
fewer
than
twenty
feet
away
but
the
cascading
river
made
it
impossible
to
tell
for
sure
hermione
snatched
up
the
beaded
bag
and
started
to
rummage
after
a
moment
she
drew
out
three
Extendible
Ears
and
threw
one
each
to
Harry
and
Ron
who
hastily
inserted
the
ends
of
the
flesh-colored
strings
into
their
ears
and
fed
the
other
ends
out
of
the
tent
entrance
within
seconds
Harry
heard
a
weary
male
voice
there
ought
to
be
a
few
salmon
in
here
or
dyou
reckon
its
too
early
in
the
season
accio
Salmon
there
were
several
distinct
splashes
and
then
the
slapping
sounds
of
fish
against
flesh
somebody
grunted
appreciatively
harry
pressed
the
Extendable
ear
deeper
into
his
own
Over
the
murmur
of
the
river
he
could
make
out
more
voices
but
they
were
not
speaking
English
or
any
human
language
he
had
ever
heard
it
was
a
rough
and
unmelodious
tongue
a
string
of
rattling
guttural
noises
and
there
seemed
to
be
two
speakers
one
with
a
slightly
lower
slower
voice
than
the
other
a
fire
danced
into
life
on
the
other
side
of
the
canvas
large
shadows
passed
between
tent
and
flames
the
delicious
smell
of
baking
salmon
wafted
tantalizingly
in
their
direction
then
came
the
clinking
of
cutlery
on
plates
and
the
first
man
spoke
again
here
Griphook
Gornuk
goblins
hermione
mouthed
at
Harry
who
nodded
thank
you
said
the
goblins
together
in
English
so
you
three
have
been
on
the
run
how
long
asked
a
new
mellow
and
pleasant
voice
it
was
vaguely
familiar
to
Harry
who
pictured
a
round-bellied
cheerful-faced
man
six
weeks
seven
i
forget
said
the
tired
man
met
up
with
Griphook
in
the
first
couple
of
days
and
joined
forces
with
Gornuk
not
long
after
nice
to
have
a
but
of
company
there
was
a
pause
while
knives
scraped
plates
and
tin
mugs
were
picked
up
and
replaced
on
the
ground
what
made
you
leave
Ted
continued
the
man
knew
they
were
coming
for
me
replied
mellow-voiced
Ted
and
Harry
suddenly
knew
who
he
was
Tonkss
father
heard
Death
Eaters
were
in
the
area
last
week
and
decided
Id
better
run
for
it
refused
to
register
as
a
muggle-born
on
principle
see
so
I
knew
it
was
a
matter
of
time
knew
Id
have
to
leave
in
the
end
my
wife
should
be
okay
shes
pure-blood
and
then
I
net
Dean
here
what
a
few
days
ago
son
yeah
said
another
voice
and
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
stared
at
each
other
silent
but
besides
themselves
with
excitement
sure
they
recognized
the
voice
of
Dean
Thomas
their
fellow
Gryffindor
muggle-born
eh
asked
the
first
man
not
sure
said
Dean
my
dad
left
my
mum
when
I
was
a
kid
ive
got
no
proof
he
was
a
wizard
though
there
was
silence
for
a
while
except
for
the
sounds
of
munching
then
Ted
spoke
again
ive
got
to
say
Dirk
Im
surprised
to
run
into
you
pleased
but
surprised
word
was
that
youd
been
caught
i
was
said
Dirk
i
was
halfway
to
Azkaban
when
I
made
a
break
for
it
stunned
Dawlish
and
nicked
his
broom
it
was
easier
than
youd
think
I
dont
reckon
hes
quite
right
at
the
moment
might
be
Confunded
if
so
Id
like
to
shake
the
hand
of
the
witch
or
wizard
who
did
it
probably
saved
my
life
there
was
another
pause
in
which
the
fire
crackled
and
the
river
rushed
on
the
Ted
said
And
where
do
you
two
fit
in
i
er
had
the
impression
the
goblins
were
for
You-Know-Who
on
the
whole
you
had
a
false
impression
said
the
higher-voiced
of
the
goblins
we
take
no
sides
this
is
a
wizards
war
how
come
youre
in
hiding
then
i
deemed
in
prudent
said
the
deeper-voiced
goblin
having
refused
what
I
considered
an
impertinent
request
I
could
see
that
my
person
safety
was
in
jeopardy
what
did
they
ask
you
to
do
asked
Ted
duties
ill-befitting
the
dignity
of
my
race
replied
the
goblin
his
voice
rougher
and
less
human
as
he
said
it
i
am
not
a
house-elf
what
about
you
Griphook
similar
reasons
said
the
higher
voiced
goblin
gringotts
is
no
longer
under
the
sole
control
of
my
race
i
recognize
no
Wizarding
master
he
added
something
under
his
breath
in
Gobbledegook
and
Gornuk
laughed
whats
the
joke
asked
Dean
he
said
replied
Dirk
that
there
are
things
wizards
dont
recognize
either
there
was
a
short
pause
i
dont
get
it
said
Dean
i
had
my
small
revenge
before
I
left
said
Griphook
in
English
good
man-goblin
I
should
say
amended
Ted
hastily
didnt
manage
to
lock
a
Death
Eater
up
in
one
of
the
old
high-security
vaults
I
suppose
if
I
had
the
sword
would
not
have
helped
him
break
out
replied
Griphook
gornuk
laughed
again
and
even
Dirk
gave
a
dry
chuckle
dean
and
I
are
still
missing
something
here
said
Ted
so
is
Severus
Snape
though
he
does
not
know
it
said
Griphook
and
the
two
goblins
roared
with
malicious
laughter
inside
the
tent
Harrys
breathing
was
shallow
with
excitement
He
and
Hermione
stared
at
each
other
listening
as
hard
as
they
could
didnt
you
hear
about
that
Ted
asked
Dirk
about
the
kids
who
tried
to
steal
Gryffindors
sword
out
of
Snapes
office
at
Hogwarts
an
electric
current
seemed
to
course
through
Harry
jangling
his
every
nerve
as
he
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
never
heard
a
word
said
Ted
Not
in
the
Prophet
was
it
hardly
chortled
Dirk
griphook
here
told
me
he
heard
about
it
from
Bill
Weasley
who
works
for
the
bank
one
of
the
kids
who
tried
to
take
the
sword
was
Bills
younger
sister
harry
glanced
toward
Hermione
and
Ron
both
of
whom
were
clutching
the
Extendable
Ears
as
tightly
as
lifelines
she
and
a
couple
of
friends
got
into
Snapes
office
and
smashed
open
the
glass
case
where
he
was
apparently
keeping
the
sword
snape
caught
them
as
they
were
trying
to
smuggle
it
down
the
staircase
ah
God
bless
em
said
Ted
what
did
they
think
that
theyd
be
able
to
use
the
sword
on
You-Know-Who
or
on
Snape
himself
well
whatever
they
thought
they
were
going
to
do
with
it
Snape
decided
the
sword
wasnt
safe
where
it
was
said
Dirk
couple
of
days
later
once
hed
got
the
say-so
from
You-Know-Who
I
imagine
he
sent
it
down
to
London
to
be
kept
in
Gringotts
instead
the
goblins
started
to
laugh
again
im
still
not
seeing
the
joke
said
Ted
its
a
fake
rasped
Griphook
the
sword
of
Gryffindor
oh
yes
it
is
a
copy-en
excellent
copy
it
is
true-but
it
was
wizard-made
the
original
was
forged
centuries
ago
by
goblins
and
had
certain
properties
only
goblin-made
armor
possesses
wherever
the
genuine
sword
of
Gryffindor
is
it
is
not
in
a
vault
at
Gringotts
bank
i
see
said
Ted
and
I
take
it
you
didnt
bother
telling
the
Death
Eaters
this
i
saw
no
reason
to
trouble
them
with
the
information
said
Griphook
smugly
and
now
Ted
and
Dean
joined
in
Gornuk
and
Dirks
laughter
inside
the
tent
Harry
closed
his
eyes
willing
someone
to
ask
the
question
he
needed
answered
and
after
a
minute
that
seemed
ten
Dean
obliged
he
was
Harry
remembered
with
a
jolt
an
ex-boyfriend
of
Ginnys
too
what
happened
to
Ginny
and
all
the
others
the
ones
who
tried
to
steal
it
oh
they
were
punished
and
cruelly
said
Griphook
indifferently
theyre
okay
though
asked
Ted
quickly
I
mean
the
Weasleys
dont
need
any
more
of
their
kids
injured
do
they
they
suffered
no
serious
injury
as
far
as
I
am
aware
said
Griphook
lucky
for
them
said
Ted
with
Snapes
track
record
I
suppose
we
should
just
be
glad
theyre
still
alive
you
believe
that
story
then
do
you
Ted
asked
Dirk
you
believe
Snape
killed
Dumbledore
course
I
do
said
Ted
youre
not
going
to
sit
there
and
tell
me
you
think
Potter
had
anything
to
do
with
it
hard
to
know
what
to
believe
these
days
muttered
Dirk
i
know
Harry
Potter
said
Dean
and
I
reckon
hes
the
real
thing-the
Chosen
One
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
yeah
theres
a
lot
would
like
to
believe
hes
that
son
said
Dirk
me
included
but
where
is
he
run
for
it
by
the
looks
of
things
youd
think
if
he
knew
anything
we
dont
or
had
anything
special
going
for
him
hed
be
out
there
now
fighting
rallying
resistance
instead
of
hiding
and
you
know
the
Prophet
made
a
pretty
good
case
against
him
the
Prophet
scoffed
Ted
you
deserve
to
be
lied
to
if
youre
still
reading
that
much
Dirk
you
want
the
facts
try
the
Quibbler
there
was
a
sudden
explosion
of
choking
and
retching
plus
a
good
deal
of
thumping
by
the
sound
of
it
dirk
had
swallowed
a
fish
bone
at
last
he
sputtered
The
Quibbler
that
lunatic
rag
of
Xeno
Lovegoods
its
not
so
lunatic
these
days
said
Ted
you
want
to
give
it
a
look
Xeno
is
printing
all
the
stuff
the
Prophets
ignoring
not
a
single
mention
of
Crumple-Horned
Snorkacks
in
the
last
issue
how
long
theyll
let
him
get
with
it
mind
I
dont
know
but
Xeno
says
front
page
of
every
issue
that
any
wizard
whos
against
You-Know-Who
ought
to
make
helping
Harry
Potter
their
number-one
priority
hard
to
help
a
boy
whos
vanished
off
the
face
of
the
earth
said
Dirk
listen
the
fact
that
they
havent
caught
him
yets
one
hell
of
an
achievement
said
Ted
id
take
tips
from
him
gladly
its
what
were
trying
to
do
stay
free
isnt
it
yeah
well
youve
got
a
point
there
said
Dirk
heavily
with
the
whole
of
the
Ministry
and
all
their
informers
looking
for
him
Id
have
expected
him
to
be
caught
by
now
mind
whos
to
say
they
havent
already
caught
and
killed
him
without
publicizing
it
ah
dont
say
that
Dirk
murmured
Ted
there
was
a
long
pause
filled
with
more
clattering
of
knives
and
forks
when
they
spoke
again
it
was
to
discuss
whether
they
ought
to
sleep
on
the
back
or
retreat
back
up
the
wooded
slope
deciding
the
trees
would
give
better
cover
they
extinguished
their
fire
then
clambered
back
up
the
incline
their
voices
fading
away
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
reeled
in
the
Extendable
Ears
harry
who
had
found
the
need
to
remain
silent
increasingly
difficult
the
longer
they
eavesdropped
now
found
himself
unable
to
say
more
then
ginny-the
sword
i
know
said
Hermione
she
lunged
for
the
tiny
beaded
bag
this
time
sinking
her
arm
in
it
right
up
to
the
armpit
here
we
are
she
said
between
gritted
teeth
and
she
pulled
at
something
that
was
evidently
in
the
depths
of
the
bag
slowly
the
edge
of
an
ornate
picture
frame
came
into
sight
harry
hurried
to
help
her
as
they
lifted
the
empty
portrait
of
Phineas
Nigellus
free
of
Hermiones
bag
she
kept
her
wand
pointing
at
it
ready
to
cast
a
spell
at
any
moment
if
somebody
swapped
the
real
sword
for
the
face
while
it
was
in
Dumbledores
office
she
panted
as
they
propped
the
painting
against
the
side
of
the
tent
Phineas
Nigellus
would
have
seen
it
happen
he
hangs
right
beside
the
case
unless
he
was
asleep
said
Harry
but
he
still
held
his
breath
as
Hermione
knelt
down
in
front
of
the
empty
canvas
her
wand
directed
at
its
center
cleared
her
throat
then
said
er-Phineas
phineas
Nigellus
nothing
happened
phineas
Nigellus
said
Hermione
again
professor
Black
please
could
we
talk
to
you
please
Please
always
helps
said
a
cold
snide
voice
and
Phineas
Nigellus
slid
into
his
portrait
at
one
Hermione
cried
obscura
a
black
blindfold
appeared
over
Phineas
Nigelluss
clever
dark
eyes
causing
him
to
bump
into
the
frame
and
shriek
with
pain
what-how
dare-what
are
you
im
very
sorry
Professor
Black
said
Hermione
but
its
a
necessary
precaution
remove
this
foul
addition
at
once
remove
it
I
say
you
are
ruining
a
great
work
of
art
where
am
I
what
is
going
on
never
mind
where
we
are
said
Harry
and
Phineas
Nigellus
froze
abandoning
his
attempts
to
peel
off
the
painted
blindfold
can
that
possible
be
the
voice
of
the
elusive
mr.
Potter
maybe
said
Harry
knowing
that
this
would
keep
Phineas
Nigelluss
interest
weve
got
a
couple
of
questions
to
ask
you-about
the
sword
of
Gryffindor
ah
said
Phineas
Nigellus
now
turning
his
head
this
way
and
that
in
an
effort
to
catch
sight
of
Harry
yes
that
silly
girl
acted
most
unwisely
there
shut
up
about
my
sister
said
Ron
roughly
Phineas
Nigellus
raised
supercilious
eyebrows
who
else
is
here
he
asked
turning
his
head
from
side
to
side
your
tone
displeases
me
the
girl
and
her
friends
were
foolhardily
in
the
extreme
thieving
from
the
headmaster
they
werent
thieving
said
Harry
that
sword
isnt
Snapes
it
belongs
to
Professor
Snapes
school
said
Phineas
Nigellus
exactly
what
claim
did
the
Weasley
girl
have
upon
it
she
deserved
her
punishment
as
did
the
idiot
Longbottom
and
the
Lovegood
oddity
neville
is
not
an
idiot
and
Luna
is
not
an
oddity
said
Hermione
where
am
I
repeated
Phineas
Nigellus
starting
to
wrestle
with
the
blindfold
again
where
have
you
brought
me
why
have
you
removed
me
from
the
house
of
my
forebears
never
mind
that
how
did
Snape
punish
Ginny
Neville
and
Luna
asked
Harry
urgently
professor
Snape
sent
them
into
the
Forbidden
Forest
to
do
some
work
for
the
oaf
Hagrid
hagrids
not
an
oaf
said
Hermione
shrilly
and
Snape
mightve
though
that
was
a
punishment
said
Harry
buy
Ginny
Neville
and
Luna
probably
had
a
good
laugh
with
Hagrid
the
Forbidden
Forest
theyve
faced
plenty
worse
than
the
Forbidden
Forest
big
deal
he
felt
relieved
he
had
been
imagining
horrors
the
Cruciatus
Curse
at
the
very
least
what
we
really
wanted
to
know
Professor
Black
is
whether
anyone
else
has
um
taken
out
the
sword
at
all
maybe
its
been
taken
away
for
cleaning-or
something
phineas
Nigellus
paused
again
in
his
struggles
to
free
his
eyes
and
sniggered
muggle-born
he
said
goblin-made
armor
does
not
require
cleaning
simple
girl
goblins
silver
repels
mundane
dirt
imbibing
only
that
which
strengthens
it
dont
call
Hermione
simple
said
Harry
i
grow
weary
of
contradiction
said
Phineas
Nigellus
perhaps
it
is
time
for
me
to
return
to
the
headmasters
office
still
blindfolded
he
began
groping
the
side
of
his
frame
trying
to
feel
his
way
out
of
his
picture
and
back
into
the
one
at
Hogwarts
harry
had
a
sudden
inspiration
dumbledore
cant
you
bring
us
Dumbledore
i
beg
your
pardon
asked
Phineas
Nigellus
professor
Dumbledores
portrait-couldnt
you
bring
him
along
here
into
yours
phineas
Nigellus
turned
his
face
in
the
direction
of
Harrys
voice
evidently
it
is
not
only
muggle-borns
who
are
ignorant
Potter
the
portraits
of
Hogwarts
may
commune
with
each
other
but
they
cannot
travel
outside
of
the
castle
except
to
visit
a
painting
of
themselves
elsewhere
dumbledore
cannot
come
here
with
me
and
after
the
treatment
I
have
received
at
your
hands
I
can
assure
you
that
I
will
not
be
making
a
return
visit
slightly
crestfallen
Harry
watched
Phineas
redouble
his
attempts
to
leave
his
frame
professor
Black
said
Hermione
couldnt
you
just
tell
us
please
when
was
the
last
time
the
sword
was
taken
out
of
its
case
before
Ginny
took
it
out
I
mean
phineas
snorted
impatiently
i
believe
that
the
last
time
I
saw
the
sword
of
Gryffindor
leave
its
case
was
when
Professor
Dumbledore
used
it
to
break
open
a
ring
hermione
whipped
around
to
look
at
Harry
neither
of
them
dared
say
more
in
front
of
Phineas
Nigellus
who
had
at
least
managed
to
locate
the
exit
well
good
night
to
you
he
said
a
little
waspishly
and
he
began
to
move
out
of
sight
again
only
the
edge
of
his
hat
brim
remained
in
view
when
Harry
gave
a
sudden
shout
wait
have
you
told
Snape
you
saw
this
phineas
Nigellus
stuck
his
blindfolded
head
back
into
the
picture
professor
Snape
has
more
important
things
on
his
mind
that
the
many
eccentricities
of
Albus
Dumbledore
good-bye
Potter
and
with
that
he
vanished
completely
leaving
behind
him
nothing
but
his
murky
backdrop
harry
hermione
cried
i
know
harry
shouted
unable
to
contain
himself
he
punched
the
air
it
was
more
than
he
had
dared
to
hope
for
he
strode
up
and
down
the
tent
feeling
that
he
could
have
run
a
mile
he
did
not
even
feel
hungry
anymore
hermione
was
squashing
Phineas
Nigelluss
back
into
the
beaded
bag
when
she
had
fastened
the
clasp
she
threw
the
bag
aside
and
raised
a
shining
face
to
Harry
the
sword
can
destroy
Horcruxes
goblin-made
blades
imbibe
only
that
which
strengthens
them-Harry
that
swords
impregnated
with
basilisk
venom
and
Dumbledore
didnt
five
it
to
me
because
he
still
needed
it
he
wanted
to
use
it
on
the
locket
and
he
must
have
realized
they
wouldnt
let
you
have
it
if
he
put
it
in
his
will
so
he
made
a
copy
and
put
a
fake
in
the
glass
case
and
he
left
the
real
one-where
they
gazed
at
east
other
Harry
felt
that
the
answer
was
dangling
invisibly
in
the
air
above
them
tantalizingly
close
why
hadnt
Dumbledore
told
him
or
had
he
in
fact
told
Harry
but
Harry
had
not
realized
it
at
the
time
think
whispered
Hermione
think
where
would
he
have
left
it
not
at
Hogwarts
said
Harry
resuming
his
pacing
somewhere
in
Hogsmeade
suggested
Hermione
the
Shrieking
Shack
said
Harry
nobody
ever
goes
in
there
but
Snape
knows
how
to
get
in
wouldnt
that
be
a
bit
risky
dumbledore
trusted
Snape
Harry
reminded
her
not
enough
to
tell
him
that
he
had
swapped
the
swords
said
Hermione
yeah
youre
right
said
Harry
and
he
felt
even
more
cheered
at
the
thought
that
Dumbledore
had
had
some
reservations
however
faint
about
Snapes
trustworthiness
so
would
he
have
hidden
the
sword
well
away
from
Hogsmeade
then
what
dyou
reckon
Ron
ron
harry
looked
around
for
one
bewildered
moment
he
thought
that
Ron
had
left
the
tent
then
realized
that
Ron
was
lying
in
the
shadow
of
a
bunk
looking
stony
oh
remembered
me
have
you
he
said
what
ron
snorted
as
he
stared
up
at
the
underside
of
the
upper
bunk
you
two
carry
on
dont
let
me
spoil
your
fun
perplexed
Harry
looked
to
Hermione
for
help
but
she
shook
her
head
apparently
as
nonplussed
as
he
was
whats
the
problem
asked
Harry
problem
theres
no
problem
said
Ron
still
refusing
to
look
at
Harry
not
according
to
you
anyways
there
were
several
plunks
on
the
canvas
over
their
heads
it
had
started
to
rain
well
youve
obviously
got
a
problem
said
Harry
spit
it
out
will
you
ron
swung
his
long
legs
off
the
bed
and
sat
up
he
looked
mean
unlike
himself
all
right
Ill
spit
it
out
dont
expect
me
to
skip
up
and
down
the
tent
because
theres
some
other
damn
thing
weve
got
to
find
just
add
it
to
the
list
of
stuff
you
dont
know
i
dont
know
repeated
Harry
i
dont
know
plunk
plunk
plunk
the
rain
was
falling
harder
and
heavier
it
pattered
on
the
leaf-strewn
bank
all
around
them
and
into
the
river
chattering
through
the
dark
dread
doused
Harrys
jubilation
Ron
was
saying
exactly
what
he
had
suspected
and
feared
him
to
be
thinking
its
not
like
Im
not
having
the
time
of
my
life
here
said
Ron
you
know
with
my
arm
mangled
and
nothing
to
eat
and
freezing
my
backside
off
every
night
i
just
hoped
you
know
after
wed
been
running
round
a
few
weeks
wed
have
achieved
something
ron
Hermione
said
but
in
such
a
quiet
voice
that
Ron
could
pretend
not
to
have
heard
it
over
the
loud
tattoo
the
rain
was
beating
on
the
tent
i
thought
you
knew
what
youd
signed
up
for
said
Harry
yeah
I
thought
I
did
too
so
what
part
of
it
isnt
living
up
to
your
expectations
asked
Harry
anger
was
coming
to
his
defense
now
did
you
think
wed
be
staying
in
five-star
hotels
finding
a
Horcrux
every
other
day
did
you
think
youd
be
back
to
Mummy
by
Christmas
we
thought
you
knew
what
you
were
doing
shouted
Ron
standing
up
and
his
words
Harry
like
scalding
knives
we
thought
Dumbledore
had
told
you
what
to
do
we
thought
you
had
a
real
plan
ron
said
Hermione
this
time
clearly
audible
over
the
rain
thundering
on
the
tent
roof
but
again
he
ignored
her
well
sorry
to
let
you
down
said
Harry
his
voice
quite
calm
even
though
he
felt
hollow
inadequate
ive
been
straight
with
you
from
the
start
i
told
you
everything
Dumbledore
told
me
and
in
the
case
you
havent
noticed
weve
found
one
Horcrux
yeah
and
were
about
as
near
getting
rid
of
it
as
we
are
to
finding
the
rest
of
them-nowhere
effing
near
in
other
words
take
off
the
locket
Ron
Hermione
said
her
voice
unusually
high
please
take
it
off
you
wouldnt
be
talking
like
this
if
you
hadnt
been
wearing
it
all
day
yeah
he
would
said
Harry
who
did
not
want
excuses
made
for
Ron
dyou
think
I
havent
noticed
the
two
of
you
whispering
behind
my
back
dyou
think
I
didnt
guess
you
were
thinking
this
stuff
harry
we
werent
dont
lie
ron
hurled
at
her
you
said
it
too
you
said
you
were
disappointed
you
said
youd
thought
he
had
a
bit
more
to
go
on
than
i
didnt
say
it
like
that-Harry
I
didnt
she
cried
the
rain
was
pounding
the
tent
tears
were
pouring
down
Hermiones
face
and
the
excitement
of
a
few
minutes
before
had
vanished
as
if
it
had
never
been
a
short-lived
firework
that
had
flared
and
died
leaving
everything
dark
wet
and
cold
the
sword
of
Gryffindor
was
hidden
they
knew
not
where
and
their
were
three
teenagers
in
a
tent
whose
only
achievement
was
not
yet
to
be
dead
so
why
are
you
still
here
harry
asked
Ron
search
me
said
Ron
go
home
then
said
Harry
yeah
maybe
I
will
shouted
Ron
and
he
took
several
steps
toward
Harry
who
did
not
back
away
didnt
you
hear
what
they
said
about
my
sister
but
you
dont
give
a
rats
fart
do
you
its
only
the
Forbidden
Forest
Harry
Ive-Faced-Worse
Potter
doesnt
care
what
happened
to
her
in
there-well
I
do
all
right
giant
spiders
and
mental
stuff
i
was
only
saying-she
was
with
the
others
they
were
with
Hagrid
yeah
I
get
it
you
dont
care
and
what
about
the
rest
of
my
family
the
Weasleys
dont
need
another
kid
injured
did
you
hear
that
Yeah
I
not
bothered
what
it
meant
though
ron
said
Hermione
forcing
her
way
between
them
i
dont
think
it
means
anything
new
has
happened
anything
we
dont
know
about
think
Ron
Bills
already
scared
plenty
of
people
must
have
seen
that
George
has
lost
an
ear
by
now
and
youre
supposed
to
be
on
your
deathbed
with
spattergroit
Im
sure
thats
all
he
meant
oh
youre
sure
are
you
right
then
well
I
wont
bother
myself
about
them
its
all
right
for
you
isnt
it
with
your
parents
safely
out
of
the
way
my
parents
are
dead
harry
bellowed
and
mine
could
be
going
the
same
way
yelled
Ron
then
go
roared
Harry
go
back
to
them
pretend
youre
got
over
your
spattergroit
and
Mummyll
be
able
to
feed
you
up
and
ron
made
a
sudden
movement
Harry
reacted
but
before
either
wand
was
clear
of
its
owners
pocket
Hermione
had
raised
her
own
prestego
she
cried
and
an
invisible
shield
expanded
between
her
and
Harry
on
the
one
side
and
Ron
on
the
other
all
of
them
were
forced
backward
a
few
steps
by
the
strength
of
the
spell
and
Harry
and
Ron
glared
from
either
side
of
the
transparent
barrier
as
though
they
were
seeing
each
other
clearly
for
the
first
time
harry
felt
a
corrosive
hatred
toward
Ron
Something
had
broken
between
them
leave
the
Horcrux
Harry
said
ron
wrenched
the
chain
from
over
his
head
and
cast
the
locket
into
a
nearby
chair
he
turned
to
Hermione
what
are
you
doing
what
do
you
mean
are
you
staying
or
what
she
looked
anguished
yes-yes
Im
staying
ron
we
said
wed
go
with
Harry
we
said
wed
help
i
get
it
you
choose
him
ron
no-please-come
back
come
back
she
was
impeded
by
her
own
Shield
Charm
by
the
time
she
had
removed
it
he
had
already
stormed
into
the
night
harry
stood
quite
still
and
silent
listening
to
her
sobbing
and
calling
Rons
name
amongst
the
trees
after
a
few
minutes
she
returned
her
sopping
hair
plastered
to
her
face
hes
g-g-gone
disapparated
she
threw
herself
into
a
chair
curled
up
and
started
to
cry
harry
felt
dazed
he
stooped
picked
up
the
Horcrux
and
placed
it
around
his
own
neck
he
dragged
blankets
off
Rons
bunk
and
threw
them
over
Hermione
then
he
climbed
onto
his
own
bed
and
stared
up
at
the
dark
canvas
roof
listening
to
the
pounding
of
the
rain
chapter
Sixteen
godrics
Hollow
when
Harry
woke
the
following
day
it
was
several
seconds
before
he
remembered
what
had
happened
then
he
hoped
childishly
that
it
had
been
a
dream
that
Ron
was
still
there
and
had
never
left
yet
by
turning
his
head
on
his
pillow
he
could
see
ron's
deserted
bunk
it
was
like
a
dead
body
in
the
way
it
seems
to
draw
his
eyes
harry
jumped
down
from
his
own
bed
keeping
his
eyes
averted
from
ron's
hermione
who
was
already
busy
in
the
kitchen
did
not
wish
Harry
good
morning
but
turned
her
face
away
quickly
as
he
went
by
he's
gone
Harry
told
himself
he's
gone
he
had
to
keep
thinking
it
as
he
washed
and
dressed
as
though
repetition
would
dull
the
shock
of
it
he's
gone
and
he's
not
coming
back
and
that
was
the
simple
truth
of
it
Harry
knew
because
their
protective
enchantments
meant
that
it
would
be
impossible
once
they
vacated
this
spot
for
Ron
to
find
them
again
he
and
Hermione
ate
breakfast
in
silence
hermione's
eyes
were
puffy
and
red
she
looked
as
if
she
had
not
slept
they
packed
up
their
things
Hermione
dawdling
harry
knew
why
she
wanted
to
spin
out
their
time
on
the
riverbank
several
times
he
saw
her
look
up
eagerly
and
he
was
sure
she
had
deluded
herself
into
thinking
that
she
heard
footsteps
through
the
heavy
rain
but
no
red-haired
figure
appeared
between
the
trees
every
time
Harry
imitated
her
looked
around
for
he
could
not
help
hoping
a
little
himself
and
saw
nothing
but
rain-swept
woods
another
little
parcel
of
fury
exploded
inside
him
he
could
hear
Ron
saying
We
thought
you
knew
what
you
were
doing
and
he
resumed
packing
with
a
hard
knot
in
the
pit
of
his
stomach
the
muddy
river
beside
them
was
rising
rapidly
and
would
soon
spill
over
onto
their
bank
they
had
lingered
a
good
hour
after
they
would
usually
have
departed
their
campsite
finally
having
entirely
repacked
the
beaded
bag
three
times
Hermione
seemed
unable
to
find
any
more
reasons
to
delay
She
and
Harry
gasped
hands
and
Disapparated
reappearing
on
a
windswept
heather-covered
hillside
the
instant
they
arrived
Hermione
dropped
harry's
hand
and
walked
away
from
him
finally
sitting
down
on
a
large
rock
her
face
on
her
knees
shaking
with
what
he
knew
were
sobs
he
watched
her
supposing
that
he
ought
to
go
and
comfort
her
but
something
kept
him
rooted
to
the
spot
everything
inside
him
felt
cold
and
tight
Again
he
saw
the
contemptuous
expression
on
ron's
face
harry
strode
off
through
the
heather
walking
in
a
large
circle
with
the
distraught
Hermione
at
its
center
casting
the
spell
she
usually
performed
to
ensure
their
protection
they
did
not
discuss
Ron
at
all
over
the
next
few
days
harry
was
determined
never
to
mention
his
name
again
and
Hermione
seemed
to
know
that
it
was
no
use
forcing
the
issue
although
sometimes
at
night
when
she
thought
he
was
sleeping
he
would
hear
her
crying
meanwhile
Harry
had
started
bringing
out
the
marauder's
map
and
examining
it
by
wandlight
he
was
waiting
for
the
moment
when
ron's
labeled
dot
would
reappear
in
the
corridors
of
Hogwarts
proving
that
he
had
returned
to
the
comfortable
castle
protected
by
his
status
of
pureblood
however
Ron
did
not
appear
on
the
map
and
after
a
while
Harry
found
himself
taking
it
out
simply
to
stare
at
ginny's
name
in
the
girl's
dormitory
wondering
whether
the
intensity
with
which
he
gazed
at
it
might
break
into
her
sleep
that
she
would
somehow
know
he
was
thinking
about
her
hoping
that
she
was
all
right
by
day
hey
devoted
themselves
to
trying
to
determine
the
possible
locations
of
gryffindor's
sword
but
the
more
they
talked
about
the
places
in
which
Dumbledore
might
have
hidden
it
the
more
desperate
and
far-fetched
their
speculation
became
cudgel
his
brains
though
he
might
Harry
could
not
remember
Dumbledore
ever
mentioning
a
place
in
which
he
might
hide
something
there
were
moments
when
he
did
not
know
whether
he
was
angrier
with
Ron
or
with
Dumbledore
we
thought
you
knew
what
you
were
doing
we
thought
Dumbledore
had
told
you
what
to
do
we
thought
you
had
a
real
plan
he
could
not
hide
it
from
himself
Ron
had
been
right
dumbledore
had
left
him
with
virtually
nothing
they
had
discovered
one
Horcrux
but
they
had
no
means
of
destroying
it
The
others
were
as
unattainable
as
they
had
ever
been
hopelessness
threatened
to
engulf
him
he
was
staggered
now
to
think
of
his
own
presumption
in
accepting
his
friends
offers
to
accompany
him
on
this
meandering
pointless
journey
he
knew
nothing
he
had
no
ideas
and
he
was
constantly
painfully
on
the
alert
for
any
indications
that
Hermione
too
was
about
to
tell
him
that
she
had
had
enough
that
she
was
leaving
they
were
spending
many
evenings
in
near
silence
and
Hermione
took
to
bringing
out
Phineas
nigellus's
portrait
and
propping
it
up
in
a
chair
as
though
he
might
fill
part
of
the
gaping
hole
left
by
ron's
departure
despite
his
previous
assertion
that
he
would
never
visit
them
again
Phineas
Nigellus
did
not
seem
able
to
resist
the
chance
to
find
out
more
about
what
Harry
was
up
to
and
consented
to
reappear
blindfolded
every
few
days
of
so
harry
was
even
glad
to
see
him
because
he
was
company
albeit
of
a
snide
and
taunting
kind
they
relished
any
news
about
what
was
happening
at
Hogwarts
though
Phineas
Nigellus
was
not
an
ideal
informer
he
venerated
Snape
the
first
Slytherin
headmaster
since
he
himself
had
controlled
the
school
and
they
had
to
be
careful
not
to
criticize
or
ask
impertinent
questions
about
Snape
or
Phineas
Nigellus
would
instantly
leave
his
painting
however
he
did
let
drop
certain
snippets
snape
seemed
to
be
facing
a
constant
low
level
of
mutiny
from
a
hard
core
of
students
ginny
had
been
banned
from
going
into
Hogsmeade
snape
had
reinstated
umbridge's
old
decree
forbidding
gatherings
of
three
or
more
students
or
any
unofficial
student
societies
from
all
of
these
things
Harry
deduced
that
Ginny
and
probably
Neville
and
Luna
along
with
her
had
been
doing
their
best
to
continue
dumbledore's
Army
this
scant
news
made
Harry
want
to
see
Ginny
so
badly
it
felt
like
a
stomachache
but
it
also
made
him
think
of
Ron
again
and
of
Dumbledore
and
of
Hogwarts
itself
which
he
missed
nearly
as
much
as
his
ex-girlfriend
indeed
as
Phineas
Niggellus
talked
about
snape's
crackdown
Harry
experienced
a
split
second
of
madness
when
he
imagined
simply
going
back
to
school
to
join
the
destabilization
of
Snapes
regime
Being
fed
and
having
a
soft
bad
and
other
people
being
in
charge
seemed
the
most
wonderful
prospect
in
the
world
at
this
moment
but
then
he
remembered
that
he
was
Undesirable
Number
One
that
there
was
a
ten-thousand
Galleon
price
on
his
head
and
that
to
walk
into
Hogwarts
these
days
was
just
as
dangerous
as
walking
into
the
Ministry
of
Magic
indeed
Phineas
Nigellus
inadvertently
emphasized
this
fact
my
slipping
in
leading
questions
about
Harry
and
hermione's
whereabouts
hermione
shoved
him
back
inside
the
beaded
bag
every
time
he
did
this
and
Phineas
Nigellus
invariably
refused
to
reappear
for
several
days
after
these
unceremonious
good-byes
the
weather
grew
colder
and
colder
they
did
not
dare
remain
in
any
area
too
long
so
rather
than
staying
in
the
south
of
England
where
a
hard
ground
frost
was
the
worst
of
their
worries
they
continued
to
meander
up
and
down
the
country
braving
a
mountainside
where
sleet
pounded
the
tent
a
wide
flat
marsh
where
the
tent
was
flooded
with
chill
water
and
a
tiny
island
in
the
middle
of
a
Scottish
loch
where
snow
half
buried
the
tent
in
the
night
they
had
already
spotted
Christmas
Trees
twinkling
from
several
sitting
room
windows
before
there
came
an
evening
when
Harry
resolved
to
suggest
again
what
seemed
to
him
the
only
unexplored
avenue
left
to
them
they
had
just
eaten
an
unusually
good
meal
Hermione
had
been
to
a
supermarket
under
the
Invisibility
Cloak
scrupulously
dropping
the
money
into
an
open
till
as
she
left
and
Harry
thought
that
she
might
be
more
persuadable
than
usual
on
a
stomach
full
of
spaghetti
Bolognese
and
tinned
pears
he
had
also
had
the
foresight
to
suggest
that
they
take
a
few
hours
break
from
wearing
the
Horcrux
which
was
hanging
over
the
end
of
the
bunk
beside
him
hermione
hmm
she
was
curled
up
in
one
of
the
sagging
armchairs
with
The
Tales
of
Beedle
the
Bard
he
could
not
imagine
how
much
more
she
could
get
out
of
the
book
which
was
not
after
all
very
long
but
evidently
she
was
still
deciphering
something
in
it
because
Spellmans
Syllabary
lay
open
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
harry
cleared
his
throat
he
felt
exactly
as
he
had
done
on
the
occasion
several
years
previously
when
he
had
asked
Professor
McGonagall
whether
he
could
go
into
Hogsmeade
despite
the
fact
that
he
had
not
persuaded
the
Dursleys
to
sign
his
permission
slip
hermione
Ive
been
thinking
and
harry
could
you
help
me
with
something
apparently
she
had
not
been
listening
to
him
she
leaned
forward
and
held
out
The
Tales
of
Beedle
the
Bard
look
at
that
symbol
she
said
pointing
to
the
top
of
a
page
above
what
Harry
assumed
was
the
title
of
the
story
being
unable
to
read
runes
he
could
not
be
sure
there
was
a
picture
of
what
looked
like
a
triangular
eye
its
pupil
crossed
with
a
vertical
line
i
never
took
Ancient
Runes
Hermione
i
know
that
but
it
isnt
a
rune
and
its
not
in
the
syllabary
either
all
along
I
thought
it
was
a
picture
of
an
eye
but
I
dont
think
it
is
its
been
inked
in
look
somebodys
drawn
it
there
it
isnt
really
part
of
the
book
think
have
you
ever
seen
it
before
no
no
wait
a
moment
harry
looked
closer
isnt
it
the
same
symbol
Lunas
dad
was
wearing
round
his
neck
well
thats
what
I
thought
too
then
its
Grindelwalds
mark
she
stared
at
him
openmouthed
what
krum
told
me
he
recounted
the
story
that
Viktor
Krum
had
told
him
at
the
wedding
hermione
looked
astonished
grindelwalds
mark
she
looked
from
Harry
to
the
weird
symbol
and
back
again
ive
never
heard
that
Grindelwald
had
a
mark
theres
no
mention
of
it
in
anything
Ive
ever
read
about
him
well
like
I
say
Krum
reckoned
that
symbol
was
carved
on
a
wall
at
Durmstrang
and
Grindelwald
put
it
there
she
fell
back
into
the
old
armchair
frowning
thats
very
odd
if
its
a
symbol
of
Dark
Magic
whats
it
doing
in
a
book
of
childrens
stories
yeah
it
is
weird
said
Harry
and
youd
think
Scrimgeour
would
have
recognized
it
he
was
Minister
he
ought
to
have
been
expert
on
Dark
stuff
i
know
perhaps
he
thought
it
was
an
eye
just
like
I
did
all
the
other
stories
have
little
pictures
over
the
titles
she
did
not
speak
but
continued
to
pore
over
the
strange
mark
harry
tried
again
hermione
hmm
ive
been
thinking
i
I
want
to
go
to
Godrics
Hollow
she
looked
up
at
him
but
her
eyes
were
unfocused
and
he
was
sure
she
was
still
thinking
about
the
mysterious
mark
on
the
book
yes
she
said
yes
Ive
been
wondering
that
too
i
really
think
well
have
to
did
you
hear
me
right
he
asked
of
course
I
did
you
want
to
go
to
Godrics
Hollow
i
agree
i
think
we
should
i
mean
I
cant
think
of
anywhere
else
it
could
be
either
itll
be
dangerous
but
the
more
I
think
about
it
the
more
likely
it
seems
its
there
er
whats
there
asked
Harry
at
that
she
looked
just
as
bewildered
as
he
felt
well
the
sword
Harry
dumbledore
must
have
known
youd
want
to
go
back
there
and
I
mean
Godrics
Hollow
is
Godric
Gryffindors
birthplace
really
gryffindor
came
from
Godrics
Hollow
harry
did
you
ever
even
open
A
History
of
Magic
erm
he
said
smiling
for
what
felt
like
the
first
time
in
months
The
muscles
in
his
face
felt
oddly
stiff
i
mightve
opened
it
you
know
when
I
bought
it
just
the
once
well
as
the
village
is
named
after
him
Id
have
thought
you
might
have
made
the
connection
said
Hermione
she
sounded
much
more
like
her
old
self
than
she
had
done
of
late
Harry
half
expected
her
to
announce
that
she
was
off
to
the
library
theres
a
bit
about
the
village
in
A
History
of
Magic
wait
she
opened
the
beaded
bag
and
rummaged
for
a
while
finally
extracting
her
copy
of
their
old
school
textbook
A
History
of
Magic
by
Bathilda
Bagshot
which
she
thumbed
through
until
finding
the
page
she
wanted
Upon
the
signature
of
the
International
Statute
of
Secrecy
in
wizards
went
into
hiding
for
good
it
was
natural
perhaps
that
they
formed
their
own
small
communities
within
a
community
many
small
villages
and
hamlets
attracted
several
magical
families
who
banded
together
for
mutual
support
and
protection
the
villages
of
Tinworsh
in
Cornwall
Upper
Flagley
in
Yorkshire
and
Ottery
st.
Catchpole
on
the
south
coast
of
England
were
notable
homes
to
knots
of
Wizarding
families
who
lived
alongside
tolerant
and
sometimes
Confunded
Muggles
most
celebrated
of
these
half-magical
dwelling
places
is
perhaps
Godrics
Hollow
the
West
Country
village
where
the
great
wizard
Godric
Gryffindor
was
born
and
where
Bowman
Wright
Wizarding
smith
forged
the
first
Golden
Snitch
the
graveyard
is
full
of
the
names
of
ancient
magical
families
and
this
accounts
no
doubt
for
the
stories
of
hauntings
that
have
dogged
the
little
church
beside
it
for
many
centuries
you
and
your
parents
arent
mentioned
hermione
said
closing
the
book
because
Professor
Bagshot
doesnt
cover
anything
later
than
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
but
you
see
godrics
Hollow
Godric
Gryffindor
Gryffindors
sword
dont
you
think
Dumbledore
would
have
expected
you
to
make
the
connection
oh
yeah
harry
did
not
want
to
admit
that
he
had
not
been
thinking
about
the
sword
at
all
when
he
suggested
they
go
to
Godrics
Hollow
for
him
the
lore
of
the
village
lay
in
his
parents
graves
the
house
where
he
had
narrowly
escaped
death
and
in
the
person
of
Bathilda
Bagshot
remember
what
Muriel
said
he
asked
eventually
who
you
know
he
hesitated
he
did
not
want
to
say
Rons
name
ginnys
great-aunt
at
the
wedding
the
one
who
said
you
had
skinny
ankles
oh
said
Hermione
it
was
a
sticky
moment
Harry
knew
that
she
had
sensed
Rons
name
in
the
offing
he
rushed
on
she
said
Bathilda
Bagshot
still
lived
in
Godrics
Hollow
bathilda
Bagshot
murmured
Hermione
running
her
index
finger
over
Bathildas
embossed
name
on
the
front
cover
of
A
History
of
Magic
well
I
suppose
she
gasped
so
dramatically
that
Harrys
insides
turned
over
he
drew
his
wand
looking
around
at
the
entrance
half
expecting
to
see
a
hand
forcing
its
way
through
the
entrance
flap
but
there
was
nothing
there
what
he
said
half
angry
half
relieved
what
did
you
do
that
for
i
thought
youd
seen
a
Death
Eater
unzipping
the
tent
at
least
harry
what
if
Bathildas
got
the
sword
what
if
Dumbledore
entrusted
it
to
her
harry
considered
this
possibility
bathilda
would
be
an
extremely
old
woman
by
now
and
according
to
Muriel
she
was
gaga
was
it
likely
that
Dumbledore
would
have
hidden
the
sword
of
Gryffindor
with
her
if
so
Harry
felt
that
Dumbledore
had
left
a
great
deal
to
chance
Dumbledore
had
never
revealed
that
he
had
replaced
the
sword
with
a
fake
nor
had
he
so
much
as
mentioned
a
friendship
with
Bathilda
now
however
was
not
the
moment
to
cast
doubt
on
Hermiones
theory
not
when
she
was
so
surprisingly
willing
to
fall
in
with
Harrys
dearest
wish
yeah
he
might
have
done
so
are
we
going
to
go
to
Godrics
Hollow
yes
but
well
have
to
think
it
through
carefully
Harry
she
was
sitting
up
now
and
Harry
could
tell
that
the
prospect
of
having
a
plan
again
had
lifted
her
mood
as
much
as
his
well
need
to
practice
Disapparating
together
under
the
Invisibility
Cloak
for
a
start
and
perhaps
Disillusionment
Charms
would
be
sensible
too
unless
you
think
we
should
go
the
whole
hog
and
use
Polyjuice
Potion
in
that
case
well
need
to
collect
hair
from
somebody
i
actually
think
wed
better
do
that
Harry
the
thicker
our
disguises
the
better
harry
let
her
talk
nodding
and
agreeing
whenever
there
was
a
pause
but
his
mind
had
left
the
conversation
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
discovered
that
the
sword
in
Gringotts
was
a
fake
he
felt
excited
he
was
about
to
go
home
about
to
return
to
the
place
where
he
had
had
a
family
it
was
in
Godrics
Hollow
that
but
for
Voldemort
he
would
have
grown
up
and
spent
every
school
holiday
he
could
have
invited
friends
to
his
house
he
might
even
have
had
brothers
and
sisters
it
would
have
been
his
mother
who
had
made
his
seventeenth
birthday
cake
the
life
he
had
lost
had
hardly
ever
seemed
so
real
to
him
as
at
this
moment
when
he
knew
he
was
about
to
see
the
place
where
it
had
been
taken
from
him
after
Hermione
had
gone
to
bed
that
night
Harry
quietly
extracted
his
rucksack
from
Hermiones
beaded
bag
and
from
inside
it
the
photograph
album
Hagrid
had
given
him
so
long
ago
for
the
first
time
in
months
he
perused
the
old
pictures
of
his
parents
smiling
and
waving
up
at
him
from
the
images
which
were
all
he
had
left
of
them
now
harry
would
gladly
have
set
out
for
Godrics
Hollow
the
following
day
but
Hermione
had
other
ideas
convinced
as
she
was
that
Voldemort
would
expect
Harry
to
return
to
the
scene
of
his
parents
deaths
she
was
determined
that
they
would
set
off
only
after
they
had
ensured
that
they
had
the
best
disguises
possible
it
was
therefore
a
full
week
later
once
they
had
surreptitiously
obtained
hairs
from
innocent
Muggles
who
were
Christmas
shopping
and
had
practiced
Apparating
and
Disapparating
while
underneath
the
Invisibility
Cloak
together
that
Hermione
agreed
to
make
the
journey
they
were
to
Apparate
to
the
village
under
cover
of
darkness
so
it
was
late
afternoon
when
they
finally
swallowed
Polyjuice
Potion
Harry
transforming
into
a
balding
middle-aged
Muggle
man
Hermione
into
his
small
and
rather
mousy
wife
the
beaded
bag
containing
all
of
their
possessions
apart
from
the
Horcrux
which
Harry
was
wearing
around
his
neck
was
tucked
into
an
inside
pocket
of
Hermiones
buttoned-up
coat
harry
lowered
the
Invisibility
Cloak
over
them
then
they
turned
into
the
suffocating
darkness
once
again
heart
beating
in
his
throat
Harry
opened
his
eyes
they
were
standing
hand
in
hand
in
a
snowy
lane
under
a
dark
blue
sky
in
which
the
nights
first
stars
were
already
glimmering
feebly
cottages
stood
on
either
side
of
the
narrow
road
Christmas
decorations
twinkling
in
their
windows
a
short
way
ahead
of
them
a
glow
of
golden
streetlights
indicated
the
center
of
the
village
all
this
snow
hermione
whispered
beneath
the
cloak
why
didnt
we
think
of
snow
after
all
our
precautions
well
leave
prints
well
just
have
to
get
rid
of
them
you
go
in
front
Ill
do
it
harry
did
not
want
to
enter
the
village
like
a
pantomime
horse
trying
to
keep
themselves
concealed
while
magically
covering
their
traces
lets
take
off
the
Cloak
said
Harry
and
when
she
looked
frightened
Oh
come
on
we
dont
look
like
us
and
theres
no
one
around
he
stowed
the
Cloak
under
his
jacket
and
they
made
their
way
forward
unhampered
the
icy
air
stinging
their
faces
as
they
passed
more
cottages
any
one
of
them
might
have
been
the
one
in
which
James
and
Lily
had
once
lived
or
where
Bathilda
lived
now
harry
gazed
at
the
front
doors
their
snow-burdened
roofs
and
their
front
porches
wondering
whether
he
remembered
any
of
them
knowing
deep
inside
that
it
was
impossible
that
he
had
been
little
more
than
a
year
old
when
he
had
left
this
place
forever
he
was
not
even
sure
whether
he
would
be
able
to
see
the
cottage
at
all
he
did
not
know
what
happened
when
the
subjects
of
a
Fidelius
Charm
died
then
the
little
lane
along
which
they
were
walking
curved
to
the
left
and
the
heart
of
the
village
a
small
square
was
revealed
to
them
strung
all
around
with
colored
lights
there
was
what
looked
like
a
war
memorial
in
the
middle
partly
obscured
by
a
windblown
Christmas
tree
there
were
several
shops
a
post
office
a
pub
and
a
little
church
whose
stained-glass
windows
were
glowing
jewel-bright
across
the
square
the
snow
here
had
become
impacted
It
was
hard
and
slippery
where
people
had
trodden
on
it
all
day
villagers
were
crisscrossing
in
front
of
them
their
figures
briefly
illuminated
by
streetlamps
they
heard
a
snatch
of
laughter
and
pop
music
as
the
pub
door
opened
and
closed
then
they
heard
a
carol
start
up
inside
the
little
church
harry
I
think
its
Christmas
Eve
said
Hermione
is
it
he
had
lost
track
of
the
date
they
had
not
seen
a
newspaper
for
weeks
im
sure
it
is
said
Hermione
her
eyes
upon
the
church
they
theyll
be
in
there
wont
they
your
mum
and
dad
i
can
see
the
graveyard
behind
it
harry
felt
a
thrill
of
something
that
was
beyond
excitement
more
like
fear
now
that
he
was
so
near
he
wondered
whether
he
wanted
to
see
after
all
perhaps
Hermione
knew
how
he
was
feeling
because
she
reached
for
his
hand
and
took
the
lead
for
the
first
time
pulling
him
forward
halfway
across
the
square
however
she
stopped
dead
harry
look
she
was
pointing
at
the
war
memorial
as
they
had
passed
it
it
had
transformed
instead
of
an
obelisk
covered
in
names
there
was
a
statue
of
three
people
a
man
with
untidy
hair
and
glasses
a
woman
with
long
hair
and
a
kind
pretty
face
and
a
baby
boy
sitting
in
his
mothers
arms
snow
lay
upon
all
their
heads
like
fluffy
white
caps
harry
drew
closer
gazing
up
into
his
parents
faces
he
had
never
imagined
that
there
would
be
a
statue
how
strange
it
was
to
see
himself
represented
in
stone
a
happy
baby
without
a
scar
on
his
forehead
cmon
said
Harry
when
he
had
looked
his
fill
and
they
turned
again
toward
the
church
as
they
crossed
the
road
he
glanced
over
his
shoulder
the
statue
had
turned
back
into
the
war
memorial
the
singing
grew
louder
as
they
approached
the
church
it
made
Harrys
throat
constrict
it
reminded
him
so
forcefully
of
Hogwarts
of
Peeves
bellowing
rude
versions
of
carols
from
inside
suits
of
armor
of
the
Great
Halls
twelve
Christmas
trees
of
Dumbledore
wearing
a
bonnet
he
had
won
in
a
cracker
of
Ron
in
a
hand-knitted
sweater
there
was
a
kissing
gate
at
the
entrance
to
the
graveyard
hermione
pushed
it
open
as
quietly
as
possible
and
they
edged
through
it
on
either
side
of
the
slippery
path
to
the
church
doors
the
snow
lay
deep
and
untouched
they
moved
off
through
the
snow
carving
deep
trenches
behind
them
as
they
walked
around
the
building
keeping
to
the
shadows
beneath
the
brilliant
windows
behind
the
church
row
upon
row
of
snowy
tombstones
protruded
from
a
blanket
of
pale
blue
that
was
flecked
with
dazzling
red
gold
and
green
wherever
the
reflections
from
the
stained
glass
hit
the
snow
keeping
his
hand
closed
tightly
on
the
wand
in
his
jacket
pocket
Harry
moved
toward
the
nearest
grave
look
at
this
its
an
Abbott
could
be
some
long-lost
relation
of
Hannahs
keep
your
voice
down
Hermione
begged
him
they
waded
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
graveyard
gouging
dark
tracks
into
the
snow
behind
them
stooping
to
peer
at
the
words
on
old
headstones
every
now
and
then
squinting
into
the
surrounding
darkness
to
make
absolutely
sure
that
they
were
unaccompanied
harry
here
hermione
was
two
rows
of
tombstones
away
he
had
to
wade
back
to
her
his
heart
positively
banging
in
his
chest
is
it
no
but
look
she
pointed
to
the
dark
stone
harry
stooped
down
and
saw
upon
the
frozen
lichen-spotted
granite
the
words
Kendra
Dumbledore
and
a
short
way
down
her
dates
of
birth
and
death
and
Her
Daughter
Ariana
there
was
also
a
quotation
where
your
treasure
is
there
will
your
heart
be
also
so
Rita
Skeeter
and
Muriel
had
got
some
of
their
facts
right
the
Dumbledore
family
had
indeed
lived
here
and
part
of
it
had
died
here
seeing
the
grave
was
worse
than
hearing
about
it
harry
could
not
help
thinking
that
he
and
Dumbledore
both
had
deep
roots
in
this
graveyard
and
that
Dumbledore
ought
to
have
told
him
so
yet
he
had
never
thought
to
share
the
connection
they
could
have
visited
the
place
together
for
a
moment
Harry
imagined
coming
here
with
Dumbledore
of
what
a
bond
that
would
have
been
of
how
much
it
would
have
meant
to
him
but
it
seemed
that
to
Dumbledore
the
fact
that
their
families
lay
side
by
side
in
the
same
graveyard
had
been
an
unimportant
coincidence
irrelevant
perhaps
to
the
job
he
wanted
Harry
to
do
hermione
was
looking
at
Harry
and
he
was
glad
that
his
face
was
hidden
in
shadow
he
read
the
words
on
the
tombstone
again
where
your
treasure
is
there
will
your
heart
be
also
he
did
not
understand
what
these
words
meant
surely
Dumbledore
had
chosen
them
as
the
eldest
member
of
the
family
once
his
mother
had
died
are
you
sure
he
never
mentioned
hermione
began
no
said
Harry
curtly
then
lets
keep
looking
and
he
turned
away
wishing
he
had
not
seen
the
stone
He
did
not
want
his
excited
trepidation
tainted
with
resentment
here
cried
Hermione
again
a
few
moments
later
from
out
of
the
darkness
oh
no
sorry
i
thought
it
said
Potter
she
was
rubbing
at
a
crumbling
mossy
stone
gazing
down
at
it
a
little
frown
on
her
face
harry
come
back
a
moment
he
did
not
want
to
be
sidetracked
again
and
only
grudgingly
made
his
way
back
through
the
snow
toward
her
what
look
at
this
the
grave
was
extremely
old
weathered
so
that
Harry
could
hardly
make
out
the
name
hermione
showed
him
the
symbol
beneath
it
harry
thats
the
mark
in
the
book
he
peered
at
the
place
she
indicated
The
stone
was
so
worn
that
it
was
hard
to
make
out
what
was
engraved
there
though
there
did
seem
to
be
a
triangular
mark
beneath
the
nearly
illegible
name
yeah
it
could
be
hermione
lit
her
wand
and
pointed
it
at
the
name
on
the
headstone
it
says
Ig
Ignotus
I
think
im
going
to
keep
looking
for
my
parents
all
right
harry
told
her
a
slight
edge
to
his
voice
and
he
set
off
again
leaving
her
crouched
beside
the
old
grave
every
now
and
then
he
recognized
a
surname
that
like
Abbott
he
had
met
at
Hogwarts
sometimes
there
were
several
generations
of
the
same
Wizarding
family
represented
in
the
graveyard
Harry
could
tell
from
the
dates
that
it
had
either
died
out
or
the
current
members
had
moved
away
from
Godrics
Hollow
deeper
and
deeper
amongst
the
graves
he
went
and
every
time
he
reached
a
new
headstone
he
felt
a
little
lurch
of
apprehension
and
anticipation
the
darkness
and
the
silence
seemed
to
become
all
of
a
sudden
much
deeper
harry
looked
around
worried
thinking
of
dementors
then
realized
that
the
carols
had
finished
that
the
chatter
and
flurry
of
churchgoers
were
fading
away
as
they
made
their
way
back
into
the
square
somebody
inside
the
church
had
just
turned
off
the
lights
then
Hermiones
voice
came
out
of
the
blackness
for
the
third
time
sharp
and
clear
from
a
few
yards
away
harry
theyre
here
right
here
and
he
knew
by
her
tone
that
it
was
his
mother
and
father
this
time
He
moved
toward
her
feeling
as
if
something
heavy
were
pressing
on
his
chest
the
same
sensation
he
had
had
right
after
Dumbledore
had
died
a
grief
that
had
actually
weighed
on
his
heart
and
lungs
the
headstone
was
only
two
rows
behind
Kendra
and
Arianas
it
was
made
of
white
marble
just
like
Dumbledores
tomb
and
this
made
it
easy
to
read
as
it
seemed
to
shine
in
the
dark
harry
did
not
need
to
kneel
or
even
approach
very
close
to
it
to
make
out
the
words
engraved
upon
it
james
potter
lily
potter
born
march
born
january
died
october
died
october
the
last
enemy
that
shall
be
destroyed
is
death
harry
read
the
words
slowly
as
though
he
would
have
only
one
chance
to
take
in
their
meaning
and
he
read
the
last
of
them
aloud
The
last
enemy
that
shall
be
defeated
is
death
a
horrible
thought
came
to
him
and
with
a
kind
of
panic
isnt
that
a
Death
Eater
idea
why
is
that
there
it
doesnt
mean
defeating
death
in
the
way
the
Death
Eaters
mean
it
Harry
said
Hermione
her
voice
gentle
it
means
you
know
living
beyond
death
living
after
death
but
they
were
not
living
thought
Harry
they
were
gone
the
empty
words
could
not
disguise
the
fact
that
his
parents
moldering
remains
lay
beneath
snow
and
stone
indifferent
unknowing
and
tears
came
before
he
could
stop
them
boiling
hot
then
instantly
freezing
on
his
face
and
what
was
the
point
in
wiping
them
off
or
pretending
he
let
them
fall
his
lips
pressed
hard
together
looking
down
at
the
thick
snow
hiding
from
his
eyes
the
place
where
the
last
of
Lily
and
James
lay
bones
now
surely
or
dust
not
knowing
or
caring
that
their
living
son
stood
so
near
his
heart
still
beating
alive
because
of
their
sacrifice
and
close
to
wishing
at
this
moment
that
he
was
sleeping
under
the
snow
with
them
hermione
had
taken
his
hand
again
and
was
gripping
it
tightly
he
could
not
look
at
her
but
returned
the
pressure
now
taking
deep
sharp
gulps
of
the
night
air
trying
to
steady
himself
trying
to
regain
control
he
should
have
brought
something
o
give
them
and
he
had
not
thought
of
it
and
every
plant
in
the
graveyard
was
leafless
and
frozen
but
Hermione
raised
her
wand
moved
it
in
a
circle
through
the
air
and
a
wreath
of
Christmas
roses
blossomed
before
them
harry
caught
it
and
laid
it
on
his
parents
grave
as
soon
as
he
stood
up
he
wanted
to
leave
He
did
not
think
he
could
stand
another
moment
there
he
put
his
arm
around
Hermiones
shoulders
and
she
put
hers
around
his
waist
and
they
turned
in
silence
and
walked
away
through
the
snow
past
Dumbledores
mother
and
sister
back
toward
the
dark
church
and
the
out-of-sight
kissing
gate

Secret
harry
stop
what's
wrong
they
had
only
just
reached
the
grave
of
the
unknown
Abbott
there's
someone
there
someone
watching
us
i
can
tell
there
over
by
the
bushes
they
stood
quite
still
holding
on
to
each
other
gazing
at
the
dense
black
boundary
of
the
graveyard
harry
could
not
see
anything
are
you
sure
i
saw
something
move
i
could
have
sworn
I
did
she
broke
from
him
to
free
her
wand
arm
we
look
like
Muggles
Harry
pointed
out
muggles
who've
just
been
laying
flowers
on
your
parents
grave
harry
i'm
sure
there's
someone
over
there
harry
thought
of
A
History
of
Magic
the
graveyard
was
supposed
to
be
haunted
what
if
but
then
he
heard
a
rustle
and
saw
a
little
eddy
of
dislodged
snow
in
the
bush
to
which
Hermione
had
pointed
ghosts
could
not
move
snow
it's
a
cat
said
Harry
after
a
second
or
two
or
a
bird
if
it
was
a
Death
Eater
we'd
be
dead
by
now
but
let's
get
out
of
here
and
we
can
put
the
Cloak
back
on
they
glanced
back
repeatedly
as
they
made
their
way
out
of
the
graveyard
harry
who
did
not
feel
as
sanguine
as
he
had
pretended
when
reassuring
Hermione
was
glad
to
reach
the
gate
and
the
slippery
pavement
they
pulled
the
Invisibility
Cloak
back
over
themselves
the
pub
was
fuller
than
before
many
voices
inside
it
were
now
singing
the
carol
that
they
had
heard
as
they
approached
the
church
for
a
moment
Harry
considered
suggesting
they
take
refuge
inside
it
but
before
he
could
say
anything
Hermione
murmured
let's
go
this
way
and
pulled
him
down
the
dark
street
leading
out
of
the
village
in
the
opposite
direction
from
which
they
had
entered
harry
could
make
out
the
point
where
the
cottages
ended
and
the
lane
turned
into
open
country
again
they
walked
as
quickly
as
they
dared
past
more
windows
sparkling
with
multicolored
lights
the
outlines
of
Christmas
trees
dark
through
the
curtains
how
are
we
going
to
find
bathilda's
house
asked
Hermione
who
was
shivering
a
little
and
kept
glancing
back
over
her
shoulder
harry
what
do
you
think
harry
she
tugged
at
this
arm
but
Harry
was
not
paying
attention
he
was
looking
toward
the
dark
mass
that
stood
at
the
very
end
of
this
row
of
houses
next
moment
he
sped
up
dragging
Hermione
along
with
him
she
slipped
a
little
on
the
ice
harry
Look
look
at
it
Hermione
i
don't
oh
he
could
see
it
the
Fidelius
Charm
must
have
died
with
James
and
Lily
the
hedge
had
grown
wild
in
the
sixteen
years
since
Hagrid
had
taken
Harry
from
the
rubble
that
lay
scattered
amongst
the
waist-high
grass
most
of
the
cottage
was
still
standing
though
entirely
covered
in
the
dark
ivy
and
snow
but
the
right
side
of
the
top
floor
had
been
blown
apart
that
Harry
was
sure
was
where
the
curse
had
backfired
he
and
Hermione
stood
at
the
gate
gazing
up
at
the
wreck
of
what
must
once
have
been
a
cottage
just
like
those
that
flanked
it
i
wonder
why
nobody's
ever
rebuilt
it
whispered
Hermione
maybe
you
can't
rebuild
it
harry
replied
maybe
it's
like
the
injuries
from
Dark
Magic
and
you
can't
repair
the
damage
he
slipped
a
hand
from
beneath
the
Cloak
and
grasped
the
snowy
and
thickly
rusted
gate
not
wishing
to
open
it
but
simply
so
he'd
some
part
of
the
house
you're
not
going
to
go
inside
it
looks
unsafe
it
might
oh
Harry
look
his
touch
on
the
gate
seemed
to
have
done
it
a
sign
had
risen
out
of
the
ground
in
front
of
them
up
thorough
the
tangles
of
nettles
and
weeds
like
some
bizarre
fast-growing
flower
and
in
golden
letters
upon
the
wood
it
said
On
this
spot
on
this
night
of
October
Lily
and
James
Potter
lost
their
lives
their
son
Harry
remains
the
only
wizard
ever
to
have
survived
the
Killing
Curse
this
house
invisible
to
Muggles
has
been
left
in
its
ruined
state
as
a
monument
to
the
Potters
and
as
a
reminder
of
the
violence
that
tore
apart
their
family
and
all
around
these
neatly
lettered
words
scribbles
had
been
added
by
other
witches
and
wizards
who
had
come
to
see
the
place
where
the
Boy
Who
Lived
had
escaped
some
had
merely
signed
their
names
in
Everlasting
Ink
others
had
carved
their
initials
into
the
wood
still
others
had
left
messages
the
most
recent
of
these
shining
brightly
over
sixteen
years
worth
of
magical
graffiti
all
said
similar
things
good
luck
Harry
wherever
you
are
if
you
read
this
Harry
we're
all
behind
you
long
live
Harry
Potter
they
shouldn't
have
written
on
the
sign
said
Hermione
indignant
but
Harry
beamed
at
her
it's
brilliant
i'm
glad
they
did
he
broke
off
a
heavily
muffled
figure
was
hobbling
up
the
lane
toward
them
silhouetted
by
the
bright
lights
in
the
distant
square
harry
thought
though
it
was
hard
to
judge
that
the
figure
was
a
woman
she
was
moving
slowly
possibly
frightened
of
slipping
on
the
snowy
ground
her
stoop
her
stoutness
her
shuffling
gait
all
gave
an
impression
of
extreme
age
they
watched
in
silence
as
she
drew
nearer
harry
was
waiting
to
see
whether
she
would
turn
into
any
of
the
cottages
she
was
passing
but
he
knew
instinctively
that
she
would
not
at
last
she
came
to
a
halt
a
few
yards
from
them
and
simply
stood
there
in
the
middle
of
the
frozen
road
facing
them
he
did
not
need
hermione's
pinch
to
his
arm
there
was
next
to
no
chance
that
this
woman
was
a
Muggle
She
was
standing
there
gazing
at
a
house
that
ought
to
have
been
completely
invisible
to
her
if
she
was
not
a
witch
even
assuming
that
she
was
a
witch
however
it
was
odd
behavior
to
come
out
on
a
night
this
cold
simply
to
look
at
an
old
ruin
by
all
the
rules
of
normal
magic
meanwhile
she
ought
not
to
be
able
to
see
Hermione
and
him
at
all
nevertheless
Harry
had
the
strangest
feeling
that
she
knew
that
they
were
there
and
also
who
they
were
just
as
he
had
reached
this
uneasy
conclusion
she
raised
a
gloved
hand
and
beckoned
hermione
moved
closer
to
him
under
the
Cloak
her
arm
pressed
against
his
how
does
she
know
he
shook
his
head
the
woman
beckoned
again
more
vigorously
harry
could
think
of
many
reasons
not
to
obey
the
summons
and
yet
his
suspicions
about
her
identity
were
growing
stronger
every
moment
that
they
stood
facing
each
other
in
the
deserted
street
was
it
possible
that
she
had
been
waiting
for
them
all
these
long
months
that
Dumbledore
had
told
her
to
wait
and
that
Harry
would
come
in
the
end
was
it
not
likely
that
it
was
she
who
had
moved
in
the
shadows
in
the
graveyard
and
had
followed
them
to
this
spot
even
her
ability
to
sense
them
suggested
some
dumbledore-ish
power
that
he
had
never
encountered
before
finally
Harry
spoke
causing
Hermione
to
gasp
and
jump
are
you
Bathilda
the
muffled
figure
nodded
and
beckoned
again
beneath
the
Cloak
Harry
and
Hermione
looked
at
each
other
harry
raised
his
eyebrows
Hermione
gave
a
tiny
nervous
nod
they
stepped
toward
the
woman
and
at
once
she
turned
and
hobbled
off
back
the
way
they
had
come
leading
them
past
several
houses
she
turned
in
at
a
gate
they
followed
her
up
the
front
path
through
a
garden
nearly
as
overgrown
as
the
one
they
had
just
left
she
fumbled
for
a
moment
with
a
key
at
the
front
door
then
opened
it
and
stepped
back
to
let
them
pass
she
smelled
bad
or
perhaps
it
was
her
house
Harry
wrinkled
his
nose
as
they
sidled
past
her
and
pulled
off
the
Cloak
now
that
he
was
beside
her
he
realized
how
tiny
she
was
bowed
down
with
age
she
came
barely
level
with
his
chest
she
closed
the
door
behind
them
her
knuckles
blue
and
mottled
against
the
peeling
paint
then
turned
and
peered
into
harry's
face
her
eyes
were
thick
with
cataracts
and
sunken
into
folds
of
transparent
skin
and
her
whole
face
was
dotted
with
broken
veins
and
liver
spots
he
wondered
whether
she
could
make
him
out
at
all
even
if
she
could
it
was
the
balding
Muggle
whose
identity
he
had
stolen
that
she
would
see
the
odor
of
old
age
of
dust
of
unwashed
clothes
and
stale
food
intensified
as
the
unwound
a
moth-eaten
black
shawl
revealing
a
head
of
scant
white
hair
through
which
the
scalp
showed
clearly
bathilda
harry
repeated
she
nodded
again
harry
became
aware
of
the
locket
against
his
skin
the
thing
inside
it
that
sometimes
ticked
or
beat
had
woken
he
could
feel
it
pulsing
through
the
cold
gold
did
it
know
could
it
sense
that
the
thing
that
would
destroy
it
was
near
bathilda
shuffled
past
them
pushing
Hermione
aside
as
though
she
had
not
seen
her
and
vanished
into
what
seemed
to
be
a
sitting
room
harry
i'm
not
sure
about
this
breathed
Hermione
look
at
the
size
of
her
I
think
we
could
overpower
her
if
we
had
to
said
Harry
listen
I
should
have
told
you
I
knew
she
wasn't
all
there
muriel
called
her
gaga
come
called
Bathilda
from
the
next
room
hermione
jumped
and
clutched
harry's
arm
it's
okay
said
Harry
reassuringly
and
he
led
the
way
into
the
sitting
room
bathilda
was
tottering
around
the
place
lighting
candles
but
it
was
still
very
dark
not
to
mention
extremely
dirty
thick
dust
crunched
beneath
their
feet
and
harry's
nose
detected
underneath
the
dank
and
mildewed
smell
something
worse
like
meat
gone
bad
he
wondered
when
was
the
last
time
anyone
had
been
inside
bathilda's
house
to
check
whether
she
was
coping
she
seemed
to
have
forgotten
that
she
could
do
magic
too
for
she
lit
the
candles
clumsily
by
hand
her
trailing
lace
cuff
in
constant
danger
of
catching
fire
let
me
do
that
offered
Harry
and
he
took
the
matches
from
her
she
stood
watching
him
as
he
finished
lighting
the
candle
stubs
that
stood
on
saucers
around
the
room
perched
precariously
on
stacks
of
books
and
on
side
tables
crammed
with
cracked
and
moldy
cups
the
last
surface
on
which
Harry
spotted
a
candle
was
a
bow-fronted
chest
of
drawers
on
which
there
stood
a
large
number
of
photographs
when
the
flame
danced
into
life
its
reflection
wavered
on
their
dusty
glass
and
silver
he
saw
a
few
tiny
movements
from
the
pictures
as
Bathilda
fumbled
with
logs
for
the
fire
he
muttered
Tergeo
The
dust
vanished
from
the
photographs
and
he
saw
at
once
that
half
a
dozen
were
missing
from
the
largest
and
most
ornate
frames
he
wondered
whether
Bathilda
or
somebody
else
had
removed
them
then
the
sight
of
a
photograph
near
the
back
of
the
collection
caught
his
eye
and
he
snatched
it
up
it
was
the
golden-haired
merry-faced
thief
the
young
man
who
had
perched
on
gregorovitch's
windowsill
smiling
lazily
up
at
Harry
out
of
the
silver
frame
and
it
came
to
Harry
instantly
where
he
had
seen
the
boy
before
in
The
Life
and
Lies
of
Albus
Dumbledore
arm
in
arm
with
the
teenage
Dumbledore
and
that
must
be
where
all
the
missing
photographs
were
in
rita's
book
mrs
Miss
Bagshot
he
said
and
his
voice
shook
slightly
who
is
this
bathilda
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
watching
Hermione
light
the
fire
for
her
miss
Bagshot
harry
repeated
and
he
advanced
with
the
picture
in
his
hands
as
the
flames
burst
into
life
in
the
fireplace
bathilda
looked
up
at
his
voice
and
the
Horcrux
beat
faster
upon
his
chest
who
is
this
person
harry
asked
her
pushing
the
picture
forward
she
peered
at
it
solemnly
then
up
at
Harry
do
you
know
who
this
is
he
repeated
in
a
much
slower
and
louder
voice
than
usual
this
man
do
you
know
him
what's
he
called
bathilda
merely
looked
vague
harry
felt
an
awful
frustration
how
had
Rita
Skeeter
unlocked
bathilda's
memories
who
is
this
man
he
repeated
loudly
harry
what
area
you
doing
asked
Hermione
this
picture
hermione
it's
the
thief
the
thief
who
stole
from
Gregorovitch
please
he
said
to
Bathilda
who
is
this
but
she
only
stared
at
him
why
did
you
ask
us
to
come
with
you
Mrs
Miss
Bagshot
asked
Hermione
raising
her
own
voice
was
there
something
you
wanted
to
tell
us
giving
no
sign
that
she
had
heard
Hermione
Bathilda
now
shuffled
a
few
steps
closer
to
Harry
with
a
little
jerk
of
her
head
she
looked
back
into
the
hall
you
want
us
to
leave
he
asked
she
repeated
the
gesture
this
time
pointing
firstly
at
him
then
at
herself
then
at
the
ceiling
oh
right
hermione
I
think
she
wants
me
to
go
upstairs
with
her
all
right
said
Hermione
let's
go
but
when
Hermione
moved
Bathilda
shook
her
head
with
surprising
vigor
once
more
pointing
first
at
Harry
then
to
herself
she
wants
me
to
go
with
her
alone
why
asked
Hermione
and
her
voice
rang
out
sharp
and
clear
in
the
candlelit
room
the
old
lady
shook
her
head
a
little
at
the
loud
noise
maybe
Dumbledore
told
her
to
give
the
sword
to
me
and
only
to
me
do
you
really
think
she
knows
who
you
are
yes
said
Harry
looking
down
into
the
milky
eyes
fixed
upon
his
own
i
think
she
does
well
okay
then
but
be
quick
Harry
lead
the
way
Harry
told
Bathilda
she
seemed
to
understand
because
she
shuffled
around
him
toward
the
door
harry
glanced
back
at
Hermione
with
a
reassuring
smile
but
he
was
not
sure
she
had
seen
it
she
stood
hugging
herself
in
the
midst
of
the
candlelit
squalor
looking
toward
the
bookcase
as
Harry
walked
out
of
the
room
unseen
by
both
Hermione
and
Bathilda
he
slipped
the
silver-framed
photograph
of
the
unknown
thief
inside
his
jacket
the
stairs
were
steep
and
narrow
Harry
was
half
tempted
to
place
his
hands
on
stout
bathilda's
backside
to
ensure
that
she
did
not
topple
over
backward
on
top
of
him
which
seemed
only
too
likely
slowly
wheezing
a
little
she
climbed
to
the
upper
landing
turned
immediately
right
and
led
him
into
a
low-ceilinged
bedroom
it
was
pitch-black
and
smelled
horrible
Harry
had
just
made
out
a
chamber
pot
protruding
from
under
the
bed
before
Bathilda
closed
the
door
and
even
that
was
swallowed
by
the
darkness
lumos
said
Harry
and
his
wand
ignited
he
gave
a
start
Bathilda
had
moved
close
to
him
in
those
few
seconds
of
darkness
and
he
had
not
heard
her
approach
you
are
Potter
she
whispered
yes
I
am
she
nodded
slowly
solemnly
harry
felt
the
Horcrux
beating
fast
faster
than
his
own
heart
It
was
an
unpleasant
agitating
sensation
have
you
got
anything
for
me
harry
asked
but
she
seemed
distracted
by
his
lit
wand-tip
have
you
got
anything
for
me
he
repeated
then
she
closed
her
eyes
and
several
things
happened
at
once
harry's
scar
prickled
painfully
the
Horcrux
twitched
so
that
the
front
of
his
sweater
actually
moved
the
dark
fetid
room
dissolved
momentarily
he
felt
a
leap
of
joy
and
spoke
in
a
high
cold
voice
Hold
him
harry
swayed
where
he
stood
The
dark
foul-smelling
room
seemed
to
close
around
him
again
he
did
not
know
what
had
just
happened
have
you
got
anything
for
me
he
asked
for
a
third
time
much
louder
over
here
she
whispered
pointing
to
the
corner
harry
raised
his
wand
and
saw
the
outline
of
a
cluttered
dressing
table
beneath
the
curtained
window
this
time
she
did
not
lead
him
harry
edged
between
her
and
the
unmade
bed
his
wand
raised
he
did
not
want
to
look
away
from
her
what
is
it
he
asked
as
he
reached
the
dressing
table
which
was
heaped
high
with
what
looked
and
smelled
like
dirty
laundry
there
she
said
pointing
at
the
shapeless
mass
and
in
the
instant
that
he
looked
away
his
eyes
taking
the
tangled
mess
for
a
sword
hilt
a
ruby
she
moved
weirdly
He
saw
it
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
panic
made
him
turn
and
horror
paralyzed
him
as
he
saw
the
old
body
collapsing
and
the
great
snake
pouring
from
the
place
where
her
neck
had
been
the
snake
struck
as
he
raised
his
wand
The
force
of
the
bite
to
his
forearm
sent
the
wand
spinning
up
toward
the
ceiling
its
light
swung
dizzyingly
around
the
room
and
was
extinguished
Then
a
powerful
blow
from
the
tail
to
his
midriff
knocked
the
breath
out
of
him
He
fell
backward
onto
the
dressing
table
into
the
mound
of
filthy
clothing
He
rolled
sideways
narrowly
avoiding
the
snake's
tail
which
thrashed
down
upon
the
table
where
he
had
been
a
second
earlier
fragments
of
the
glass
surface
rained
upon
him
as
he
hit
the
floor
from
below
he
heard
Hermione
call
Harry
he
could
not
get
enough
breath
into
his
lungs
to
call
back
Then
a
heavy
smooth
mass
smashed
him
to
the
floor
and
he
felt
it
slide
over
him
powerful
muscular
No
he
gasped
pinned
to
the
floor
yes
whispered
the
voice
yesss
hold
you
hold
you
accio
accio
Wand
but
nothing
happened
and
he
needed
his
hands
to
try
to
force
the
snake
from
him
as
it
coiled
itself
around
his
torso
squeezing
the
air
from
him
pressing
the
Horcrux
hard
into
his
chest
a
circle
of
ice
that
throbbed
with
life
inches
from
his
own
frantic
heart
and
his
brain
was
flooding
with
cold
white
light
all
thought
obliterated
his
own
breath
drowned
distant
footsteps
everything
going
a
metal
heart
was
banging
outside
his
chest
and
now
he
was
flying
flying
with
triumph
in
his
heart
without
need
of
broomstick
or
thestral
he
was
abruptly
awake
in
the
sour-smelling
darkness
Nagini
had
released
him
he
scrambled
up
and
saw
the
snake
outlined
against
the
landing
light
It
struck
and
Hermione
dived
aside
with
a
shriek
her
deflected
curse
hit
the
curtained
window
which
shattered
frozen
air
filled
the
room
as
Harry
ducked
to
avoid
another
shower
of
broken
glass
and
his
foot
slipped
on
a
pencil-like
something
his
wand
He
bent
and
snatched
it
up
but
now
the
room
was
full
of
the
snake
its
tail
thrashing
Hermione
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
and
for
a
moment
Harry
thought
the
worst
but
then
there
was
a
loud
bang
and
a
flash
of
red
light
and
the
snake
flew
into
the
air
smacking
Harry
hard
in
the
face
as
it
went
coil
after
heavy
coil
rising
up
to
the
ceiling
harry
raised
his
wand
but
as
he
did
so
his
scar
seared
more
painfully
more
powerfully
than
it
had
done
in
years
he's
coming
hermione
he's
coming
as
he
yelled
the
snake
fell
hissing
wildly
everything
was
chaos
It
smashed
shelves
from
the
wall
and
splintered
china
flew
everywhere
as
Harry
jumped
over
the
bed
and
seized
the
dark
shape
he
knew
to
be
Hermione
She
shrieked
with
pain
as
he
pulled
her
back
across
the
bed
The
snake
reared
again
but
Harry
knew
that
worse
than
the
snake
was
coming
was
perhaps
already
at
the
gate
his
head
was
going
to
split
open
with
the
pain
from
his
scar
The
snake
lunged
as
he
took
a
running
leap
dragging
Hermione
with
him
as
it
struck
Hermione
screamed
Confringo
and
her
spell
flew
around
the
room
exploding
the
wardrobe
mirror
and
ricocheting
back
at
them
bouncing
from
floor
to
ceiling
Harry
felt
the
heat
of
it
sear
the
back
of
his
hand
glass
cut
his
cheek
as
pulling
Hermione
with
him
he
leapt
from
bed
to
broken
dressing
table
and
then
straight
out
of
the
smashed
window
into
nothingness
her
scream
reverberating
through
the
night
as
they
twisted
in
midair
and
then
his
scar
burst
open
and
he
was
Voldemort
and
he
was
running
across
the
fetid
bedroom
his
long
white
hands
clutching
at
the
windowsill
as
he
glimpsed
the
bald
man
and
the
little
woman
twist
and
vanish
and
he
screamed
with
rage
a
scream
that
mingled
with
the
girl's
that
echoed
across
the
dark
gardens
over
the
church
bells
ringing
in
Christmas
Day
and
his
scream
was
harry's
scream
his
pain
was
harry's
pain
that
it
could
happen
here
where
it
had
happened
before
here
within
sight
of
that
house
where
he
had
come
so
close
to
knowing
what
it
was
to
die
to
die
the
pain
was
so
terrible
ripped
from
his
body
but
if
he
had
no
body
why
did
his
head
hurt
so
badly
if
he
was
dead
how
cold
he
feel
so
unbearably
didn't
pain
cease
with
death
didn't
it
go
the
night
wet
and
windy
two
children
dressed
as
pumpkins
waddling
across
the
square
and
the
shop
windows
covered
in
paper
spiders
all
the
tawdry
Muggle
trappings
of
a
world
in
which
they
did
not
believe
and
he
was
gliding
along
that
sense
of
purpose
and
power
and
rightness
in
him
that
he
always
knew
on
these
occasions
not
anger
that
was
for
weaker
souls
than
he
but
triumph
yes
he
had
waited
for
this
he
had
hoped
for
it
nice
costume
mister
he
saw
the
small
boy's
smile
falter
as
he
ran
near
enough
to
see
beneath
the
hood
of
the
cloak
saw
the
fear
cloud
his
pained
face
Then
the
child
turned
and
ran
away
beneath
the
robe
he
fingered
the
handle
of
his
wand
one
simple
movement
and
the
child
would
never
reach
his
mother
but
unnecessary
quite
unnecessary
and
along
a
new
and
darker
street
he
moved
and
now
his
destination
was
in
sight
at
last
the
Fidelius
Charm
broken
though
they
did
not
know
it
yet
and
he
made
less
noise
than
the
dead
leaves
slithering
along
the
pavement
as
he
drew
level
with
the
dark
hedge
and
steered
over
it
they
had
not
drawn
the
curtains
he
saw
them
quite
clearly
in
their
little
sitting
room
the
tall
black-haired
man
in
his
glasses
making
puffs
of
colored
smoke
erupt
from
his
wand
for
the
amusement
of
the
small
black-haired
boy
in
his
blue
pajamas
the
child
was
laughing
and
trying
to
catch
the
smoke
to
grab
it
in
his
small
fist
a
door
opened
and
the
mother
entered
saying
words
he
cold
not
hear
her
long
dark-red
hair
falling
over
her
face
now
the
father
scooped
up
the
son
and
handed
him
to
the
mother
he
threw
his
wand
down
upon
the
sofa
and
stretched
yawning
the
gate
creaked
a
little
as
he
pushed
it
open
but
James
Potter
did
not
hear
his
white
hand
pulled
out
the
wand
beneath
his
cloak
and
pointed
it
at
the
door
which
burst
open
he
was
over
the
threshold
as
James
came
sprinting
into
the
hall
it
was
easy
too
easy
he
had
not
even
picked
up
his
wand
lily
take
Harry
and
go
it's
him
go
run
i'll
hold
him
off
hold
him
off
without
a
wand
in
his
hand
he
laughed
before
casting
the
curse
avada
Kedavra
the
green
light
filled
the
cramped
hallway
it
lit
the
pram
pushed
against
the
wall
it
made
the
banisters
glow
like
lighting
rods
and
James
Potter
fell
like
a
marionette
whose
strings
were
cut
he
could
hear
her
screaming
from
the
upper
floor
trapped
but
as
long
as
she
was
sensible
she
at
least
had
nothing
to
fear
he
climbed
the
steps
listening
with
faint
amusement
to
her
attempts
to
barricade
herself
in
she
had
no
wand
upon
her
either
how
stupid
they
were
and
how
trusting
thinking
that
their
safety
lay
in
friends
that
weapons
could
be
discarded
even
for
moments
he
forced
the
door
open
cast
aside
the
chair
and
boxes
hastily
piled
against
it
with
one
lazy
wave
of
his
wand
and
there
she
stood
the
child
in
her
arms
at
the
sight
of
him
she
dropped
her
son
into
the
crib
behind
her
and
threw
her
arms
wide
as
if
this
would
help
as
if
in
shielding
him
from
sight
she
hoped
to
be
chosen
instead
not
Harry
not
Harry
please
not
Harry
stand
aside
you
silly
girl
stand
aside
now
not
Harry
please
no
take
me
kill
me
instead
This
is
my
last
warning
Not
Harry
please
have
mercy
have
mercy
not
Harry
not
Harry
please
i'll
do
anything
stand
aside
stand
aside
girl
he
could
have
forced
her
away
from
the
crib
but
it
seemed
more
prudent
to
finish
them
all
the
green
light
flashed
around
the
room
and
she
dropped
like
her
husband
the
child
had
not
cried
all
this
time
he
could
stand
clutching
the
bars
of
his
crib
and
he
looked
up
into
the
intruder's
face
with
a
kind
of
bright
interest
perhaps
thinking
that
it
was
his
father
who
hid
beneath
the
cloak
making
more
pretty
lights
and
his
mother
would
pop
up
any
moment
laughing
He
pointed
the
wand
very
carefully
into
the
boy's
face
He
wanted
to
see
it
happen
the
destruction
of
this
one
inexplicable
danger
the
child
began
to
cry
It
had
seen
that
he
was
not
James
he
did
not
like
it
crying
he
had
never
been
able
to
stomach
the
small
ones
whining
in
the
orphanage
Avada
Kedavra
and
then
he
broke
he
was
nothing
nothing
but
pain
and
terror
and
he
must
hide
himself
not
here
in
the
rubble
of
the
ruined
house
where
the
child
was
trapped
screaming
but
far
away
far
away
no
he
moaned
the
snake
rustled
on
the
filthy
cluttered
floor
and
he
had
killed
the
boy
and
yet
he
was
the
boy
no
and
now
he
stood
at
the
broken
window
of
bathilda's
house
immersed
in
memories
of
his
greatest
loss
and
at
his
feet
the
great
snake
slithered
over
broken
china
and
glass
he
looked
down
and
saw
something
something
incredible
no
harry
it's
all
right
you're
all
right
he
stooped
down
and
picked
up
the
smashed
photograph
there
he
was
the
unknown
thief
the
thief
he
was
seeking
no
i
dropped
it
i
dropped
it
harry
it's
okay
wake
up
wake
up
he
was
Harry
harry
not
Voldemort
and
the
thing
that
was
rustling
was
not
a
snake
he
opened
his
eyes
harry
Hermione
whispered
do
you
feel
all
all
right
yes
he
lied
he
was
in
the
tent
lying
on
one
of
the
lower
bunks
beneath
a
heap
of
blankets
he
could
tell
that
it
was
almost
dawn
by
the
stillness
and
quality
of
the
cold
flat
light
beyond
the
canvas
ceiling
he
was
drenched
in
sweat
he
could
feel
it
on
the
sheets
and
blankets
we
got
away
yes
said
Hermione
i
had
to
use
a
Hover
Charm
to
get
you
into
your
bunk
i
couldn't
lift
you
you've
been
well
you
haven't
been
quite
there
were
purple
shadows
under
her
brown
eyes
and
he
noticed
a
small
sponge
in
her
hand
She
had
been
wiping
his
face
you've
been
ill
she
finished
quite
ill
how
long
ago
did
we
leave
hours
ago
it's
nearly
morning
and
i've
been
what
unconscious
not
exactly
said
Hermione
uncomfortably
you've
been
shouting
and
moaning
and
things
she
added
in
a
tone
that
made
Harry
feel
uneasy
what
had
he
done
screamed
curses
like
Voldemort
cried
like
the
baby
in
the
crib
i
couldn't
get
the
Horcrux
off
you
Hermione
said
and
he
knew
she
wanted
to
change
the
subject
it
was
stuck
stuck
to
your
chest
you've
got
a
mark
i'm
sorry
I
had
to
use
a
Severing
Charm
to
get
it
away
the
snake
hit
you
too
but
i've
cleaned
the
wound
and
put
some
dittany
on
it
he
pulled
the
sweaty
t-shirt
he
was
wearing
away
from
himself
and
looked
down
there
was
a
scarlet
oval
over
his
heart
where
the
locket
had
burned
him
he
could
also
see
the
half
healed
puncture
marks
to
his
forearm
where've
you
put
the
Horcrux
in
my
bag
i
think
we
should
keep
it
off
for
a
while
he
lay
back
on
his
pillows
and
looked
into
her
pinched
gray
face
we
shouldn't
have
gone
to
godric's
Hollow
it's
my
fault
it's
all
my
fault
hermione
i'm
sorry
it's
not
you
fault
i
wanted
to
go
too
I
really
thought
Dumbledore
might
have
left
the
sword
there
for
you
yeah
well
we
got
that
wrong
didn't
we
what
happened
Harry
what
happened
when
she
took
you
upstairs
was
the
snake
hiding
somewhere
did
it
just
come
out
and
kill
her
and
attack
you
no.
he
said
she
was
the
snake
or
the
snake
was
her
all
along
w-what
he
closed
his
eyes
he
could
still
smell
bathilda's
house
on
him
it
made
the
whole
thing
horribly
vivid
bathilda
must've
been
dead
a
while
the
snake
was
was
inside
her
you-Know-Who
put
it
there
in
godric's
Hollow
to
wait
you
were
right
he
knew
i'd
go
back
the
snake
was
inside
her
he
opened
his
eyes
again
hermione
looked
revolted
nauseated
lupin
said
there
would
be
magic
we'd
never
imagined
harry
said
she
didn't
want
to
talk
in
front
of
you
because
it
was
Parseltongue
all
Parseltongue
and
I
didn't
realize
but
of
course
I
could
understand
her
once
we
were
up
in
the
room
the
snake
sent
a
message
to
You-Know-Who
I
heard
it
happen
inside
my
head
I
felt
him
get
excited
he
said
to
keep
me
there
and
then
he
remembered
the
snake
coming
out
of
bathilda's
neck
Hermione
did
not
need
to
know
the
details
she
changed
changed
into
the
snake
and
attacked
he
looked
down
at
the
puncture
marks
it
wasn't
supposed
to
kill
me
just
keep
me
there
till
You-Know-Who
came
if
he
had
only
managed
to
kill
the
snake
it
would
have
been
worth
it
all
of
it
sick
at
heart
he
sat
up
and
threw
back
the
covers
harry
no
i'm
sure
you
ought
to
rest
you're
the
one
who
needs
sleep
no
offense
but
you
look
terrible
i'm
fine
i'll
keep
watch
for
a
while
where's
my
wand
she
did
not
answer
she
merely
looked
at
him
where's
my
wand
Hermione
she
was
biting
her
lip
and
tears
swam
in
her
eyes
harry
where's
my
wand
she
reached
down
beside
the
bed
and
held
it
out
to
him
the
holly
and
phoenix
wand
was
nearly
severed
in
two
one
fragile
strand
of
phoenix
feather
kept
both
pieces
hanging
together
the
wood
had
splintered
apart
completely
harry
took
it
into
his
hands
as
though
it
was
a
living
thing
that
had
suffered
a
terrible
injury
he
could
not
think
properly
Everything
was
a
blur
of
panic
and
fear
then
he
held
out
the
want
to
Hermione
mend
it
please
harry
I
don't
think
when
it's
broken
like
this
Please
Hermione
try
r-Reparo
the
dangling
half
of
the
wand
resealed
itself
harry
held
it
up
lumos
the
wand
sparked
feebly
then
went
out
harry
pointed
it
at
Hermione
expelliarmus
hermione's
wand
gave
a
little
jerk
but
did
not
leave
her
hand
the
feeble
attempt
at
magic
was
too
much
for
harry's
wand
which
split
into
two
again
he
stared
at
it
aghast
unable
to
take
in
what
he
was
seeing
the
wand
that
had
survived
so
much
harry
hermione
whispered
so
quietly
he
could
hardly
hear
her
i'm
so
so
sorry
i
think
it
was
me
as
we
were
leaving
you
know
the
snake
was
coming
for
us
and
so
I
cast
a
Blasting
Curse
and
it
rebounded
everywhere
and
it
must
have
must
have
hit
It
was
an
accident
said
Harry
mechanically
he
felt
empty
stunned
we'll
we'll
find
a
way
to
repair
it
harry
I
don't
think
we're
going
to
be
able
to
said
Hermione
the
ears
trickling
down
her
face
remember
remember
Ron
when
he
broke
his
wand
crashing
the
car
it
was
never
the
same
again
he
had
to
get
a
new
one
harry
thought
of
Ollivander
kidnapped
and
held
hostage
by
Voldemort
of
Gregorovitch
who
was
dead
how
was
he
supposed
to
find
himself
a
new
wand
well
he
said
in
a
falsely
matter-of-fact
voice
well
i'll
just
borrow
yours
for
now
then
while
I
keep
watch
her
face
glazed
with
tears
Hermione
handed
over
her
wand
and
he
left
her
sitting
beside
his
bed
desiring
nothing
more
than
to
get
away
from
her
chapter
Eighteen
the
Life
and
Lies
of
Albus
Dumbledore
the
sun
was
coming
up
The
pure
colorless
vastness
of
the
sky
stretched
over
him
indifferent
to
him
and
his
suffering
harry
sat
down
in
the
tent
entrance
and
took
a
deep
breath
of
clean
air
simply
to
be
alive
to
watch
the
sun
rise
over
the
sparkling
snowy
hillside
ought
to
have
been
the
greatest
treasure
on
earth
yet
he
could
not
appreciate
it
His
senses
had
been
spiked
by
the
calamity
of
losing
his
want
he
looked
out
over
a
valley
blanketed
in
snow
distant
church
bells
chiming
through
the
glittering
silence
without
realizing
it
he
was
digging
his
fingers
into
his
arms
as
if
he
were
trying
to
resist
physical
pain
he
had
spilled
his
own
blood
more
times
than
he
could
count
he
had
lost
all
bones
in
his
right
arm
once
this
journey
had
already
given
him
scars
to
his
chest
and
forearm
to
join
those
on
his
hand
and
forehead
but
never
until
this
moment
had
he
felt
himself
to
be
fatally
weakened
vulnerable
and
naked
as
though
the
best
part
of
his
magical
power
had
been
torn
from
him
he
knew
exactly
what
Hermione
would
say
if
he
expressed
any
of
this
The
wand
is
only
as
good
as
the
wizard
but
she
was
wrong
his
case
was
different
she
had
not
felt
the
wand
spin
like
the
needle
of
a
compass
and
shoot
golden
flames
at
his
enemy
he
had
lost
the
protection
of
the
twin
cores
and
only
now
that
it
was
gone
did
he
realize
how
much
he
had
been
counting
on
it
he
pulled
the
pieces
of
the
broken
wand
out
of
his
pocket
and
without
looking
at
them
tucked
them
away
in
Hagrids
pouch
around
his
neck
the
pouch
was
now
too
full
of
broken
and
useless
objects
to
take
any
more
harrys
hand
brushed
the
old
Snitch
through
the
mokeskin
and
for
a
moment
he
had
to
fight
the
temptation
to
pull
it
out
and
throw
it
away
impenetrable
unhelpful
useless
like
everything
else
Dumbledore
had
left
behind
and
his
fury
at
Dumbledore
broke
over
him
now
like
lava
scorching
him
inside
wiping
out
every
other
feeling
out
of
sheer
desperation
they
had
talked
themselves
into
believing
that
Godrics
Hollow
held
answers
convinced
themselves
that
they
were
supposed
to
go
back
that
it
was
all
part
of
some
secret
path
laid
out
for
them
by
Dumbledore
but
there
was
no
map
no
plan
dumbledore
had
left
them
to
grope
in
the
darkness
to
wrestle
with
unknown
and
undreamed-of
terrors
alone
and
unaided
Nothing
was
explained
nothing
was
given
freely
they
had
no
sword
and
now
Harry
had
no
wand
and
he
had
dropped
the
photograph
of
the
thief
and
it
would
surely
be
easy
now
for
Voldemort
to
find
out
who
he
was
voldemort
had
all
the
information
now
harry
hermione
looked
frightened
that
he
might
curse
her
with
her
own
wand
her
face
streaked
with
tears
she
crouched
down
beside
him
two
cups
of
tea
trembling
in
her
hands
and
something
bulky
under
her
arm
thanks
he
said
taking
one
of
the
cups
do
you
mind
if
I
talk
to
you
no
he
said
because
he
did
not
want
to
hurt
her
feelings
harry
you
wanted
to
know
who
that
man
in
the
picture
was
well
ive
got
the
book
timidly
she
pushed
it
onto
his
lap
a
pristine
copy
of
The
Life
and
Lies
of
Albus
Dumbledore
where
how
it
was
in
Bathildas
sitting
room
just
lying
there
this
note
was
sticking
out
of
the
top
of
it
hermione
read
the
few
lines
of
spiky
acid-green
writing
aloud
Dear
Bally
Thanks
for
your
help
heres
a
copy
of
the
book
hope
you
like
it
you
said
everything
even
if
you
dont
remember
it
rita
I
think
it
must
have
arrived
while
the
real
Bathilda
was
alive
but
perhaps
she
wasnt
in
any
fit
state
to
read
it
no
she
probably
wasnt
harry
looked
down
upon
Dumbledores
face
and
experienced
a
surge
of
savage
pleasure
Now
he
would
know
if
all
the
things
that
Dumbledore
had
never
thought
it
worth
telling
him
whether
Dumbledore
wanted
him
to
or
not
youre
still
really
angry
at
me
arent
you
said
Hermione
he
looked
up
to
see
fresh
tears
leaking
out
of
her
eyes
and
knew
that
his
anger
must
have
shown
in
his
face
no
he
said
quietly
no
Hermione
I
know
it
was
an
accident
you
were
trying
to
get
us
out
of
there
alive
and
you
were
incredible
id
be
dead
if
you
hadnt
been
there
to
help
me
he
tried
to
return
her
watery
smile
then
turned
his
attention
to
the
book
its
spine
was
stiff
it
had
clearly
never
been
opened
before
he
riffled
through
the
pages
looking
for
photographs
he
came
across
the
one
he
sought
almost
at
once
the
young
Dumbledore
and
his
handsome
companion
roaring
with
laughter
at
some
long-forgotten
joke
harry
dropped
his
eyes
to
the
caption
albus
Dumbledore
shortly
after
his
mothers
death
with
his
friend
Gellert
Grindelwald
harry
gaped
at
the
last
word
for
several
long
moments
grindelwald
his
friend
Grindelwald
he
looked
sideways
at
Hermione
who
was
still
contemplating
the
name
as
though
she
could
not
believe
her
eyes
slowly
she
looked
up
at
Harry
grindelwald
ignoring
the
remainder
of
the
photographs
Harry
searched
the
pages
around
them
for
a
recurrence
of
that
fatal
name
he
soon
discovered
it
and
read
greedily
but
became
lost
It
was
necessary
to
go
farther
back
to
make
sense
of
it
all
and
eventually
he
found
himself
at
the
start
of
a
chapter
entitled
The
Greater
Good
together
he
and
Hermione
started
to
read
now
approaching
his
eighteenth
birthday
Dumbledore
left
Hogwarts
in
a
blaze
of
glory

next
to
take
a
Grand

with
Elphias
Dogbreath
Doge
the
dim-witted
but
devoted
sidekick
he
had
picked
up
at
school
the
two
young
men
were
staying
at
the
Leaky
Cauldron
in
London
preparing
to
depart
for
Greece
the
following
morning
when
an
owl
arrived
bearing
news
of
Dumbledores
mothers
death
dogbreath
Doge
who
refused
to
be
interviewed
for
this
book
has
given
the
public
his
own
sentimental
version
of
what
happened
next
he
represents
Kendras
death
as
a
tragic
blow
and
Dumbledores
decision
to
give
up
his
expedition
as
an
act
of
noble
self-sacrifice
certainly
Dumbledore
returned
to
Godrics
Hollow
at
once
supposedly
to
care
for
his
younger
brother
and
sister
but
how
much
care
did
he
actually
give
them
he
were
a
head
case
that
Aberforth

Enid

family
lived
on
the
outskirts
of
Godrics
Hollow
at
that
time
ran
wild
Course
with
his
mum
and
dad
gone
youd
have
felt
sorry
for
him
only
he
kept
chucking
goat
dung
at
my
head
i
dont
think
Albus
was
fussed
about
him
i
never
saw
them
together
anyway
so
what
was
Albus
doing
if
not
comforting
his
wild
young
brother
the
answer
it
seems
is
ensuring
the
continued
imprisonment
of
his
sister
for
though
her
first
jailer
had
died
there
was
no
change
in
the
pitiful
condition
of
Ariana
Dumbledore
her
very
existence
continued
to
be
known
only
to
those
few
outsiders
who
like
Dogbreath
Doge
could
be
counted
upon
to
believe
in
the
story
of
her
ill
health
another
such
easily
satisfied
friend
of
the
family
was
Bathilda
Bagshot
the
celebrated
magical
historian
who
has
lived
in
Godrics
Hollow
for
many
years
kendra
of
course
had
rebuffed
Bathilda
when
she
first
attempted
to
welcome
the
family
to
the
village
several
years
later
however
the
author
sent
an
owl
to
Albus
at
Hogwarts
having
been
favorably
impressed
by
his
paper
on
trans-species
transformation
in
Transfiguration
Today
this
initial
contract
led
to
acquaintance
with
the
entire
Dumbledore
family
at
the
time
of
Kendras
death
Bathilda
was
the
only
person
in
Godrics
Hollow
who
was
on
speaking
terms
with
Dumbledores
mother
unfortunately
the
brilliance
that
Bathilda
exhibited
earlier
in
her
life
has
now
dimmed
the
fires
lit
but
the
cauldrons
empty
as
Ivor
Dillonsby
put
it
to
me
or
in
Enid
Smeeks
slightly
earthier
phrase
Shes
nutty
as
squirrel
poo
nevertheless
a
combination
of
tried-and-tested
reporting
techniques
enabled
me
to
extract
enough
nuggets
of
hard
fact
to
string
together
the
whole
scandalous
story
like
the
rest
of
the
Wizarding
world
Bathilda
puts
Kendras
premature
death
down
to
a
backfiring
charm
a
story
repeated
by
Albus
and
Aberforth
in
later
years
bathilda
also
parrots
the
family
line
on
Ariana
calling
her
frail
and
delicate
on
one
subject
however
Bathilda
is
well
worth
the
effort
I
put
into
procuring
Veritaserum
for
she
and
she
alone
knows
the
full
story
of
the
best-kept
secret
of
Albus
Dumbledores
life
now
revealed
for
the
first
time
it
calls
into
question
everything
that
his
admirers
believed
of
Dumbledore
his
supposed
hatred
of
the
Dark
Arts
his
opposition
into
the
oppression
of
Muggles
even
his
devotion
to
his
own
family
the
very
same
summer
that
Dumbledore
went
home
to
Godrics
Hollow
now
an
orphan
and
head
of
the
family
Bathilda
Bagshot
agreed
to
accept
into
her
home
her
great-nephew
Gellert
Grindelwald
the
name
of
Grindelwald
is
justly
famous
In
a
list
of
Most
Dangerous
Dark
Wizards
of
All
Time
he
would
miss
out
on
the
top
spot
only
because
You
know-Who
arrived
a
generation
later
to
steal
his
crown
as
Grindelwald
never
extended
his
campaign
of
terror
to
Britain
however
the
details
of
his
rise
to
power
are
not
widely
known
here
educated
at
Durmstrang
a
school
famous
even
then
for
its
unfortunate
tolerance
of
the
Dark
Arts
Grindelwald
showed
himself
quite
as
precociously
brilliant
as
Dumbledore
rather
than
channel
his
abilities
into
the
attainment
of
awards
and
prizes
however
Gellert
Grindelwald
devoted
himself
no
other
pursuits
at
sixteen
years
old
even
Durmstrang
felt
it
could
no
longer
turn
a
blind
eye
to
the
twisted
experiments
of
Gellert
Grindelwald
and
he
was
expelled
hitherto
all
that
has
been
known
of
Grindelwalds
next
movements
is
that
he
traveled
around
for
some
months
it
can
now
be
revealed
that
Grindelwald
chose
to
visit
his
great-aunt
in
Godrics
Hollow
and
that
there
intensely
shocking
though
it
will
be
for
many
to
hear
it
he
struck
up
a
close
friendship
with
none
other
than
Albus
Dumbledore
he
seemed
a
charming
boy
to
me
babbles
Bathilda
whatever
he
became
later
naturally
I
introduced
him
to
poor
Albus
who
was
missing
the
company
of
lads
his
own
age
the
boys
took
to
each
other
at
once
they
certainly
did
bathilda
shows
me
a
letter
kept
by
her
that
Albus
Dumbledore
sent
Gellert
Grindelwald
in
the
dead
of
night
yes
even
after
theyd
spent
all
day
in
discussion
both
such
brilliant
young
boys
they
got
on
like
a
cauldron
on
fire
Id
sometimes
hear
an
owl
tapping
at
Gellerts
bedroom
window
delivering
a
letter
from
Albus
an
idea
would
have
struck
him
and
he
had
to
let
Gellert
know
immediately
and
what
ideas
they
were
profoundly
shocking
though
Albus
Dumbledores
fans
will
find
it
here
are
the
thoughts
of
their
seventeen-year-old
hero
as
relayed
to
his
new
best
friend
A
copy
of
the
original
letter
may
be
seen
on
page
gellert
your
point
about
Wizard
dominance
being
for
the
muggles
own
good
this
I
think
is
the
crucial
point
yes
we
have
been
given
power
and
yes
that
power
gives
us
the
right
to
rule
but
it
also
gives
us
responsibilities
over
the
ruled
we
must
stress
this
point
it
will
be
the
foundation
stone
upon
which
we
build
where
we
are
opposed
as
we
surely
will
be
this
must
be
the
basis
of
all
our
counterarguments
we
seize
control
for
the
greater
good
and
from
this
it
follows
that
where
we
meet
resistance
we
must
use
only
the
force
that
is
necessary
and
no
more
This
was
your
mistake
at
Durmstrang
but
I
do
not
complain
because
if
you
had
not
been
expelled
we
would
never
have
met
albus
astonished
and
appalled
though
his
many
admirers
will
be
this
letter
constitutes
the
Statute
of
Secrecy
and
establishing
Wizard
rule
over
Muggles
what
a
blow
for
those
who
have
always
portrayed
Dumbledore
as
the
muggle-borns
greatest
champion
how
hollow
those
speeches
promoting
Muggle
rights
seem
in
the
light
of
this
damning
new
evidence
how
despicable
does
Albus
Dumbledore
appear
busy
plotting
his
rise
to
power
when
he
should
have
been
mourning
his
mother
and
caring
for
his
sister
no
doubt
those
determined
to
keep
Dumbledore
on
his
crumbling
pedestal
will
bleat
that
he
did
not
after
all
put
his
plans
into
action
that
he
must
have
suffered
a
change
of
heart
that
he
came
to
his
senses
however
the
truth
seems
altogether
more
shocking
barely
two
months
into
their
great
new
friendship
Dumbledore
and
Grindelwald
parted
never
to
see
each
other
again
until
they
met
for
their
legendary
duel
for
more
see
chapter
what
caused
this
abrupt
rupture
had
Dumbledore
come
to
his
senses
had
he
told
Grindelwald
he
wanted
no
more
part
in
his
plans
alas
no
it
was
poor
little
Ariana
dying
I
think
that
did
it
says
Bathilda
it
came
as
an
awful
shock
gellert
was
there
in
the
house
when
it
happened
and
he
came
back
to
my
house
all
of
a
dither
told
me
he
wanted
to
go
home
the
next
day
terribly
distressed
you
know
so
I
arranged
a
Portkey
and
that
was
the
last
I
saw
of
him
albus
was
beside
himself
at
Arianas
death
it
was
so
dreadful
for
those
two
brothers
they
had
lost
everybody
except
for
each
other
no
wonder
tempers
ran
a
little
high
aberforth
blamed
Albus
you
know
as
people
will
under
these
dreadful
circumstances
but
Aberforth
always
talked
a
little
madly
poor
boy
all
the
same
breaking
Albuss
nose
at
the
funeral
was
not
decent
it
would
have
destroyed
Kendra
to
see
her
sons
fighting
like
that
across
her
daughters
body
a
shame
Gellert
could
not
have
stayed
for
the
funeral
he
would
have
been
a
comfort
to
Albus
at
least
this
dreadful
coffin-side
brawl
known
only
to
those
few
who
attended
Ariana
Dumbledores
funeral
raises
several
questions
why
exactly
did
Aberforth
Dumbledore
blame
Albus
for
his
sisters
death
was
it
as
Batty
pretends
a
mere
effusion
of
grief
or
could
there
have
been
some
more
concrete
reason
for
his
fury
grindelwald
expelled
from
Durmstrang
for
the
near-fatal
attacks
upon
fellow
students
fled
the
country
hours
after
the
girls
death
and
Albus
out
of
shame
or
fear
never
saw
him
again
not
until
forced
to
do
so
by
the
pleas
of
the
Wizarding
world
neither
Dumbledore
nor
Grindelwald
ever
seems
to
have
referred
to
this
brief
boyhood
friendship
in
later
life
however
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
Dumbledore
delayed
for
some
five
years
of
turmoil
fatalities
and
disappearances
his
attack
upon
Gellert
Grindelwald
was
it
lingering
affection
for
the
man
or
fear
of
exposure
as
his
once
best
friend
that
caused
Dumbledore
to
hesitate
was
it
only
reluctantly
that
Dumbledore
set
out
to
capture
the
man
he
was
once
so
delighted
he
had
met
and
how
did
the
mysterious
Ariana
die
was
she
the
inadvertent
victim
of
some
Dark
rite
did
she
stumble
across
something
she
ought
not
to
have
done
as
the
two
young
men
sat
practicing
for
their
attempt
at
glory
and
domination
is
it
possible
that
Ariana
Dumbledore
was
the
first
person
to
die
for
the
greater
good
the
chapter
ended
here
and
Harry
looked
up
hermione
had
reached
the
bottom
of
the
page
before
him
she
tugged
the
book
out
of
Harrys
hands
looking
a
little
alarmed
by
his
expression
and
closed
it
without
looking
at
it
as
though
hiding
something
indecent
harry
but
he
shook
his
head
some
inner
certainty
had
crashed
down
inside
him
it
was
exactly
as
he
had
felt
after
Ron
left
he
had
trusted
Dumbledore
believed
him
the
embodiment
of
goodness
and
wisdom
all
was
ashes
How
much
more
could
he
lose
ron
Dumbledore
the
phoenix
wand
harry
she
seemed
to
have
heard
his
thoughts
listen
to
me
it
it
doesn't
make
a
very
nice
reading
yeah
you
could
say
that
but
don't
forget
Harry
this
is
Rita
Skeeter
writing
you
did
read
that
letter
to
Grindelwald
didn't
you
yes
I
I
did
she
hesitated
looking
upset
cradling
her
tea
in
her
cold
hands
i
think
that's
the
worst
bit
i
know
Bathilda
thought
it
was
all
just
talk
but
For
the
Greater
Good
became
grindelwald's
slogan
his
justification
for
all
the
atrocities
he
committed
later
and
from
that
it
looks
like
Dumbledore
gave
him
the
idea
they
say
For
the
Greater
Good
was
even
carved
over
the
entrance
to
Nurmengard
what's
Nurmengard
the
prison
Grindelwald
had
built
to
hold
his
opponents
he
ended
up
in
there
himself
once
Dumbledore
had
caught
him
anyway
it's
its
an
awful
thought
that
dumbledore's
ideas
helped
Grindelwald
rise
to
power
but
on
the
other
hand
even
Rita
can't
pretend
that
they
knew
each
other
for
more
than
a
few
months
one
summer
when
they
were
both
really
young
and
i
thought
you'd
say
that
said
Harry
he
did
not
want
to
let
his
anger
spill
out
at
her
but
it
was
hard
to
keep
his
voice
steady
i
thought
you'd
say
They
were
young
they
were
the
same
age
as
we
are
now
and
here
we
are
risking
our
lives
to
fight
the
Dark
Arts
and
there
he
was
in
a
huddle
with
his
new
best
friend
plotting
their
rise
to
power
over
the
Muggles
his
temper
would
not
remain
in
check
much
longer
He
stood
up
and
walked
around
trying
to
work
some
of
it
off
i'm
not
trying
to
defend
what
Dumbledore
wrote
said
Hermione
all
that
right
to
rule
rubbish
it's
Magic
Is
Might
all
over
again
but
Harry
his
mother
had
just
died
he
was
stuck
alone
in
the
house
alone
he
wasn't
alone
he
had
his
brother
and
sister
for
company
his
Squib
sister
he
was
keeping
locked
up
i
don't
believe
it
said
Hermione
she
stood
up
too
whatever
was
wrong
with
that
girl
I
don't
think
she
was
a
Squib
the
Dumbledore
we
knew
would
never
ever
have
allowed
the
Dumbledore
we
thought
we
knew
didn't
want
to
conquer
Muggles
by
force
harry
shouted
his
voice
echoing
across
the
empty
hilltop
and
several
blackbirds
rose
into
the
air
squawking
and
spiraling
against
the
pearly
sky
he
changed
Harry
he
changed
it's
as
simple
as
that
maybe
he
did
believe
these
things
when
he
was
seventeen
but
the
whole
of
the
rest
of
his
life
was
devoted
to
fighting
the
Dark
Arts
dumbledore
was
the
one
who
stopped
Grindelwald
the
one
who
always
voted
for
Muggle
protection
and
Muggle
born
rights
who
fought
You-Know-Who
from
the
start
and
who
died
trying
to
bring
him
down
rita's
book
lay
on
the
ground
between
them
so
that
the
face
of
Albus
Dumbledore
smiled
dolefully
at
both
harry
i'm
sorry
but
I
think
the
real
reason
you're
so
angry
is
that
Dumbledore
never
told
you
any
of
this
himself
maybe
I
am
harry
bellowed
and
he
flung
his
arms
over
his
head
hardly
knowing
whether
he
was
trying
to
hold
in
his
anger
or
protect
himself
from
the
weight
of
his
own
disillusionment
look
what
he
asked
from
me
Hermione
risk
your
life
Harry
and
again
and
again
and
don't
expect
me
to
explain
everything
just
trust
me
blindly
trust
that
I
know
what
i'm
doing
trust
me
even
though
I
don't
trust
you
never
the
whole
truth
never
his
voice
cracked
with
the
strain
and
they
stood
looking
at
each
other
in
the
whiteness
and
emptiness
and
Harry
felt
they
were
as
insignificant
as
insects
beneath
that
wide
sky
he
loved
you
Hermione
whispered
i
know
he
loved
you
harry
dropped
his
arms
i
don't
know
who
he
loved
Hermione
but
it
was
never
me
this
isn't
love
the
mess
he's
left
me
in
he
shared
a
damn
sight
more
of
what
he
was
really
thinking
with
Gellert
Grindelwald
than
he
ever
shared
with
me
harry
picked
up
hermione's
wand
which
he
had
dropped
in
the
snow
and
sat
back
down
in
the
entrance
of
the
tent
thanks
for
the
tea
i'll
finish
the
watch
you
get
back
in
the
warm
she
hesitated
but
recognized
the
dismissal
she
picked
up
the
book
and
then
walked
back
past
him
into
the
tent
but
as
she
did
so
she
brushed
the
top
of
his
head
lightly
with
her
hand
he
closed
his
eyes
at
her
touch
and
hated
himself
for
wishing
that
what
she
said
was
true
that
Dumbledore
had
really
cared
chapter
Nineteen
the
Silver
Doe
it
was
snowing
by
the
time
Hermione
took
over
the
watch
at
midnight
harry's
dreams
were
confused
and
disturbing
Nagini
wove
in
and
out
of
them
first
through
a
wreath
of
Christmas
roses
he
woke
repeatedly
panicky
convinced
that
somebody
had
called
out
to
him
in
the
distance
imagining
that
the
wind
whipping
around
the
tent
was
footsteps
or
voices
finally
he
got
up
in
the
darkness
and
joined
Hermione
who
was
huddled
in
the
entrance
to
the
tent
reading
A
History
of
Magic
by
the
light
of
her
wand
the
snow
was
falling
thickly
and
she
greeted
with
relief
his
suggestion
of
packing
up
early
and
moving
on
we'll
somewhere
more
sheltered
she
agreed
shivering
as
she
pulled
on
a
sweatshirt
over
her
pajamas
i
kept
thinking
I
could
hear
people
moving
outside
i
even
though
I
saw
somebody
one
or
twice
harry
paused
in
the
act
of
pulling
on
a
jumper
and
glanced
at
the
silent
motionless
Sneakoscope
on
the
table
i'm
sure
I
imagined
it
said
Hermione
looking
nervous
the
snow
the
dark
it
plays
tricks
on
your
eyes
but
perhaps
we
ought
to
Disapparate
under
the
Invisibility
Cloak
just
in
case
half
an
hour
later
with
the
tent
packed
Harry
wearing
the
Horcrux
and
Hermione
clutching
the
beaded
bag
they
Disapparated
the
usual
tightness
engulfed
them
harry's
feet
parted
company
with
the
snowy
ground
then
slammed
hard
onto
what
felt
like
frozen
earth
covered
in
leaves
where
are
we
he
asked
peering
around
at
the
fresh
mass
of
trees
as
Hermione
opened
the
beaded
bag
and
began
tugging
out
the
tent
poles
the
Forest
of
Dean
she
said
I
came
camping
here
once
with
my
mum
and
dad
here
too
snow
lay
on
the
trees
all
around
and
it
was
bitterly
cold
but
they
were
at
least
protected
from
the
wind
they
spent
most
of
the
day
inside
the
tent
huddled
for
warmth
around
the
useful
bright
blue
flames
that
Hermione
was
adept
at
producing
and
which
could
be
scooped
up
and
carried
in
a
jar
harry
felt
as
though
he
was
recuperating
from
some
brief
but
severe
an
impression
reinforced
by
hermione's
solicitousness
that
afternoon
fresh
flakes
drifted
down
upon
them
so
that
even
their
sheltered
clearing
had
a
fresh
dusting
of
powdery
snow
after
two
nights
of
little
sleep
harry's
senses
seemed
more
alert
than
usual
their
escape
from
godric's
Hollow
had
been
so
narrow
that
Voldemort
seemed
somehow
closer
than
before
more
threatening
as
darkness
drove
in
again
Harry
refused
hermione's
offer
to
keep
watch
and
told
her
to
go
to
bed
harry
moved
an
old
cushion
into
the
tent
mouth
and
sat
down
wearing
all
the
sweaters
he
owned
but
even
so
still
shivery
the
darkness
deepened
with
the
passing
hours
until
it
was
virtually
impenetrable
he
was
on
the
point
of
taking
out
the
marauder's
Map
so
as
to
watch
ginny's
dot
for
a
while
before
he
remembered
that
it
was
the
Christmas
holidays
and
that
she
would
be
back
at
the
Burrow
every
tiny
movement
seemed
magnified
in
the
vastness
of
the
forest
harry
knew
that
it
must
be
full
of
living
creatures
but
he
wished
they
would
all
remain
still
and
silent
so
that
he
could
separate
their
innocent
scurryings
and
prowlings
from
noises
that
might
proclaim
other
sinister
movements
he
remembered
the
sound
of
a
cloak
slithering
over
dead
leaves
many
years
ago
and
at
once
thought
he
heard
it
again
before
mentally
shaking
himself
their
protective
enchantments
had
worked
for
weeks
why
should
they
break
now
and
yet
he
could
no
throw
off
the
feeling
that
something
was
different
tonight
several
times
he
jerked
upright
his
neck
aching
because
he
had
fallen
asleep
slumped
at
an
awkward
angle
against
the
side
of
the
tent
the
night
reached
such
a
depth
of
velvety
blackness
that
he
might
have
been
suspended
in
limbo
between
Disapparation
and
Apparation
he
had
just
held
a
hand
in
front
of
his
face
to
see
whether
he
could
make
out
his
fingers
when
it
happened
a
bright
silver
light
appeared
right
ahead
of
him
moving
through
the
trees
whatever
the
source
it
was
moving
soundlessly
the
light
seemed
simply
to
drift
toward
him
he
jumped
to
his
feet
his
voice
frozen
in
his
throat
and
raised
hermione's
wand
he
screwed
up
his
eyes
as
the
light
became
blinding
the
trees
in
front
of
it
pitch
black
in
silhouette
and
still
the
thing
came
closer
and
then
the
source
of
the
light
stepped
out
from
behind
an
oak
it
was
a
silver
white
doe
moon-bright
and
dazzling
picking
her
way
over
the
ground
still
silent
and
leaving
no
hoofprints
in
the
fine
powdering
of
snow
she
stepped
toward
him
her
beautiful
head
with
its
wide
long-lashed
eyes
held
high
harry
stared
at
the
creature
filled
with
wonder
not
at
her
strangeness
but
her
inexplicable
familiarity
he
felt
that
he
had
been
waiting
for
her
to
come
but
that
he
had
forgotten
until
this
moment
that
they
had
arranged
to
meet
his
impulse
to
shout
for
Hermione
which
had
been
so
strong
a
moment
ago
had
gone
he
knew
he
would
have
staked
his
life
on
it
that
she
had
come
for
him
and
him
alone
they
gazed
at
each
other
for
several
long
moments
and
then
she
turned
and
walked
away
no
he
said
and
his
voice
was
cracked
with
lack
of
use
come
back
she
continued
to
step
deliberately
through
the
trees
and
soon
he
brightness
was
striped
by
their
thick
black
trunks
for
one
trembling
second
he
hesitated
caution
murmured
it
could
be
a
trick
a
lure
a
trap
but
instinct
overwhelming
instinct
told
him
that
this
was
not
Dark
Magic
he
set
off
in
pursuit
snow
crunched
beneath
his
feet
but
the
doe
made
no
noise
as
she
passed
through
the
trees
for
she
was
nothing
but
light
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
forest
she
led
him
and
Harry
walked
quickly
sure
that
when
she
stopped
she
would
allow
him
to
approach
her
properly
and
then
she
would
speak
and
the
voice
would
tell
him
what
he
needed
to
know
at
last
she
came
to
a
halt
she
turned
her
beautiful
head
toward
him
once
more
and
he
broke
into
a
run
a
question
burning
in
him
but
as
he
opened
his
lips
to
ask
it
she
vanished
though
the
darkness
had
swallowed
her
whole
her
burnished
image
was
still
imprinted
on
his
retinas
it
obscured
his
vision
brightening
when
he
lowered
his
eyelids
disorienting
him
now
fear
came
Her
presence
had
meant
safety
lumos
he
whispered
and
the
wand-tip
ignited
the
imprint
of
the
doe
faded
away
with
every
blink
of
his
eyes
as
he
stood
there
listening
to
the
sounds
of
the
forest
to
distant
crackles
of
twigs
soft
swishes
of
snow
was
he
about
to
be
attacked
had
she
enticed
him
into
an
ambush
was
he
imagining
that
somebody
stood
beyond
the
reach
of
the
wandlight
watching
him
he
held
the
wand
higher
nobody
ran
out
at
him
no
flash
of
green
light
burst
from
behind
a
tree
why
then
had
she
led
him
to
this
spot
something
gleamed
in
the
light
of
the
wand
and
Harry
spun
about
but
all
that
was
there
was
a
small
frozen
pool
its
black
cracked
surface
glittering
as
he
raised
his
wand
higher
to
examine
it
he
moved
forward
rather
cautiously
and
looked
down
the
ice
reflected
his
distorted
shadow
and
the
beam
of
wandlight
but
deep
below
the
thick
misty
gray
carapace
something
else
glinted
a
great
silver
cross
his
heart
skipped
into
his
mouth
He
dropped
to
his
knees
at
the
pool's
edge
and
angled
the
wand
so
as
to
flood
the
bottom
of
the
pool
with
as
much
light
as
possible
glint
of
deep
red
it
was
a
sword
with
glittering
rubies
in
its
hilt
the
sword
of
Gryffindor
was
lying
at
the
bottom
of
the
forest
pool
barely
breathing
he
stared
down
at
it
how
was
this
possible
how
could
it
have
come
to
be
lying
in
a
forest
pool
this
close
to
the
place
where
they
were
camping
had
some
unknown
magic
drawn
Hermione
to
this
spot
or
was
the
doe
which
he
had
taken
to
be
a
Patronus
some
kind
of
guardian
of
the
pool
or
had
the
sword
been
put
into
the
pool
after
they
had
arrived
precisely
because
they
were
here
in
which
case
where
was
the
person
who
wanted
to
pass
it
to
Harry
again
he
directed
the
wand
at
the
surrounding
trees
and
bushes
searching
for
a
human
outline
for
the
glint
of
an
eye
but
he
could
not
see
anyone
there
all
the
same
a
little
more
fear
leavened
his
exhilaration
as
he
returned
his
attention
to
the
sword
reposing
upon
the
bottom
of
the
frozen
pool
he
pointed
the
wand
at
the
silvery
shape
and
murmured
Accio
Sword
it
did
not
stir
he
had
not
expected
it
to
if
it
had
been
that
easy
the
sword
would
have
lain
on
the
ground
for
him
to
pick
up
not
in
the
depths
of
a
frozen
pool
he
set
off
around
the
circle
of
ice
thinking
hard
about
the
last
time
the
sword
had
delivered
itself
to
him
he
had
been
in
terrible
danger
then
and
had
asked
for
help
help
he
murmured
but
the
sword
remained
upon
the
pool
bottom
indifferent
motionless
what
was
it
Harry
asked
himself
walking
again
that
Dumbledore
had
told
him
the
last
time
he
had
retrieved
the
sword
only
a
true
Gryffindor
could
have
pulled
that
out
of
the
hat
and
what
were
the
qualities
that
defined
a
Gryffindor
a
small
voice
inside
harry's
head
answered
him
Their
daring
nerve
and
chivalry
set
Gryffindor
apart
harry
stopped
walking
and
let
out
a
long
sigh
his
smoky
breath
dispersing
rapidly
upon
the
frozen
air
he
knew
what
he
had
to
do
if
he
was
honest
with
himself
he
had
thought
it
might
come
to
this
from
the
moment
he
had
spotted
the
sword
through
the
ice
he
glanced
around
at
the
surrounding
trees
again
but
was
convinced
now
that
nobody
was
going
to
attack
him
they
had
had
their
chance
as
he
walked
alone
through
the
forest
had
had
plenty
of
opportunity
as
he
examined
the
pool
the
only
reason
to
delay
at
this
point
was
because
the
immediate
prospect
was
so
deeply
uninviting
with
fumbling
fingers
Harry
started
to
remove
his
many
layers
of
clothing
where
chivalry
entered
into
this
he
thought
ruefully
he
was
not
entirely
sure
unless
it
counted
as
chivalrous
that
he
was
not
calling
for
Hermione
to
do
it
in
his
stead
an
owl
hooted
somewhere
as
he
stripped
off
and
he
thought
with
a
pang
of
Hedwig
he
was
shivering
now
his
teeth
chattering
horribly
and
yet
he
continued
to
strip
off
until
at
last
he
stood
there
in
his
underwear
barefooted
in
the
snow
he
placed
the
pouch
containing
his
wand
his
mother's
letter
the
shard
of
sirius's
mirror
and
the
old
Snitch
on
top
of
his
clothes
then
he
pointed
hermione's
wand
at
the
ice
diffindo
it
cracked
with
a
sound
like
a
bullet
in
the
silence
the
surface
of
the
pool
broke
and
chunks
of
dark
ice
rocked
on
the
ruffled
water
as
far
as
Harry
could
judge
it
was
not
deep
but
to
retrieve
the
sword
he
would
have
to
submerge
himself
completely
contemplating
the
task
ahead
would
not
make
it
easier
or
the
water
warmer
he
stepped
to
the
pool's
edge
and
placed
hermione's
wand
on
the
ground
still
lit
then
trying
not
to
imagine
how
much
colder
he
was
about
to
become
or
how
violently
he
would
soon
be
shivering
he
jumped
every
pore
of
his
body
screamed
in
protest
the
very
air
in
his
lungs
seemed
to
freeze
solid
as
he
was
submerged
to
his
shoulders
in
the
frozen
water
he
could
hardly
breathe
trembling
so
violently
the
water
lapped
over
the
edges
of
the
pool
he
felt
for
the
blade
with
his
numb
feet
he
only
wanted
to
dive
once
harry
put
off
the
moment
of
total
submersion
from
second
to
second
gasping
and
shaking
until
he
told
himself
that
it
must
be
done
gathered
all
his
courage
and
dived
the
cold
was
agony
It
attacked
him
like
fire
his
brain
itself
seemed
to
have
frozen
as
he
pushed
through
the
dark
water
to
the
bottom
and
reached
out
groping
for
the
sword
his
fingers
closed
around
the
hilt
he
pulled
it
upward
then
something
closed
tight
around
his
neck
he
thought
of
water
weeds
though
nothing
had
brushed
him
as
he
dived
and
raised
his
hand
to
free
himself
it
was
not
weed
The
chain
of
the
Horcrux
had
tightened
and
was
slowly
constricting
his
windpipe
harry
kicked
out
wildly
trying
to
push
himself
back
to
the
surface
but
merely
propelled
himself
into
the
rocky
side
of
the
pool
thrashing
suffocating
he
scrabbled
at
the
strangling
chain
his
frozen
fingers
unable
to
loosen
it
and
now
little
lights
were
popping
inside
his
head
and
he
was
going
to
drown
there
was
nothing
left
nothing
he
could
do
and
the
arms
that
closed
around
his
chest
were
surely
death's
choking
and
retching
soaking
and
colder
than
he
had
ever
been
in
his
life
he
came
to
facedown
in
the
snow
somewhere
close
by
another
person
was
panting
and
coughing
and
staggering
around
as
she
had
come
when
the
snake
attacked
yet
it
did
not
sound
like
her
not
with
those
deep
coughs
no
judging
by
the
weight
of
the
footsteps
harry
had
no
strength
to
lift
his
head
and
see
his
savior's
identity
all
he
could
do
was
raise
a
shaking
hand
to
his
throat
and
feel
the
place
where
the
locket
had
cut
tightly
into
his
flesh
it
was
gone
someone
had
cut
him
free
then
a
panting
voice
spoke
from
over
his
head
are
you
mental
nothing
but
the
shock
of
hearing
that
voice
could
have
given
Harry
the
strength
to
get
up
shivering
violently
he
staggered
to
his
feet
there
before
him
stood
Ron
fully
dressed
but
drenched
to
the
skin
his
hair
plastered
to
his
face
the
sword
of
Gryffindor
in
one
hand
and
the
Horcrux
dangling
from
its
broken
chain
in
the
other
why
the
hell
panted
Ron
holding
up
the
Horcrux
which
swung
backward
and
forward
on
its
shortened
chain
in
some
parody
of
hypnosis
didn't
you
take
the
thing
off
before
you
dived
harry
could
not
answer
the
silver
doe
was
nothing
nothing
compared
with
ron's
reappearance
he
could
not
believe
it
shuddering
with
cold
he
caught
up
the
pile
of
clothes
still
lying
at
the
water's
edge
and
began
to
pull
them
on
as
he
dragged
sweater
after
sweater
over
his
head
Harry
stared
at
Ron
half
expecting
him
to
have
disappeared
every
time
he
lost
sight
of
him
and
yet
he
had
to
be
real
He
had
just
dived
into
the
pool
he
had
saved
harry's
life
it
was
y-you
harry
said
at
last
his
teeth
chattering
his
voice
weaker
than
usual
due
to
his
near-strangulation
well
yeah
said
Ron
looking
slightly
confused
y-you
cast
that
doe
what
no
of
course
not
i
thought
it
was
you
doing
it
my
Patronus
is
a
stag
oh
yeah
i
thought
it
looked
different
no
antlers
harry
put
hagrid's
pouch
back
around
his
neck
pulled
on
a
final
sweater
stooped
to
pick
up
hermione's
wand
and
faced
Ron
again
how
come
you're
here
apparently
Ron
had
hoped
that
this
point
would
come
up
later
if
at
all
well
i've
you
know
i've
come
back
if
He
cleared
his
throat
you
know
you
still
want
me
there
was
a
pause
in
which
the
subject
of
ron's
departure
seemed
to
rise
like
a
wall
between
them
yet
he
was
here
he
had
returned
he
had
just
saved
harry's
life
ron
looked
down
at
his
hands
he
seemed
momentarily
surprised
to
see
the
things
he
was
holding
oh
yeah
I
got
it
out
he
said
rather
unnecessarily
holding
up
the
sword
for
harry's
inspection
that's
why
you
jumped
in
right
yeah
said
Harry
but
I
don't
understand
how
did
you
get
here
how
did
you
find
us
long
story
said
Ron
i've
been
looking
for
you
for
hours
it's
a
big
forest
isn't
it
and
I
was
just
thinking
i'd
have
to
go
kip
under
a
tree
and
wait
for
morning
when
I
saw
that
dear
coming
and
you
following
you
didn't
see
anyone
else
no
said
Ron
i
but
he
hesitated
glancing
at
two
trees
growing
close
together
some
yards
away
i
did
think
I
saw
something
move
over
there
but
I
was
running
to
the
pool
at
the
time
because
you'd
gone
in
and
you
hadn't
come
up
so
I
wasn't
going
to
make
a
detour
to
hey
harry
was
already
hurrying
to
the
place
that
Ron
had
indicated
the
two
oaks
grew
close
together
there
was
a
gap
of
only
a
few
inches
between
the
trunks
at
eye
level
an
ideal
place
to
see
but
not
be
seen
the
ground
around
the
roots
however
was
free
of
snow
and
Harry
could
see
no
sign
of
footprints
he
walked
back
to
where
Ron
stood
waiting
still
holding
the
sword
and
the
Horcrux
anything
there
ron
asked
no
said
Harry
so
how
did
the
sword
get
in
that
pool
whoever
cast
the
Patronus
must
have
put
it
there
they
both
looked
at
the
ornate
silver
sword
its
rubied
hilt
glinting
a
little
in
the
light
from
hermione's
wand
you
reckon
this
is
the
real
one
asked
Ron
one
way
to
find
out
isn't
there
said
Harry
the
Horcrux
was
still
swinging
from
ron's
hand
the
locket
was
twitching
slightly
harry
knew
that
the
thing
inside
it
was
agitated
again
it
had
sensed
the
presence
of
the
sword
and
had
tried
to
kill
Harry
rather
than
let
him
possess
it
now
was
not
the
time
for
long
discussions
now
was
the
moment
to
destroy
once
and
for
all
harry
looked
around
holding
hermione's
wand
high
and
saw
the
place
a
flattish
rock
lying
in
the
shadow
of
a
sycamore
tree
come
here
he
said
and
he
led
the
way
brushed
snow
from
the
rock's
surface
and
held
out
his
hand
for
the
Horcrux
when
Ron
offered
the
sword
however
Harry
shook
his
head
no
you
should
do
it
me
said
Ron
looking
shocked
why
because
you
got
the
sword
out
of
the
pool
i
think
it's
supposed
to
be
you
he
was
not
being
kind
or
generous
as
certainly
as
he
had
known
that
the
doe
was
benign
he
knew
that
Ron
had
to
be
the
one
to
wield
the
sword
dumbledore
had
at
least
taught
Harry
something
about
certain
kinds
of
magic
of
the
incalculable
power
of
certain
acts
i'm
going
to
open
it
said
Harry
and
you
will
stab
it
straightaway
okay
because
whatever's
in
there
will
put
up
a
fight
the
bit
of
Riddle
in
the
Diary
tried
to
kill
me
how
are
you
going
to
open
it
asked
Ron
he
looked
terrified
i'm
going
to
ask
it
to
open
using
Parseltongue
said
Harry
the
answer
came
so
readily
to
his
lips
that
thought
that
he
had
always
known
it
deep
down
Perhaps
it
had
taken
his
recent
encounter
with
Nagini
to
make
him
realize
it
he
looked
at
the
serpentine
S
inlaid
with
glittering
green
stones
It
was
easy
to
visualize
it
as
a
miniscule
snake
curled
upon
the
cold
rock
no
said
Ron
don't
open
it
i'm
serious
why
not
asked
Harry
let's
get
rid
of
the
damn
thing
it's
been
months
i
can't
Harry
i'm
serious
you
do
it
but
why
because
that
thing's
bad
for
me
said
Ron
backing
away
from
the
locket
on
the
rock
i
can't
handle
it
i'm
not
making
excuses
for
what
I
was
like
but
it
affects
me
worse
than
it
affects
you
and
Hermione
it
made
me
think
stuff
stuff
that
I
was
thinking
anyway
but
it
made
everything
worse
i
can't
explain
it
and
then
i'd
take
it
off
and
i'd
get
my
head
straight
again
and
then
i'd
have
to
put
the
effing
thing
back
on
I
can't
do
it
Harry
he
had
backed
away
the
sword
dragging
at
his
side
shaking
his
head
you
can
do
it
said
Harry
you
can
you've
just
got
the
sword
I
know
it's
supposed
to
be
you
who
uses
it
please
just
get
rid
of
it
Ron
the
sound
of
his
name
seemed
to
act
like
a
stimulant
ron
swallowed
then
still
breathing
hard
through
his
long
nose
moved
back
toward
the
rock
tell
me
when
he
croaked
on
three
said
Harry
looking
back
down
at
the
locket
and
narrowing
his
eyes
concentrating
on
the
letter
S
imagining
a
serpent
while
the
contents
of
the
locket
rattled
like
a
trapped
cockroach
it
would
have
been
easy
to
pity
it
except
that
the
cut
around
harry's
neck
still
burned
one
two
three
open
the
last
word
came
as
a
hiss
and
a
snarl
and
the
golden
doors
of
the
locket
swung
wide
open
with
a
little
click
behind
both
of
the
glass
windows
within
blinked
a
living
eye
dark
and
handsome
as
Tom
riddle's
eyes
had
been
before
he
turned
them
scarlet
and
slit-pupiled
stab
said
Harry
holding
the
locket
steady
on
the
rock
ron
raised
the
sword
in
his
shaking
hands
The
point
dangled
over
the
frantically
swiveling
eyes
and
Harry
gripped
the
locket
tightly
bracing
himself
already
imagining
blood
pouring
from
the
empty
windows
then
a
voice
hissed
from
out
the
Horcrux
i
have
seen
your
heart
and
it
is
mine
don't
listen
to
it
harry
said
harshly
stab
it
i
have
seen
your
dreams
Ronald
Weasley
and
I
have
seen
your
fears
all
you
desire
is
possible
but
all
that
you
dread
is
also
possible
stab
shouted
Harry
his
voice
echoed
off
the
surrounding
trees
the
sword
point
trembled
and
Ron
gazed
down
into
riddle's
eyes
least
loved
always
by
the
mother
who
craved
a
daughter
least
loved
now
by
the
girl
who
prefers
your
friend
second
best
always
eternally
overshadowed
ron
stab
it
now
harry
bellowed
He
could
feel
the
locket
quivering
in
the
grip
and
was
scared
of
what
was
coming
ron
raised
the
sword
still
higher
and
as
he
did
so
riddle's
eyes
gleamed
scarlet
out
of
the
locket's
two
windows
out
of
the
eyes
there
bloomed
like
two
grotesque
bubbles
the
heads
of
Harry
and
Hermione
weirdly
distorted
ron
yelled
in
shock
and
backed
away
as
the
figures
blossomed
out
of
the
locket
first
chests
then
waists
then
legs
until
they
stood
in
the
locket
side
by
side
like
trees
with
a
common
root
swaying
over
Ron
and
the
real
Harry
who
had
snatched
his
fingers
away
from
the
locket
as
it
burned
suddenly
white-hot
ron
he
shouted
but
the
Riddle-Harry
was
now
speaking
with
voldemort's
voice
and
Ron
was
gazing
mesmerized
into
its
face
why
return
we
were
better
without
you
happier
without
you
glad
of
your
absence
we
laughed
at
your
stupidity
your
cowardice
your
presumption
presumption
echoed
the
Riddle-Hermione
who
was
more
beautiful
and
yet
more
terrible
than
the
real
Hermione
She
swayed
cackling
before
Ron
who
looked
horrified
yet
transfixed
the
sword
hanging
pointlessly
at
his
side
who
could
look
at
you
who
would
ever
look
at
you
beside
Harry
Potter
what
have
you
ever
done
compared
with
the
Chosen
One
what
are
you
compared
with
the
Boy
Who
Lived
ron
stab
it
stab
it
harry
yelled
but
Ron
did
not
move
his
eyes
were
wide
and
the
Riddle-Harry
and
the
Riddle-Hermione
were
reflected
in
them
their
hair
swirling
like
flames
their
eyes
shining
red
their
voices
lifted
in
an
evil
duet
your
mother
confessed
sneered
Riddle-Harry
while
Riddle-Hermione
jeered
that
she
would
have
preferred
me
as
a
son
would
be
glad
to
exchange
who
wouldn't
prefer
him
what
woman
would
take
you
you
are
nothing
nothing
nothing
to
him
crooned
Riddle-Hermione
and
she
stretched
like
a
snake
and
entwined
herself
around
Riddle-Harry
wrapping
him
in
a
close
embrace
Their
lips
met
on
the
ground
in
front
of
them
ron's
face
filled
with
anguish
he
raised
the
sword
high
his
arms
shaking
do
it
Ron
harry
yelled
ron
looked
toward
him
and
Harry
thought
he
saw
a
trace
of
scarlet
in
his
eyes
ron
the
sword
flashed
plunged
Harry
threw
himself
out
of
the
way
there
as
a
clang
of
metal
and
a
long
drawn-out
scream
harry
whirled
around
slipping
in
the
snow
wand
held
ready
to
defend
himself
but
there
was
nothing
to
fight
the
monstrous
versions
of
himself
and
Hermione
were
gone
There
was
only
Ron
standing
there
with
the
sword
held
slackly
in
his
hand
looking
down
at
the
shattered
remains
of
the
locket
on
the
flat
rock
slowly
Harry
walked
back
to
him
hardly
knowing
what
to
say
or
do
ron
was
breathing
heavily
His
eyes
were
no
longer
red
at
all
but
their
normal
blue
they
were
also
wet
harry
stooped
pretending
he
had
not
seen
and
picked
up
the
broken
Horcrux
ron
had
pierced
the
glass
in
both
windows
riddle's
eyes
were
gone
and
the
stained
silk
lining
of
the
locket
was
smoking
slightly
the
thing
that
had
lived
in
the
Horcrux
had
vanished
torturing
Ron
had
been
its
final
act
the
sword
clanged
as
Ron
dropped
it
he
had
sunk
to
his
knees
his
head
in
his
arms
he
was
shaking
but
not
Harry
realized
from
cold
harry
crammed
the
broken
locket
into
his
pocket
knelt
down
beside
Ron
and
placed
a
hand
cautiously
on
his
shoulder
he
took
it
as
a
good
sign
that
Ron
did
not
throw
it
off
after
you
left
he
said
in
a
low
voice
grateful
for
the
fact
that
ron's
face
was
hidden
she
cried
for
a
week
probably
longer
only
she
didn't
want
me
to
see
there
were
loads
of
nights
when
we
never
even
spoke
to
each
other
with
you
gone
he
could
not
finish
it
was
now
that
Ron
was
here
again
that
Harry
fully
realized
how
much
his
absence
had
cost
them
she's
like
my
sister
he
went
on
i
love
her
like
a
sister
and
I
reckon
that
she
feels
the
same
way
about
me
it's
always
been
like
that
i
thought
you
knew
ron
did
not
respond
but
turned
his
face
away
from
Harry
and
wiped
his
nose
noisily
on
his
sleeve
harry
got
to
his
feet
again
and
walked
to
where
ron's
enormous
rucksack
lay
yards
away
discarded
as
Ron
had
run
toward
the
pool
to
save
Harry
from
drowning
he
hoisted
it
onto
his
own
back
and
walked
back
to
Ron
who
clambered
to
his
feet
as
Harry
approached
eyes
bloodshot
but
otherwise
composed
i'm
sorry
he
said
in
a
thick
voice
i'm
sorry
I
left
i
know
I
was
a
a
he
looked
around
at
the
darkness
as
if
hoping
a
bad
enough
word
would
swoop
down
upon
him
and
claim
him
you've
sort
of
made
up
for
it
tonight
said
Harry
getting
the
sword
finishing
off
the
Horcrux
saving
my
life
that
makes
me
sound
a
lot
cooler
than
I
was
Ron
mumbled
stuff
like
that
always
sounds
cooler
than
it
really
was
said
Harry
i've
been
trying
to
tell
you
that
for
years
simultaneously
they
walked
forward
and
hugged
Harry
gripping
the
still-sopping
back
of
ron's
jacket
and
now
said
Harry
as
they
broke
apart
all
we've
got
to
do
is
find
that
tent
again
but
it
was
not
difficult
though
the
walk
through
the
dark
forest
with
the
doe
had
seemed
lengthy
with
Ron
by
his
side
the
journey
back
seemed
to
take
a
surprisingly
short
time
harry
could
not
wait
to
wake
Hermione
and
it
was
with
quickening
excitement
that
he
entered
the
tent
Ron
lagging
a
little
behind
him
it
was
gloriously
warm
after
the
pool
and
the
forest
the
only
illumination
the
bluebell
flames
still
shimmering
in
a
bowl
on
the
floor
hermione
was
fast
asleep
curled
up
under
her
blankets
and
did
not
move
until
Harry
had
said
her
name
several
times
hermione
she
stirred
then
sat
up
quickly
pushing
her
hair
out
of
her
face
what's
wrong
harry
are
you
all
right
it's
okay
everything's
fine
more
than
fine
i'm
great
there's
someone
here
what
do
you
mean
who
she
saw
Ron
who
stood
there
holding
the
sword
and
dripping
onto
the
threadbare
carpet
harry
backed
into
a
shadowy
corner
slipped
off
ron's
rucksack
and
attempted
to
blend
in
with
the
canvas
hermione
slid
out
of
her
bunk
and
moved
like
a
sleepwalker
toward
Ron
her
eyes
upon
his
pale
face
she
stopped
right
in
front
of
him
her
lips
slightly
parted
her
eyes
wide
ron
gave
a
weak
hopeful
smile
and
half
raised
his
arms
hermione
launched
herself
forward
and
started
punching
every
inch
of
him
that
she
could
reach
ouch
ow
gerroff
what
the
hermione
ow
you
complete
arse
Ronald
Weasley
she
punctuated
every
word
with
a
blow
Ron
backed
away
shielding
his
head
as
Hermione
advanced
you
crawl
back
here
after
weeks
and
weeks
oh
where's
my
wand
she
looked
as
though
ready
to
wrestle
it
out
of
harry's
hands
and
he
reacted
instinctively
protego
the
invisible
shield
erupted
between
Ron
and
Hermione
the
force
of
it
knocked
her
backward
onto
the
floor
spitting
hair
out
of
her
mouth
she
lept
up
again
hermione
said
Harry
calm
i
will
not
calm
down
she
screamed
never
before
had
he
seen
her
lose
control
like
this
she
looked
quite
demented
give
me
back
my
wand
give
it
back
to
me
hermione
will
you
please
don't
you
tell
me
what
do
Harry
Potter
she
screeched
don't
you
dare
give
it
back
now
and
you
she
was
pointing
at
Ron
in
dire
accusation
It
was
like
a
malediction
and
Harry
could
not
blame
Ron
for
retreating
several
steps
i
cam
running
after
you
i
called
you
i
begged
you
to
come
back
I
know
Ron
said
Hermione
i'm
sorry
i'm
really
oh
you're
sorry
she
laughed
a
high-pitched
out-of-control
sound
Ron
looked
at
Harry
for
help
but
Harry
merely
grimaced
his
helplessness
you
came
back
after
weeks
weeks
and
you
think
it's
all
going
to
be
all
right
if
you
just
say
sorry
well
what
else
can
I
say
ron
shouted
and
Harry
was
glad
that
Ron
was
fighting
back
oh
I
don't
know
yelled
Hermione
with
awful
sarcasm
rack
your
brains
Ron
that
should
only
take
a
couple
of
seconds
hermione
interjected
Harry
who
considered
this
a
low
blow
he
just
saved
my
i
don't
care
she
screamed
i
don't
care
what
he's
done
weeks
and
weeks
we
could
have
been
dead
for
all
he
knew
i
knew
you
weren't
dead
bellowed
Ron
drowning
her
voice
for
the
first
time
and
approaching
as
close
as
he
could
with
the
Shield
Charm
between
them
harry's
all
over
the
Prophet
all
over
the
radio
they're
looking
for
you
everywhere
all
these
rumors
and
mental
stories
I
knew
i'd
hear
straight
off
if
you
were
dead
you
don't
know
what
it's
been
like
what
it's
been
like
for
you
her
voice
was
not
so
shrill
only
bats
would
be
able
to
hear
it
soon
but
she
had
reached
a
level
of
indignation
that
rendered
her
temporarily
speechless
and
Ron
seized
his
opportunity
i
wanted
to
come
back
the
minute
i'd
Disapparated
but
I
walked
straight
into
a
gang
of
Snatchers
Hermione
and
I
couldn't
go
anywhere
a
gang
of
what
asked
Harry
as
Hermione
threw
herself
down
into
a
chair
with
her
arms
and
legs
crossed
so
tightly
it
seemed
unlikely
that
she
would
unravel
them
for
several
years
snatchers
said
Ron
they're
everywhere
gangs
trying
to
earn
gold
by
rounding
up
muggle-borns
and
blood
traitors
there's
a
reward
from
the
Ministry
for
everyone
captured
i
was
on
my
own
and
I
look
like
I
might
be
school
age
they
got
really
excited
thought
I
was
a
muggle-born
in
hiding
i
had
to
talk
fast
to
get
out
of
being
dragged
to
the
Ministry
what
did
you
say
to
them
told
them
I
was
Stan
Shunpike
first
person
I
could
think
of
and
they
believed
that
they
weren't
the
brightest
one
of
them
was
definitely
part
troll
the
smell
of
him
ron
glanced
at
Hermione
clearly
hopeful
she
might
soften
at
this
small
instance
of
humor
but
her
expression
remained
stony
above
her
tightly
knotted
limbs
anyway
they
had
a
row
about
whether
I
was
Stan
or
not
it
was
a
bit
pathetic
to
be
honest
but
there
were
still
five
of
them
and
only
one
of
me
and
they'd
taken
my
wand
then
two
of
them
got
into
a
fight
and
while
the
others
were
distracted
I
managed
to
hit
the
one
holding
me
in
the
stomach
grabbed
his
wand
Disarmed
the
bloke
holding
mine
and
Disapparated
i
didn't
do
it
so
well
splinched
myself
again
Ron
held
up
his
right
hand
to
show
two
missing
fingernails
Hermione
raised
her
eyebrows
coldly
and
I
came
out
miles
from
where
you
were
by
the
time
I
got
back
to
that
bit
of
riverbank
where
we'd
been
you
were
gone
gosh
what
a
gripping
story
Hermione
said
in
the
lofty
voice
she
adopted
when
wishing
to
wound
you
must
have
been
simply
terrified
meanwhile
we
went
to
godric's
Hollow
and
let's
think
what
happened
there
Harry
oh
yes
you-know-who's
snake
turned
up
it
nearly
killed
both
of
us
and
then
You-Know-Who
himself
arrived
and
missed
us
by
about
a
second
what
ron
said
gaping
from
her
to
Harry
but
Hermione
ignored
him
imagine
losing
fingernails
Harry
that
really
puts
our
sufferings
into
perspective
doesn't
it
hermione
said
Harry
quietly
Ron
just
saved
my
life
she
appeared
not
to
have
heard
him
one
thing
I
would
like
to
know
though
she
said
fixing
her
eyes
on
a
spot
a
foot
over
ron's
head
how
exactly
did
you
find
us
tonight
that's
important
once
we
know
we'll
be
able
to
make
sure
we're
not
visited
by
anyone
else
we
don't
want
to
see
ron
glared
at
her
then
pulled
a
small
silver
object
from
his
jeans
pocket
this
she
had
to
look
at
Ron
to
see
what
he
was
showing
them
the
Deluminator
she
asked
so
surprised
she
forgot
to
look
cold
and
fierce
it
doesn't
just
turn
the
lights
on
and
off
said
Ron
i
don't
know
how
it
works
or
why
it
happened
then
and
not
any
other
time
because
i've
been
wanting
to
come
back
ever
since
I
left
but
I
was
listening
to
the
radio
really
early
on
Christmas
morning
and
I
heard
i
heard
you
he
was
looking
at
Hermione
you
heard
me
on
the
radio
she
asked
incredulously
no
I
heard
you
coming
out
of
my
pocket
your
voice
he
held
up
the
Deluminator
again
came
out
of
this
and
what
exactly
did
I
say
asked
Hermione
her
tone
somewhere
between
skepticism
and
curiosity
my
name
ron
and
you
said
something
about
a
wand
hermione
turned
a
fiery
shade
of
scarlet
harry
remembered
it
had
been
the
first
time
won's
name
had
been
said
aloud
by
either
of
them
since
the
day
he
had
left
Hermione
had
mentioned
it
when
talking
about
repairing
harry's
wand
so
I
took
it
out
Ron
went
on
looking
at
the
Deluminator
and
it
didn't
seem
different
or
anything
but
I
was
sure
i'd
heard
you
so
I
clicked
it
and
the
light
went
out
in
my
room
but
another
light
appeared
right
outside
the
window
ron
raised
his
empty
hand
and
pointed
in
front
of
him
his
eyes
focused
on
something
neither
Harry
nor
Hermione
could
see
it
was
a
ball
of
light
kind
of
pulsing
and
bluish
like
that
light
you
get
around
a
Portkey
you
know
yeah
said
Harry
and
Hermione
together
automatically
i
knew
this
was
it
said
Ron
i
grabbed
my
stuff
and
packed
it
then
I
put
on
my
rucksack
and
went
out
into
the
garden
the
little
ball
of
light
was
hovering
there
waiting
for
me
and
when
I
came
out
it
bobbed
along
a
bit
and
I
followed
it
behind
the
shed
and
then
it
well
it
went
inside
me
sorry
said
Harry
sure
he
had
not
heard
correctly
it
sort
of
floated
toward
me
said
Ron
illustrating
the
movement
with
his
free
index
finger
right
to
my
chest
and
then
it
just
went
straight
through
it
was
here
he
touched
a
point
close
to
his
heard
I
could
feel
it
it
was
hot
and
once
it
was
inside
me
I
knew
what
I
was
supposed
to
do
i
knew
it
would
take
me
where
I
needed
to
go
so
I
Disapparated
and
came
out
on
the
side
of
a
hill
there
was
snow
everywhere
we
were
there
said
Harry
we
spent
two
nights
there
and
the
second
night
I
kept
thinking
I
could
hear
someone
moving
around
in
the
dark
and
calling
out
yeah
well
that
would've
been
me
said
Ron
your
protective
spells
work
anyway
because
I
couldn't
see
you
and
I
couldn't
hear
you
i
was
sure
you
were
around
though
so
in
the
end
I
got
in
my
sleeping
bag
and
waited
for
one
of
you
to
appear
i
thought
you'd
have
to
show
yourselves
when
you
packed
up
the
tent
no
actually
said
Hermione
we've
been
Disapparating
under
the
Invisibility
Cloak
as
an
extra
precaution
and
we
left
really
early
because
as
Harry
says
we'd
heard
somebody
blundering
around
well
I
stayed
on
that
hill
all
day
said
Ron
i
kept
hoping
you'd
appear
but
when
it
started
to
get
dark
I
knew
I
must
have
missed
you
so
I
clicked
the
Deluminator
again
the
blue
light
came
out
and
went
inside
me
and
I
Disapparated
and
arrived
here
in
these
woods
i
still
couldn't
see
you
so
I
just
had
to
hope
one
of
you
would
show
yourselves
in
the
end
and
Harry
did
well
I
saw
the
doe
first
obviously
you
saw
the
what
said
Hermione
sharply
they
explained
what
had
happened
and
as
the
story
of
the
silver
doe
and
the
sword
in
the
pool
unfolded
Hermione
frowned
form
one
to
the
other
of
them
concentrating
so
hard
she
forgot
to
keep
her
limbs
locked
together
but
it
must
have
been
a
Patronus
she
said
couldn't
you
see
who
was
casting
it
didn't
you
see
anyone
and
it
led
you
to
the
sword
i
can't
believe
this
then
what
happened
ron
explained
how
he
had
watched
Harry
jump
into
the
pool
and
had
waited
for
him
to
resurface
how
he
had
realized
that
something
was
wrong
dived
in
and
saved
Harry
then
returned
for
the
sword
he
got
as
far
as
the
opening
of
the
locket
then
hesitated
and
Harry
cut
in
and
Ron
stabbed
it
with
the
sword
and
and
it
went
just
like
that
she
whispered
well
it
it
screamed
said
Harry
with
half
a
glance
at
Ron
here
he
threw
the
locket
into
her
lap
gingerly
she
picked
it
up
and
examined
its
punctured
windows
deciding
that
it
was
at
last
safe
to
do
so
Harry
removed
the
Shield
Charm
with
a
wave
of
hermione's
wand
and
turned
to
Ron
did
you
just
say
now
that
you
got
away
from
the
snatchers
with
a
spare
wand
what
said
Ron
who
had
been
watching
Hermione
examining
the
locket
oh
oh
yeah
he
tugged
open
a
buckle
on
his
rucksack
and
pulled
a
short
dark
wand
out
of
his
pocket
here
I
figured
it's
always
handy
to
have
a
backup
you
were
right
said
Harry
holding
out
his
hand
mine's
broken
you're
kidding
ron
said
but
at
that
moment
Hermione
got
to
her
feet
and
he
looked
apprehensive
again
hermione
put
the
vanquished
Horcrux
into
the
beaded
bag
then
climbed
back
into
her
bed
and
settled
down
without
another
word
ron
passed
Harry
the
new
wand
about
the
best
you
could
hope
for
I
think
murmured
Harry
yeah
said
Ron
could've
been
worse
remember
those
birds
she
set
on
me
i
still
haven't
ruled
it
out
came
hermione's
muffled
voice
from
beneath
her
blankets
but
Harry
saw
Ron
smiling
slightly
as
he
pulled
his
maroon
pajamas
out
of
his
rucksack
chapter
Twenty
xenophilius
Lovegood
harry
had
not
expected
hermione's
anger
to
abate
over
night
and
was
therefore
unsurprised
that
she
communicated
mainly
by
dirty
looks
and
pointed
silences
the
next
morning
ron
responded
by
maintaining
an
unnaturally
somber
demeanor
in
her
presence
as
an
outward
sign
of
continuing
remorse
in
fact
when
all
three
of
them
were
together
Harry
felt
like
the
only
non-mourner
at
a
poorly
attended
funeral
during
those
few
moments
he
spent
alone
with
Harry
however
collecting
water
and
searching
the
undergrowth
for
mushrooms
ron
became
shamelessly
cheery
someone
helped
us
he
kept
saying
Someone
sent
that
doe
someone's
on
our
side
One
Horcrux
down
mate
bolstered
by
the
destruction
of
the
locket
they
set
to
debating
the
possible
locations
of
the
other
Horcruxes
and
even
though
they
had
discussed
the
matter
so
often
before
harry
felt
optimistic
certain
that
more
breakthroughs
would
succeed
the
first
hermione's
sulkiness
could
not
mar
his
buoyant
spirits
The
sudden
upswing
in
their
fortunes
the
appearance
of
the
mysterious
due
the
recovery
of
Gryffindors
sword
and
above
all
ron's
return
made
Harry
so
happy
that
it
was
quite
difficult
to
maintain
a
straight
face
late
in
the
afternoon
he
and
Ron
escaped
hermione's
baleful
presence
again
and
under
the
pretense
of
scouring
the
bare
hedges
for
nonexistent
blackberries
they
continued
their
ongoing
exchange
of
news
harry
had
finally
managed
to
tell
Ron
the
whole
story
of
his
and
hermione's
various
wanderings
right
up
to
the
full
story
of
what
had
happened
at
godric's
Hollow
Ron
was
now
filling
Harry
in
on
everything
he
had
discovered
about
the
wider
Wizarding
world
during
his
weeks
away
and
how
did
you
find
out
about
the
Taboo
he
asked
Harry
after
explaining
the
many
desperate
attempts
of
muggle-borns
to
evade
the
Ministry
the
what
you
and
Hermione
have
stopped
saying
you-know-who's
name
oh
yeah
Well
it's
just
a
bad
habit
we've
slipped
into
said
Harry
but
I
haven't
got
a
problem
calling
him
V
no
roared
Ron
causing
Harry
to
jump
into
the
hedge
and
Hermione
nose
buried
in
a
book
at
the
tent
entrance
to
scowl
over
at
them
sorry
said
Ron
wrenching
Harry
back
out
of
the
brambles
but
the
name's
been
jinxed
Harry
that's
how
they
track
people
using
his
name
breaks
protective
enchantments
it
causes
some
kind
of
magical
disturbance
it's
how
they
found
us
in
Tottenham
Court
Road
because
we
used
his
name
exactly
you've
got
to
give
them
credit
it
makes
sense
it
was
only
people
who
were
serious
about
standing
up
to
him
like
Dumbledore
who
even
dared
use
it
now
they've
put
a
Taboo
on
it
anyone
who
says
it
is
trackable
quick-and-easy
way
to
find
Order
members
they
nearly
got
Kingsley
you're
kidding
yeah
a
bunch
of
Death
Eaters
cornered
him
Bill
said
but
he
fought
his
way
out
he's
on
the
run
now
just
like
us
ron
scratched
his
chin
thoughtfully
with
the
end
of
his
wand
you
don't
reckon
Kingsley
could
have
sent
that
doe
his
Patronus
is
a
lynx
we
saw
it
at
the
wedding
remember
oh
yeah
they
moved
farther
along
the
hedge
away
from
the
tent
and
Hermione
harry
you
don't
reckon
it
could've
been
Dumbledore
dumbledore
what
ron
looked
a
little
embarrassed
but
said
in
a
low
voice
Dumbledore
the
doe
i
mean
Ron
was
watching
Harry
out
of
the
corners
of
his
eyes
he
had
the
real
sword
last
didn't
he
harry
did
not
laugh
at
Ron
because
he
understood
too
well
the
longing
behind
the
question
the
idea
that
Dumbledore
had
managed
to
come
back
to
them
that
he
was
watching
over
them
would
have
inexpressibly
comforting
he
shook
his
head
dumbledores
dead
he
said
i
saw
it
happen
I
saw
the
body
he's
definitely
gone
anyway
his
Patronus
was
a
phoenix
not
a
doe
Patronuses
can
change
though
can't
they
said
Ron
Tonkss
changed
didn't
it
yeah
but
if
Dumbledore
was
alive
why
wouldn't
he
show
himself
why
wouldn't
he
just
hand
us
the
sword
search
me
said
Ron
same
reason
he
didn't
give
it
to
you
while
he
was
alive
same
reason
he
left
you
an
old
Snitch
and
Hermione
a
book
of
kid's
stories
which
is
what
asked
Harry
turning
to
look
Ron
full
in
the
face
desperate
for
the
answer
i
dunno
said
Ron
sometimes
i've
thought
when
i've
been
a
bit
hacked
off
he
was
having
a
laugh
or
or
he
just
wanted
to
make
it
more
difficult
But
I
don't
think
so
not
anymore
he
knew
what
he
was
doing
when
he
gave
me
the
Deluminator
didn't
he
he
well
ron's
ears
turned
bright
red
and
he
became
engrossed
in
a
tuft
of
grass
at
his
feet
which
he
prodded
with
his
toe
he
must've
known
i'd
run
out
on
you
no
Harry
corrected
him
he
must've
known
you'd
always
want
to
come
back
ron
looked
grateful
but
still
awkward
partly
to
change
the
subject
Harry
said
Speaking
of
Dumbledore
have
you
heard
what
Skeeter
wrote
about
him
oh
yeah
said
Ron
at
once
people
are
talking
about
it
quite
a
lot
course
if
things
were
different
it'd
be
huge
news
Dumbledore
being
pals
with
Grindelwald
but
now
it's
just
something
to
laugh
about
for
people
who
didn't
like
Dumbledore
and
a
bit
of
a
slap
in
the
face
for
everyone
who
thought
he
was
such
a
good
bloke
i
don't
know
that
it's
such
a
big
deal
though
he
was
really
young
when
they
Our
age
said
Harry
just
as
he
had
retorted
to
Hermione
and
something
in
his
face
seemed
to
decide
Ron
against
pursuing
the
subject
a
large
spider
sat
in
the
middle
of
a
frosted
web
in
the
brambles
harry
took
aim
at
it
with
the
wand
Ron
had
given
him
the
previous
night
which
hermione
had
since
condescended
to
examine
and
had
decided
was
made
of
blackthorn
Engorgio
The
spider
gave
a
little
shiver
bouncing
slightly
in
the
web
harry
tried
again
this
time
the
spider
grew
slightly
larger
stop
that
said
Ron
sharply
i'm
sorry
I
said
Dumbledore
was
young
okay
harry
had
forgotten
ron's
hatred
of
spiders
sorry
Reducio
The
spider
did
not
shrink
harry
looked
down
at
the
blackthorn
wand
every
minor
spell
he
had
cast
with
it
so
far
that
day
had
seemed
less
powerful
than
those
he
had
produced
with
his
phoenix
wand
the
new
one
felt
intrusively
unfamiliar
like
having
somebody
else's
hand
sewn
to
the
end
of
his
arm
you
just
need
to
practice
said
Hermione
who
had
approached
them
noiselessly
from
behind
and
had
stood
watching
anxiously
as
Harry
tried
to
enlarge
and
reduce
the
spider
its
all
a
matter
of
confidence
Harry
he
knew
why
she
wanted
it
to
be
all
right
She
still
felt
guilty
about
breaking
his
wand
he
bit
back
the
retort
that
sprung
to
his
lips
that
she
could
take
the
blackthorn
wand
if
she
thought
it
made
no
difference
and
he
would
have
hers
instead
keen
for
them
all
to
be
friends
again
however
he
agreed
but
when
Ron
gave
Hermione
a
tentative
smile
she
stalked
off
and
vanished
behind
her
book
once
more
all
three
of
them
returned
to
the
tent
when
darkness
fell
and
Harry
took
first
watch
sitting
in
the
entrance
he
tried
to
make
the
blackthorn
wand
levitate
small
stones
at
his
feet
but
his
magic
still
seemed
clumsier
and
less
powerful
than
it
had
done
before
hermione
was
lying
on
her
bunk
reading
while
Ron
after
many
nervous
glances
up
at
her
had
taken
a
small
wooden
wireless
out
of
his
rucksack
and
started
to
try
to
tune
it
there's
this
one
program
he
told
Harry
in
a
low
voice
that
tells
the
news
like
it
really
is
all
the
others
are
on
you-know-who's
side
and
are
following
the
Ministry
line
but
this
one
you
wait
till
you
hear
it
it's
great
only
they
can't
do
it
every
night
they
have
to
keep
changing
locations
in
case
they're
raided
and
you
need
a
password
to
tune
in
trouble
is
I
missed
the
last
one
he
drummed
lightly
on
the
top
of
the
radio
with
his
wand
muttering
random
words
under
his
breath
he
threw
Hermione
many
covert
glances
plainly
fearing
an
angry
outburst
but
for
all
the
notice
she
took
of
him
he
might
not
have
been
there
for
ten
minutes
or
so
Ron
tapped
and
muttered
Hermione
turned
the
pages
of
her
book
and
Harry
continued
to
practice
with
the
blackthorn
wand
finally
Hermione
climbed
down
from
her
bunk
ron
ceased
his
tapping
at
once
if
it's
annoying
you
i'll
stop
he
told
Hermione
nervously
hermione
did
not
deign
to
respond
but
approached
Harry
we
need
to
talk
she
said
he
looked
at
the
book
still
clutched
in
her
hand
it
was
The
Life
and
Lies
of
Albus
Dumbledore
What
he
said
apprehensively
it
flew
through
his
mind
that
there
was
a
chapter
on
him
in
there
he
was
not
sure
he
felt
up
to
hearing
rita's
version
of
his
relationship
with
Dumbledore
hermione's
answer
however
was
completely
unexpected
i
want
to
go
and
see
Xenophilius
Lovegood
he
stared
at
her
sorry
xenophilius
Lovegood
Lunas
father
i
want
to
go
and
talk
to
him
er
why
she
took
a
deep
breath
as
though
bracing
herself
and
said
Its
that
mark
the
mark
in
Beedle
the
Bard
look
at
this
she
thrust
The
Life
and
Lies
of
Albus
Dumbledore
under
Harrys
unwilling
eyes
and
saw
a
photograph
of
the
original
letter
that
Dumbledore
had
written
Grindelwald
with
Dumbledores
familiar
thin
slanting
handwriting
he
hated
seeing
absolute
proof
that
Dumbledore
really
had
written
those
words
that
they
had
not
been
Ritas
invention
the
signature
said
Hermione
look
at
the
signature
Harry
he
obeyed
for
a
moment
he
had
no
idea
what
she
was
talking
about
but
looking
more
closely
with
the
aid
of
his
lit
wand
he
saw
that
Dumbledore
had
replaced
the
A
of
Albus
with
a
tiny
version
of
the
same
triangular
mark
inscribed
upon
The
Tales
of
Beedle
the
Bard
er
what
are
you
said
Ron
tentatively
but
Hermione
quelled
him
with
a
look
and
turned
back
to
Harry
it
keeps
cropping
up
doesnt
it
she
said
i
know
Viktor
said
it
was
Grindelwalds
mark
but
it
was
definitely
on
that
old
grave
in
Godrics
Hollow
and
the
dates
on
the
headstone
were
long
before
Grindelwald
came
along
and
now
this
well
we
cant
ask
Dumbledore
or
Grindelwald
what
it
means
I
dont
even
know
whether
Grindelwalds
still
alive
but
we
can
ask
mr.
Lovegood
he
was
wearing
the
symbol
at
the
wedding
im
sure
this
is
important
Harry
harry
did
not
answer
immediately
he
looked
into
her
intense
eager
face
and
then
out
into
the
surrounding
darkness
thinking
after
a
long
pause
he
said
Hermione
we
dont
need
another
Godrics
Hollow
we
talked
ourselves
into
going
there
and
but
it
keeps
appearing
Harry
dumbledore
left
me
The
Tales
of
Beedle
the
Bard
how
do
you
know
were
not
supposed
to
find
out
about
the
sign
here
we
go
again
harry
felt
slightly
exasperated
we
keep
trying
to
convince
ourselves
Dumbledore
left
us
secret
signs
and
clues
the
Deluminator
turned
out
to
be
pretty
useful
piped
up
Ron
i
think
Hermiones
right
I
think
we
ought
to
go
and
see
Lovegood
harry
threw
him
a
dark
look
he
was
quite
sure
that
Rons
support
of
Hermione
had
little
to
do
with
a
desire
to
know
the
meaning
of
the
triangular
rune
it
wont
be
like
Godrics
Hollow
Ron
added
Lovegoods
on
your
side
Harry
The
Quibblers
been
for
you
all
along
it
keeps
telling
everyone
theyve
got
to
help
you
im
sure
this
is
important
said
Hermione
earnestly
but
dont
you
think
if
it
was
Dumbledore
would
have
told
me
about
it
before
he
died
maybe
maybe
its
something
you
need
to
find
out
for
yourself
said
Hermione
with
a
faint
air
of
clutching
at
straws
yeah
said
Ron
sycophantically
that
makes
sense
no
it
doesnt
snapped
Hermione
but
I
still
think
we
ought
to
talk
to
mr.
Lovegood
a
symbol
that
links
Dumbledore
Grindelwald
and
Godrics
Hollow
harry
Im
sure
we
ought
to
know
about
this
i
think
we
should
vote
on
it
said
Ron
those
in
favor
of
going
to
see
Love
good
his
hand
flew
into
the
air
before
Hermiones
her
lips
quivered
suspiciously
as
she
raised
her
own
outvoted
Harry
sorry
said
Ron
clapping
him
on
the
back
fine
said
Harry
half
amused
half
irritated
only
once
weve
seen
Lovegood
lets
try
and
look
for
some
more
Horcruxes
shall
we
where
do
the
Lovegoods
live
anyway
do
either
of
you
know
yeah
theyre
not
far
from
my
place
said
Ron
i
dunno
exactly
where
but
Mum
and
Dad
always
point
toward
the
hills
whenever
they
mention
them
shouldnt
be
hard
to
find
when
Hermione
had
returned
to
her
bunk
Harry
lowered
his
voice
you
only
agreed
to
try
and
get
back
in
her
good
books
alls
fair
in
love
and
war
said
Ron
brightly
and
this
is
a
bit
of
both
cheer
up
its
the
Christmas
holidays
Lunall
be
home
they
had
an
excellent
view
of
the
village
of
Ottery
st.
Catchopole
from
the
breezy
hillside
to
which
they
Disapparated
next
morning
from
their
high
vantage
point
the
village
looked
like
a
collection
of
toy
houses
in
the
great
slanting
shafts
of
sunlight
stretching
to
earth
in
the
breaks
between
clouds
they
stood
for
a
minute
or
two
looking
toward
the
Burrow
their
hands
shadowing
their
eyes
but
all
they
could
make
out
were
the
high
hedges
and
trees
of
the
orchard
which
afforded
the
crooked
little
house
protection
from
Muggle
eyes
its
weird
being
this
near
but
not
going
to
visit
said
Ron
well
its
not
like
you
havent
just
seen
them
you
were
there
for
Christmas
said
Hermione
coldly
i
wasnt
at
the
Burrow
said
Ron
with
an
incredulous
laugh
do
you
think
I
was
going
to
go
back
there
and
tell
them
all
Id
walked
out
on
you
yeah
Fred
and
George
wouldve
been
great
about
it
and
Ginny
shed
have
been
really
understanding
but
where
have
you
been
then
asked
Hermione
surprised
bill
and
Fleurs
new
place
shell
cottage
bills
always
been
decent
to
me
he
he
wasnt
impressed
when
he
heard
what
Id
done
but
he
didnt
go
on
about
it
he
knew
I
was
really
sorry
none
of
the
rest
of
the
family
know
I
was
there
bill
told
Mum
he
and
Fleur
werent
going
home
for
Christmas
because
they
wanted
to
spend
it
alone
you
know
first
holiday
after
they
were
married
i
dont
think
Fleur
minded
you
know
how
much
she
hates
Celestina
Warbeck
ron
turned
his
back
on
the
Burrow
lets
try
up
here
he
said
leading
the
way
over
the
top
of
the
hill
they
walked
for
a
few
hours
Harry
at
Hermiones
insistence
hidden
beneath
the
Invisibility
Cloak
the
cluster
of
low
hills
appeared
to
be
uninhabited
apart
from
one
small
cottage
which
seemed
deserted
do
you
think
its
theirs
and
theyve
gone
away
for
Christmas
said
Hermione
peering
through
the
window
at
a
neat
little
kitchen
with
geraniums
on
the
windowsill
ron
snorted
listen
Ive
got
a
feeling
youd
be
able
to
tell
who
lived
there
if
you
looked
through
the
Lovegoods
window
lets
try
the
next
lot
of
hills
so
they
Disapparated
a
few
miles
farther
north
aha
shouted
Ron
as
the
wind
whipped
their
hair
and
clothes
ron
was
pointing
upward
toward
the
top
of
the
hill
on
which
they
had
appeared
where
a
most
strange-looking
house
rose
vertically
against
the
sky
a
great
black
cylinder
with
a
ghostly
moon
hanging
behind
it
in
the
afternoon
sky
thats
got
to
be
Lunas
house
who
else
would
live
in
a
place
like
that
it
looks
like
a
giant
rook
its
nothing
like
a
bird
said
Hermione
frowning
at
the
tower
i
was
talking
about
a
chess
rook
said
Ron
a
castle
to
you
rons
legs
were
the
longest
and
he
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
first
when
Harry
and
Hermione
caught
up
with
him
panting
and
clutching
stitches
in
their
sides
they
found
him
grinning
broadly
its
theirs
said
Ron
look
three
hand-painted
signs
had
been
tacked
to
a
broke-down
gate
the
first
read
the
quibbler
editor
X
lovegood
the
second
pick
your
own
mistletoe
the
third
keep
off
the
dirigible
plums
the
gate
creaked
as
they
opened
it
the
zigzagging
path
leading
to
the
front
door
was
overgrown
with
a
variety
of
odd
plants
including
a
bush
covered
in
orange
radishlike
fruit
Luna
sometimes
wore
as
earrings
harry
thought
he
recognized
a
Snargaluff
and
gave
the
wizened
stump
a
wide
berth
two
aged
crab
apple
trees
bent
with
the
wind
stripped
of
leaves
but
still
heavy
with
berry-sized
red
fruits
and
bushy
crowns
of
white
beaded
mistletoe
stood
sentinel
on
either
side
of
the
front
door
a
little
owl
with
a
slightly
flattened
hawklike
head
peered
down
at
them
from
one
of
the
branches
youd
better
take
off
the
Invisibility
Cloak
Harry
said
Hermione
its
you
mr.
Lovegood
wants
to
help
not
us
he
did
as
she
suggested
handing
her
the
Cloak
to
stow
in
the
beaded
bag
she
then
rapped
three
times
on
the
thick
black
door
which
was
studded
with
iron
nails
and
bore
a
knocker
shaped
like
an
eagle
barely
ten
seconds
passed
then
the
door
was
flung
open
and
there
stood
Xenophilius
Lovegood
barefoot
and
wearing
what
appeared
to
be
a
stained
nightshirt
his
long
white
candyfloss
hair
was
dirty
and
unkempt
xenophilius
had
been
positively
dapper
at
Bill
and
fleur's
wedding
by
comparison
what
what
is
it
who
are
you
what
do
you
want
he
cried
in
a
high-pitched
querulous
voice
looking
first
at
Hermione
then
at
Ron
and
finally
at
Harry
upon
which
his
mouth
fell
open
in
a
perfect
comical
O
hello
mr.
Lovegood
said
Harry
holding
out
his
hand
i'm
Harry
Harry
Potter
xenophilius
did
not
take
harry's
hand
although
the
eye
that
was
not
pointing
inward
at
his
nose
slid
straight
to
the
scar
on
harry's
forehead
would
it
be
okay
if
we
came
in
asked
Harry
there's
something
we'd
like
to
ask
you
i'm
not
sure
that's
advisable
whispered
Xenophilius
He
swallowed
and
cast
a
quick
look
around
the
garden
rather
a
shock
my
word
i'm
afraid
I
don't
really
think
I
ought
to
It
wont
take
long
said
Harry
slightly
disappointed
by
this
less-than-warm
welcome
i
oh
all
right
then
come
in
quickly
Quickly
they
were
barely
over
the
threshold
when
Xenophilius
slammed
the
door
shut
behind
them
They
were
standing
in
the
most
peculiar
kitchen
Harry
had
ever
seen
the
room
was
perfectly
circular
so
that
he
felt
like
being
inside
a
giant
pepper
pot
everything
was
curved
to
fit
the
walls
the
stove
the
sink
and
the
cupboards
and
all
of
it
had
been
painted
with
flowers
insects
and
birds
in
bright
primary
colors
harry
thought
he
recognized
luna's
styles
the
effect
in
such
and
enclosed
space
was
slightly
overwhelming
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
a
wrought-iron
spiral
staircase
ld
to
the
upper
levels
there
was
a
great
deal
of
clattering
and
banging
coming
from
overhead
Harry
wondered
what
Luna
could
be
doing
you'd
better
come
up
said
Xenophilius
still
looking
extremely
uncomfortable
and
he
led
the
way
the
room
above
seemed
to
be
a
combination
of
living
room
and
workplace
and
as
such
was
even
more
cluttered
than
the
kitchen
though
much
smaller
and
entirely
round
the
room
somewhat
resembled
the
Room
of
Requirement
on
the
unforgettable
occasion
that
it
had
transformed
itself
into
a
gigantic
labyrinth
comprised
of
centuries
of
hidden
objects
there
were
piles
upon
piles
of
books
and
papers
on
every
surface
delicately
made
models
of
creatures
Harry
did
not
recognize
all
flapping
wings
or
snapping
jaws
hung
from
the
ceiling
luna
was
not
there
The
thing
that
was
making
such
a
racket
was
a
wooden
object
covered
in
magically
turning
cogs
and
wheels
It
looked
like
the
bizarre
offspring
of
a
workbench
and
a
set
of
shelves
but
after
a
moment
Harry
deduced
that
it
was
an
old-fashioned
printing
press
due
to
the
fact
that
it
was
churning
out
Quibblers
excuse
me
said
Xenophilius
and
he
strode
over
to
the
machine
seized
grubbily
tablecloth
from
beneath
an
immense
number
of
books
and
papers
which
all
tumbled
onto
the
floor
and
threw
it
over
the
press
somewhat
muffling
the
loud
bangs
and
clatters
he
then
faced
Harry
why
have
you
come
here
before
Harry
could
speak
however
Hermione
let
out
a
small
cry
of
shock
mr.
Lovegood
what's
that
see
was
pointing
at
an
enormous
gray
spiral
horn
not
unlike
that
of
a
unicorn
which
had
been
mounted
on
the
wall
protruding
several
feet
into
the
room
it
is
the
horn
of
a
Crumple-Horned
Snorkack
said
Xenophilius
no
it
isn't
said
Hermione
hermione
muttered
Harry
embarrassed
now's
not
the
moment
But
Harry
it's
an
Erumpent
horn
it's
a
Class
B
Tradeable
Material
and
it's
an
extraordinary
dangerous
thing
to
have
in
a
house
how'd
you
know
it's
an
Erumpent
horn
asked
Ron
edging
away
from
the
horn
as
fast
as
he
could
given
the
extreme
clutter
of
the
room
there's
a
description
in
Fantastic
Beasts
and
Where
to
Find
Them
mr.
Lovegood
you
need
to
get
rid
of
it
straightaway
don't
you
know
it
can
explode
at
the
slightest
touch
the
Crumple
Horned
Snorkack
said
Xenophilius
very
clearly
a
mulish
look
upon
his
face
is
a
shy
and
highly
magical
creature
and
it's
horn
mr.
Lovegood
i
recognize
the
grooved
markings
around
the
base
that's
an
Erumpent
horn
and
it's
incredibly
dangerous
I
don't
know
where
you
got
it
I
bought
it
said
Xenophilius
dogmatically
two
weeks
ago
from
a
delightful
young
wizard
who
knew
my
interest
in
the
exquisite
Snorkack
a
Christmas
surprise
for
my
Luna
now
he
said
turning
to
Harry
why
exactly
have
you
come
here
mr.
Potter
we
need
some
help
said
Harry
before
Hermione
could
start
again
ah
said
Xenophilius
Help
Hmm
his
good
eye
moved
again
to
harry's
scar
he
seemed
simultaneously
terrified
and
mesmerized
yes
the
thing
is
helping
Harry
Potter
rather
dangerous
aren't
you
the
one
who
keeps
telling
everyone
it's
their
first
duty
to
help
Harry
said
Ron
in
that
magazine
of
yours
xenophilius
glanced
behind
him
at
the
concealed
printing
press
still
banging
and
clattering
beneath
the
tablecloth
er
yes
I
have
expressed
that
view
however
that's
for
everyone
else
to
do
not
you
personally
said
Ron
xenophilius
did
not
answer
he
kept
swallowing
his
eyes
darting
between
the
three
of
them
harry
had
the
impression
that
he
was
undergoing
some
painful
internal
struggle
where's
Luna
asked
Hermione
let's
see
what
she
thinks
xenophilius
gulped
he
seemed
to
be
steeling
himself
finally
he
said
in
a
shaky
voice
difficult
to
hear
over
the
noise
of
the
printing
press
Luna
is
down
at
the
stream
fishing
for
Freshwater
Plimpies
she
she
will
like
to
see
you
i'll
go
and
call
her
and
then
yes
very
well
i
shall
try
to
help
you
he
disappeared
down
the
spiral
staircase
and
they
heard
the
front
open
and
close
they
looked
at
each
other
cowardly
old
wart
said
Ron
luna's
got
ten
times
his
guts
he's
probably
worried
about
what'll
happen
to
them
if
the
Death
Eaters
find
out
I
was
here
said
Harry
well
I
agree
with
Ron
said
Hermione
Awful
old
hypocrite
telling
everyone
else
to
help
you
and
trying
to
worm
our
of
it
himself
and
for
heaven's
sake
keep
away
from
that
horn
harry
crossed
to
the
window
on
the
far
side
of
the
room
he
could
see
a
stream
a
thin
glittering
ribbon
lying
far
below
them
at
the
base
of
the
hill
they
were
very
high
up
a
bird
fluttered
past
the
window
as
he
stared
in
the
direction
of
the
Burrow
now
invisible
beyond
another
line
of
hills
ginny
was
over
there
somewhere
they
were
closer
to
each
other
today
than
they
had
been
since
Bill
and
fleur's
wedding
but
she
could
have
no
idea
he
was
gazing
toward
her
now
thinking
of
her
he
suppose
he
ought
to
be
glad
of
it
anyone
he
came
into
contact
with
was
in
danger
xenophilius's
attitude
proved
that
he
turned
away
from
the
windows
and
his
gaze
fell
upon
another
peculiar
object
standing
upon
the
cluttered
curved
slide
board
a
stone
but
of
a
beautiful
but
austere-looking
witch
wearing
a
most
bizarre-looking
headdress
two
objects
that
resembled
golden
ear
trumpets
curved
out
from
the
sides
a
tiny
pair
of
glittering
blue
wing
was
stuck
to
a
leather
strap
that
ran
over
the
top
of
her
head
while
one
of
the
orange
radishes
had
been
stuck
to
a
second
strap
around
her
forehead
look
at
this
said
Harry
fetching
said
Ron
surprised
he
didn't
hear
that
to
the
wedding
they
heard
the
front
door
close
and
a
moment
later
Xenophilius
climbed
back
up
the
spiral
staircase
into
the
room
his
thin
legs
now
encase
in
Wellington
boots
bearing
a
tray
of
ill-assorted
teacups
and
a
steaming
teapot
ah
you
have
spotted
my
pet
invention
he
said
shoving
the
tray
into
hermione's
arms
and
joining
Harry
at
the
statue's
side
modeled
fittingly
enough
upon
the
head
of
the
beautiful
Rowens
Ravenclaw
Wit
beyond
measure
is
a
man's
greatest
treasure
he
indicated
the
objects
like
ear
trumpets
these
are
the
Wrackpurt
siphons
to
remove
all
sources
of
distraction
from
the
thinker's
immediate
area
here
he
pointed
out
the
tiny
wings
a
billywig
propeller
to
induce
an
elevated
frame
of
mind
finally
he
pointed
to
the
orange
radish
the
dirigible
Plum
so
as
to
enhance
the
ability
to
accept
the
extraordinary
xenophilius
strode
back
to
the
tea
tray
which
Hermione
had
managed
to
balance
precariously
on
one
of
the
cluttered
side
tables
may
I
offer
you
all
an
infusion
of
Gurdyroots
said
Xenophilius
we
make
it
ourselves
as
he
started
to
pour
out
the
drink
which
was
as
deeply
purple
as
beetroot
juice
he
added
Luna
is
down
beyond
Bottom
Bridge
she
is
most
excited
that
you
are
here
She
ought
not
to
be
too
long
she
has
caught
nearly
enough
Plumpies
to
make
soup
for
all
of
us
do
sit
down
and
help
yourselves
to
sugar
now
he
remove
a
tottering
pile
of
papers
from
an
armchair
and
sat
down
his
Wellingtoned
legs
crossed
how
may
I
help
you
mr.
Potter
well
said
Harry
glancing
at
Hermione
who
nodded
encouragingly
it's
about
that
symbol
you
were
wearing
around
your
neck
at
Bill
and
fleur's
wedding
mr.
Lovegood
we
wondered
what
it
meant
xenophilius
raised
his
eyebrows
are
you
referring
to
the
sign
of
the
Deathly
Hallows
chapter
Twenty-One
the
Tale
of
the
Three
Brothers
harry
turned
to
look
at
Ron
and
Hermione
neither
of
them
seemed
to
have
understood
what
Xenophilius
had
said
either
the
Deathly
Hallows
that's
right
said
Xenophilius
you
haven't
heard
of
them
i'm
not
surprised
very
very
few
wizards
believe
witness
that
knuckle-headed
young
man
at
your
brother's
wedding
he
nodded
at
Ron
who
attacked
me
for
sporting
the
symbol
of
a
well-known
Dark
wizard
such
ignorance
there
is
nothing
Dark
about
the
Hallows
at
least
not
in
that
crude
sense
one
simply
uses
the
symbol
to
reveal
oneself
to
other
believers
in
the
hope
that
they
might
help
one
with
the
Quest
he
stirred
several
lumps
of
sugar
into
his
Gurdyroot
infusion
and
drank
some
i'm
sorry
said
Harry
I
still
don't
really
understand
to
be
polite
he
took
a
sip
from
his
cup
too
and
almost
gagged
The
stuff
was
quite
disgusting
as
though
someone
had
liquidized
bogey-flavored
Every
Flavor
Beans
well
you
see
believers
seek
the
Deathly
Hallows
said
Xenophilius
smacking
his
lips
in
apparent
appreciation
of
the
Gurdyroot
infusion
but
what
are
the
Deathly
Hallows
asked
Hermione
xenophilius
set
aside
his
empty
teacup
i
assume
that
you
are
familiar
with
The
Tale
of
the
Three
Brothers
harry
said
No
but
Ron
and
Hermione
both
said
Yes
xenophilius
nodded
gravely
well
well
mr.
Potter
the
whole
thing
starts
with
The
Tale
of
the
Three
Brothers
i
have
a
copy
somewhere
he
glanced
vaguely
around
the
room
at
the
piles
of
parchment
and
books
but
Hermione
said
i've
got
a
copy
mr.
Lovegood
i've
got
it
right
here
and
she
pulled
out
The
Tales
of
Beedle
the
Bard
from
the
small
beaded
bag
the
original
inquired
Xenophilius
sharply
and
when
she
nodded
he
said
Well
then
why
don't
you
read
it
out
aloud
much
the
best
way
to
make
sure
we
all
understand
er
all
right
said
Hermione
nervously
she
opened
the
book
and
Harry
saw
that
the
symbol
they
were
investigating
headed
the
top
of
the
page
as
she
gave
a
little
cough
and
began
to
read
there
were
once
three
brothers
who
were
traveling
along
a
lonely
winding
road
at
twilight
midnight
our
mum
always
told
us
said
Ron
who
had
stretched
out
arms
behind
his
head
to
listen
hermione
shot
him
a
look
of
annoyance
sorry
I
just
think
it's
a
bit
spookier
if
it's
midnight
said
Ron
yeah
because
we
really
need
a
bit
more
fear
in
our
lives
said
Harry
before
he
could
stop
himself
xenophilius
did
not
seem
to
be
paying
much
attention
but
was
staring
out
of
the
window
at
the
sky
go
on
Hermione
in
time
the
brothers
reached
a
river
too
deep
to
wade
through
and
too
dangerous
to
swim
across
however
these
brothers
were
learned
in
the
magical
arts
and
so
they
simply
waved
their
wands
and
made
a
bridge
appear
across
the
treacherous
water
they
were
halfway
across
it
when
they
found
their
path
blocked
by
a
hooded
figure
and
Death
spoke
to
them
sorry
interjected
Harry
but
Death
spoke
to
them
it's
a
fairy
tale
Harry
right
sorry
go
on
and
Death
spoke
to
them
he
was
angry
that
he
had
been
cheated
out
of
the
three
new
victims
for
travelers
usually
drowned
in
the
river
but
Death
was
cunning
he
pretended
to
congratulate
the
three
brothers
upon
their
magic
and
said
that
each
had
earned
a
prize
for
having
been
clever
enough
to
evade
him
so
the
oldest
brother
who
was
a
combative
man
asked
for
a
wand
more
powerful
than
any
in
existence
a
wand
that
must
always
win
duels
for
its
owner
a
wand
worthy
of
a
wizard
who
had
conquered
Death
so
Death
crossed
to
an
elder
tree
on
the
banks
of
the
river
fashioned
a
wand
from
a
branch
that
hung
there
and
gave
it
to
the
oldest
brother
then
the
second
brother
who
was
an
arrogant
man
decided
that
he
wanted
to
humiliate
Death
still
further
and
asked
for
the
power
to
recall
others
from
Death
so
death
picked
up
a
stone
from
the
riverbank
and
gave
it
to
the
second
brother
and
told
him
that
the
stone
would
have
the
power
to
bring
back
the
dead
and
then
Death
asked
the
third
and
youngest
brother
what
he
would
like
the
youngest
brother
was
the
humblest
and
also
the
wisest
of
the
brothers
and
he
did
not
trust
Death
so
he
asked
for
something
that
would
enable
him
to
go
forth
from
that
place
without
being
followed
by
Death
and
Death
most
unwillingly
handed
over
his
own
Cloak
of
Invisibility
death's
got
an
Invisibility
Cloak
harry
interrupted
again
so
he
can
sneak
up
on
people
said
Ron
sometimes
he
gets
bored
of
running
at
them
flapping
his
arms
and
shrieking
sorry
Hermione
then
Death
stood
aside
and
allowed
the
three
brothers
to
continue
on
their
way
and
they
did
so
talking
with
wonder
of
the
adventure
they
had
had
and
admiring
death's
gifts
in
due
course
the
brothers
separated
each
for
his
own
destination
the
first
brother
traveled
on
for
a
week
more
and
reaching
a
distant
village
sought
out
a
fellow
wizard
with
whom
he
had
a
quarrel
naturally
with
the
Elder
Wand
as
his
weapon
he
could
not
fail
to
win
the
duel
that
followed
leaving
his
enemy
dead
upon
the
floor
the
oldest
brother
proceeded
to
an
inn
where
he
boasted
loudly
of
the
powerful
wand
he
had
snatched
from
Death
himself
and
of
how
it
made
him
invincible
that
very
night
another
wizard
crept
upon
the
oldest
brother
as
he
lay
wine-sodden
upon
his
bed
the
thief
took
the
wand
and
for
good
measure
slit
the
oldest
brother's
throat
and
so
Death
took
the
first
brother
for
his
own
meanwhile
the
second
brother
journeyed
to
his
own
home
where
he
lived
alone
here
he
took
out
the
stone
that
had
the
power
to
recall
the
dead
and
turned
it
thrice
in
his
hand
to
his
amazement
and
his
delight
the
figure
of
the
girl
he
had
once
hoped
to
marry
before
her
untimely
death
appeared
at
once
before
him
yet
she
was
sad
and
cold
separated
from
him
as
by
a
veil
though
she
had
returned
to
the
mortal
world
she
did
not
truly
belong
there
and
suffered
finally
the
second
brother
driven
mad
with
hopeless
longing
killed
himself
so
as
to
truly
join
her
and
so
Death
took
the
second
brother
from
his
own
but
though
Death
searched
for
the
third
brother
for
many
years
he
was
never
able
to
find
him
it
was
only
when
he
had
attained
a
great
age
that
the
youngest
brother
finally
took
off
the
Cloak
of
Invisibility
and
gave
it
to
his
son
and
the
he
greeted
Death
as
an
old
friend
and
went
with
him
gladly
and
equals
they
departed
this
life
hermione
closed
the
book
it
was
a
moment
or
two
before
Xenophilius
seemed
to
realize
that
she
had
stopped
reading
then
he
withdrew
his
gaze
from
the
window
and
said
Well
there
you
are
sorry
said
Hermione
sounding
confused
those
are
the
Deathly
Hallows
said
Xenophilius
he
picked
up
a
quill
from
a
packed
table
at
his
elbow
and
pulled
a
torn
piece
of
parchment
from
between
more
books
the
Elder
Wand
he
said
and
drew
a
straight
vertical
line
upon
the
parchment
the
Resurrection
Stone
he
said
and
added
a
circle
on
top
of
the
line
the
Cloak
of
Invisibility
he
finished
enclosing
both
line
and
circle
in
a
triangle
to
make
the
symbols
that
so
intrigued
Hermione
together
he
said
the
Deathly
Hallows
but
there's
no
mention
of
the
words
Deathly
Hallows
in
the
story
said
Hermione
well
of
course
not
said
Xenophilius
maddeningly
smug
that
is
a
children's
tale
told
to
amuse
rather
than
to
instruct
those
of
us
who
understand
these
matters
however
recognize
that
the
ancient
story
refers
to
three
objects
or
Hallows
which
if
united
will
make
the
possessor
master
of
Death
there
was
a
short
silence
in
which
Xenophilius
glanced
out
of
the
window
already
the
sun
was
low
in
the
sky
luna
ought
to
have
enough
Plimpies
soon
he
said
quietly
when
you
say
master
of
Death
said
Ron
master
said
Xenophilius
waving
an
airy
hand
conqueror
vanquisher
whichever
term
you
prefer
but
then
do
you
mean
said
Hermione
slowly
and
Harry
could
tell
that
she
was
trying
to
keep
any
trace
of
skepticism
out
of
her
voice
that
you
believe
these
objects
these
Hallows
really
exist
xenophilius
raised
his
eyebrows
again
well
of
course
but
said
Hermione
and
Harry
could
hear
her
restraint
starting
to
crack
mr.
Lovegood
how
can
you
possibly
believe
luna
has
told
me
all
about
you
young
lady
said
Xenophilius
you
are
I
gather
not
unintelligent
but
painfully
limited
narrow
close-minded
perhaps
you
ought
to
try
on
the
hat
Hermione
said
Ron
nodding
toward
the
ludicrous
headdress
his
voice
shook
with
the
strain
of
not
laughing
mr.
Lovegood
Hermione
began
again
We
all
know
that
there
are
such
things
as
Invisibility
Cloaks
they
are
rare
but
they
exist
but
ah
but
the
Third
Hallow
is
a
true
Cloak
of
Invisibility
Miss
Granger
i
mean
to
say
it
is
not
a
traveling
cloak
imbued
with
a
Disillusionment
Charm
or
carrying
a
Bedazzling
Hex
or
else
woven
from
Demiguise
hair
which
will
hide
one
initially
but
fade
with
the
years
until
it
turns
opaque
we
are
talking
about
a
cloak
that
really
and
truly
renders
the
wearer
completely
invisible
and
endures
eternally
giving
constant
and
impenetrable
concealment
no
matter
what
spells
are
cast
at
it
how
many
cloaks
have
you
ever
seen
like
that
Miss
Granger
hermione
opened
her
mouth
to
answer
then
closed
it
again
looking
more
confused
than
ever
she
Harry
and
Ron
glanced
at
one
another
and
Harry
knew
that
they
were
all
thinking
the
same
thing
it
so
happened
that
a
cloak
exactly
like
the
one
Xenophilius
had
just
described
was
in
the
room
with
them
at
that
very
moment
exactly
said
Xenophilius
as
if
he
had
defeated
them
all
in
reasoned
argument
none
of
you
have
ever
seen
such
a
thing
the
possessor
would
be
immeasurably
rich
would
he
not
he
glanced
out
of
the
window
again
the
sky
was
now
tinged
with
the
faintest
trace
of
pink
all
right
said
Hermione
disconcerted
say
the
Cloak
existed
what
about
that
stone
mr.
Lovegood
the
thing
you
call
the
Resurrection
Stone
what
of
it
well
how
can
that
be
real
prove
that
is
not
said
Xenophilius
hermione
looked
outraged
but
that's
i'm
sorry
but
that's
completely
ridiculous
how
can
I
possibly
prove
it
doesn't
exist
do
you
expect
me
to
get
hold
of
of
all
the
pebbles
in
the
world
and
test
them
i
mean
you
could
claim
that
anything's
real
if
the
only
basis
for
believing
in
it
is
that
nobody's
proved
it
doesn't
exist
yes
you
could
said
Xenophilius
i
am
glad
to
see
that
you
are
opening
your
mind
a
little
so
the
Elder
Wand
said
Harry
quickly
before
Hermione
could
retort
you
think
that
exists
too
oh
well
in
that
case
there
is
endless
evidence
said
Xenophilius
the
Elder
Wand
is
the
Hallow
that
is
most
easily
traced
because
of
the
way
in
which
it
passes
from
hand
to
hand
which
is
what
asked
Harry
which
is
that
the
possessor
of
the
wand
must
capture
it
from
its
previous
owner
if
he
is
to
be
truly
master
of
it
said
Xenophilius
surely
you
have
heard
of
the
way
the
wand
came
to
Egbert
the
Egregious
after
his
slaughter
of
Emeric
the
Evil
of
how
Godelot
died
in
his
own
cellar
after
his
son
Hereward
took
the
wand
from
him
of
the
dreadful
Loxias
who
took
the
wand
from
Baraabas
Deverill
whom
he
had
killed
the
bloody
trail
of
the
Elder
Wand
is
splattered
across
the
pages
of
Wizarding
history
harry
glanced
at
Hermione
she
was
frowning
at
Xenophilius
but
she
did
not
contradict
him
so
where
do
you
think
the
Elder
Wand
is
now
asked
Ron
alas
who
knows
said
Xenophilius
as
he
gazed
out
of
the
window
who
knows
where
the
Elder
Wand
lies
hidden
the
trail
goes
cold
with
Arcus
and
Livius
who
can
say
which
of
them
really
defeated
Loxias
and
which
took
the
wand
and
who
can
say
who
may
have
defeated
them
history
alas
does
not
tell
us
there
was
a
pause
finally
Hermione
asked
stiffly
mr.
Lovegood
does
the
Peverell
family
have
anything
to
do
with
the
Deathly
Hallows
xenophilius
looked
taken
aback
as
something
shifted
in
harry's
memory
but
he
could
not
locate
it
peverell
he
had
heard
that
name
before
but
you
have
been
misleading
me
young
woman
said
Xenophilius
now
sitting
up
much
straighter
in
his
chair
and
goggling
at
Hermione
i
thought
you
were
new
to
the
Hallows
Quest
many
of
us
Questers
believe
that
the
Peverells
have
everything
everything
to
do
with
the
Hallows
who
are
the
Peverells
asked
Ron
that
was
the
name
on
the
grave
with
the
mark
on
it
in
godric's
Hollow
said
Hermione
still
watching
Xenophilius
ignotus
Peverell
exactly
said
Xenophilius
his
forefinger
raised
pedantically
the
sign
of
the
Death
Hallows
on
ignotus's
grave
is
conclusive
proof
of
what
asked
Ron
why
that
the
three
brothers
in
the
story
were
actually
the
three
Peverell
brothers
Antioch
Cadmus
and
Ignotus
that
they
were
the
original
owners
of
the
Hallows
with
another
glance
at
the
window
he
got
to
his
feet
picked
up
the
tray
and
headed
for
the
spiral
staircase
you
will
stay
for
dinner
he
called
as
he
vanished
downstairs
again
everybody
always
requests
our
recipe
for
Freshwater
Plimply
soup
probably
to
show
the
Poisoning
Department
at
st.
mungo's
said
Ron
under
his
breath
harry
waited
until
they
could
hear
Xenophilius
moving
about
in
the
kitchen
downstairs
before
speaking
what
do
you
think
he
asked
Hermione
oh
Harry
she
said
wearily
it's
a
pile
of
utter
rubbish
this
can't
be
what
the
sign
really
means
this
must
just
be
his
weird
take
on
it
what
a
waste
of
time
i
s'pose
this
is
the
man
who
brought
us
Crumple-Horned
Snorkacks
said
Ron
you
didn't
believe
it
either
harry
asked
him
nah
that
story's
just
one
of
those
things
you
tell
kids
to
teach
them
lessons
isn't
it
don't
go
looking
for
trouble
don't
go
pick
fights
don't
go
messing
around
with
stuff
that's
best
left
alone
just
keep
your
head
down
mind
your
own
business
and
you'll
be
okay
come
to
think
of
it
Ron
added
maybe
that
story's
why
elder
wands
are
supposed
to
be
unlucky
what
are
you
talking
about
one
of
those
superstitions
isn't
it
may-born
witches
will
marry
Muggles
jinx
by
twilight
undone
by
midnight
wand
of
cider
never
prosper
you
must
have
heard
them
my
mum's
full
of
them
harry
and
I
were
raised
by
Muggles
Hermione
reminded
him
we
were
taught
different
superstitions
she
sighed
deeply
as
a
rather
pungent
smell
drifted
up
from
the
kitchen
the
one
good
thing
about
her
exasperation
with
Xenophilius
was
that
it
seemed
to
have
made
her
forget
that
she
was
annoyed
at
Ron
i
think
you're
right
she
told
him
it's
just
a
morality
tale
it's
obvious
which
gift
is
best
which
one
you'd
choose
the
three
of
them
spoke
at
the
same
time
Hermione
said
the
Cloak
Ron
said
the
wand
and
Harry
said
the
stone
they
looked
at
each
other
half
surprised
half
amused
you're
supposed
to
say
the
Cloak
Ron
told
Hermione
but
you
wouldn't
need
to
be
invisible
if
you
had
the
wand
an
unbeatable
wand
Hermione
come
on
we've
already
got
an
Invisibility
Cloak
said
Harry
And
it's
helped
us
rather
a
lot
in
case
you
hadn't
noticed
said
Hermione
whereas
the
wand
would
be
bound
to
attract
trouble
Only
if
you
shouted
about
it
argued
Ron
only
if
you
were
prat
enough
to
go
dancing
around
waving
it
over
your
head
and
singing
i've
got
an
unbeatable
want
come
and
have
a
go
if
you
think
you're
hard
enough
as
long
as
you
kept
your
trap
shut
Yes
but
could
you
keep
your
trap
shut
said
Hermione
looking
skeptical
you
know
the
only
true
thing
he
said
to
us
was
that
there
have
been
stories
about
extra-powerful
wands
for
hundreds
of
years
there
have
asked
Harry
hermione
looked
exasperated
The
expression
was
so
endearingly
familiar
that
Harry
and
Ron
grinned
at
each
other
the
Deathstick
the
Wand
of
Destiny
they
crop
up
under
different
names
through
the
centuries
usually
in
the
possession
of
some
Dark
wizard
whos
boasting
about
them
professor
Binns
mentioned
some
of
them
but
oh
it's
all
nonsense
wands
are
only
as
powerful
as
the
wizards
who
use
them
some
wizards
just
like
to
boast
that
theirs
are
bigger
and
better
than
other
people's
but
how
do
you
know
said
Harry
that
those
wants
the
Deathstick
and
the
Wand
of
Destiny
aren't
the
same
want
surfacing
over
the
centuries
under
different
names
what
if
they're
all
really
the
Elder
Wand
made
by
Death
said
Ron
harry
laughed
The
strange
idea
that
had
occurred
to
him
was
after
all
ridiculous
his
wand
he
reminded
himself
had
been
of
holly
not
elder
and
it
had
been
made
by
Ollivander
whatever
it
had
done
that
night
Voldemort
had
pursued
him
across
the
skies
and
if
it
had
been
unbeatable
how
could
it
have
been
broken
so
why
would
you
take
the
stone
ron
asked
him
well
if
you
could
bring
people
back
we
could
have
Sirius
mad-Eye
dumbledore
my
parents
neither
Ron
nor
Hermione
smiled
but
according
to
Beedle
the
Bard
they
wouldn't
want
to
come
back
would
they
said
Harry
thinking
about
the
tail
they
had
just
heard
i
don't
suppose
there
have
been
loads
of
other
stories
about
a
stone
that
can
raise
the
dead
have
there
he
asked
Hermione
no
she
replied
sadly
i
don't
think
anyone
except
mr.
Lovegood
could
kid
themselves
that's
possible
beedle
probably
took
the
idea
from
the
sorcerer's
Stone
you
know
instead
of
a
stone
to
make
you
immortal
a
stone
to
reverse
death
the
smell
from
the
kitchen
was
getting
stronger
it
was
something
like
burning
underpants
harry
wondered
whether
it
would
be
possible
to
eat
enough
of
whatever
Xenophilius
was
cooking
to
spare
his
feelings
what
about
the
Cloak
though
said
Ron
slowly
don't
you
realize
he's
right
i've
got
so
used
to
harry's
Cloak
and
how
good
it
is
I
never
stopped
to
think
i've
never
heard
of
one
like
harry's
it's
infallible
we've
never
been
spotted
under
it
Of
course
not
we're
invisible
when
we're
under
it
Ron
but
all
the
stuff
he
said
about
other
cloaks
and
they're
not
exactly
ten
a
Knut
you
know
is
true
it's
never
occurred
to
me
before
but
i've
heard
stuff
about
charms
wearing
off
cloaks
when
they
get
old
or
them
being
ripped
apart
by
spells
so
they've
got
holes
harry's
was
owned
by
his
dad
so
it's
not
exactly
new
is
it
but
it's
just
perfect
yes
all
right
but
Ron
the
stone
as
they
argued
in
whispers
Harry
moved
around
the
room
only
half
listening
reaching
the
spiral
stair
he
raised
his
eyes
absently
to
the
next
level
and
was
distracted
at
once
his
own
face
was
looking
back
at
him
from
the
ceiling
of
the
room
above
after
a
moment's
bewilderment
he
realized
that
it
was
not
a
mirror
but
a
painting
curious
he
began
to
clime
the
stairs
harry
what
are
you
doing
i
don't
think
you
should
look
around
when
he's
not
here
but
Harry
had
already
reached
the
next
level
luna
had
decorated
her
bedroom
ceiling
with
five
beautifully
painted
faces
Harry
Ron
Hermione
Ginny
and
Neville
they
were
not
moving
as
the
portraits
at
Hogwarts
moved
but
there
was
a
certain
magic
about
them
all
the
same
harry
thought
they
breathed
what
appeared
to
be
a
fine
golden
chains
wove
around
the
pictures
linking
them
together
but
after
examining
them
for
a
minute
or
so
Harry
realized
that
the
chains
were
actually
one
work
repeated
a
thousand
times
in
golden
ink
friends
friends
friends
harry
felt
a
great
rush
of
affection
for
Luna
he
looked
around
the
room
there
was
a
large
photograph
beside
the
bed
of
a
young
Luna
and
a
woman
who
looked
very
like
her
they
were
hugging
luna
looked
rather
better-groomed
in
this
picture
than
Harry
had
ever
seen
her
in
life
the
picture
was
dusty
this
struck
Harry
as
slightly
odd
he
stared
around
something
was
wrong
the
pale
blue
carpet
was
also
thick
with
dust
there
were
no
clothes
in
the
wardrobe
whose
doors
stood
ajar
the
bed
had
a
cold
unfriendly
look
as
though
it
had
not
been
slept
in
for
weeks
a
single
cobweb
stretched
over
the
nearest
window
across
the
blood
red
sky
what's
wrong
hermione
asked
as
Harry
descended
the
staircase
but
before
he
could
respond
Xenophilius
reached
the
top
of
the
stairs
from
the
kitchen
now
holding
a
tray
laden
with
bowls
mr.
Lovegood
said
Harry
where's
Luna
excuse
me
where's
Luna
xenophilius
halted
on
the
top
step
i
i've
already
told
you
she
is
down
at
the
Botions
Bridge
fishing
for
Plimpies
so
why
have
you
only
laid
that
tray
for
four
xenophilius
tried
to
speak
but
no
sound
came
out
the
only
noise
was
the
continued
chugging
of
the
printing
press
and
a
slight
rattle
from
the
tray
as
xenophilius's
hands
shook
i
don't
think
luna's
been
here
for
weeks
said
Harry
her
clothes
are
gone
her
bed
hasn't
been
slept
in
where
is
she
and
why
do
you
keep
looking
out
of
the
window
xenophilius
dropped
the
tray
the
bowls
bounced
and
smashed
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
drew
their
wands
xenophilius
froze
his
hand
about
to
enter
his
pocket
at
that
moment
the
printing
press
have
a
huge
bank
and
numerous
Quibblers
came
streaming
across
the
floor
from
underneath
the
tablecloth
the
press
fell
silent
at
last
hermione
stooped
down
and
picked
up
one
of
the
magazines
her
wand
still
pointing
at
mr.
Lovegood
harry
look
at
this
He
strode
over
to
her
as
quickly
as
he
could
through
all
the
clutter
the
front
of
the
Quibbler
carried
his
own
picture
emblazoned
with
the
words
Undesirable
Number
One
and
captioned
with
the
reward
money
the
quibbler's
going
for
a
new
angle
then
Harry
asked
coldly
his
mind
working
very
fast
is
that
what
you
were
doing
when
you
went
into
the
garden
mr.
Lovegood
sending
an
owl
to
the
Ministry
xenophilius
licked
his
lips
They
took
my
Luna
he
whispered
Because
of
what
i've
been
writing
they
took
my
Luna
and
I
don't
know
where
she
is
what
they've
done
to
her
but
they
might
give
her
back
to
me
if
I
If
I
Hand
over
Harry
hermione
finished
for
him
no
deal
said
Ron
flatly
get
out
of
the
way
we're
leaving
xenophilius
looked
ghastly
a
century
old
his
lips
drawn
back
into
a
dreadful
leer
they
will
be
here
any
moment
i
must
save
Luna
i
cannot
lose
Luna
you
must
not
leave
he
spread
his
arms
in
front
of
the
staircase
and
Harry
had
a
sudden
vision
of
his
mother
doing
the
same
thing
in
front
of
his
crib
don't
make
us
hurt
you
Harry
said
get
out
of
the
way
mr.
Lovegood
harry
hermione
screamed
figures
on
broomsticks
were
flying
past
the
windows
as
the
three
of
them
looked
away
from
him
xenophilius
drew
his
wand
harry
realized
their
mistake
just
in
time
he
launched
himself
sideways
shoving
Ron
and
Hermione
out
of
harm's
way
as
xenophilius's
Stunning
Spell
soared
across
the
room
and
hit
the
Erumpent
horn
there
was
a
colossal
explosion
the
sound
of
it
seemed
to
blow
the
room
apart
fragments
of
wood
and
paper
and
rubble
flew
in
all
directions
along
with
an
impenetrable
cloud
of
thick
white
dust
harry
flew
through
the
air
then
crashed
to
the
floor
unable
to
see
as
debris
rained
upon
him
his
arms
over
his
head
he
heard
hermione's
scream
ron's
yell
and
a
series
of
sickening
metallic
thuds
which
told
him
that
Xenophilius
had
been
blasted
off
his
feet
and
fallen
backward
down
the
spiral
stairs
half
buried
in
rubble
Harry
tried
to
raise
himself
he
could
barely
breathe
or
see
for
dust
half
of
the
ceiling
had
fall
in
and
the
end
of
luna's
bead
was
hanging
through
the
hole
the
bust
of
Rowena
Ravenclaw
lay
beside
him
with
half
its
face
missing
fragments
of
torn
parchment
were
floating
through
the
air
and
most
of
the
printing
press
lay
on
its
side
blocking
the
top
of
the
staircase
to
the
kitchen
then
another
white
shape
moved
close
by
and
Hermione
coated
in
dust
like
a
second
statue
pressed
his
finger
to
her
lips
the
door
downstairs
crashed
open
didn't
I
tell
you
there
was
no
need
to
hurry
Travers
said
a
rough
voice
didn't
I
tell
you
this
nutter
was
just
raving
as
usual
there
was
a
bang
and
a
scream
of
pain
from
Xenophilius
no
no
upstairs
potter
i
told
you
last
week
Lovegood
we
weren't
coming
back
for
anything
less
than
some
solid
information
remember
last
week
when
you
wanted
to
swap
your
daughter
for
that
stupid
bleeding
headdress
and
the
week
before
Another
bang
another
squeal
When
you
thought
we'd
give
her
back
if
you
offered
us
proof
there
are
Cumple
Bang
HeadedbangSnorkacks
no
no
I
beg
of
you
sobbed
Xenophilius
it
really
is
Potter
Really
and
now
it
turns
out
you
only
called
us
here
to
try
and
blow
us
up
roared
the
Death
Eater
and
there
was
a
volley
of
bangs
interspersed
with
squeals
of
agony
from
Xenophilius
the
place
looks
like
it's
about
to
fall
in
Selwyn
said
a
cool
second
voice
echoing
up
the
mangled
staircase
the
stairs
are
completely
blocked
could
try
clearing
it
might
bring
the
place
down
you
lying
piece
of
filth
shouted
the
wizard
named
Selwyn
you
have
never
seen
Potter
in
your
life
have
you
thought
you'd
lure
us
here
to
kill
us
did
you
and
you
think
you'll
get
your
girl
back
like
this
i
swear
i
swear
potter's
upstairs
homenum
revelio
said
the
voice
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
harry
heard
Hermione
gasp
and
he
had
the
odd
sensation
something
was
swooping
low
over
him
immersing
his
body
in
its
shadow
there's
someone
up
there
all
right
Selwyn
said
the
second
man
sharply
it's
Potter
I
tell
you
it's
Potter
sobbed
Xenophilius
please
please
give
me
Luna
just
let
me
have
Luna
you
can
have
your
little
girl
Lovegood
said
Selwyn
if
you
get
up
those
stairs
and
bring
me
down
Harry
Potter
but
if
this
is
a
plot
if
it's
a
trick
if
you've
got
an
accomplice
waiting
up
there
to
ambush
us
we'll
see
if
we
can
spare
a
bit
of
your
daughter
for
you
to
bury
xenophilius
gave
a
wail
of
fear
and
despair
there
were
scurryings
and
scrapings
xenophilius
was
trying
to
get
through
the
debris
on
the
stairs
come
on
Harry
whispered
we've
got
to
get
out
of
here
he
started
to
dig
himself
out
under
cover
of
all
the
noise
Xenophilius
was
making
on
the
staircase
ron
was
buried
the
deepest
harry
and
Hermione
climbed
as
quietly
as
they
could
over
all
the
wreckage
to
where
he
lay
trying
to
prise
a
heavy
chest
of
drawers
off
his
legs
while
Xenophilius
banging
and
scraping
drew
nearer
and
nearer
Hermione
managed
to
free
Ron
with
the
use
of
a
Hover
Charm
all
right
breathed
Hermione
as
the
broken
printing
press
blocking
the
top
of
the
stairs
begin
to
tremble
xenophilius
was
feet
away
from
them
she
was
still
white
with
dust
do
you
trust
me
Harry
harry
nodded
okay
then
hermione
whispered
give
me
the
invisibility
Cloak
ron
you're
going
to
put
it
on
me
but
Harry
Please
Ron
harry
hold
on
tight
to
my
hand
Ron
grab
my
shoulder
harry
held
out
his
left
hand
ron
vanished
beneath
the
Cloak
the
printing
press
blocking
the
stairs
was
vibrating
xenophilius
was
trying
to
shift
it
using
a
Hover
Charm
harry
did
not
know
what
Hermione
was
waiting
for
hold
tight
she
whispered
hold
tight
any
second
xenophilius's
paper-white
face
appeared
over
the
top
of
the
sideboard
obliviate
cried
Hermione
pointing
her
want
first
into
his
face
then
at
the
floor
beneath
them
deprimo
she
had
blasted
a
hole
in
the
sitting
room
floor
they
fell
like
boulders
harry
still
holding
onto
her
hand
for
dear
life
there
was
a
scream
from
below
and
he
glimpsed
two
men
trying
to
get
out
of
the
way
as
vast
quantities
of
rubble
and
broken
furniture
rained
all
around
them
from
the
shattered
ceiling
hermione
twisted
in
midair
and
thundering
of
the
collapsing
house
rang
in
harry's
ears
as
she
dragged
him
once
more
into
darkness
chapter
Twenty-Two
the
Deathly
Hallows
harry
fell
panting
onto
grass
and
scrambled
up
at
once
they
seemed
to
have
landed
in
the
corner
of
a
field
at
dusk
Hermione
was
already
running
in
a
circle
around
them
waving
her
wand
protego
Totalum
salvio
Hexia
that
treacherous
old
bleeder
ron
panted
emerging
from
beneath
the
Invisibility
Cloak
and
throwing
it
to
Harry
hermione
youre
a
genius
a
total
genius
i
cant
believe
we
got
out
of
that
cave
Inimicum

I
say
it
was
an
Frumpent
horn
didnt
I
tell
him
and
now
his
house
has
been
blown
apart

him
right
said
Ron
examining
his
torn
jeans
and
the
cuts
to
his
legs
Whatd
you
reckon
theyll
do
to
him
oh
I
hope
they
dont
kill
him
groaned
Hermione
Thats
why
I
wanted
the
Death
Eaters
to
get
a
glimpse
of
Harry
before
we
left
so
they
knew
Xenophilius
hadnt
been
lying
why
hide
me
though
asked
Ron
youre
supposed
to
be
in
bed
with
spattergrolt
Ron
theyve
kidnapped
Luna
because
her
father
supported
Harry
what
would
happen
to
your
family
if
they
knew

with
him
but
what
about
your
mum

Australia
said
Hermione
They

be
all
right

genius
Ron
repeated
looking
awed
yeah

Hermione
agreed
Harry
fervently
i
dont
know
what

without
you
she
beamed
but
became
solemn
at
once
what
about
Luna
well
if
theyre
telling
the
truth
and
shes
still
Alive
began
Ron
dont
say
that

squealed
Hermione

be
alive

must
then
shell
be
in
Azkaban

Ron
whether
she
survives
the
place

loads

will
said
Harry
he
could
not
bear
to
contemplate
the
alternative
shes
tough
Luna
much
tougher
than
youd
think
shes
probably
teaching
all
the
inmates
about
Wrackspurts
and
Nargles
i
hope
youre
right
said
Hermione
she
passed
a
hand
over
her
eyes
id
feel
so
sorry
for
Xenophilius
if
if
he
hadnt
just
tried
to
sell
us
to
the
Death
Eaters
yeah
said
Ron
they
put
up
the
tent
and
retreated
inside
it
where
Ron
made
them
tea
after
their
narrow
escape
the
chilly
musty
old
place
felt
like
home
safe
familiar
and
friendly
oh
why
did
we
go
there
groaned
Hermione
after
a
few
minutes
silence
harry
you
were
right
it
was
Godrics
Hollow
all
over
again
a
complete
waste
of
time
the
Deathly
Hallows
such
rubbish
although
actually
a
sudden
thought
seemed
to
have
struck
her
he
might
have
made
it
all
up
mightnt
he
he
probably
doesnt
believe
in
the
Deathly
Hallows
at
all
he
just
wanted
to
keep
us
talking
until
the
Death
Eaters
arrived
i
dont
think
so
said
Ron
its
a
damn
sight
harder
making
stuff
up
when
youre
under
stress
than
youd
think
i
found
that
out
when
the
Snatchers
caught
me
it
was
much
easier
pretending
to
be
Stan
because
I
knew
a
bit
about
him
than
inventing
a
whole
new
person
old
Lovegood
was
under
loads
of
pressure
trying
to
make
sure
we
stayed
put
i
reckon
he
told
us
the
truth
or
what
he
thinks
is
the
truth
just
to
keep
us
talking
well
I
dont
suppose
it
matters
sighed
Hermione
even
if
he
was
being
honest
I
never
heard
such
a
lot
of
nonsense
in
all
my
life
hang
on
though
said
Ron
the
Chamber
of
Secrets
was
supposed
to
be
a
myth
wasnt
it
but
the
Deathly
Hallows
cant
exist
Ron
you
keep
saying
that
but
one
of
them
can
said
Ron
harrys
Invisibility
Cloak
the
Tale
of
the
Three
Brothers
is
a
story
said
Hermione
firmly
a
story
about
how
humans
are
frightened
of
death
if
surviving
was
as
simple
as
hiding
under
the
Invisibility
Cloak
wed
have
everything
we
need
already
i
dont
know
we
could
do
with
an
unbeatable
wand
said
Harry
turning
the
blackthorn
wand
he
so
disliked
over
in
his
fingers
theres
no
such
thing
Harry
you
said
there
have
been
loads
of
wands
the
Deathstick
and
whatever
they
were
called
all
right
even
if
you
want
to
kid
yourself
the
Elder
Wands
real
what
about
the
Resurrection
Stone
her
fingers
sketched
quotation
marks
around
the
name
and
her
tone
dripped
sarcasm
no
magic
can
raise
the
dead
and
thats
that
when
my
wand
connected
with
You-Know-Whos
it
made
my
mum
and
dad
appear
and
Cedric
but
they
werent
really
back
from
the
dead
were
they
said
Hermione
those
kind
of
of
pale
imitations
arent
the
same
as
truly
bringing
someone
back
to
life
but
she
the
girl
in
the
tale
didnt
really
come
back
did
she
the
story
says
that
once
people
are
dead
they
belong
with
the
dead
but
the
second
brother
still
got
to
see
her
and
talk
to
her
didnt
he
he
even
lived
with
her
for
a
while
he
saw
concern
and
something
less
easily
definable
in
Hermiones
expression
then
as
she
glanced
at
Ron
Harry
realized
that
it
was
fear
He
had
scared
her
with
his
talk
of
living
with
dead
people
so
that
Peverell
bloke
whos
buried
in
Godrics
Hollow
he
said
hastily
trying
to
sound
robustly
sane
you
dont
know
anything
about
him
then
no
she
replied
looking
relieved
at
the
change
of
subject
i
looked
him
up
after
I
saw
the
mark
on
his
grave
if
hed
been
anyone
famous
or
done
anything
important
Im
sure
hed
be
in
one
of
our
books
the
only
place
Ive
managed
to
find
the
name
Peverell
Is
Natures
Nobility
A
Wizarding
Genealogy
i
borrowed
it
from
Kreacher
she
explained
as
Ron
raised
his
eyebrows
it
lists
the
pure-blood
families
that
are
now
extinct
in
the
male
line
apparently
the
Peverells
were
one
of
the
earliest
families
to
vanish
extinct
in
the
male
line
repeated
Ron
it
means
the
name
died
out
said
Hermione
centuries
ago
in
the
case
of
the
Peverells
they
could
still
have
descendents
though
theyd
just
be
called
something
different
and
then
it
came
to
Harry
in
one
shining
piece
the
memory
that
had
stirred
at
the
sound
of
the
name
Peverell
a
filthy
old
man
brandishing
an
ugly
ring
in
the
face
of
a
Ministry
official
and
he
cried
aloud
Marvolo
Gaunt
sorry
said
Ron
and
Hermione
together
marvolo
Gaunt
you-Know-Whos
grandfather
in
the
Pensieve
with
Dumbledore
marvolo
Gaunt
said
he
was
descended
from
the
Peverells
ron
and
Hermione
looked
bewildered
the
ring
the
ring
that
became
the
Horcrux
Marvolo
Gaunt
said
it
had
the
Peverell
coat
of
arms
on
it
i
saw
him
waving
it
in
the
bloke
from
the
Ministrys
face
he
nearly
shoved
it
up
his
nose
the
Peverell
coat
of
arms
said
Hermione
sharply
could
you
see
what
it
looked
like
not
really
said
Harry
trying
to
remember
there
was
nothing
fancy
on
there
as
far
as
I
could
see
maybe
a
few
scratches
i
only
ever
saw
it
really
close
up
after
it
had
been
cracked
open
harry
saw
Hermiones
comprehension
in
the
sudden
widening
of
her
eyes
ron
was
looking
from
one
to
the
other
astonished
blimey
you
reckon
it
was
this
sign
again
the
sign
of
the
Hallows
why
not
said
Harry
excitedly
Marvolo
Gaunt
was
an
ignorant
old
git
who
lived
like
a
pig
all
he
cared
about
was
his
ancestry
if
that
ring
had
been
passed
down
through
the
centuries
he
might
not
have
known
what
it
really
was
there
were
no
books
in
that
house
and
trust
me
he
wasnt
the
type
to
read
fairy
tales
to
his
kids
hed
have
loved
to
think
the
scratches
on
the
stone
were
a
coat
of
arms
because
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
having
pure
blood
made
you
practically
royal
yes
and
thats
all
very
interesting
said
Hermione
cautiously
but
Harry
if
youre
thinking
what
I
think
youre
think
well
why
not
why
not
said
Harry
abandoning
caution
it
was
a
stone
wasnt
it
he
looked
at
Ron
for
support
what
if
it
was
the
Resurrection
Stone
rons
mouth
fell
open
blimey
but
would
it
still
work
if
Dumbledore
broke
work
work
ron
it
never
worked
theres
no
such
thing
as
a
Resurrection
Stone
hermione
leapt
to
her
feet
looking
exasperated
and
angry
harry
youre
trying
to
fit
everything
into
the
Hallows
story
fit
everything
in
he
repeated
hermione
it
fits
of
its
own
accord
i
know
the
sign
of
the
Deathly
Hallows
was
on
that
stone
gaunt
said
he
was
descended
from
the
Peverells
a
minute
ago
you
told
us
you
never
saw
the
mark
on
the
stone
properly
whered
you
reckon
the
ring
is
now
ron
asked
Harry
what
did
Dumbledore
do
with
it
after
he
broke
it
open
but
Harrys
imagination
was
racing
ahead
far
beyond
Ron
and
Hermiones
three
objects
or
Hallows
which
if
united
will
make
the
possessor
master
of
Death
master
conqueror
vanquisher
the
last
enemy
that
shall
be
destroyed
is
death
and
he
saw
himself
possessor
of
the
Hallows
facing
Voldemort
whose
Horcruxes
were
no
match
neither
can
live
while
the
other
survives
was
this
the
answer
hallows
versus
Horcruxes
was
there
a
way
after
all
to
ensure
that
he
was
the
one
who
triumphed
if
he
were
the
master
of
the
Deathly
Hallows
would
he
be
safe
harry
but
he
scarcely
heard
Hermione
He
had
pulled
out
his
Invisibility
Cloak
and
was
running
it
through
his
fingers
the
cloth
supple
as
water
light
as
air
he
had
never
seen
anything
to
equal
it
in
his
nearly
seven
years
in
the
Wizarding
world
the
Cloak
was
exactly
what
Xenophilius
had
described
A
cloak
that
really
and
truly
renders
the
wearer
completely
invisible
and
endures
eternally
giving
constant
and
impenetrable
concealment
no
matter
what
spells
are
cast
at
it
and
then
with
a
gasp
he
remembered
dumbledore
had
my
Cloak
the
night
my
parents
died
his
voice
shook
and
he
could
feel
the
color
in
his
face
but
he
did
not
care
my
mum
told
Sirius
that
Dumbledore
borrowed
the
Cloak
this
is
why
he
wanted
to
examine
it
because
he
thought
it
was
the
third
Hallow
ignotus
Peverell
is
buried
in
Godrics
Hollow
harry
was
walking
blindly
around
the
tent
feeling
as
though
great
new
vistas
of
truth
were
opening
all
around
him
hes
my
ancestor
im
descended
from
the
third
brother
it
all
makes
sense
he
felt
armed
in
certainty
in
his
belief
in
the
Hallows
as
if
the
mere
idea
of
possessing
them
was
giving
him
protection
and
he
felt
joyous
as
he
turned
back
to
the
other
two
harry
said
Hermione
again
but
he
was
busy
undoing
the
pouch
around
his
neck
his
fingers
shaking
hard
read
it
he
told
her
pushing
his
mothers
letter
into
her
hand
read
it
dumbledore
had
the
Cloak
Hermione
why
else
would
he
want
it
he
didnt
need
a
Cloak
he
could
perform
a
Disillusionment
Charm
so
powerful
that
he
made
himself
completely
invisible
without
one
something
fell
to
the
floor
and
rolled
glittering
under
a
chair
He
had
dislodged
the
Snitch
when
he
pulled
out
the
letter
he
stooped
to
pick
it
up
and
then
the
newly
tapped
spring
of
fabulous
discoveries
threw
him
another
gift
and
shock
and
wonder
erupted
inside
him
so
that
he
shouted
out
its
in
here
he
left
me
the
ring
its
in
the
Snitch
you
you
reckon
he
could
not
understand
why
Ron
looked
taken
aback
it
was
so
obvious
so
clear
to
Harry
everything
fit
everything
his
Cloak
was
the
third
Hallow
and
when
he
discovered
how
to
open
the
Snitch
he
would
have
the
second
and
then
all
he
needed
to
do
was
find
the
first
Hallow
the
Elder
Wand
and
then
but
it
was
as
though
a
curtain
fell
on
a
lit
stage
All
his
excitement
all
his
hope
and
happiness
were
extinguished
at
a
stroke
and
he
stood
alone
in
the
darkness
and
the
glorious
spell
was
broken
thats
what
hes
after
the
change
in
his
voice
made
Ron
and
Hermione
look
even
more
scared
you-Know-Whos
after
the
Elder
Wand
he
turned
his
back
on
their
strained
incredulous
faces
he
knew
it
was
the
truth
it
all
made
sense
Voldemort
was
not
seeking
a
new
wand
he
was
seeking
an
old
wand
a
very
old
wand
indeed
harry
walked
to
the
entrance
of
the
tent
forgetting
about
Ron
and
Hermione
as
he
looked
out
into
the
night
thinking
voldemort
had
been
raised
in
a
Muggle
orphanage
nobody
could
have
told
him
The
Tales
of
Beedle
the
Bard
when
he
was
a
child
any
more
than
Harry
had
heard
them
hardly
any
wizards
believed
in
the
Deathly
Hallows
was
it
likely
that
Voldemort
knew
about
them
harry
gazed
into
the
darkness
if
Voldemort
had
known
about
the
Deathly
Hallows
surely
he
would
have
sought
them
done
anything
to
possess
them
three
objects
that
made
the
possessor
master
of
Death
if
he
had
known
about
the
Deathly
Hallows
he
might
not
have
needed
Horcruxes
in
the
first
place
didnt
the
simple
fact
that
he
had
taken
a
Hallow
and
turned
it
into
a
Horcrux
demonstrate
that
he
did
not
know
this
last
great
Wizarding
secret
which
meant
that
Voldemort
sought
the
Elder
Wand
without
realizing
its
full
power
without
understanding
that
it
was
one
of
three
for
the
wand
was
the
Hallow
that
could
not
be
hidden
whose
existence
was
best
known
the
bloody
trail
of
the
Elder
Wand
is
splattered
across
the
pages
of
Wizarding
history
harry
watched
the
cloudy
sky
curves
of
smoke-gray
and
silver
sliding
over
the
face
of
the
white
moon
he
felt
lightheaded
with
amazement
at
his
discoveries
he
turned
back
into
the
tent
it
was
a
shock
to
see
Ron
and
Hermione
standing
exactly
where
he
had
left
them
Hermione
still
holding
Lilys
letter
Ron
at
her
side
looking
slightly
anxious
didnt
they
realize
how
far
they
had
traveled
in
the
last
few
minutes
this
is
it
harry
said
trying
to
bring
them
inside
the
glow
of
his
own
astonished
certainty
This
explains
everything
the
Deathly
Hallows
are
real
and
Ive
got
one
maybe
two
he
held
up
the
Snitch
and
You-Know-Whos
chasing
the
third
but
he
doesnt
realize
he
just
thinks
its
a
powerful
wand
harry
said
Hermione
moving
across
to
him
and
handing
him
back
Lilys
letter
Im
sorry
but
I
think
youve
got
this
wrong
all
wrong
but
dont
you
see
it
all
fits
not
it
doesnt
she
said
it
doesnt
harry
youre
just
getting
carried
away
please
she
said
as
she
started
to
speak
please
just
answer
me
this
If
the
Deathly
Hallows
really
existed
and
Dumbledore
knew
about
them
knew
that
the
person
who
possessed
all
of
them
would
be
master
of
Death
Harry
why
wouldnt
he
have
told
you
why
he
had
his
answer
ready
but
you
said
it
Hermione
youve
got
to
find
out
about
them
for
yourself
its
a
Quest
but
I
only
said
that
to
try
and
persuade
you
to
come
to
the
Lovegoods
cried
Hermione
in
exasperation
i
didnt
really
believe
it
harry
took
no
notice
dumbledore
usually
let
me
find
out
stuff
for
myself
he
let
me
try
my
strength
take
risks
this
feels
like
the
kind
of
thing
hed
do
harry
this
isnt
a
game
this
isnt
practice
this
is
the
real
thing
and
Dumbledore
left
you
very
clear
instructions
Find
and
destroy
the
Horcruxes
that
symbol
doesnt
mean
anything
forget
the
Deathly
Hallows
we
cant
afford
to
get
sidetracked
harry
was
barely
listening
to
her
he
was
turning
the
Snitch
over
and
over
in
his
hands
half
expecting
it
to
break
open
to
reveal
the
Resurrection
Stone
to
prove
to
Hermione
that
he
was
right
that
the
Deathly
Hallows
were
real
she
appealed
to
Ron
you
dont
believe
in
this
do
you
harry
looked
up
Ron
hesitated
i
dunno
i
mean
bits
of
it
sort
of
fit
together
said
Ron
awkwardly
But
when
you
look
at
the
whole
thing
he
took
a
deep
breath
i
think
were
supposed
to
get
rid
of
Horcruxes
Harry
thats
what
Dumbledore
told
us
to
do
maybe
maybe
we
should
forget
about
this
Hallows
business
thank
you
Ron
said
Hermione
ill
take
first
watch
and
she
strode
past
Harry
and
sat
down
in
the
tent
entrance
bringing
the
action
to
a
fierce
full
stop
but
Harry
hardly
slept
that
night
the
idea
of
the
Deathly
Hallows
had
taken
possession
of
him
and
he
could
not
rest
while
agitating
thoughts
whirled
through
his
mind
the
wand
the
stone
and
the
Cloak
if
he
could
just
possess
them
all
i
open
at
the
close
but
what
was
the
close
why
couldnt
he
have
the
stone
now
if
only
he
had
the
stone
he
could
ask
Dumbledore
these
questions
in
person
and
Harry
murmured
words
to
the
Snitch
in
the
darkness
trying
everything
even
Parseltongue
but
the
golden
ball
would
not
open
and
the
wand
the
Elder
Wand
where
was
that
hidden
where
was
Voldemort
searching
now
harry
wished
his
scar
would
burn
and
show
him
Voldemorts
thoughts
because
for
the
first
time
ever
he
and
Voldemort
were
united
in
wanting
the
very
same
thing
hermione
would
not
like
that
idea
of
course
but
then
she
did
not
believe
xenophilius
had
been
right
in
a
way
limited
Narrow
close-minded
the
truth
was
that
she
was
scared
of
the
idea
of
the
Deathly
Hallows
especially
of
the
Resurrection
Stone
and
Harry
pressed
his
mouth
again
to
the
Snitch
kissing
it
nearly
swallowing
it
but
the
cold
medal
did
not
yield
it
was
nearly
dawn
when
he
remembered
Luna
alone
in
a
cell
in
Azkaban
surrounded
by
dementors
and
he
suddenly
felt
ashamed
of
himself
he
had
forgotten
all
about
her
in
his
feverish
contemplation
of
the
Hallows
if
only
they
could
rescue
her
but
dementors
in
those
numbers
would
be
virtually
unassailable
now
he
came
to
think
about
it
he
had
not
tried
casting
a
Patronus
with
the
blackthorn
wand
he
must
try
that
in
the
morning
if
only
there
was
a
way
of
getting
a
better
wand
and
desire
for
the
Elder
Wand
the
Deathstick
unbeatable
invincible
swallowed
him
once
more
they
packed
up
the
tent
next
morning
and
moved
on
through
a
dreary
shower
of
rain
the
downpour
pursued
them
to
the
coast
where
they
pitched
the
tent
that
night
and
persisted
through
the
whole
week
through
sodden
landscapes
that
Harry
found
bleak
and
depressing
he
could
think
only
of
the
Deathly
Hallows
it
was
as
though
a
flame
had
been
lit
inside
him
that
nothing
not
Hermiones
flat
disbelief
nor
Rons
persistent
doubts
could
extinguish
and
yet
the
fiercer
the
longing
for
the
Hallows
burned
inside
him
the
less
joyful
it
made
him
he
blamed
Ron
and
Hermione
Their
determined
indifference
was
as
bad
as
the
relentless
rain
for
dampening
his
spirits
but
neither
could
erode
his
certainty
which
remained
absolute
harrys
belief
in
and
longing
for
the
Hallows
consumed
him
so
much
that
he
felt
isolated
from
the
other
two
and
their
obsession
with
the
Horcruxes
obsession
said
Hermione
in
a
low
fierce
voice
when
Harry
was
careless
enough
to
use
the
word
one
evening
after
Hermione
had
told
him
off
for
his
lack
of
interest
in
locating
more
Horcruxes
were
not
the
one
with
an
obsession
Harry
were
the
ones
trying
to
do
what
Dumbledore
wanted
us
to
do
but
he
was
impervious
to
the
veiled
criticism
dumbledore
had
left
the
sign
of
the
Hallows
for
Hermione
to
decipher
and
he
had
also
Harry
remained
convinced
of
it
left
the
Resurrection
Stone
hidden
in
the
golden
Snitch
neither
can
live
while
the
other
survives
master
of
Death
why
didnt
Ron
and
Hermione
understand
The
last
enemy
shall
be
destroyed
is
death
Harry
quoted
calmly
i
thought
it
was
You-Know-Who
we
were
supposed
to
be
fighting
hermione
retorted
and
Harry
gave
up
on
her
even
the
mystery
of
the
silver
doe
which
the
other
two
insisted
on
discussing
seemed
less
important
to
Harry
now
a
vaguely
interesting
sideshow
the
only
other
thing
that
mattered
to
him
was
that
his
scar
had
begun
to
prickle
again
although
he
did
all
he
could
to
hide
this
fact
from
the
other
two
he
sought
solitude
whenever
it
happened
but
was
disappointed
by
what
he
saw
the
visions
he
and
Voldemort
were
sharing
had
changed
in
quality
they
had
become
blurred
shifting
as
though
they
were
moving
in
and
out
of
focus
harry
was
just
able
to
make
out
the
indistinct
features
of
an
object
that
looked
like
a
skull
and
something
like
a
mountain
that
was
more
shadow
than
substance
used
to
images
sharp
as
reality
Harry
was
disconcerted
by
the
change
he
was
worried
that
the
connection
between
himself
and
Voldemort
had
been
damaged
a
connection
that
he
both
feared
and
whatever
he
had
told
Hermione
prized
somehow
Harry
connected
these
unsatisfying
vague
images
with
the
destruction
of
his
wand
as
if
it
was
the
blackthorn
wands
fault
that
he
could
no
longer
see
into
Voldemorts
mind
as
well
as
before
as
the
weeks
crept
on
Harry
could
not
help
but
notice
even
through
his
new
self-absorption
that
Ron
seemed
to
be
taking
charge
perhaps
because
he
was
determined
to
make
up
for
having
walked
out
on
them
perhaps
because
Harrys
descent
into
listlessness
galvanized
his
dormant
leadership
qualities
Ron
was
the
one
now
encouraging
and
exhorting
the
other
two
into
action
three
Horcruxes
left
he
kept
saying
we
need
a
plan
of
action
come
on
where
havent
we
looked
lets
go
through
it
again
the
orphanage
diagon
Alley
Hogwarts
the
Riddle
House
Borgin
and
Burkes
Albania
every
place
that
they
knew
Tom
Riddle
had
ever
lived
or
worked
visited
or
murdered
Ron
and
Hermione
raked
over
them
again
Harry
joining
in
only
to
stop
Hermione
pestering
him
he
would
have
been
happy
to
sit
alone
in
silence
trying
to
read
Voldemorts
thoughts
to
find
out
more
about
the
Elder
Wand
but
Ron
insisted
on
journeying
to
ever
more
unlikely
places
simply
Harry
was
aware
to
keep
them
moving
you
never
know
was
Rons
constant
refrain
upper
Flagley
is
a
Wizarding
village
he
mightve
wanted
to
live
there
lets
go
and
have
a
poke
around
these
frequent
forays
into
Wizarding
territory
brought
them
within
occasional
sight
of
Snatchers
some
of
them
are
supposed
to
be
as
bad
as
Death
Eaters
said
Ron
the
lot
that
got
me
were
a
bit
pathetic
but
Bill
recons
some
of
them
are
really
dangerous
they
said
on
Potterwatch
on
what
said
Harry
potterwatch
didnt
I
tell
you
thats
what
it
was
called
the
program
I
keep
trying
to
get
on
the
radio
the
only
one
that
tells
the
truth
about
whats
going
on
nearly
all
of
the
programs
are
following
You-Know-Whos
line
all
except
Potterwatch
I
really
want
you
to
hear
it
but
its
tricky
tuning
in
ron
spent
evening
after
evening
using
his
wand
to
beat
out
various
rhythms
on
top
of
the
wireless
while
the
dials
whirled
occasionally
they
would
catch
snatches
of
advice
on
how
to
treat
dragonpox
and
once
a
few
bars
of
A
Cauldron
Full
of
Hot
Strong
Love
while
he
taped
Ron
continued
to
try
to
hit
on
the
correct
password
muttering
strings
of
random
words
under
his
breath
theyre
normally
something
to
do
with
the
Order
he
told
them
bill
had
a
real
knack
for
guessing
them
im
bound
to
get
one
in
the
end
but
not
until
March
did
luck
favor
Ron
at
last
harry
was
sitting
in
the
tent
entrance
on
guard
duty
staring
idly
at
a
clump
of
grape
hyacinths
that
had
forced
their
way
through
the
chilly
ground
when
Ron
shouted
excitedly
from
inside
the
tent
ive
got
it
Ive
got
it
password
was
Albus
get
in
here
Harry
roused
for
the
first
time
in
days
from
his
contemplation
of
the
Deathly
Hallows
Harry
hurried
back
inside
the
tent
to
find
Ron
and
Hermione
kneeling
on
the
floor
beside
the
little
radio
hermione
who
had
been
polishing
the
sword
of
Gryffindor
just
for
something
to
do
was
sitting
open-mouthed
staring
at
the
tiny
speaker
from
which
a
most
familiar
voice
was
issuing
apologize
for
our
temporary
absence
from
the
airwaves
which
was
due
to
a
number
of
house
calls
in
our
area
by
those
charming
Death
Eaters
but
thats
Lee
Jordan
said
Hermione
i
know
beamed
Ron
cool
eh
now
found
ourselves
another
secure
location
Lee
was
saying
and
Im
pleased
to
tell
you
that
two
of
our
regular
contributors
have
joined
me
here
this
evening
evening
boys
hi
evening
River
River
thats
Lee
Ron
explained
theyve
all
got
code
names
but
you
can
usually
tell
shh
said
Hermione
but
before
we
hear
from
Royal
and
Romulus
Lee
went
on
lets
take
a
moment
to
report
those
deaths
that
the
Wizarding
Wireless
Network
News
and
Daily
Prophet
dont
think
important
enough
to
mention
it
is
with
great
regret
that
we
inform
our
listeners
of
the
murders
of
Ted
Tonks
and
Dirk
Cresswell
harry
felt
a
sick
swooping
in
his
belly
he
Ron
and
Hermione
gazed
at
one
another
in
horror
a
goblin
by
the
name
of
Gornuk
was
also
killed
it
is
believed
that
muggle-born
Dean
Thomas
and
a
second
goblin
both
believed
to
have
been
traveling
with
Tonks
Cresswell
and
Gornuk
may
have
escaped
if
Dean
is
listening
or
if
anyone
has
any
knowledge
of
his
whereabouts
his
parents
and
sisters
are
desperate
for
news
meanwhile
in
Gaddley
a
Muggle
family
of
five
has
been
found
dead
in
their
home
muggle
authorities
are
attributing
their
deaths
to
a
gas
leak
but
members
of
the
Order
of
the
Phoenix
inform
me
that
it
was
the
Killing
Curse
more
evidence
as
if
it
were
needed
of
the
fact
that
Muggle
slaughter
is
becoming
little
more
than
a
recreational
sport
under
the
new
regime
finally
we
regret
to
inform
our
listeners
that
the
remains
of
Bathilda
Bagshot
have
been
discovered
in
Godrics
Hollow
the
evidence
is
that
she
died
several
months
ago
the
Order
of
the
Phoenix
informs
us
that
her
body
showed
unmistakable
signs
of
injuries
inflicted
by
Dark
Magic
listeners
Id
like
to
invite
you
now
to
join
us
in
a
minutes
silence
in
memory
of
Ted
Tonks
Dirk
Cresswell
Bathilda
Bagshot
Gornuk
and
the
unnamed
but
no
less
regretted
Muggles
murdered
by
the
Death
Eaters
silence
fell
and
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
did
not
speak
half
of
Harry
yearned
to
hear
more
half
of
him
was
afraid
of
what
might
come
next
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
felt
fully
connected
to
the
outside
world
for
a
long
time
thank
you
said
Lees
voice
and
now
we
can
return
to
regular
contributor
Royal
for
an
update
on
how
the
new
Wizarding
order
is
affecting
the
Muggle
world
thanks
River
said
an
unmistakable
voice
deep
measured
reassuring
kingsley
burst
out
Ron
we
know
said
Hermione
hushing
him
muggles
remain
ignorant
of
the
source
of
their
suffering
as
they
continue
to
sustain
heavy
casualties
said
Kingsley
however
we
continue
to
hear
truly
inspirational
stories
of
wizards
and
witches
risking
their
own
safety
to
protect
Muggle
friends
and
neighbors
often
without
the
Muggles
knowledge
id
like
to
appeal
to
all
our
listeners
to
emulate
their
example
perhaps
by
casting
a
protective
charm
over
any
Muggle
dwellings
in
your
street
many
lives
could
be
saved
if
such
simple
measures
are
taken
and
what
would
you
say
Royal
to
those
listeners
who
reply
that
in
these
dangerous
times
it
should
be
Wizards
first
asked
Lee
id
say
that
its
one
short
step
from
Wizards
first
to
Purebloods
first
and
then
to
Death
Eaters
replied
Kingsley
were
all
human
arent
we
every
human
life
is
worth
the
same
and
worth
saving
excellently
put
Royal
and
youve
got
my
vote
for
Minister
of
Magic
if
we
ever
get
out
of
this
mess
said
Lee
and
now
over
to
Romulus
for
our
popular
feature
Pals
of
Potter
thanks
River
said
another
very
familiar
voice
ron
started
to
speak
but
Hermione
forestalled
him
in
a
whisper
we
know
its
Lupin
romulus
do
you
maintain
as
you
have
every
time
youve
appeared
on
our
program
that
Harry
Potter
is
still
alive
i
do
said
Lupin
firmly
there
is
no
doubt
at
all
in
my
mind
that
his
death
would
be
proclaimed
as
widely
as
possible
by
the
Death
Eaters
if
it
had
happened
because
it
would
strike
a
deadly
blow
at
the
morale
of
those
resisting
the
new
regime
The
Boy
Who
Lived
remains
a
symbol
of
everything
for
which
we
are
fighting
the
triumph
of
good
the
power
of
innocence
the
need
to
keep
resisting
a
mixture
of
gratitude
and
shame
welled
up
in
Harry
had
Lupin
forgiven
him
then
for
the
terrible
things
he
had
said
when
they
had
last
met
and
what
would
you
say
to
Harry
if
you
knew
he
was
listening
Romulus
id
tell
him
were
all
with
him
in
spirit
said
Lupin
then
hesitated
slightly
And
Id
tell
him
to
follow
his
instincts
which
are
good
and
nearly
always
right
harry
looked
at
Hermione
whose
eyes
were
full
of
tears
nearly
always
right
she
repeated
oh
didnt
I
tell
you
said
Ron
in
surprise
bill
told
me
Lupins
living
with
Tonks
again
and
apparently
shes
getting
pretty
big
too
and
our
usual
update
on
those
friends
of
Harry
Potters
who
are
suffering
for
their
allegiance
lee
was
saying
well
as
regular
listeners
will
know
several
of
the
more
outspoken
supporters
of
Harry
Potter
have
now
been
imprisoned
including
Xenophilius
Lovegood
erstwhile
editor
of
The
Quibbler
said
Lupin
at
least
hes
still
alive
muttered
Ron
we
have
also
heard
within
the
last
few
hours
that
Rubeus
Hagrid
all
three
of
them
gasped
and
so
nearly
missed
the
rest
of
the
sentence
well-known
gamekeeper
at
Hogwarts
School
has
narrowly
escaped
arrest
within
the
grounds
of
Hogwarts
where
he
is
rumored
to
have
hosted
a
Support
Harry
Potter
party
in
his
house
however
Hagrid
was
not
taken
into
custody
and
is
we
believe
on
the
run
i
suppose
it
helps
when
escaping
from
Death
Eaters
if
youve
got
a
sixteen-foot-high
half
brother
asked
Lee
it
would
tend
to
give
you
an
edge
agreed
Lupin
gravely
may
I
just
add
that
while
we
here
at
Potterwatch
applaud
Hagrids
spirit
we
would
urge
even
the
most
devoted
of
Harrys
supporters
against
following
Hagrids
lead
Support
Harry
Potter
parties
are
unwise
in
the
present
climate
indeed
they
are
Romulus
said
Lee
so
we
suggest
that
you
continue
to
show
your
devotion
to
the
man
with
the
lightning
scar
by
listening
to
Potterwatch
and
now
lets
move
to
news
concerning
the
wizard
who
is
proving
just
as
elusive
as
Harry
Potter
we
like
to
refer
to
him
as
the
Chief
Death
Eater
and
here
to
give
his
views
on
some
of
the
more
insane
rumors
circulating
about
him
Id
like
to
introduce
a
new
correspondent
rodent
Rodent
said
yet
another
familiar
voice
and
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
cried
out
together
fred
no
is
it
George
its
Fred
I
think
said
Ron
leaning
in
closer
as
whichever
twin
it
was
said
im
not
being
Rodent
no
way
I
told
you
I
wanted
to
be
Rapier
oh
all
right
then
Rapier
could
you
please
give
us
your
take
on
the
various
stories
weve
been
hearing
about
the
Chief
Death
Eater
yes
River
I
can
said
Fred
as
our
listeners
will
know
unless
theyve
taken
refuge
at
the
bottom
of
a
garden
pond
or
somewhere
similar
You-Know-Whos
strategy
of
remaining
in
the
shadows
is
creating
a
nice
little
climate
of
panic
mind
you
if
all
the
alleged
sightings
of
him
are
genuine
we
must
have
a
good
nineteen
You-Know-Whos
running
around
the
place
which
suits
him
of
course
said
Kingsley
the
air
of
mystery
is
creating
more
terror
than
actually
showing
himself
agreed
said
Fred
so
people
lets
try
and
calm
down
a
bit
things
are
bad
enough
without
inventing
stuff
as
well
for
instance
this
new
idea
that
You-Know-Who
can
kill
people
with
a
single
glance
from
his
eyes
thats
a
basilisk
listeners
one
simple
test
Check
whether
the
thing
thats
glaring
at
you
has
got
legs
if
it
has
its
safe
to
look
into
its
eyes
although
if
it
really
is
You-Know-Who
thats
still
likely
to
be
the
last
thing
you
ever
do
for
the
first
time
in
weeks
and
weeks
Harry
was
laughing
He
could
feel
the
weight
of
tension
leaving
him
and
the
rumors
that
he
keeps
being
sighted
abroad
asked
Lee
well
who
wouldnt
want
a
nice
little
holiday
after
all
the
hard
work
hes
been
putting
in
asked
Fred
point
is
people
dont
get
lulled
into
a
false
sense
of
security
thinking
hes
out
of
the
country
maybe
he
is
maybe
he
isnt
but
the
fact
remains
he
can
move
faster
than
Severus
Snape
confronted
with
shampoo
when
he
wants
to
so
dont
count
on
him
being
a
long
way
away
if
youre
planning
to
take
any
risks
i
never
thought
Id
hear
myself
say
it
but
safety
first
thank
you
very
much
for
those
wise
words
Rapier
said
Lee
listeners
that
brings
us
to
the
end
of
another
Potterwatch
we
dont
know
when
it
will
be
possible
to
broadcast
again
but
you
can
be
sure
we
shall
be
back
keep
twiddling
those
dials
The
next
password
will
be
Mad-Eye
Keep
each
other
safe
Keep
faith
good
night
the
radios
dial
twirled
and
the
lights
behind
the
tuning
panel
went
out
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
were
still
beaming
hearing
familiar
friendly
voices
was
an
extraordinary
tonic
Harry
had
become
so
used
to
their
isolation
he
had
nearly
forgotten
that
other
people
were
resisting
Voldemort
it
was
like
waking
from
a
long
sleep

Ron
happily

Harry
its
so
brave
of
them
sighed
Hermione
admiringly
if
they
were
found
well
they
keep
on
the
move
dont
they
said
Ron
like
us
but
did
you
hear
what
Fred
said
asked
Harry
excitedly
now
the
broadcast
was
over
his
thoughts
turned
around
toward
his
all
consuming
obsession
hes
abroad
hes
still
looking
for
the
Wand
I
knew
it
harry
come
on
Hermione
why
are
you
so
determined
not
to
admit
it
vol
harry
no
demorts
after
the
Elder
Wand
the
names
Taboo
ron
bellowed
leaping
to
his
feet
as
a
loud
crack
sounded
outside
the
tent
i
told
you
Harry
I
told
you
we
cant
say
it
anymore
weve
got
to
put
the
protection
back
around
us
quickly
its
how
they
find
but
Ron
stopped
talking
and
Harry
knew
why
the
Sneakoscope
on
the
table
had
lit
up
and
begun
to
spin
they
could
hear
voices
coming
nearer
and
nearer
rough
excited
voices
ron
pulled
the
Deluminator
out
of
his
pocket
and
clicked
it
Their
lamps
went
out
come
out
of
there
with
your
hands
up
came
a
rasping
voice
through
the
darkness
we
know
youre
in
there
youve
got
half
a
dozen
wands
pointing
at
you
and
we
dont
care
who
we
curse
chapter
Twenty-Three
malfoy
Manor
harry
looked
around
at
the
other
two
now
mere
outlines
in
the
darkness
he
saw
Hermione
point
her
wand
set
toward
the
outside
but
into
his
face
there
was
a
bang
a
burst
of
white
light
and
he
buckled
in
agony
unable
to
see
he
could
feel
his
face
swelling
rapidly
under
his
hands
as
heavy
footfalls
surrounded
him
get
up
vermin
unknown
hands
dragged
Harry
roughly
off
the
ground
before
he
could
stop
them
someone
had
rummaged
through
his
pockets
and
removed
the
blackthorn
wand
harry
clutched
at
his
excruciatingly
painful
face
which
felt
unrecognizable
beneath
his
fingers
tight
swollen
and
puffy
as
though
he
had
suffered
some
violent
allergic
reaction
his
eyes
had
been
reduced
to
slits
through
which
he
could
barely
see
his
glasses
fell
off
as
he
was
bundled
out
of
the
tent
all
he
could
make
out
were
the
blurred
shapes
of
four
or
five
people
wrestling
Ron
and
Hermione
outside
too
get
off
her
ron
shouted
there
was
the
unmistakable
sound
of
knuckles
hitting
flesh
Ron
grunted
in
pain
and
Hermione
screamed
No
leave
him
alone
leave
him
alone
your
boyfriend's
going
to
have
worse
than
that
done
to
him
if
he's
on
my
list
said
the
horribly
familiar
rasping
voice
delicious
girl
what
a
treat
i
do
enjoy
the
softness
of
the
skin
harry's
stomach
turned
over
he
knew
who
this
was
Fenrit
Greyback
the
werewolf
who
was
permitted
to
wear
Death
Eater
robes
in
return
for
his
hired
savagery
search
the
tent
said
another
voice
harry
was
thrown
face
down
onto
the
ground
a
thud
told
him
that
Ron
had
been
cast
down
beside
him
they
could
hear
footsteps
and
crashes
the
men
were
pushing
over
chairs
inside
the
tent
as
they
searched
now
let's
see
who
we've
got
said
greyback's
gloating
voice
from
overhead
and
Harry
was
rolled
over
onto
his
back
a
beam
of
wand
light
fell
onto
his
face
and
Greyback
laughed
i'll
be
needing
butterbeer
to
wash
this
one
down
what
happened
to
you
ugly
harry
did
not
answer
immediately
i
said
repeated
Greyback
and
Harry
received
a
blow
to
the
diaphragm
that
made
him
double
over
in
pain
what
happened
to
you
stung
harry
muttered
been
Stung
yeah
looks
like
it
said
a
second
voice

name

Greyback

said
Harry
and

first
name

Vernon
vernon
Dudley

the
list
Scabior
said
Greyback
and
Harry
head
him
move
sideways
to
look
down
at
Ron
instead
and
what
about
you
ginger
stan
Shunpike
said
Ron
like
ell
you
are
said
the
man
called
Scabior
we
know
Stan
Shunpike
e's
put
a
bit
of
work
our
way
there
was
another
thud
i'b
Bardy
said
Ron
and
Harry
could
tell
that
his
mouth
was
full
of
blood
bardy
Weasley
a
Weasley
rasped
Greyback
so
you're
related
to
blood
traitors
even
if
you're
not
a
Mudblood
and
lastly
your
pretty
little
friend
the
relish
in
his
voice
made
harry's
flesh
crawl
easy
Greyback
said
Scabior
over
the
jeering
of
the
others
oh
i'm
not
going
to
bite
just
yet
we'll
see
if
shes
a
bit
quicker
at
remembering
her
name
than
Barny
who
are
you
girly
penelope
Clearwater
said
Hermione
she
sounded
terrified
but
convincing
what's
your
blood
status
half-Blood
said
Hermione
easy
enough
to
check
said
Scabior
but
the
ole
lot
of
em
look
like
they
could
still
be
ogwarts
age
we'b
lebt
said
Ron
left
ave
you
ginger
said
Scabior
and
you
decided
to
go
camping
and
you
thought
just
for
a
laugh
you'd
use
the
Dark
Lords
name
nod
a
laugh
said
Ron
aggiden
accident
there
was
more
jeering
laughter
you
know
who
used
to
like
using
the
Dark
lord's
name
Weasley
growled
Greyback
The
Order
of
the
Phoenix
mean
anything
to
you
doh
well
they
don't
show
the
Dark
Lord
proper
respect
so
the
name's
been
Tabooed
a
few
Order
members
have
been
tracked
that
way
we'll
see
bind
them
up
with
the
other
two
prisoners
someone
yanked
Harry
up
by
the
hair
dragged
him
a
short
way
pushed
him
down
into
a
sitting
position
then
started
binding
him
back-to-back
with
other
people
harry
was
still
half
blind
barely
able
to
see
anything
through
his
puffed-up
eyes
when
at
last
the
man
tying
then
had
walked
away
Harry
whispered
to
the
other
prisoners
anyone
still
got
a
wand
no.
Said
Ron
and
Hermione
from
either
side
of
him
this
is
all
my
fault
i
said
the
name
i'm
sorry
harry
it
was
a
new
but
familiar
voice
and
it
came
from
directly
behind
Harry
from
the
person
tied
to
hermione's
left
dean
it
is
you
if
they
find
out
who
they've
got
they're
Snatchers
they're
only
looking
for
truants
to
sell
for
gold
not
a
bad
little
haul
for
one
night
greyback
was
saying
as
a
pair
of
hobnailed
boots
marched
close
by
Harry
and
they
heard
more
crashes
from
inside
the
tent
a
Mudblood
a
runaway
goblin
and
these
truants
you
checked
their
names
on
the
list
yet
Scabior
he
roared
yeah
there's
no
Vernon
Dudley
un
ere
Greyback
interesting
said
Greyback
that's
interesting
he
crouched
down
beside
Harry
who
saw
through
the
infinitesimal
gap
left
between
his
swollen
eyelids
a
face
covered
in
matted
gray
hair
and
whiskers
with
pointed
brown
teeth
and
sores
in
the
corners
of
his
mouth
greyback
smelled
as
he
had
done
at
the
top
of
the
tower
where
Dumbledore
had
died
of
dirt
sweat
and
blood
so
you
aren't
wanted
then
Vernon
or
are
you
on
that
list
under
a
different
name
what
house
were
you
in
at
Hogwarts
slytherin
said
Harry
automatically
funny
ow
they
all
thinks
we
wants
to
ear
that
leered
Scabior
out
of
the
shadows
but
none
of
em
can
tell
us
where
the
common
room
is
it's
in
the
dungeons
said
Harry
clearly
you
enter
through
the
wall
it's
full
of
skulls
and
stuff
and
its
under
the
lake
so
the
light's
all
green
there
was
a
short
pause
well
well
looks
like
we
really
ave
caught
a
little
Slytherin
said
Scabior
good
for
you
Vernon
cause
there
ain't
a
lot
of
Mudblood
Slytherins
who's
your
father
he
works
at
the
Ministry
Harry
lied
he
knew
that
his
whole
story
would
collapse
with
the
smallest
investigation
but
on
the
other
hand
he
only
had
until
his
face
regained
its
usual
appearance
before
the
game
was
up
in
any
case
department
of
Magical
Accidents
and
Catastrophes
you
know
what
Greyback
said
Scabior
i
think
there
is
a
Dudley
in
there
harry
could
barely
breathe
Could
luck
sheer
luck
get
them
safely
out
of
this
well
well
said
Greyback
and
Harry
could
hear
the
tiniest
note
of
trepidation
in
that
callous
voice
and
knew
that
Greyback
was
wondering
whether
he
had
just
indeed
just
attacked
and
bound
the
son
of
a
Ministry
Official
harry's
heart
was
pounding
against
the
ropes
around
his
ribs
he
would
not
have
been
surprised
to
know
that
Greyback
could
see
it
if
you're
telling
the
truth
ugly
you've
got
nothing
to
fear
from
a
trip
to
the
Ministry
i
expect
your
father'll
reward
us
just
for
picking
you
up
but
said
Harry
his
mouth
bone
dry
if
you
just
let
us
hey
came
a
shout
from
inside
the
tent
look
at
this
greyback
a
dark
figure
came
bustling
toward
them
and
Harry
saw
a
glint
of
silver
to
the
light
of
their
wands
they
had
found
gryffindor's
sword
ve-e-ery
nice
said
Greyback
appreciatively
taking
it
from
his
companion
oh
very
nice
indeed
looks
goblin-made
that
where
did
you
get
something
like
this
it's
my
father's
Harry
lied
hoping
against
hope
that
it
was
too
dark
for
Greyback
to
see
the
name
etched
just
below
the
hilt
we
borrowed
it
to
cut
firewood
ang
on
a
minute
Greyback
look
at
this
in
the
Prophet
as
Scabior
said
it
harry's
scar
which
was
stretched
tight
across
his
distended
forehead
burned
savagely
more
clearly
than
he
could
make
out
anything
around
him
he
saw
a
towering
building
a
grim
fortress
jet-black
and
forbidding
voldemort's
thoughts
had
suddenly
become
Razor-Sharp
again
he
was
gliding
toward
the
gigantic
building
with
a
sense
of
calmly
euphoric
purpose
so
close
so
close
with
a
huge
effort
of
will
Harry
closed
his
mind
to
voldemort's
thoughts
pulling
himself
back
to
where
he
sat
tied
to
Ron
Hermione
Dean
and
Griphook
in
the
darkness
listening
to
Greyback
and
Scabior
hermione
Granger
Scabior
was
saying
the
Mudblood
who
is
known
to
be
traveling
with
arry
Potter
harry's
scar
burned
in
the
silence
but
he
made
a
supreme
effort
to
keep
himself
present
nor
to
slip
into
voldemort's
mind
he
heard
the
creak
of
greyback's
boots
as
he
crouched
down
in
front
of
Hermione
you
know
what
little
girly
this
picture
looks
a
hell
of
a
lot
like
you
it
isn't
it
isn't
me
hermione's
terrified
squeak
was
as
good
as
a
confession
known
to
be
traveling
with
Harry
Potter
repeated
Greyback
quietly
a
stillness
had
settled
over
the
scene
harry's
scar
was
Exquisitely
painful
but
he
struggled
with
all
his
strength
against
the
pull
of
voldemort's
thoughts
it
had
never
been
so
important
to
remain
in
his
own
right
mind
well
this
changed
things
doesn't
it
whispered
Greyback
nobody
spoke
Harry
sensed
the
gang
of
Snatchers
watching
frozen
and
felt
hermione's
arm
trembling
against
his
greyback
got
up
and
took
a
couple
of
steps
to
where
Harry
sat
crouching
down
again
to
stare
closely
at
his
misshapen
features
what's
that
on
your
forehead
Vernon
he
asked
softly
his
breath
foul
in
harry's
nostrils
as
he
pressed
a
filthy
finger
to
the
taught
scar
don't
touch
it
harry
yelled
he
could
not
stop
himself
he
thought
he
might
be
sick
from
the
pain
of
it
i
thought
you
wore
glasses
Potter
breathed
Greyback
i
found
glasses
yelped
one
of
the
Snatchers
skulking
in
the
background
there
was
glasses
in
the
tent
Greyback
wait
and
seconds
later
harry's
glasses
had
been
rammed
back
onto
his
face
the
Snatchers
were
closing
in
now
peering
at
him
it
Is
rasped
Greyback
we've
caught
Potter
they
all
took
several
steps
backward
stunned
by
what
they
had
done
harry
still
fighting
to
remain
present
in
his
own
splitting
head
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
fragmented
visions
were
breaking
across
the
surface
of
his
mind
he
was
hiding
around
the
high
walls
of
the
black
fortress
no
he
was
Harry
tied
up
and
wandless
in
grave
danger
looking
up
up
to
the
topmost
window
the
highest
tower
he
was
Harry
and
they
were
discussing
his
fate
in
low
voices
time
to
fly
to
the
Ministry
to
hell
with
the
Ministry
growled
Greyback
they'll
take
the
credit
and
we
won't
get
a
look
in
i
say
we
take
him
straight
to
You-Know-Who
will
you
summon
im
ere
said
Scabior
sounding
awed
terrified
no
snarled
Greyback
I
haven't
got
they
say
he's
using
the
malfoy's
place
as
a
base
we'll
take
the
boy
there
harry
thought
he
knew
why
Greyback
was
not
calling
Voldemort
the
werewolf
might
be
allowed
to
wear
Death
Eater
robes
when
they
wanted
to
use
him
but
only
voldemort's
inner
circle
were
branded
with
the
Dark
Mark
Greyback
had
not
been
granted
this
highest
honor
harrys
scar
seared
again
and
he
rose
into
the
night
flying
straight
up
to
the
windows
at
the
very
top
of
the
tower
completely
sure
its
him
Cause
if
it
aint
Greyback
were
dead
whos
in
charge
here
roared
Greyback
covering
his
moment
of
inadequacy
i
say
thats
Potter
and
him
plus
his
wand
thats
two
hundred
thousand
Galleons
right
there
but
if
youre
too
gutless
to
come
along
any
of
you
its
all
for
me
and
with
any
luck
Ill
get
the
girl
thrown
in
The
window
was
the
merest
slit
in
the
black
rock
not
big
enough
for
a
man
to
enter
a
skeletal
figure
was
just
visible
through
it
curled
beneath
a
blanket
dead
or
sleeping
all
right
said
Scabior
all
right
were
in
and
what
about
the
rest
of
em
Greyback
whatll
we
do
with
em
might
as
well
take
the
lot
weve
got
two
Mudbloods
thats
another
ten
Galleons
give
me
the
sword
as
well
if
theyre
rubies
thats
another
small
fortune
right
there
the
prisoners
were
dragged
to
their
feet
harry
could
hear
Hermiones
breathing
fast
and
terrified
grab
hold
and
make
it
tight
ill
do
Potter
said
Greyback
seizing
a
fistful
of
Harrys
hair
Harry
could
feel
his
long
yellow
nails
scratching
his
scalp
on
three
one
two
three
they
Disapparated
pulling
the
prisoners
with
them
harry
struggled
trying
to
throw
off
Greybacks
hand
but
it
was
hopeless
Ron
and
Hermione
were
squeezed
tightly
against
him
on
either
side
he
could
not
separate
from
the
group
and
as
the
breath
was
squeezed
out
of
him
his
scar
seared
more
painfully
still
as
he
forced
himself
through
the
slit
of
a
window
like
a
snake
and
landed
lightly
as
vapor
inside
the
cell-like
room
the
prisoners
lurched
into
one
another
as
they
landed
in
a
country
lane
harrys
eyes
still
puffy
took
a
moment
to
acclimatize
then
he
saw
a
pair
of
wrought-iron
gates
at
the
foot
of
what
looked
like
a
long
drive
he
experienced
the
tiniest
trickle
of
relief
the
worst
had
not
happened
yet
Voldemort
was
not
here
he
was
Harry
knew
for
he
was
fighting
to
resist
the
vision
in
some
strange
fortresslike
place
at
the
top
of
a
tower
how
long
it
would
take
Voldemort
to
get
to
this
place
once
he
knew
that
Harry
was
here
was
another
matter
one
of
the
Snatchers
strode
to
the
gates
and
shook
them
how
do
we
get
in
theyre
locked
Greyback
I
cant
blimey
he
whipped
his
hands
away
in
fright
the
iron
was
contorting
twisting
itself
out
of
the
abstract
furls
and
coils
into
a
frightening
face
which
spoke
in
a
clanging
echoing
voice
state
your
purpose
weve
got
Potter
greyback
roared
triumphantly
weve
captured
Harry
Potter
the
gates
swung
open
come
on
said
Greyback
to
his
men
and
the
prisoners
were
shunted
through
the
gates
and
up
the
drive
between
high
hedges
that
muffled
their
footsteps
harry
saw
a
ghostly
white
shape
above
him
and
realized
it
was
an
albino
peacock
he
stumbled
and
was
dragged
onto
his
feet
by
Greyback
now
he
was
staggering
along
sideways
tied
back-to-back
to
the
four
other
prisoner
closing
his
puffy
eyes
he
allowed
the
pain
in
his
scar
to
overcome
him
for
a
moment
wanting
to
know
what
Voldemort
was
doing
whether
he
knew
yet
that
Harry
was
caught
the
emaciated
figure
stirred
beneath
its
thin
blanket
and
rolled
over
toward
him
eyes
opening
in
a
skull
of
a
face
the
frail
man
sat
up
great
sunken
eyes
fixed
upon
him
upon
Voldemort
and
then
he
smiled
most
of
his
teeth
were
gone
so
you
have
come
i
thought
you
would
one
day
but
your
journey
was
pointless
i
never
had
it
you
lie
as
Voldemorts
anger
throbbed
inside
him
Harrys
scar
threatened
to
burst
with
pain
and
he
wrenched
his
mind
back
to
his
own
body
fighting
to
remain
present
as
the
prisoners
were
pushed
over
gravel
light
spilled
out
over
all
of
them
what
is
this
said
a
womans
cold
voice

He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named

resentment

werewolfs
voice

Greyback

Harry
Potter
greyback

Harry
and
dragged
him
around
to

light
forcing
the
other

Ere

through
his
puffy
eyelids
Harry
saw
Narcissa
Malfoy
scrutinizing
his
swollen
face
scabior
thrust
the
blackthorn
wand
at
her
she
raised
her
eyebrows
bring
them
in
she
said
harry
and
the
others
were
shoved
and
kicked
up
broad
stone
steps
into
a
hallway
lined
with
portraits
follow
me
said
Narcissa
leading
the
way
across
the
hall
my
son
Draco
is
home
for
his
Easter
holidays
if
that
is
Harry
Potter
he
will
know
the
drawing
room
dazzled
after
the
darkness
outside
even
with
his
eyes
almost
closed
Harry
could
make
out
the
wide
proportions
of
the
room
a
crystal
chandelier
hung
from
the
ceiling
more
portraits
against
the
dark
purple
walls
two
figures
rose
from
chairs
in
front
of
an
ornate
marble
fireplace
as
the
prisoners
were
forced
into
the
room
by
the
Snatchers
what
is
this
the
dreadfully
familiar
drawling
voice
of
Lucius
Malfoy
fell
on
Harrys
ears
he
was
panicking
now
he
could
see
no
way
out
and
it
was
easier
as
his
fear
mounted
to
block
out
Voldemorts
thoughts
though
his
scar
was
still
burning
they
say
theyve
got
Potter
said
Narcissas
cold
voice
draco
come
here
harry
did
not
dare
look
directly
at
Draco
but
saw
him
obliquely
a
figure
slightly
taller
than
he
was
rising
from
an
armchair
his
face
a
pale
and
pointed
blur
beneath
white-blond
hair
greyback
forced
the
prisoners
to
turn
again
so
as
to
place
Harry
directly
beneath
the
chandelier
well
boy
rasped
the
werewolf
harry
was
facing
a
mirror
over
the
fireplace
a
great
gilded
thing
in
an
intricately
scrolled
frame
through
the
slits
of
his
eyes
he
saw
his
own
reflection
for
the
first
time
since
leaving
Grimmauld
Place
his
face
was
huge
shiny
and
pink
every
feature
distorted
by
Hermiones
jinx
his
black
hair
reached
his
shoulders
and
there
was
a
dark
shadow
around
his
jaw
had
he
not
known
that
it
was
he
who
stood
there
he
would
have
wondered
who
was
wearing
his
glasses
he
resolved
not
to
speak
for
his
voice
was
sure
to
give
him
away
yet
he
still
avoided
eye
contact
with
Draco
as
the
latter
approached
well
Draco
said
Lucius
Malfoy
he
sounded
avid
is
it
is
it
Harry
Potter
i
cant
I
cant
be
sure
said
Draco
he
was
keeping
his
distance
from
Greyback
and
seemed
as
scared
of
looking
at
Harry
as
Harry
was
of
looking
at
him
but
look
at
him
carefully
look
come
closer
harry
had
never
heard
Lucius
Malfoy
so
excited
draco
if
we
are
the
ones
who
hand
Potter
over
to
the
Dark
Lord
everything
will
be
forgiv
now
we
wont
be
forgetting
who
actually
caught
him
I
hope
mr.
Malfoy
said
Greyback
menacingly
of
course
not
of
course
not
said
Lucius
impatiently
he
approached
Harry
himself
came
so
close
that
Harry
could
see
the
usually
languid
pale
face
in
sharp
detail
even
through
his
swollen
eyes
with
his
face
a
puffy
mask
Harry
felt
as
though
he
was
peering
out
from
between
the
bars
of
a
cage
what
did
you
do
to
him
lucius
asked
Greyback
how
did
he
get
into
this
state
that
wasnt
us
looks
more
like
a
Stinging
Jinx
to
me
said
Lucius
his
gray
eyes
raked
Harrys
forehead
theres
something
there
he
whispered
it
could
be
the
scar
stretched
tight
draco
come
here
look
properly
what
do
you
think
harry
saw
Dracos
face
up
close
now
right
beside
his
fathers
they
were
extraordinarily
alike
except
that
while
his
father
looked
beside
himself
with
excitement
Dracos
expression
was
full
of
reluctance
even
fear
i
dont
know
he
said
and
he
walked
away
toward
the
fireplace
where
his
mother
stood
watching
we
had
better
be
certain
Lucius
Narcissa
called
to
her
husband
in
her
cold
clear
voice
completely
sure
that
it
is
Potter
before
we
summon
the
Dark
Lord
they
say
this
is
his
she
was
looking
closely
at
the
blackthorn
wand
but
it
does
not
resemble
Ollivanders
description
if
we
are
mistaken
if
we
call
the
Dark
Lord
here
for
nothing
remember
what
he
did
to
Rowle
and
Dolohov
what
about
the
Mudblood
then
growled
Greyback
harry
was
nearly
thrown
off
his
feet
as
the
Snatchers
forced
the
prisoners
to
swivel
around
again
so
that
the
light
fell
on
Hermione
instead
wait
said
Narcissa
sharply
yes
yes
she
was
in
Madam
Malkins
with
Potter
i
saw
her
picture
in
the
Prophet
look
Draco
isnt
it
the
Granger
girl
maybe
yeah
but
then
thats
the
Weasley
boy
shouted
Lucius
striding
around
the
bound
prisoners
to
face
Ron
its
them
Potters
friends
Draco
look
at
him
isnt
it
Arthur
Weasleys
son
whats
his
name
yeah
said
Draco
again
his
back
to
the
prisoners
it
could
be
the
drawing
room
door
opened
behind
Harry
a
woman
spoke
and
the
sound
of
the
voice
wound
Harrys
fear
to
an
even
higher
pitch
what
is
this
whats
happened
Cissy
bellatrix
Lestrange
walked
slowly
around
the
prisoners
and
stopped
on
Harrys
right
staring
at
Hermione
through
her
heavily
lidded
eyes
but
surely
she
said
quietly
this
is
the
Mudblood
girl
this
is
Grander
yes
yes
its
Granger
cried
Lucius
And
beside
her
we
think
Potter
potter
and
his
friends
caught
at
last
potter
shrieked
Bellatrix
and
she
backed
away
the
better
to
take
in
Harry
are
you
sure
well
then
the
Dark
Lord
must
be
informed
at
once
she
dragged
back
her
left
sleeve
Harry
saw
the
Dark
Mark
burned
into
the
flesh
of
her
arm
and
knew
that
she
was
about
to
touch
it
to
summon
her
beloved
master
i
was
about
to
call
him
said
Lucius
and
his
hand
actually
closed
upon
Bellatrixs
wrist
preventing
her
from
touching
the
Mark
i
shall
summon
him
Bella
potter
has
been
brought
to
my
house
and
it
is
therefore
upon
my
authority
your
authority
she
sneered
attempting
to
wrench
her
hand
from
his
grasp
you
lost
your
authority
when
you
lost
your
wand
Lucius
how
dare
you
take
your
hands
off
me
this
is
nothing
to
do
with
you
you
did
not
capture
the
boy
begging
your
pardon
mr.
Malfoy
interjected
Greyback
but
its
us
that
caught
Potter
and
its
us
thatll
be
claiming
the
gold
gold
laughed
Bellatrix
still
attempting
to
throw
off
her
brother-in-law
her
free
hand
groping
in
her
pocket
for
her
wand
take
your
gold
filthy
scavenger
what
do
I
want
with
gold
i
seek
only
the
honor
of
his
of
she
stopped
struggling
her
dark
eyes
fixed
upon
something
Harry
could
not
see
jubilant
at
her
capitulation
Lucius
threw
her
hand
from
him
and
ripped
up
his
own
sleeve
stop
shrieked
Bellatrix
Do
not
touch
it
we
shall
all
perish
if
the
Dark
Lord
comes
now
lucius
froze
his
index
finger
hovering
over
his
own
Mark
bellatrix
strode
out
of
Harrys
limited
line
of
vision
what
is
that
he
heard
her
say
sword
grunted
an
out-of-sight
Snatcher
give
it
to
me
its
not
yours
missus
its
mine
I
reckon
I
found
it
there
was
a
bang
and
a
flash
of
red
light
Harry
knew
that
the
Snatcher
had
been
Stunned
there
was
a
roar
of
anger
from
his
fellows
Scabior
drew
his
wand
what
dyou
think
youre
playing
at
woman
stupefy
she
screamed
Stupefy
they
were
no
match
for
her
even
thought
there
were
four
of
them
against
one
of
her
She
was
a
witch
as
Harry
knew
with
prodigious
skill
and
no
conscience
they
fell
where
they
stood
all
except
Greyback
who
had
been
forced
into
a
kneeling
position
his
arms
outstretched
out
of
the
corners
of
his
eyes
Harry
saw
Bellatrix
bearing
down
upon
the
werewolf
the
sword
of
Gryffindor
gripped
tightly
in
her
hand
her
face
waxen
where
did
you
get
this
sword
she
whispered
to
Greyback
as
she
pulled
his
wand
out
of
his
unresisting
grip
how
dare
you
he
snarled
his
mouth
the
only
thing
that
could
move
as
he
was
forced
to
gaze
up
at
her
he
bared
his
pointed
teeth
release
me
woman
where
did
you
find
this
sword
she
repeated
brandishing
it
in
his
face
Snape
sent
it
to
my
vault
in
Gringotts
it
was
in
their
tent
rasped
Greyback
release
me
I
say
she
waved
her
wand
and
the
werewolf
sprang
to
his
feet
but
appeared
too
wary
to
approach
her
he
prowled
behind
an
armchair
his
filthy
curved
nails
clutching
its
back
draco
move
this
scum
outside
said
Bellatrix
indicating
the
unconscious
men
if
you
havent
got
the
guts
to
finish
them
then
leave
them
in
the
courtyard
for
me
dont
you
dare
speak
to
Draco
like
said
Narcissa
furiously
but
Bellatrix
screamed
be
quiet
the
situation
is
graver
than
you
can
possibly
imagine
Cissy
we
have
a
very
serious
problem
she
stood
panting
slightly
looking
down
at
the
sword
examining
its
hilt
then
she
turned
to
look
at
the
silent
prisoners
if
it
is
indeed
Potter
he
must
not
be
harmed
she
muttered
more
to
herself
than
to
the
others
the
Dark
Lord
wishes
to
dispose
of
Potter
himself
but
if
he
finds
out
i
must
i
must
know
she
turned
back
to
her
sister
again
the
prisoners
must
be
placed
in
the
cellar
while
I
think
what
to
do
this
is
my
house
Bella
you
dont
give
orders
in
my
do
it
you
have
no
idea
of
the
danger
were
in
shrieked
Bellatrix
she
looked
frightening
mad
a
thin
stream
of
fire
issued
from
her
wand
and
burned
a
hole
in
the
carpet
narcissa
hesitated
for
a
moment
then
addressed
the
werewolf
take
these
prisoners
down
to
the
cellar
Greyback
wait
said
Bellatrix
sharply
all
except
except
for
the
Mudblood
greyback
gave
a
grunt
of
pleasure
no
shouted
Ron
you
can
have
me
keep
me
bellatrix
hit
him
across
the
face
the
blow
echoed
around
the
room
if
she
dies
under
questioning
Ill
take
you
next
she
said
blood
traitor
is
next
to
Mudblood
in
my
book
take
them
downstairs
Greyback
and
make
sure
they
are
secure
but
do
nothing
more
to
them
yet
she
threw
Greybacks
wand
back
to
him
then
took
a
short
silver
knife
from
under
her
robes
she
cut
Hermione
free
from
the
other
prisoners
then
dragged
her
by
the
hair
into
the
middle
of
the
room
while
Greyback
forced
the
rest
of
them
to
shuffle
across
to
another
door
into
a
dark
passageway
his
wand
held
out
in
front
of
him
projecting
an
invisible
and
irresistible
force
reckon
shell
let
me
have
a
bit
of
the
girl
when
shes
finished
with
her
greyback
crooned
as
he
forced
them
along
the
corridor
id
say
Ill
get
a
bite
or
two
wouldnt
you
ginger
harry
could
feel
Ron
shaking
they
were
forced
down
a
steep
flight
of
stairs
still
tied
back-to-back
and
in
danger
of
slipping
and
breaking
their
necks
at
any
moment
at
the
bottom
was
a
heavy
door
greyback
unlocked
it
with
a
tap
of
his
wand
then
forced
them
into
a
dank
and
musty
room
and
left
them
in
total
darkness
the
echoing
bang
of
the
slammed
cellar
door
had
not
died
away
before
there
was
a
terrible
drawn
out
scream
from
directly
above
them
hermione
ron
bellowed
and
he
started
to
writhe
and
struggle
against
the
ropes
tying
them
together
so
that
Harry
staggered
hermione
be
quiet
harry
said
shut
up
ron

need
to
work
out
a
way
hermione
hermione
we
need
a
plan

yelling
we
need
to
get
these
ropes
off
harry
came
a
whisper
through
the
darkness
ron
is
that
you
ron
stopped
shouting
there
was
a
sound
of
movement
close
by
them
then
Harry
saw
a
shadow
moving
closer
harry
ron
luna
yes
its
me
oh
no
I
didnt
want
you
to
be
caught
luna
can

said
Harry
oh

I
expect
so
theres
an
old
nail
we
use
if
we
need
to
break
anything
just
a
moment
hermione
screamed
again
from
overhead
and
they
could
hear
Bellatrix
screaming
too
but
her
words
were
inaudible
for
Ron
shouted
again
hermione
hermione
mr.
Ollivander
harry
could
hear
Luna
saying
mr.
Ollivander
have
you
got
the
nail
if

over
a
little
bit
i
think
it
was
beside
the
water
jug
she
was
back
within
seconds
youll
need
to
stay
still
she
said
harry
could
feel
her
digging
at
the
ropes
tough
fibers
to
work
the
knots
free
from
upstairs
they
heard
Bellatrixs
voice
im
going
to
ask
you
again
where
did
you
get
this
sword
where
we
found
it
we
found
it

hermione
screamed
again
Ron
struggled
harder
than
ever
and
the
rusty
nail
slipped
onto
Harrys
wrist
ron
please
stay
still
luna
whispered
i
cant
see
what
Im
doing
my
pocket
said
Ron
In
my
pocket
theres
a
Deluminator
and
its
full
of
light
a
few
seconds
later
there
was
a
click
and
the
luminescent
spheres
the
Deluminator
had
sucked
from
the
lamps
in
the
tent
flew
into
the
cellar
Unable
to
rejoin
their
sources
they
simply
hung
there
like
tiny
suns
flooding
the
underground
room
with
light
harry
saw
Luna
all
eyes
in
her
white
face
and
the
motionless
figure
of
Ollivander
the
wandmaker
curled
up
on
the
floor
in
the
corner
craning
around
he
caught
sight
of
their
fellow
prisoners
Dean
and
Griphook
the
goblin
who
seemed
barely
conscious
kept
standing
by
the
ropes
that
bound
him
to
the
humans
oh
thats
much
easier
thanks
Ron
said
Luna
and
she
began
hacking
at
their
bindings
again
hello
Dean
from
above
came
Bellatrixs
voice

lying
filthy
Mudblood
and
I
know

inside
my
vault

Gringotts

else

me
the
truth
or
I
swear
I
shall
run
you
through
with
this
knife
there
harry
felt
the
ropes
fall
away
and
turned
rubbing
his
wrists
to
see
Ron
running
around
the
cellar
looking
up
at
the
low
ceiling
searching
for
a
trapdoor
dean
his
face
bruised
and
bloody
said
Thanks
to
Luna
and
stood
there
shivering
but
Griphook
sank
onto
the
cellar
floor
looking
groggy
and
disoriented
many
welts
across
his
swarthy
face
ron
was
now
trying
to
Disapparate
without
a
wand
theres
no
way
out
Ron
said
Luna
watching
his
fruitless
efforts
the
cellar
is
completely
escape-proof
i
tried
at
first
mr.
Ollivander
has
been
here
for
a
long
time
hes
tried
everything
hermione
was
screaming
again
The
sound
went
through
Harry
like
physical
pain
barely
conscious
of
the
fierce
prickling
of
his
scar
he
too
started
to
run
around
the
cellar
feeling
the
walls
for
he
hardly
knew
what
knowing
in
his
heart
that
it
was
useless
what
else
did
you
take
what
else
answer
me
crucio
hermiones
screams
echoed
off
the
walls
upstairs
Ron
was
half
sobbing
as
he
pounded
the
walls
with
his
fists
and
Harry
in
utter
desperation
seized
Hagrids
pouch
from
around
his
neck
and
groped
inside
it
He
pulled
out
Dumbledores
Snitch
and
shook
it
hoping
for
he
did
not
know
what
nothing
happened
he
waved
the
broken
halves
of
the
phoenix
wand
but
they
were
lifeless
the
mirror
fragment
fell
sparkling
to
the
floor
and
he
saw
a
gleam
of
brightest
blue
dumbledores
eye
was
gazing
at
him
out
of
the
mirror
help
us
he
yelled
at
it
in
mad
desperation
were
in
the
cellar
of
Malfoy
Manor
help
us
the
eye
blinked
and
was
gone
harry
was
not
even
sure
that
it
had
really
been
there
he
tilted
the
shard
of
mirror
this
way
and
that
and
saw
nothing
reflected
there
but
the
walls
and
ceiling
of
their
prison
and
upstairs
Hermione
was
screaming
worse
than
ever
and
next
to
him
Ron
was
bellowing
hermione
hermione
how
did
you
get
into
my
vault
they
heard
Bellatrix
scream
did
that
dirty
little
goblin
in
the
cellar

harry
dashed
across
the
cellar
to
where
Griphook
was
huddled
on
the
floor
griphook
he
whispered
into
the
goblins
pointed
ear

them

mustnt
know
its
the
real
one
Griphook

he
could
hear
someone
scuttling
own
the
cellar
steps
next
moment
Dracos
shaking
voice
spoke
from
behind
the
door
stand
back
line
up
against
the
back
wall
dont
try
anything
or
Ill
kill
you
they
did
as
they
were
bidden
as
the
lock
turned
Ron
clicked
the
Deluminator
and
the
lights
whisked
back
into
his
pocket
restoring
the
cellars
darkness
the
door
flew
open
Malfoy
marched
inside
wand
held
out
in
front
of
him
pale
and
determined
he
seized
the
little
goblin
by
the
arm
and
backed
out
again
dragging
Griphook
with
him
the
door
slammed
shut
and
at
the
same
moment
a
loud
crack
echoed
inside
the
cellar
ron
clicked
the
Deluminator
three
balls
of
light
flew
back
into
the
air
from
his
pocket
revealing
Dobby
the
house-elf
who
had
just
Apparated
into
their
midst
dob
harry
hit
Ron
on
the
arm
to
stop
him
shouting
and
Ron
looked
terrified
at
his
mistake
footsteps
crossed
the
ceiling
overhead
Draco
marching
Griphook
to
Bellatrix
dobbys
enormous
tennis-ball
shaped
eyes
were
wide
he
was
trembling
from
his
feet
to
the
tips
of
his
ears
he
was
back
in
the
home
of
his
old
masters
and
it
was
clear
that
he
was
petrified
harry
Potter
he
squeaked
in
the
tiniest
quiver
of
a
voice
Dobby
has
come
to
rescue
you
but
how
did
you
an
awful
scream
drowned
Harrys
words
Hermione
was
being
tortured
again
he
cut
to
the
essentials
you
can
Disapparate
out
of
this
cellar
he
asked
Dobby
who
nodded
his
ears
flapping
and
you
can
take
humans
with
you
dobby
nodded
again
right
dobby
I
want
you
to
grab
Luna
Dean
and
mr.
Ollivander
and
take
them
take
them
to
bill
and
Fleurs
said
Ron
shell
Cottage
on
the
outskirts
of
Tinworth
the
elf
nodded
for
a
third
time
and
then
come
back
said
Harry
can
you
do
that
Dobby
of
course
Harry
Potter
whispered
the
little
elf
he
hurried
over
to
mr.
Ollivander
who
appeared
to
be
barely
conscious
he
took
one
of
the
wandmakers
hands
in
his
own
then
held
out
the
other
to
Luna
and
Dean
neither
of
whom
moved
harry
we
want
to
help
you
luna
whispered
we
cant
leave
you
here
said
Dean
go
both
of
you
well
see
you
at
Bill
and
Fleurs
as
Harry
spoke
his
scar
burned
worse
than
ever
and
for
a
few
seconds
he
looked
down
not
upon
the
wandmaker
but
on
another
man
who
was
just
as
old
just
as
thin
but
laughing
scornfully
kill
me
then
voldemort
I
welcome
death
but
my
death
will
not
bring
you
what
you
seek
there
is
so
much
you
do
not
understand
he
felt
Voldemorts
fury
but
as
Hermione
screamed
again
he
shut
it
out
returning
to
the
cellar
and
the
horror
of
his
own
present
go
harry
beseeched
to
Luna
and
Dean
go
well
follow
just
go
they
caught
hold
of
the
elfs
outstretched
fingers
there
was
another
loud
crack
and
Dobby
Luna
Dean
and
Ollivander
vanished
what
was
that
shouted
Lucius
Malfoy
from
over
their
heads
did
you
hear
that
what
was
that
noise
in
the
cellar
harry
and
Ron
stared
at
each
other
draco
no
call
Wormtail
make
him
go
and
check
footsteps
crossed
the
room
overhead
then
there
was
silence
harry
knew
that
the
people
in
the
drawing
room
were
listening
for
more
noises
from
the
cellar
were
going
to
have
to
try
and
tackle
him
he
whispered
to
Ron
they
had
no
choice
The
moment
anyone
entered
the
room
and
saw
the
absence
of
three
prisoners
they
were
lost
leave
the
lights
on
Harry
added
and
as
they
heard
someone
descending
the
steps
outside
the
door
they
backed
against
the
wall
on
either
side
of
it
stand
back
came
Wormtails
voice
stand
away
from
the
door
im
coming
in
the
door
flew
open
for
a
split
second
Wormtail
gazed
into
the
apparently
empty
cellar
ablaze
with
light
from
the
three
miniature
suns
floating
in
midair
then
Harry
and
Ron
launched
themselves
upon
him
ron
seized
Wormtails
wand
arm
and
forced
it
upwards
harry
slapped
a
hand
to
his
mouth
muffling
his
voice
silently
they
struggled
Wormtails
wand
emitted
sparks
his
silver
hand
closed
around
Harrys
throat
what
is
it
Wormtail
called
Lucius
Malfoy
from
above
nothing
ron
called
back
in
a
passable
imitation
of
Wormtails
wheezy
voice
all
fine
harry
could
barely
breathe
youre
going
to
kill
me
harry
choked
attempting
to
prise
off
the
metal
fingers
after
I
saved
your
life
you
owe
me
Wormtail
the
silver
fingers
slackened
harry
had
not
expected
it
He
wrenched
himself
free
astonished
keeping
his
hand
over
Wormtails
mouth
he
saw
the
ratlike
mans
small
watery
eyes
widen
with
fear
and
surprise
He
seemed
just
as
shocked
as
Harry
at
what
his
hand
had
done
at
the
tiny
merciful
impulse
it
had
betrayed
and
he
continued
to
struggle
more
powerfully
as
though
to
undo
that
moment
of
weakness
and
well
have
that
whispered
Ron
tugging
Wormtails
wand
from
his
other
hand
wandless
helpless
Pettigrews
pupils
dilated
in
terror
his
eyes
had
slid
from
Harrys
face
to
something
else
his
own
silver
fingers
were
moving
inexorably
toward
his
own
throat
no
without
pausing
to
think
Harry
tried
to
drag
back
the
hand
but
there
was
no
stopping
it
the
silver
tool
that
Voldemort
had
given
his
most
cowardly
servant
had
turned
upon
its
disarmed
and
useless
owner
Pettigrew
was
reaping
his
reward
for
his
hesitation
his
moment
of
pity
he
was
being
strangled
before
their
eyes
no
ron
had
released
Wormtail
too
and
together
he
and
Harry
tried
to
pull
the
crushing
metal
fingers
from
around
Wormtails
throat
but
it
was
no
use
pettigrew
was
turning
blue
relashio
said
Ron
pointing
the
wand
at
the
silver
hand
but
nothing
happened
Pettigrew
dropped
to
his
knees
and
at
the
same
moment
Hermione
gave
a
dreadful
scream
from
overhead
wormtails
eyes
rolled
upward
in
his
purple
face
he
gave
a
last
twitch
and
was
still
harry
and
Ron
looked
at
each
other
then
leaving
Wormtails
body
on
the
floor
behind
them
ran
up
the
stairs
and
back
into
the
shadowy
passageway
leading
to
the
drawing
room
cautiously
they
crept
along
it
until
they
reached
the
drawing
room
door
which
was
ajar
now
they
had
a
clear
view
of
Bellatrix
looking
down
at
Griphook
who
was
holding
Gryffindors
sword
in
his
long-fingered
hands
hermione
was
lying
at
Bellatrixs
feet
she
was
barely
stirring
well
bellatrix
said
to
Griphook
is
it
the
true
sword
harry
waited
holding
his
breath
fighting
against
the
prickling
of
his
scar
no
said
Griphook
it
is
a
fake
are
you
sure
panted
Bellatrix
quite
sure
yes
said
the
goblin
relief
broke
across
her
face
all
tension
drained
from
it
good
she
said
and
with
a
casual
flick
of
her
wand
she
slashed
another
deep
cut
into
the
goblins
face
and
he
dropped
with
a
yell
at
her
feet
she
kicked
him
aside
and
now
she
said
in
a
voice
that
burst
with
triumph
we
call
the
Dark
Lord
and
she
pushed
back
her
sleeve
and
touched
her
forefinger
to
the
Dark
Mark
at
once
Harrys
scar
felt
as
though
it
had
split
open
again
his
true
surroundings
vanished
He
was
Voldemort
and
the
skeletal
wizard
before
him
was
laughing
toothlessly
at
him
he
was
enraged
at
the
summons
he
felt
he
had
warned
them
he
had
told
them
to
summon
him
for
nothing
less
than
Potter
if
they
were
mistaken
kill
me
then
demanded
the
old
man
you
will
not
win
you
cannot
win
that
wand
will
never
ever
be
yours
and
Voldemorts
fury
broke
A
burst
of
green
light
filled
the
prison
room
and
the
frail
old
body
was
lifted
from
its
hard
bed
and
then
fell
back
lifeless
and
Voldemort
returned
to
the
window
his
wrath
barely
controllable
they
would
suffer
his
retribution
if
they
had
no
good
reason
for
calling
him
back
and
I
think
said
Bellatrixs
voice
we
can
dispose
of
the
Mudblood
greyback
take
her
if
you
want
her
noooooooooooo
ron
had
burst
into
the
drawing
room
Bellatrix
looked
around
shocked
she
turned
her
wand
to
face
Ron
instead
expelliarmus
he
roared
pointing
Wormtails
wand
at
Bellatrix
and
hers
flew
into
the
air
and
was
caught
by
Harry
who
had
sprinted
after
Ron
lucius
Narcissa
Draco
and
Greyback
wheeled
about
Harry
yelled
Stupefy
and
Lucius
Malfoy
collapsed
onto
the
hearth
jets
of
light
flew
from
Dracos
Narcissas
and
Greybacks
wands
Harry
threw
himself
to
the
floor
rolling
behind
a
sofa
to
avoid
them
stop
or
she
dies
panting
Harry
peered
around
the
edge
of
the
sofa
bellatrix
was
supporting
Hermione
who
seemed
to
be
unconscious
and
was
holding
her
short
silver
knife
to
Hermiones
throat
drop
your
wands
she
whispered
drop
them
or
well
see
exactly
how
filthy
her
blood
is
ron
stood
rigid
clutching
Wormtails
wand
harry
straightened
up
still
holding
Bellatrixs
i
said
drop
them
she
screeched
pressing
the
blade
into
Hermiones
throat
Harry
saw
beads
of
blood
appear
there
all
right
he
shouted
and
he
dropped
Bellatrixs
wand
onto
the
floor
at
his
feet
Ron
did
the
same
with
Wormtails
both
raised
their
hands
to
shoulder
height
good
she
leered
draco
pick
them
up
the
Dark
Lord
is
coming
Harry
Potter
your
death
approaches
harry
knew
it
his
scar
was
bursting
with
the
pain
of
it
and
he
could
feel
Voldemort
flying
through
the
sky
from
far
away
over
a
dark
and
stormy
sea
and
soon
he
would
be
close
enough
to
Apparate
to
them
and
Harry
could
see
no
way
out
now
said
Bellatrix
softly
as
Draco
hurried
back
to
her
with
the
wands
cissy
I
think
we
ought
to
tie
these
little
heroes
up
again
while
Greyback
takes
care
of
Miss
Mudblood
i
am
sure
the
Dark
Lord
will
not
begrudge
you
the
girl
Greyback
after
what
you
have
done
tonight
at
the
last
word
there
was
a
peculiar
grinding
noise
from
above
all
of
them
looked
upward
in
time
to
see
the
crystal
chandelier
tremble
then
with
a
creak
and
an
ominous
jingling
it
began
to
fall
bellatrix
was
directly
beneath
it
dropping
Hermione
she
threw
herself
aside
with
a
scream
the
chandelier
crashed
to
the
floor
in
an
explosion
of
crystal
and
chains
falling
on
top
of
Hermione
and
the
goblin
who
still
clutched
the
sword
of
Gryffindor
glittering
shards
of
crystal
flew
in
all
directions
Draco
doubled
over
his
hands
covering
his
bloody
face
as
Ron
ran
to
pull
Hermione
out
of
the
wreckage
Harry
took
the
chance
He
leapt
over
an
armchair
and
wrested
the
three
wands
from
Dracos
grip
pointed
all
of
them
at
Greyback
and
yelled
Stupefy
the
werewolf
was
lifted
off
his
feet
by
the
triple
spell
flew
up
to
the
ceiling
and
then
smashed
to
the
ground
as
Narcissa
dragged
Draco
out
of
the
way
of
further
harm
Bellatrix
sprang
to
her
feet
her
hair
flying
as
she
brandished
the
silver
knife
but
Narcissa
had
directed
her
wand
at
the
doorway
dobby
she
screamed
and
even
Bellatrix
froze
you
you
dropped
the
chandelier
the
tiny
elf
trotted
into
the
room
his
shaking
finger
pointing
at
his
old
mistress
you
must
not
hurt
Harry
Potter
he
squeaked
kill
him
Cissy
shrieked
Bellatrix
but
there
was
another
loud
crack
and
Narcissas
wand
too
flew
into
the
air
and
landed
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
you
dirty
little
monkey
bawled
Bellatrix
how
dare
you
take
a
witchs
wand
how
dare
you
defy
your
masters
dobby
has
no
master
squealed
the
elf
dobby
is
a
free
elf
and
Dobby
has
come
to
save
Harry
Potter
and
his
friends
harrys
scar
was
blinding
him
with
pain
dimly
he
knew
that
they
had
moments
seconds
before
Voldemort
was
with
them
ron
catch
and
go
he
yelled
throwing
one
of
the
wands
to
him
then
he
bent
down
to
tug
Griphook
out
from
under
the
chandelier
hoisting
the
groaning
goblin
who
still
clung
to
the
sword
over
one
shoulder
Harry
seized
Dobbys
hand
and
spun
on
the
spot
to
Disapparate
as
he
turned
into
darkness
he
caught
one
last
view
of
the
drawing
room
of
the
pale
frozen
figures
of
Narcissa
and
Draco
of
the
streak
of
red
that
was
Rons
hair
and
a
blue
of
flying
silver
as
Bellatrixs
knife
flew
across
the
room
at
the
place
where
he
was
vanishing
bill
and
Fleurs
shell
Cottage
bill
and
Fleurs
he
had
disappeared
into
the
unknown
all
he
could
do
was
repeat
the
name
of
the
destination
and
hope
that
it
would
suffice
to
take
him
there
the
pain
in
his
forehead
pierced
him
and
the
weight
of
the
goblin
bore
down
upon
him
he
could
feel
the
blade
of
Gryffindors
sword
bumping
against
his
back
Dobbys
hand
jerked
in
his
he
wondered
whether
the
elf
was
trying
to
take
charge
to
pull
them
in
the
right
direction
and
tried
by
squeezing
the
fingers
to
indicate
that
that
was
fine
with
them
and
then
they
hit
solid
earth
and
smelled
salty
air
harry
fell
to
his
knees
relinquished
Dobbys
hand
and
attempted
to
lower
Griphook
gently
to
the
ground
are
you
all
right
he
said
as
the
goblin
stirred
but
Griphook
merely
whimpered
harry
squinted
around
through
the
darkness
there
seemed
to
be
a
cottage
a
short
way
away
under
the
wide
starry
sky
and
he
thought
he
saw
movement
outside
it
dobby
is
this
Shell
Cottage
he
whispered
clutching
the
two
wands
he
had
brought
from
the
Malfoys
ready
to
fight
if
he
needed
to
have
we
come
to
the
right
place
dobby
he
looked
around
the
little
elf
stood
feet
from
him
dobby
the
elf
swayed
slightly
stars
reflected
in
his
wide
shining
eyes
together
he
and
Harry
looked
down
at
the
silver
hilt
of
the
knife
protruding
from
the
elfs
heaving
chest
dobby
no
help
harry
bellowed
toward
the
cottage
toward
the
people
moving
there
help
he
did
not
know
or
care
whether
they
were
wizards
or
Muggles
friends
or
foes
all
he
cared
about
was
that
a
dark
stain
was
spreading
across
Dobbys
front
and
that
he
had
stretched
out
his
own
arms
to
Harry
with
a
look
of
supplication
harry
caught
him
and
laid
him
sideways
on
the
cool
grass
dobby
no
dont
die
dont
die
the
elfs
eyes
found
him
and
his
lips
trembled
with
the
effort
to
form
words
harry
potter
and
then
with
a
little
shudder
the
elf
became
quite
still
and
his
eyes
were
nothing
more
than
great
glassy
orbs
sprinkled
with
light
from
the
stars
they
could
not
see
chapter
Twenty-Four
the
Wandmaker
it
was
like
sinking
into
an
old
nightmare
for
an
instant
Harry
knelt
again
beside
Dumbledores
body
at
the
foot
of
the
tallest
tower
at
Hogwarts
but
in
reality
he
was
staring
at
a
tiny
body
curled
upon
the
grass
pierced
by
Bellatrixs
silver
knife
harrys
voice
was
still
saying
Dobby
dobby
even
though
he
knew
that
the
elf
had
gone
where
he
could
not
call
him
back
after
a
minute
or
so
he
realized
that
they
had
after
all
come
to
the
right
place
for
here
were
Bill
and
Fleur
Dean
and
Luna
gathering
around
him
as
he
knelt
over
the
elf
hermione
he
said
suddenly
where
is
she
rons
taken
her
inside
said
Bill
shell
be
all
right
harry
looked
back
down
at
Dobby
he
stretched
out
a
hand
and
pulled
the
sharp
blade
from
the
elfs
body
then
dragged
off
his
own
jacket
and
covered
Dobby
in
it
like
a
blanket
the
sea
was
rushing
against
the
rock
somewhere
nearby
Harry
listened
to
it
while
the
others
talked
discussing
matters
in
which
he
could
take
no
interest
making
decisions
Dean
carried
the
injured
Griphook
into
the
house
Fleur
hurrying
with
them
now
Bill
was
really
knowing
what
he
was
saying
as
he
did
so
he
gazed
down
at
the
tiny
body
and
his
scar
prickled
and
burned
and
in
one
part
of
his
mind
viewed
as
if
from
the
wrong
end
of
a
long
telescope
he
saw
Voldemort
punishing
those
they
had
left
behind
at
the
Malfoy
Manor
his
rage
was
dreadful
and
yet
Harrys
grief
for
Dobby
seemed
to
diminish
it
so
that
it
became
a
distant
storm
that
reached
Harry
from
across
a
vast
silent
ocean
i
want
to
do
it
properly
were
the
first
words
of
which
Harry
was
fully
conscious
of
speaking
not
by
magic
have
you
got
a
spade
and
shortly
afterward
he
had
set
to
work
alone
digging
the
grave
in
the
place
that
Bill
had
shown
him
at
the
end
of
the
garden
between
bushes
he
dug
with
a
kind
of
fury
relishing
the
manual
work
glorying
in
the
non-magic
of
it
for
every
drop
of
his
sweat
and
every
blister
felt
like
a
gift
to
the
elf
who
had
saved
their
lives
his
scar
burned
but
he
was
master
of
the
pain
he
felt
it
yet
was
apart
from
it
he
had
learned
control
at
last
learned
to
shut
his
mind
to
Voldemort
the
very
thing
Dumbledore
had
wanted
him
to
learn
from
Snape
just
as
Voldemort
had
not
been
able
to
possess
Harry
while
Harry
was
consumed
with
grief
for
Sirius
so
his
thoughts
could
not
penetrate
Harry
now
while
he
mourned
Dobby
grief
it
seemed
drove
Voldemort
out
though
Dumbledore
of
course
would
have
said
that
it
was
love
on
Harry
dug
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
hard
cold
earth
subsuming
his
grief
in
sweat
denying
the
pain
in
his
scar
in
the
darkness
with
nothing
but
the
sound
of
his
own
breath
and
the
rushing
sea
to
keep
him
company
the
things
that
had
happened
at
the
Malfoys
returned
to
him
the
things
he
had
heard
came
back
to
him
and
understanding
blossomed
in
the
darkness
the
steady
rhythm
of
his
arms
beat
time
with
his
thoughts
hallows
horcruxes
hallows
horcruxes
yet
no
longer
burned
with
that
weird
obsessive
longing
loss
and
fear
had
snuffed
it
out
he
felt
as
though
he
had
been
slapped
awake
again
deeper
and
deeper
Harry
sank
into
the
grave
and
he
knew
where
Voldemort
had
been
tonight
and
whom
he
had
killed
in
the
topmost
cell
of
Nurmengard
and
why
and
he
thought
of
Wormtail
dead
because
of
one
small
unconscious
impulse
of
mercy
dumbledore
had
foreseen
that
how
much
more
had
he
known
harry
lost
track
of
time
he
knew
only
that
the
darkness
had
lightened
a
few
degrees
when
he
was
rejoined
by
Ron
and
Dean
hows
Hermione
better
said
Ron
fleurs
looking
after
her
harry
had
his
retort
ready
for
when
they
asked
him
why
he
had
not
simply
created
a
perfect
grave
with
his
wand
but
he
did
not
need
it
they
jumped
down
into
the
hole
he
had
made
with
spades
of
their
own
and
together
they
worked
in
silence
until
the
hole
seemed
deep
enough
harry
wrapped
the
elf
more
snuggly
in
his
jacket
ron
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
grave
and
stripped
off
his
shoes
and
socks
which
he
placed
on
the
elfs
bare
feet
dean
produced
a
woolen
hat
which
Harry
placed
carefully
upon
Dobbys
head
muffling
his
batlike
ears
we
should
close
his
eyes
harry
had
not
heard
the
others
coming
through
the
darkness
bill
was
wearing
a
traveling
cloak
Fleur
a
large
white
apron
from
the
pocket
of
which
protruded
a
bottle
of
what
Harry
recognized
to
be
Skele-Gro
hermione
was
wrapped
in
a
borrowed
dressing
gown
pale
and
unsteady
on
her
feet
Ron
put
an
arm
around
her
when
she
reached
him
luna
who
was
huddled
in
one
of
Fleurs
coats
crouched
down
and
placed
her
fingers
tenderly
upon
each
of
the
elfs
eyelids
sliding
them
over
his
glassy
stare
there
she
said
softly
now
he
could
be
sleeping
harry
placed
the
elf
into
the
grave
arranged
his
tiny
limbs
so
that
he
might
have
been
resting
then
climbed
out
and
gazed
for
the
last
time
upon
the
little
body
he
forced
himself
not
to
break
down
as
he
remembered
Dumbledores
funeral
and
the
rows
and
rows
of
golden
chairs
and
the
Minister
of
Magic
in
the
front
row
the
recitation
of
dumbledores
achievements
the
stateliness
of
the
white
marble
tomb
he
felt
that
Dobby
deserved
just
as
grand
a
funeral
and
yet
here
the
elf
lay
between
bushes
in
a
roughly
dug
hole
i
think
we
ought
to
say
something
piped
up
Luna
ill
go
first
shall
I
and
as
everybody
looked
at
her
she
addressed
the
dead
elf
at
the
bottom
of
the
grave
thank
you
so
much
Dobby
for
rescuing
me
from
that
cellar
its
so
unfair
that
you
had
to
die
when
you
were
so
good
and
brave
ill
always
remember
what
you
did
for
us
i
hope
youre
happy
now
she
turned
and
looked
expectingly
at
Ron
who
cleared
his
throat
and
said
in
a
thick
voice
yeah
thanks
Dobby
thanks
muttered
Dean
harry
swallowed
good
bye
Dobby
he
said
It
was
all
he
could
manage
but
Luna
had
said
it
all
for
him
bill
raised
his
wand
and
the
pile
of
earth
beside
the
grave
rose
up
into
the
air
and
fell
neatly
upon
it
a
small
reddish
mound
dya
mind
if
I
stay
here
a
moment
he
asked
the
others
they
murmured
words
he
did
not
catch
he
felt
gentle
pats
upon
his
back
and
then
they
all
traipsed
back
toward
the
cottage
leaving
Harry
alone
beside
the
elf
he
looked
around
There
were
a
number
of
large
white
stones
smoothed
by
the
sea
marking
the
edge
of
the
flower
beds
he
picked
up
one
of
the
largest
and
laid
it
pillowlike
over
the
place
where
Dobbys
head
now
rested
he
then
felt
in
his
pocket
for
a
wand
there
were
two
in
there
he
had
forgotten
lost
track
he
could
not
now
remember
whose
wands
these
were
he
seemed
to
remember
wrenching
them
out
of
someones
hand
he
selected
the
shorter
of
the
two
which
felt
friendlier
in
his
hand
and
pointed
it
at
the
rock
slowly
under
his
murmured
instruction
deep
cuts
appeared
upon
the
rocks
surface
he
knew
that
Hermione
could
have
done
it
more
neatly
and
probably
more
quickly
but
he
wanted
to
mark
the
spot
as
he
had
wanted
to
dig
the
grave
when
Harry
stood
up
again
the
stone
read
here
lies
dobby
A
free
elf
he
looked
at
his
handiwork
for
a
few
more
seconds
then
walked
away
his
scar
still
prickling
a
little
and
his
mind
full
of
those
things
that
had
come
to
him
in
the
grave
ideas
that
had
taken
shape
in
the
darkness
ideas
both
fascinating
and
terrible
they
were
all
sitting
in
the
living
room
when
he
entered
the
little
hall
their
attention
focused
upon
Bill
who
was
talking
the
room
was
light-colored
pretty
with
a
small
fire
of
driftwood
burning
brightly
in
the
fireplace
harry
did
not
want
to
drop
mud
upon
the
carpet
so
he
stood
in
the
doorway
listening
lucky
that
Ginnys
on
holiday
if
shed
been
at
Hogwarts
they
could
have
taken
her
before
we
reached
her
now
we
know
shes
safe
too
he
looked
around
and
saw
Harry
standing
there
ive
been
getting
them
all
out
of
the
Burrow
he
explained
moved
them
to
Muriels
the
Death
Eaters
know
Rons
with
you
now
theyre
bound
to
target
the
family
dont
apologize
he
added
at
the
sight
of
Harrys
expression
it
was
always
a
matter
of
time
Dads
been
saying
so
for
months
were
the
biggest
blood
traitor
family
there
is
how
are
they
protected
asked
Harry
fidelius
Charm
dads
Secret-Keeper
and
weve
done
it
on
this
cottage
too
Im
Secret-Keeper
here
none
of
us
can
go
to
work
but
thats
hardly
the
most
important
thing
now
once
Ollivander
and
Griphook
are
well
enough
well
move
them
to
Muriels
too
there
isnt
much
room
here
but
shes
got
plenty
griphooks
legs

on
the
mend
fleurs
given
him
skele-gro-we
could
probably
move
them
in
an
hour
or
no
Harry
said
and
Bill
looked
startled
i
need
both
of
them
here
i
need
to
talk
to
them
its
important
he
heard
the
authority
of
his
own
voice
the
conviction
the
voice
of
purpose
that
had
come
to
him
as
he
dug
Dobbys
grave
all
of
their
faces
were
turned
toward
him
looking
puzzled
im
going
to
wash
Harry
told
Bill
looking
down
at
his
hands
still
covered
with
mud
and
Dobbys
blood
then
Ill
need
to
see
them
straight
away
he
walked
into
the
little
kitchen
to
the
basin
beneath
a
window
overlooking
the
sea
dawn
was
breaking
over
the
horizon
shell
pink
and
faintly
gold
as
he
washed
again
following
the
train
of
thought
that
had
come
to
him
in
the
dark
garden
dobby
would
never
be
able
to
tell
them
who
had
sent
him
to
the
cellar
but
Harry
knew
what
he
had
seen
a
piercing
blue
eye
had
looked
out
of
the
mirror
fragment
and
then
help
had
come
help
will
always
be
given
at
Hogwarts
to
those
who
ask
for
it
harry
dried
his
hands
impervious
to
the
beauty
of
the
scene
outside
the
window
and
to
the
murmuring
of
the
others
in
the
sitting
room
he
looked
out
over
the
ocean
and
felt
closer
this
dawn
than
ever
before
closer
to
the
heart
of
it
all
and
still
his
scar
prickled
and
he
knew
that
Voldemort
was
getting
there
too
harry
understood
and
yet
did
not
understand
his
instinct
was
telling
him
one
thing
his
brain
quite
another
the
Dumbledore
in
Harrys
head
smiled
surveying
Harry
over
the
tips
of
his
fingers
pressed
together
as
if
in
prayer
you
gave
Ron
the
Deluminator
you
understood
him
you
gave
him
a
way
back
and
you
understood
Wormtail
too
you
knew
there
was
a
bit
of
regret
there
somewhere
and
if
you
knew
them
what
did
you
know
about
me
Dumbledore
am
I
meant
to
know
but
not
to
seek
did
you
know
how
hard
Id
feel
that
is
that
why
you
made
it
this
difficult
so
Id
have
time
to
work
that
out
harry
stood
quite
still
eyes
glazed
watching
the
place
where
a
bright
gold
ray
of
dazzling
sun
was
rising
over
the
horizon
then
he
looked
down
at
his
clean
hands
and
was
momentarily
surprised
to
see
the
cloth
he
was
holding
in
them
he
set
it
down
and
returned
to
the
hall
and
as
he
did
so
he
felt
his
scar
pulse
angrily
and
then
flashed
across
his
mind
swift
as
the
reflection
of
a
dragonfly
over
water
the
outline
of
a
building
he
knew
extremely
well
bill
and
Fleur
were
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
i
need
to
speak
to
Griphook
and
Ollivander
Harry
said
no
said
Fleur
you
will
ave
to
wait
Arry
zey
are
both
too
tired
im
sorry
he
said
without
heat
but
it
cant
wait
i
need
to
talk
to
them
now
privately
and
separately
its
urgent
harry
what
the
hells
going
on
asked
Bill
you
turn
up
here
with
a
dead
house-elf
and
a
half-conscious
goblin
Hermione
looks
as
though
shes
been
tortured
and
Rons
just
refused
to
tell
me
anything
we
cant
tell
you
what
were
doing
said
Harry
flatly
youre
in
the
Order
Bill
you
know
Dumbledore
left
us
a
mission
were
not
supposed
to
talk
about
it
to
anyone
else
fleur
made
an
impatient
noise
but
Bill
did
not
look
at
her
he
was
staring
at
Harry
his
deeply
scarred
face
was
hard
to
read
finally
Bill
said
All
right
who
do
you
want
to
talk
to
first
harry
hesitated
he
knew
what
hung
on
his
decision
there
was
hardly
any
time
left
now
was
the
moment
to
decide
Horcruxes
or
Hallows
griphook
Harry
said
ill
speak
to
Griphook
first
his
heart
was
racing
as
if
he
had
been
sprinting
and
had
just
cleared
an
enormous
obstacle
up
here
then
said
Bill
leading
the
way
harry
had
walked
up
several
steps
before
stopping
and
looking
back
i
need
you
two
as
well
he
called
to
Ron
and
Hermione
who
had
been
skulking
half
concealed
in
the
doorway
of
the
sitting
room
they
both
moved
into
the
light
looking
oddly
relieved
how
are
you
harry
asked
Hermione
you
were
amazing
coming
up
with
that
story
when
she
was
hurting
you
like
that
hermione
gave
a
weak
smile
as
Ron
gave
her
a
one-armed
squeeze
what
are
we
doing
now
Harry
he
asked
youll
see
come
on
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
followed
Bill
up
the
steep
stairs
onto
a
small
landing
three
doors
led
off
it
in
here
said
Bill
opening
the
door
into
his
and
Fleurs
room
it
too
had
a
view
of
the
sea
now
flecked
with
gold
in
the
sunrise
harry
moved
to
the
window
turned
his
back
on
the
spectacular
view
and
waited
his
arms
folded
his
scar
prickling
hermione
took
the
chair
beside
the
dressing
table
Ron
sat
on
the
arm
bill
reappeared
carrying
the
little
goblin
whom
he
set
down
carefully
upon
the
bed
griphook
grunted
thanks
and
Bill
left
closing
the
door
upon
them
all
im
sorry
to
take
you
out
of
bed
said
Harry
how
are
your
legs
painful
replied
the
goblin
but
mending
he
was
still
clutching
the
sword
of
Gryffindor
and
wore
a
strange
look
half
truculent
half
intrigued
harry
noted
the
goblins
sallow
skin
his
long
thin
fingers
his
black
eyes
fleur
had
removed
his
shoes
His
long
feet
were
dirty
he
was
larger
than
a
house-elf
but
not
by
much
his
domed
head
was
much
bigger
than
a
humans
you
probably
dont
remember
Harry
began
that
I
was
the
goblin
who
showed
you
to
your
vault
the
first
time
you
ever
visited
Gringotts
said
Griphook
i
remember
Harry
Potter
even
amongst
goblins
you
are
very
famous
harry
and
the
goblin
looked
at
each
other
sizing
each
other
up
harrys
scar
was
still
prickling
he
wanted
to
get
through
this
interview
with
Griphook
quickly
and
at
the
same
time
was
afraid
of
making
a
false
move
while
he
tried
to
decide
on
the
best
way
to
approach
his
request
the
goblin
broke
the
silence
you
buried
the
elf
he
said
sounding
unexpectedly
rancorous
i
watched
you
from
the
window
of
the
bedroom
next
door
yes
said
Harry
griphook
looked
at
him
out
of
the
corners
of
his
slanting
black
eyes
you
are
an
unusual
wizard
Harry
Potter
in
what
way
asked
Harry
rubbing
his
scar
absently
you
dug
the
grave
so
griphook
did
not
answer
harry
rather
thought
he
was
being
sneered
at
for
acting
like
a
Muggle
but
it
did
not
matter
to
him
whether
Griphook
approved
of
Dobbys
grave
or
not
he
gathered
himself
for
the
attack
griphook
I
need
to
ask
you
also
rescued
a
goblin
what
you
brought
me
here
saved
me
well
I
take
it
youre
not
sorry
said
Harry
a
little
impatiently
no
Harry
Potter
said
Griphook
and
with
one
finger
he
twisted
the
thin
black
beard
upon
his
chin
but
you
are
a
very
odd
wizard
right
said
Harry
well
I
need
some
help
Griphook
and
you
can
give
it
to
me
the
goblin
made
no
sign
of
encouragement
but
continued
to
frown
at
Harry
as
though
he
had
never
seen
anything
like
him
i
need
to
break
into
a
Gringotts
vault
harry
had
not
meant
to
say
it
so
badly
the
words
were
forced
from
him
as
pain
shot
through
his
lightning
scar
and
he
saw
again
the
outline
of
Hogwarts
he
closed
his
mind
firmly
he
needed
to
deal
with
Griphook
first
ron
and
Hermione
were
staring
at
Harry
as
though
he
had
gone
mad
harry
said
Hermione
but
she
was
cut
off
by
Griphook
break
into
a
Gringotts
vault
repeated
the
goblin
wincing
a
little
as
he
shifted
his
position
upon
the
bed
it
is
impossible
no
it
isnt
Ron
contradicted
him
its
been
done
yeah
said
Harry
the
same
day
I
first
met
you
Griphook
my
birthday
seven
years
ago
the
vault
in
question
was
empty
at
the
time
snapped
the
goblin
and
Harry
understood
that
even
though
Griphook
had
let
Gringotts
he
was
offended
at
the
idea
of
its
defenses
being
breached
its
protection
was
minimal
well
the
vault
we
need
to
get
into
isnt
empty
and
Im
guessing
its
protection
will
be
pretty
powerful
said
Harry
it
belongs
to
the
Lestranges
he
saw
Hermione
and
Ron
look
at
each
other
astonished
but
there
would
be
time
enough
to
explain
after
Griphook
had
given
his
answer
you
have
no
chance
said
Griphook
flatly
no
chance
at
all
if
you
seek
beneath
our
floors
a
treasure
that
was
never
yours
thief
you
have
been
warned
beware
yeah
I
know
I
remember
said
Harry
but
Im
not
trying
to
get
myself
any
treasure
Im
not
trying
to
take
anything
for
personal
gain
can
you
believe
that
the
goblin
looked
slantwise
at
Harry
and
the
lightning
scar
on
Harrys
forehead
prickled
but
he
ignored
it
refusing
to
acknowledge
its
pain
or
its
invitation
if
there
was
a
wizard
of
whom
I
would
believe
that
they
did
not
seek
personal
gain
said
Griphook
finally
it
would
be
you
Harry
Potter
goblins
and
elves
are
not
used
to
the
protection
or
the
respect
that
you
have
shown
this
night
not
from
wand-carriers
wand-carriers
repeated
Harry
The
phrase
fell
oddly
upon
his
ears
as
his
scar
prickled
as
Voldemort
turned
his
thoughts
northward
and
as
Harry
burned
to
question
Ollivander
next
door
the
right
to
carry
a
wand
said
the
goblin
quietly
has
long
been
contested
between
wizards
and
goblins
well
goblins
can
do
magic
without
wands
said
Ron
that
is
immaterial
wizards
refuse
to
share
the
secrets
of
wand-lore
with
other
magical
beings
they
deny
us
the
possibility
of
extending
our
powers
well
goblins
wont
share
any
of
their
magic
either
said
Ron
you
wont
tell
us
how
to
make
swords
and
armor
the
way
you
do
goblins
know
how
to
work
metal
in
a
way
wizards
have
never
it
doesnt
matter
said
Harry
noting
Griphooks
rising
color
this
isnt
about
wizards
versus
goblins
or
any
other
sort
of
magical
creature
griphook
gave
a
nasty
laugh
but
it
is
it
is
precisely
that
as
the
Dark
Lord
becomes
ever
more
powerful
your
race
is
set
still
more
firmly
above
mine
gringotts
falls
under
Wizarding
rule
house-elves
are
slaughtered
and
who
amongst
the
wand-carriers
protests
we
do
said
Hermione
she
had
sat
up
straight
her
eyes
bright
we
protest
and
Im
hunted
quite
as
much
as
any
goblin
or
elf
Griphook
im
a
Mudblood
dont
call
yourself
Ron
muttered
why
shouldnt
I
said
Hermione
mudblood
and
proud
of
it
ive
got
no
higher
position
under
this
new
order
than
you
have
Griphook
it
was
me
they
chose
to
torture
back
at
the
Malfoys
as
she
spoke
she
pulled
aside
the
neck
of
the
dressing
gown
to
reveal
the
thin
cut
Bellatrix
had
made
scarlet
against
her
throat
did
you
know
that
it
was
Harry
who
set
Dobby
free
she
asked
did
you
know
that
weve
wanted
elves
to
be
freed
for
years
Ron
fidgeted
uncomfortably
on
the
arm
of
Hermiones
chair
You
cant
want
You-Know-Who
defeated
more
than
we
do
Griphook
the
goblin
gazed
at
Hermione
with
the
same
curiousity
he
had
shown
Harry
what
do
you
seek
within
the
Lestranges
vault
he
asked
abruptly
the
sword
that
lies
inside
it
is
a
fake
this
is
the
real
one
he
looked
from
one
to
the
other
of
them
i
think
that
you
already
know
this
you
asked
me
to
lie
for
you
back
there
but
the
fake
sword
isnt
the
only
thing
in
that
vault
is
it
asked
Harry
perhaps
youve
seen
other
things
in
there
his
heart
was
pounding
harder
than
ever
he
redoubled
his
efforts
to
ignore
the
pulsing
of
his
scar
the
goblin
twisted
his
beard
around
his
finger
again
it
is
against
our
code
to
speak
of
the
secrets
of
Gringotts
we
are
the
guardians
of
fabulous
treasures
we
have
a
duty
to
the
objects
placed
in
our
care
which
were
so
often
wrought
by
our
fingers
the
goblin
stroked
the
sword
and
his
black
eyes
roved
from
Harry
to
Hermione
to
Ron
and
then
back
again
so
young
he
said
finally
to
be
fighting
so
many
will
you
help
us
said
Harry
we
havent
got
a
hope
of
breaking
in
without
a
goblins
help
youre
our
one
chance
i
shall
think
about
it
said
Griphook
maddeningly
but
Ron
started
angrily
Hermione
nudged
him
in
the
ribs
thank
you
said
Harry
the
goblin
bowed
his
great
domed
head
in
acknowledgement
then
flexed
his
short
legs
i
think
he
said
settling
himself
ostentatiously
upon
Bill
and
Fleurs
bed
that
the
Skele-Gro
has
finished
its
work
i
may
be
able
to
sleep
at
last
forgive
me
yeah
of
course
said
Harry
but
before
leaving
the
room
he
leaned
forward
and
took
the
sword
of
Gryffindor
from
beside
the
goblin
griphook
did
not
protest
but
Harry
thought
he
saw
resentment
in
the
goblins
eyes
as
he
closed
the
door
upon
him
little
git
whispered
Ron
hes
enjoying
keeping
us
hanging
harry
whispered
Hermione
pulling
them
both
away
from
the
door
into
the
middle
of
the
still-dark
landing
are
you
saying
what
I
think
youre
saying
are
you
saying
theres
a
Horcrux
in
the
Lestranges
vault
yes
said
Harry
bellatrix
was
terrified
when
she
thought
wed
been
in
there
she
was
beside
herself
why
what
did
she
think
wed
seen
what
else
did
she
think
we
might
have
taken
something
she
was
petrified
You-Know-Who
would
find
out
about
but
I
thought
we
were
looking
for
places
You-Know-Whos
been
places
hes
done
something
important
said
Ron
looking
baffled
was
he
ever
inside
the
Lestranges
vault
i
dont
know
whether
he
was
ever
inside
Gringotts
said
Harry
he
never
had
gold
there
when
he
was
younger
because
nobody
left
him
anything
he
would
have
seen
the
bank
from
the
outside
though
the
first
time
he
ever
went
to
Diagon
Alley
harrys
scar
throbbed
but
he
ignored
it
he
wanted
Ron
and
Hermione
to
understand
about
Gringotts
before
they
spoke
to
Ollivander
i
think
he
would
have
envied
anyone
who
had
a
key
to
a
Gringotts
vault
i
think
hed
have
seen
it
as
a
real
symbol
of
belonging
to
the
Wizarding
world
and
dont
forget
he
trusted
Bellatrix
and
her
husband
they
were
his
most
devoted
servants
before
he
fell
and
they
went
looking
for
him
after
he
vanished
he
said
it
night
he
came
back
I
heard
him
harry
rubbed
his
scar
i
dont
think
hed
have
told
Bellatrix
it
was
a
Horcrux
though
he
never
told
Lucius
Malfoy
the
truth
about
the
diary
he
probably
told
her
it
was
a
treasured
possession
and
asked
her
to
place
it
in
her
vault
the
safest
place
in
the
world
for
anything
you
want
to
hide
Hagrid
told
me
except
for
Hogwarts
when
Harry
had
finished
speaking
Ron
shook
his
head
you
really
understand
him
bits
of
him
said
Harry
bits
i
just
wish
Id
understood
Dumbledore
as
much
but
well
see
come
on
Ollivander
now
ron
and
Hermione
looked
bewildered
but
very
impressed
as
they
followed
him
across
the
little
landing
and
knocked
upon
the
door
opposite
Bill
and
Fleurs
a
weak
Come
in
answered
them
the
wandmaker
was
lying
on
the
twin
bed
farthest
from
the
window
he
had
been
held
in
the
cellar
for
more
than
a
year
and
tortured
Harry
knew
on
at
least
one
occasion
he
was
emaciated
the
bones
of
his
face
sticking
out
sharply
against
the
yellowish
skin
his
great
silver
eyes
seemed
vast
in
their
sunken
sockets
the
hands
that
lay
upon
the
blanket
could
have
belonged
to
a
skeleton
harry
sat
down
on
the
empty
bed
beside
Ron
and
Hermione
the
rising
sun
was
not
visible
here
the
room
faced
the
cliff-top
garden
and
the
freshly
dug
grave
mr.
Ollivander
Im
sorry
to
disturb
you
Harry
said
my
dear
boy
Ollivanders
voice
was
feeble
you
rescued
us
I
thought
we
would
die
in
that
place
I
can
never
thank
you
never
thank
you
enough
we
were
glad
to
do
it
harrys
scar
throbbed
he
knew
he
was
certain
that
there
was
hardly
any
time
left
in
which
to
beat
Voldemort
to
his
goal
or
else
to
attempt
to
thwart
him
he
felt
a
flutter
of
panic
yet
he
had
made
his
decision
when
he
chose
to
speak
to
Griphook
first
feigning
a
calm
he
did
not
feel
he
groped
in
the
pouch
around
his
neck
and
took
out
the
two
halves
of
his
broken
wand
mr.
Ollivander
I
need
some
help
anything
anything
said
the
wandmaker
weakly
can
you
mend
this
is
it
possible
ollivander
held
out
a
trembling
hand
and
Harry
placed
the
two
barely
connected
halves
in
his
palm
holly
and
phoenix
feather
said
Ollivander
in
a
tremulous
voice
eleven
inches
nice
and
supple
yes
said
Harry
can
you
no
whispered
Ollivander
i
am
sorry
very
sorry
but
a
wand
that
has
suffered
this
degree
of
damage
cannot
be
repaired
by
any
means
that
I
know
of
harry
had
been
braced
to
hear
it
but
it
was
a
blow
nevertheless
he
took
the
wand
halves
back
and
replaced
them
in
the
pouch
around
his
neck
ollivander
stared
at
the
place
where
the
shattered
wand
had
vanished
and
did
not
look
away
until
Harry
had
taken
from
his
pocket
the
two
wands
he
had
brought
from
the
Malfoys
can
you
identify
these
harry
asked
the
wandmaker
took
the
first
of
the
wands
and
held
it
close
to
his
faded
eyes
rolling
it
between
his
knobble-knuckled
fingers
flexing
it
slightly
walnut
and
dragon
heartstring
he
said
twelve-and-three-quarter
inches
unyielding
this
wand
belonged
to
Bellatrix
Lestrange
and
this
one
ollivander
performed
the
same
examination
hawthorn
and
unicorn
hair
ten
inches
precisely
reasonably
springy
this
was
the
wand
of
Draco
Malfoy
was
repeated
Harry
isnt
it
still
his
perhaps
not
if
you
took
it
I
did
then
it
may
be
yours
of
course
the
manner
of
taking
matters
much
also
depends
upon
the
wand
itself
in
general
however
where
a
wand
has
been
won
its
allegiance
will
change
there
was
a
silence
in
the
room
except
for
the
distant
rushing
of
the
sea
you
talk
about
wands
like
theyve
got
feelings
said
Harry
like
they
can
think
for
themselves
the
wand
chooses
the
wizard
said
Ollivander
that
much
has
always
been
clear
to
those
of
us
who
have
studied
wandlore
a
person
can
still
use
a
wand
that
hasnt
chosen
them
though
asked
Harry
oh
yes
if
you
are
any
wizard
at
all
you
will
be
able
to
channel
your
magic
through
almost
any
instrument
the
best
results
however
must
always
come
where
there
is
the
strongest
affinity
between
wizard
and
wand
these
connections
are
complex
an
initial
attraction
and
then
a
mutual
quest
for
experience
the
wand
learning
from
the
wizard
the
wizard
from
the
wand
the
sea
gushed
forward
and
backward
it
was
a
mournful
sound
i
took
this
wand
from
Draco
Malfoy
by
force
said
Harry
can
I
use
it
safely
i
think
so
subtle
laws
govern
wand
ownership
but
the
conquered
wand
will
usually
bend
its
will
to
its
new
master
so
I
should
use
this
one
said
Ron
pulling
Wormtails
wand
out
of
his
pocket
and
handing
it
to
Ollivander
chestnut
and
dragon
heartstring
nine-and-a-quarter
inches
brittle
i
was
forced
to
make
this
shortly
after
my
kidnapping
for
Peter
Pettigrew
yes
if
you
won
it
it
is
more
likely
to
do
your
bidding
and
do
it
well
than
another
wand
and
this
holds
true
for
all
wands
does
it
asked
Harry
i
think
so
replied
Ollivander
his
protuberant
eyes
upon
Harrys
face
you
ask
deep
questions
mr.
Potter
wandlore
is
a
complex
and
mysterious
branch
of
magic
so
it
isnt
necessary
to
kill
the
previous
owner
to
take
the
possession
of
a
wand
asked
Harry
ollivander
swallowed
necessary
no
I
should
not
say
that
it
is
necessary
to
kill
there
are
legends
though
said
Harry
and
as
his
heart
rate
quickened
the
pain
in
his
scar
became
more
intense
he
was
sure
that
Voldemort
has
decided
to
put
his
idea
into
action
legends
about
a
wand
or
wands
that
have
been
passed
from
hand
to
hand
by
murder
ollivander
turned
pale
against
the
snowy
pillow
he
was
light
gray
and
his
eyes
were
enormous
bloodshot
and
bulging
with
what
looked
like
fear
only
one
wand
I
think
he
whispered
and
You-Know-Who
is
interested
in
it
isnt
he
asked
Harry
i
how
croaked
Ollivander
and
he
looked
appealingly
at
Ron
and
Hermione
for
help
how
do
you
know
this
he
wanted
you
to
tell
him
how
to
overcome
the
connection
between
our
wands
said
Harry
ollivander
looked
terrified
he
tortured
me
you
must
understand
that
the
Cruciatus
Curse
I
I
had
no
choice
but
to
tell
him
what
I
knew
what
I
guessed
i
understand
said
Harry
you
told
him
about
the
twin
cores
you
said
he
just
had
to
borrow
another
wizards
wand
ollivander
looked
horrified
transfixed
by
the
amount
that
Harry
knew
he
nodded
slowly
but
it
didnt
work
Harry
went
on
mine
still
beat
the
borrowed
wand
do
you
know
why
that
is
ollivander
shook
his
head
slowly
as
he
had
just
nodded
i
had
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
your
wand
performed
something
unique
that
night
the
connection
of
the
twin
cores
is
incredibly
rare
yet
why
your
wand
would
have
snapped
the
borrowed
wand
I
do
not
know
we
were
talking
about
the
other
wand
the
wand
that
changes
hands
by
murder
when
You-Know-Who
realized
my
wand
had
done
something
strange
he
came
back
and
asked
about
that
other
wand
didnt
he
how
do
you
know
this
harry
did
not
answer
yes
he
asked
whispered
Ollivander
he
wanted
to
know
everything
I
could
tell
him
about
the
wand
variously
known
as
the
Deathstick
the
Wand
of
Destiny
or
the
Elder
Wand
harry
glanced
sideways
at
Hermione
she
looked
flaggergasted
the
Dark
Lord
said
Ollivander
in
hushed
and
frightened
tones
had
always
been
happy
with
the
wand
I
made
him
yes
and
phoenix
feather
thirteen-and-a-half
inches
until
he
discovered
the
connection
of
the
twin
cores
now
he
seeks
another
more
powerful
wand
as
the
only
way
to
conquer
yours
but
hell
know
soon
if
he
doesnt
already
that
mines
broken
beyond
repair
said
Harry
quietly
no
said
Hermione
sounding
frightened
he
cant
know
that
Harry
how
could
he
priori
Incantatem
said
Harry
we
left
your
wand
and
the
blackthorn
wand
at
the
Malfoys
Hermione
if
they
examine
them
properly
make
them
re-create
the
spells
theyve
cast
lately
theyd
see
that
yours
broke
mine
theyll
see
that
you
tried
and
failed
to
mend
it
and
theyll
realize
that
Ive
been
using
the
blackthorn
one
ever
since
the
little
color
she
had
regained
since
their
arrival
had
drained
from
her
face
ron
gave
Harry
a
reproachful
look
and
said
Lets
not
worry
about
that
now
but
mr.
Ollivander
intervened
the
Dark
Lord
no
longer
seeks
the
Elder
Wand
only
for
your
destruction
mr.
Potter
he
is
determined
to
possess
it
because
he
believes
it
will
make
him
truly
invulnerable
and
will
it
the
owner
of
the
Elder
Wand
must
always
fear
attack
said
Ollivander
but
the
idea
of
the
Dark
Lord
in
possession
of
the
Deathstick
is
I
must
admit
formidable
harry
was
suddenly
reminded
of
how
unsure
when
they
first
met
of
how
much
he
like
Ollivander
even
now
having
been
tortured
and
imprisoned
by
Voldemort
the
idea
of
the
Dark
Wizard
in
possession
of
this
wand
seemed
to
enthrall
him
as
much
as
it
repulsed
him
you
you
really
think
this
wand
exists
then
mr.
Ollivander
asked
Hermione
oh
yes
said
Ollivander
yes
it
is
perfectly
possible
to
trace
the
wands
course
through
history
there
are
gaps
of
course
and
long
ones
where
it
vanishes
from
view
temporarily
lost
or
hidden
but
always
it
resurfaces
it
has
certain
identifying
characteristics
that
those
who
are
learned
in
wandlore
recognize
there
are
written
accounts
some
of
them
obscure
that
I
and
other
wandmakers
have
made
it
our
business
to
study
they
have
the
ring
of
authenticity
so
you
you
dont
think
it
can
be
a
fairy
tale
or
a
myth
hermione
asked
hopefully
no
said
Ollivander
whether
it
needs
to
pass
by
murder
I
do
not
know
its
history
is
bloody
but
that
may
be
simply
due
to
the
fact
that
it
is
such
a
desirable
object
and
arouses
such
passions
in
wizards
immensely
powerful
dangerous
in
the
wrong
hands
and
an
object
of
incredible
fascination
to
all
of
us
who
study
the
power
of
wands
mr.
Ollivander
said
Harry
you
told
You-Know-Who
that
Gregorovitch
had
the
Elder
Wand
didnt
you
ollivander
turned
if
possible
even
paler
he
looked
ghostly
as
he
gulped
but
how
how
do
you
never
mind
how
I
know
it
said
Harry
closing
his
eyes
momentarily
as
his
scar
burned
and
he
saw
for
mere
seconds
a
vision
of
the
main
street
in
Hogsmeade
still
dark
because
it
was
so
much
farther
north
you
told
You-Know-Who
that
Gregorovitch
had
the
wand
it
was
a
rumor
whispered
Ollivander
a
rumor
years
and
years
ago
long
before
you
were
born
I
believe
Gregorovitch
himself
started
it
you
can
see
how
good
it
would
be
for
business
that
he
was
studying
and
duplicating
the
qualities
of
the
Elder
Wand
yes
I
can
see
that
said
Harry
he
stood
up
mr.
Ollivander
one
last
thing
and
then
well
let
you
get
some
rest
what
do
you
know
about
the
Deathly
Hallows
the
the
what
asked
the
wandmaker
looking
utterly
bewildered
the
Deathly
Hallows
im
afraid
I
dont
know
what
youre
talking
about
is
this
still
something
to
do
with
wands
harry
looked
into
the
sunken
face
and
believed
that
Ollivander
was
not
acting
he
did
not
know
about
the
Hallows
thank
you
said
Harry
thank
you
very
much
well
leave
you
to
get
some
rest
now
ollivander
looked
stricken
he
was
torturing
me
he
gasped
the
Cruciatus
Curse
you
have
no
idea
i
do
said
Harry
I
really
do
please
get
some
rest
thank
you
for
telling
me
all
of
this
he
led
Ron
and
Hermione
down
the
staircase
harry
caught
glimpses
of
Bill
Fleur
Luna
and
Dean
sitting
at
the
table
in
the
kitchen
cups
of
tea
in
front
of
them
they
all
looked
up
at
Harry
as
he
appeared
in
the
doorway
but
he
merely
nodded
to
them
and
continued
into
the
garden
Ron
and
Hermione
behind
him
the
reddish
mound
of
earth
that
covered
Dobby
lay
ahead
and
Harry
walked
back
to
it
as
the
pain
in
his
head
built
more
and
more
powerfully
it
was
a
huge
effort
now
to
close
down
the
visions
that
were
forcing
themselves
upon
him
but
he
knew
that
he
would
have
to
resist
only
a
little
longer
he
would
yield
very
soon
because
he
needed
to
know
that
his
theory
was
right
he
must
make
only
one
more
short
effort
so
that
he
could
explain
to
Ron
and
Hermione
gregorovitch
had
the
Elder
Wand
a
long
time
ago
he
said
I
saw
You-Know-Who
trying
to
find
him
when
he
tracked
him
down
he
found
that
Gregorovitch
didnt
have
it
anymore
It
was
stolen
from
him
by
Grindelwald
how
Grindelwald
found
out
that
Gregorovitch
had
it
I
dont
know
but
if
Gregorovitch
was
stupid
enough
to
spread
the
rumor
it
cant
have
been
that
difficult
voldemort
was
at
the
gates
of
Hogwarts
Harry
could
see
him
standing
there
and
see
too
the
lamp
bobbing
in
the
pre-dawn
coming
closer
and
closer
and
Grindelwald
used
the
Elder
Wand
to
become
powerful
and
at
the
height
of
his
power
when
Dumbledore
knew
he
was
the
only
one
who
could
stop
him
he
dueled
Grindelwald
and
beat
him
and
he
took
the
Elder
Wand
dumbledore
had
the
Elder
Wand
said
Ron
but
then
where
is
it
now
at
Hogwarts
said
Harry
fighting
to
remain
with
them
in
the
cliff-top
garden
but
then
lets
go
said
Ron
urgently
harry
lets
go
and
get
it
before
he
does
its
too
late
for
that
said
Harry
he
could
not
help
himself
but
clutched
his
head
trying
to
help
it
resist
he
knows
where
it
is
hes
there
now
harry
ron
said
furiously
how
long
have
you
known
this
why
have
we
been
wasting
time
why
did
you
talk
to
Griphook
first
we
could
have
gone
we
could
still
go
no
said
Harry
and
he
sank
to
his
knees
in
the
grass
hermiones
right
dumbledore
didnt
want
me
to
have
it
he
didnt
want
me
to
take
it
he
wanted
me
to
get
the
Horcruxes
the
unbeatable
wand
Harry
moaned
Ron
im
not
supposed
to
im
supposed
to
get
the
Horcruxes
and
now
everything
was
cool
and
dark
The
sun
was
barely
visible
over
the
horizon
as
he
glided
alongside
Snape
up
through
the
grounds
toward
the
lake
i
shall
join
you
in
the
castle
shortly
he
said
in
his
high
cold
voice
leave
me
now
snape
bowed
and
set
off
back
up
the
path
his
black
cloak
billowing
behind
him
harry
walked
slowly
waiting
for
Snapes
figure
to
disappear
it
would
not
do
for
Snape
or
indeed
anyone
else
to
see
where
he
was
going
but
there
were
no
lights
in
the
castle
windows
and
he
could
conceal
himself
and
in
a
second
he
had
cast
upon
himself
a
Disillusionment
Charm
that
hid
him
even
from
his
own
eyes
and
he
walked
on
around
the
edge
of
the
lake
taking
in
the
outlines
of
the
beloved
castle
his
first
kingdom
his
birthright
and
here
it
was
beside
the
lake
reflected
in
the
dark
waters
the
white
marble
tomb
an
unnecessary
blot
on
the
familiar
landscape
he
felt
again
that
rush
of
controlled
euphoria
that
heady
sense
of
purpose
in
destruction
he
raised
the
old
yew
wand
How
fitting
that
this
would
be
its
last
great
act
the
tomb
split
open
from
head
to
foot
the
shrouded
figure
was
as
long
as
thin
as
it
had
been
in
life
he
raised
the
wand
again
the
wrappings
fell
open
the
face
was
translucent
pale
sunken
yet
almost
perfectly
preserved
they
had
left
his
spectacles
on
the
crooked
nose
He
felt
amused
derision
dumbledores
hands
were
folded
upon
his
chest
and
there
it
lay
clutched
beneath
them
buried
with
him
had
the
old
fool
imagined
that
marble
or
death
would
protect
the
wand
had
he
thought
that
the
Dark
Lord
would
be
scared
to
violate
his
tomb
the
spiderlike
hand
swooped
and
pulled
the
wand
from
Dumbledores
grasp
and
as
he
took
it
a
shower
of
sparks
flew
from
its
tip
sparkling
over
the
corpse
of
its
last
owner
ready
to
serve
a
new
master
at
last
chapter
Twenty-Five
shell
Cottage
bill
and
fleur's
cottage
stood
alone
on
a
cliff
overlooking
the
sea
its
walls
embedded
with
shells
and
whitewashed
it
was
a
lonely
and
beautiful
place
wherever
Harry
went
inside
the
tiny
cottage
or
its
garden
he
could
hear
the
constant
ebb
and
flow
of
the
sea
like
the
breathing
of
some
great
slumbering
creature
he
spent
much
of
the
next
few
days
making
excuses
to
escape
the
crowded
cottage
craving
the
cliff-top
view
of
open
sky
and
wide
empty
sea
and
the
feel
of
cold
salty
wind
on
his
face
the
enormity
of
his
decision
not
to
race
Voldemort
to
the
wand
still
scared
Harry
he
could
not
remember
ever
before
choosing
not
to
act
he
was
full
of
doubts
doubts
that
Ron
could
not
help
voicing
whenever
they
were
together
what
if
Dumbledore
wanted
us
to
work
out
the
symbol
in
time
to
get
the
wand
what
if
working
out
what
the
symbol
meant
made
you
worthy
to
get
the
Hallows
harry
if
that
really
is
the
Elder
Wand
how
the
hell
are
we
supposed
to
finish
off
You-Know-Who
harry
had
no
answers
There
were
moments
when
he
wondered
whether
it
had
been
outright
madness
not
to
try
to
prevent
Voldemort
breaking
open
the
tomb
he
could
not
even
explain
satisfactorily
why
he
had
decided
against
it
Every
time
he
tried
to
reconstruct
the
internal
arguments
that
had
led
to
his
decision
they
sounded
feebler
to
him
the
odd
thing
was
that
hermione's
support
made
him
feel
just
as
confused
as
ron's
doubts
now
forced
to
accept
that
the
Elder
Wand
was
real
she
maintained
that
it
was
an
evil
object
and
that
the
way
Voldemort
had
taken
possession
of
it
was
repellent
not
to
be
considered
you
could
never
have
done
that
Harry
she
said
again
and
again
you
couldn't
have
broken
into
dumbledore's
grave
but
the
idea
of
dumbledore's
corpse
frightened
Harry
much
less
than
the
possibility
that
he
might
have
misunderstood
the
living
dumbledore's
intentions
he
felt
that
he
was
still
groping
in
the
dark
he
had
chosen
his
path
but
kept
looking
back
wondering
whether
he
had
misread
the
signs
whether
he
should
not
have
taken
the
other
way
from
time
to
time
anger
at
Dumbledore
crashed
over
him
again
powerful
as
the
waves
slamming
themselves
against
the
cliff
beneath
the
cottage
anger
that
Dumbledore
had
not
explained
before
he
died
but
is
he
dead
said
Ron
three
days
after
they
had
arrived
at
the
cottage
harry
had
been
staring
out
over
the
wall
that
separated
the
cottage
garden
from
the
cliff
when
Ron
and
Hermione
had
found
him
he
wished
they
had
not
having
no
wish
to
join
in
with
their
argument
yes
he
is
ron
please
don't
start
that
again
look
at
the
facts
Hermione
said
Ron
speaking
across
Harry
who
continued
to
gaze
at
the
horizon
the
solve
doe
the
sword
the
eye
Harry
saw
in
the
mirror
harry
admits
he
could
have
imagined
the
eye
don't
you
Harry
i
could
have
said
Harry
without
looking
at
her
but
you
don't
thing
you
did
do
you
asked
Ron
no
I
don't
said
Harry
there
you
go
said
Ron
quickly
before
Hermione
could
carry
on
if
it
wasn't
Dumbledore
explain
how
Dobby
knew
we
were
in
the
cellar
Hermione
i
can't
but
can
you
explain
how
Dumbledore
sent
him
to
us
if
he's
lying
in
a
tomb
at
Hogwarts
i
dunno
it
could've
been
his
ghost
dumbledore
wouldn't
come
back
as
a
ghost
said
Harry
there
was
little
about
Dumbledore
he
was
sure
of
now
but
he
knew
that
much
he
would
have
gone
on
what
d'you
mean
gone
on
asked
Ron
but
before
Harry
could
say
any
more
a
voice
behind
them
said
Arry
fleur
had
come
out
of
the
cottage
her
long
silver
hair
flying
in
the
breeze
arry
grip'ook
would
like
to
speak
to
you
e
eez
in
ze
smallest
bedroom
e
says
e
does
not
want
to
be
over'eard
her
dislike
of
the
goblin
sending
her
to
deliver
messages
was
clear
she
looked
irritable
as
she
walked
back
around
the
house
griphook
was
waiting
for
them
as
Fleur
had
said
in
the
tiniest
of
the
cottage's
three
bedrooms
in
which
Hermione
and
Luna
slept
by
night
he
had
drawn
the
red
cotton
curtains
against
the
bright
cloudy
sky
which
gave
the
room
a
fiery
glow
at
odds
with
the
rest
of
the
airy
light
cottage
i
have
reached
my
decision
Harry
Potter
said
the
goblin
who
was
sitting
cross-legged
in
a
low
chair
drumming
its
arms
with
his
spindly
fingers
though
the
goblins
of
Gringotts
will
consider
it
base
treachery
I
have
decided
to
help
you
that's
great
said
Harry
relief
surging
through
him
griphook
thank
you
we're
really
in
return
said
the
goblin
firmly
for
payment
slightly
taken
aback
Harry
hesitated
how
much
do
you
want
i've
got
gold
not
gold
said
Griphook
i
have
gold
his
black
eyes
glittered
there
were
no
whites
to
his
eyes
i
want
the
sword
the
sword
of
Godric
Gryffindor
harry's
spirits
plummeted
you
can't
have
that
he
said
i'm
sorry
then
said
the
goblin
softly
we
have
a
problem
we
can
give
you
something
else
said
Ron
eagerly
i'll
bet
the
Lestranges
have
got
loads
of
stuff
you
can
take
your
pick
once
we
get
into
the
vault
he
had
said
the
wrong
thing
griphook
flushed
angrily
i
am
not
a
thief
boy
i
am
not
trying
to
procure
treasures
to
which
I
have
no
right
the
sword's
ours
it
is
not
said
the
goblin
we're
Gryffindors
and
it
was
Godric
gryffindor's
and
before
it
was
gryffindor's
whose
was
it
demanded
the
goblin
sitting
up
straight
no
one's
said
Ron
it
was
made
for
him
wasn't
it
no
cried
the
goblin
bristling
with
anger
as
he
pointed
a
long
finger
at
Ron
wizarding
arrogance
again
that
sword
was
Ragnuk
the
first's
taken
from
him
by
Godric
Gryffindor
it
is
a
a
masterpiece
of
goblinwork
it
belongs
with
the
gobl
the
sword
is
the
price
of
my
hire
take
it
or
leave
it
griphook
glared
at
them
harry
glanced
at
the
other
then
said
We
need
to
discuss
this
Griphook
if
that's
all
right
could
you
give
us
a
few
minutes
the
goblin
nodded
looking
sour
downstairs
in
the
empty
sitting
room
Harry
walked
to
the
fireplace
brow
furrowed
trying
to
think
what
to
do
behind
him
Ron
said
he's
having
a
laugh
we
can't
let
him
have
that
sword
it
is
true
harry
asked
Hermione
was
the
sword
stolen
by
Gryffindor
i
don't
know
she
said
hopelessly
wizarding
history
often
skates
over
what
the
wizards
have
done
to
other
magical
races
but
there's
no
account
that
I
know
of
that
says
Gryffindor
stole
the
sword
it'll
be
one
of
those
goblin
stories
said
Ron
about
how
the
wizards
are
always
trying
to
get
one
over
on
them
i
suppose
we
should
think
ourselves
lucky
he
hasn't
asked
for
one
of
our
wands
goblins
have
got
good
reason
to
dislike
wizards
Ron
said
Hermione
they've
been
treated
brutally
in
the
past
goblins
aren't
exactly
fluffy
little
bunnies
though
are
they
said
Ron
they've
killed
plenty
of
us
they've
fought
dirty
too
but
arguing
with
Griphook
about
whose
race
is
most
underhanded
and
violent
isn't
going
to
make
him
more
likely
to
help
us
is
it
there
was
a
pause
while
they
tried
to
think
of
a
way
around
the
problem
harry
looked
out
of
the
window
at
dobby's
grave
luna
was
arranging
sea
lavender
in
a
jam
jar
beside
the
headstone
okay
said
Ron
and
Harry
turned
back
to
face
him
how's
this
we
tell
Griphook
we
need
the
sword
until
we
get
inside
the
and
then
he
can
have
it
there's
a
fake
in
these
isn't
there
we
switch
them
and
give
him
the
fake
ron
he'd
know
the
difference
better
than
we
would
said
Hermione
he's
the
only
one
who
realized
there
had
been
a
swap
yeah
but
we
could
caper
before
he
realizes
he
quailed
beneath
the
look
Hermione
was
giving
him
that
she
said
quietly
is
despicable
ask
for
his
help
then
double-cross
him
and
you
wonder
why
goblins
don't
like
wizards
Ron
ron's
ears
had
turned
red
all
right
all
right
it
was
the
only
thing
I
could
think
of
what's
your
solution
then
we
need
to
offer
him
something
else
something
just
as
valuable
brilliant
i'll
go
and
get
one
of
our
ancient
goblin-made
swords
and
you
can
gift
wrap
it
silence
fell
between
them
again
harry
was
sure
that
the
goblin
would
accept
nothing
but
the
sword
even
if
they
had
something
as
valuable
to
offer
him
yet
the
sword
was
their
one
indispensable
weapon
against
the
Horcruxes
he
closed
his
eyes
for
a
moment
or
two
and
listened
to
the
rush
of
the
sea
the
idea
that
Gryffindor
might
have
stolen
the
sword
was
unpleasant
to
him
He
had
always
been
proud
to
be
a
Gryffindor
Gryffindor
had
been
the
champion
of
muggle-borns
the
wizard
who
had
clashed
with
the
pureblood-loving
Slytherin
maybe
he's
lying
Harry
said
opening
his
eyes
again
griphook
maybe
Gryffindor
didn't
take
the
sword
how
do
we
know
the
goblin
version
of
history's
right
does
it
make
a
difference
asked
Hermione
changes
how
I
feel
about
it
said
Harry
he
took
a
deep
breath
we'll
tell
him
he
can
have
the
sword
after
he's
helped
us
get
into
that
vault
but
we'll
be
careful
to
avoid
telling
him
exactly
when
he
can
have
it
a
grin
spread
slowly
across
ron's
face
hermione
however
looked
alarmed
harry
we
can't
he
can
have
it
Harry
went
on
after
we've
used
it
on
all
of
the
Horcruxes
i'll
make
sure
he
gets
it
then
i'll
keep
my
word
but
that
could
be
years
said
Hermione
i
know
that
but
he
needn't
i
won't
be
lying
really
harry
met
her
eyes
with
a
mixture
of
defiance
and
shame
he
remembered
the
words
that
had
been
engraved
over
the
gateway
to
Nurmengard
for
the
greater
good
he
pushed
the
idea
away
what
choice
did
they
have
i
don't
like
it
said
Hermione
nor
do
I
much
Harry
admitted
well
I
think
it's
genius
said
Ron
standing
up
again
let's
go
and
tell
him
back
in
the
smallest
bedroom
Harry
made
the
offer
careful
to
phrase
it
so
as
not
to
give
any
definite
time
for
the
handover
of
the
sword
hermione
frowned
at
the
floor
while
he
was
speaking
he
felt
irritated
at
her
afraid
that
she
might
give
the
game
away
however
Griphook
had
eyes
for
nobody
but
Harry
i
have
your
word
Harry
Potter
that
you
will
give
me
the
sword
of
Gryffindor
if
I
help
you
yes
said
Harry
then
shake
said
the
goblin
holding
out
his
hand
harry
took
it
and
shook
he
wondered
whether
those
black
eyes
saw
any
misgivings
in
his
own
then
Griphook
relinquished
him
clapped
his
hands
together
and
said
so.
We
begin
it
was
like
planning
to
break
into
the
Ministry
all
over
again
they
settled
to
work
in
the
smallest
bedroom
which
was
kept
according
to
griphook's
preference
in
semidarkness
i
have
visited
the
Lestranges
vault
only
once
Griphook
told
them
on
the
occasion
I
was
told
to
place
inside
it
the
false
sword
it
is
one
of
the
most
ancient
chambers
the
oldest
Wizarding
families
store
their
treasures
at
the
deepest
level
where
the
vaults
are
largest
and
best
protected
they
remained
shut
in
the
cupboardlike
room
for
hours
at
a
time
slowly
the
days
stretched
into
weeks
there
was
problem
after
problem
to
overcome
not
least
of
which
was
that
their
store
of
Polyjuice
Potion
was
greatly
depleted
there's
really
only
enough
left
for
one
of
us
said
Hermione
tilting
the
thick
mudlike
potion
against
the
lamplight
that'll
be
enough
said
Harry
who
was
examining
griphook's
hand-drawn
map
of
the
deepest
passageways
the
other
inhabitants
of
Shell
Cottage
could
hardly
fail
to
notice
that
something
was
going
on
now
that
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
only
emerged
for
mealtimes
nobody
asked
questions
although
Harry
often
felt
bill's
eyes
on
the
three
of
them
at
the
table
thoughtful
concerned
the
longer
they
spent
together
the
more
Harry
realized
that
he
did
not
much
like
the
goblin
griphook
was
unexpectedly
bloodthirsty
laughed
at
the
idea
of
pain
in
lesser
creatures
and
seemed
to
relish
the
possibility
that
they
might
have
to
hurt
other
wizards
to
reach
the
Lestranges
vault
harry
could
tell
that
his
distaste
was
shared
by
the
other
two
but
they
did
not
discuss
it
they
needed
Griphook
the
goblin
ate
only
grudgingly
with
the
rest
of
them
even
after
his
legs
had
mended
he
continued
to
request
trays
of
food
in
his
room
like
the
still-frail
Ollivander
until
Bill
following
an
angry
outburst
from
Fleur
went
upstairs
to
tell
him
that
the
arrangement
could
not
continue
thereafter
Griphook
joined
them
at
the
overcrowded
table
although
he
refused
to
eat
the
same
food
insisting
instead
on
lumps
of
raw
meat
roots
and
various
fungi
harry
felt
responsible
It
was
after
all
he
who
had
insisted
that
the
goblin
remain
at
Shell
Cottage
so
that
he
could
question
him
his
fault
that
the
whole
Weasley
family
had
been
driven
into
hiding
that
Bill
Fred
George
and
mr.
Weasley
could
no
longer
work
i'm
sorry
he
told
Fleur
one
blustery
April
evening
as
he
helped
her
prepare
dinner
i
never
meant
you
to
have
to
deal
with
all
of
this
she
had
just
set
some
knives
to
work
chipping
up
steaks
for
Griphook
and
Bill
who
had
preferred
his
meat
bloody
ever
since
he
had
been
attacked
by
Greyback
while
the
knives
sliced
behind
her
her
somewhat
irritable
expression
softened
arry
you
saved
my
sister's
life
I
do
not
forget
this
was
not
strictly
speaking
true
but
Harry
decided
against
reminding
her
that
Gabrielle
had
never
been
in
real
danger
anyway
Fleur
went
on
pointing
her
want
at
a
pot
of
sauce
on
the
stove
which
began
to
bubble
at
once
mr.
Ollivander
leaves
for
muriel's
zis
evening
zat
will
make
zings
easier
ze
goblin
she
scowled
a
little
at
the
mention
of
him
can
move
downstairs
and
you
Ron
and
Dean
can
take
zat
room
we
don't
mind
sleeping
in
the
living
room
said
Harry
who
knew
that
Griphook
would
thing
poorly
of
having
to
sleep
on
the
sofa
keeping
Griphook
happy
was
essential
to
their
plans
don't
worry
about
us
and
when
she
tried
to
protest
he
went
on
we'll
be
off
your
hands
soon
too
Ron
Hermione
and
I
we
won't
need
to
be
here
much
longer
but
what
do
you
mean
she
said
frowning
at
him
her
wand
pointing
at
the
casserole
dish
now
suspended
in
midair
of
course
you
must
not
leave
you
are
safe
ere
she
looked
rather
like
Mrs
weasley
as
she
said
it
and
he
was
glad
that
the
back
door
opened
at
that
moment
luna
and
Dean
entered
their
hair
damp
from
the
rain
outside
and
their
arms
full
of
driftwood
and
tiny
little
ears
Luna
was
saying
a
bit
like
hippo's
Daddy
says
only
purple
and
hairy
and
if
you
want
to
call
them
you
have
to
hum
they
prefer
a
waltz
nothing
too
fast
looking
uncomfortable
Dean
shrugged
at
Harry
as
he
passed
following
Luna
into
the
combined
dining
and
sitting
room
where
Ron
and
Hermione
were
laying
the
dinner
table
seizing
the
chance
to
escape
fleur's
questions
Harry
grabbed
two
jugs
of
pumpkin
juice
and
followed
them
and
if
you
ever
come
to
our
house
i'll
be
able
to
show
you
the
horn
Daddy
wrote
to
me
about
it
but
I
haven't
seen
it
yet
because
the
Death
Eaters
took
me
from
the
Hogwarts
Express
and
I
never
got
home
for
Christmas
Luna
was
saying
as
she
and
Dean
relit
the
fire
luna
we
told
you
Hermione
called
over
to
her
that
horn
exploded
it
came
from
an
Erumpent
not
a
Crumple-Horned
Snorkack
no
it
was
definitely
a
Snorkack
horn
said
Luna
serenely
Daddy
told
me
it
will
probably
have
re-formed
by
now
they
mend
themselves
you
know
hermione
shook
her
head
and
continued
laying
down
forks
as
Bill
appeared
leading
mr.
Ollivander
down
the
stairs
the
wandmaker
still
looked
exceptionally
frail
and
he
clung
to
bill's
arm
as
the
latter
supported
him
carrying
a
large
suitcase
i'm
going
to
miss
you
mr.
Ollivander
said
Luna
approaching
the
old
man
and
I
you
my
dear
said
Ollivander
patting
her
on
the
shoulder
you
were
an
inexpressible
comfort
to
me
in
that
terrible
place
so
au
revoir
mr.
Ollivander
said
Fleur
kissing
him
on
both
cheeks
and
I
wonder
whezzer
you
could
oblige
me
by
delivering
a
package
to
bill's
Auntie
Murie
i
never
returned
er
tiara
it
will
be
an
honor
said
Ollivander
with
a
little
bow
the
very
least
I
can
do
in
return
for
your
generous
hospitality
fleur
drew
out
a
worn
velvet
case
which
she
opened
to
show
the
wandmaker
the
tiara
sat
glittering
and
twinkling
in
the
light
from
the
low-hanging
lamp
moonstones
and
diamonds
said
Griphook
who
had
sidled
into
the
room
without
Harry
noticing
made
by
goblins
I
think
and
paid
for
by
wizards
said
Bill
quietly
and
the
goblin
shot
him
a
look
that
was
both
furtive
and
challenging
a
strong
wind
gusted
against
the
cottage
windows
as
Bill
and
Ollivander
set
off
into
the
night
the
rest
of
them
squeezed
in
around
the
table
elbow
to
elbow
and
with
barely
enough
room
to
move
they
started
to
eat
the
fire
crackled
and
popped
in
the
grate
beside
them
fleur
Harry
noticed
was
merely
playing
with
her
food
she
glanced
at
the
window
every
few
minutes
however
Bill
returned
before
they
had
finished
their
first
course
his
long
hair
tangled
by
the
wind
everything's
fine
he
told
Fleur
ollivander
settled
in
Mum
and
Dad
say
hello
ginny
sends
you
all
her
love
Fred
and
George
are
driving
Muriel
up
the
wall
they're
still
operating
an
Owl-Order
business
out
of
her
back
room
it
cheered
her
up
to
have
her
tiara
back
though
she
said
she
thought
we'd
stolen
it
ah
she
eez
charmant
your
aunt
said
Fleur
crossly
waving
her
wand
and
causing
the
dirty
plates
to
rise
and
form
a
stack
in
midair
she
caught
them
and
marched
out
of
the
room
daddy's
made
a
tiara
piped
up
Luna
Well
more
of
a
crown
really
ron
caught
harry's
eye
and
grinned
Harry
knew
that
he
was
remembering
the
ludicrous
headdress
they
had
seen
on
their
visit
to
Xenophilius
yes
he's
trying
to
re-create
the
lost
diadem
of
Ravenclaw
he
thinks
he's
identified
most
of
the
main
elements
now
adding
the
billywig
wings
really
made
a
difference
there
was
a
bang
on
the
front
door
everyone's
head
turned
toward
it
fleur
came
running
out
of
the
kitchen
looking
frightened
Bill
jumped
to
his
feed
his
wand
pointing
at
the
door
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
did
the
same
silently
Griphook
slipped
beneath
the
table
out
of
sight
who
is
it
bill
called
it
is
I
Remus
John
Lupin
called
a
voice
over
the
howling
wind
harry
experienced
a
thrill
of
fear
what
had
happened
i
am
a
werewolf
married
to
Nymphadora
Tonks
and
you
the
Secret-Keeper
of
Shell
Cottage
told
me
the
address
and
bade
me
come
in
an
emergency
lupin
muttered
Bill
and
he
ran
to
the
door
and
wrenched
it
open
lupin
fell
over
the
threshold
he
was
white-faced
wrapped
in
a
traveling
cloak
his
graying
hair
windswept
he
straightened
up
looked
around
the
room
making
sure
of
who
was
there
then
cried
aloud
it's
a
boy
we've
named
him
Ted
after
dora's
father
hermione
shrieked
wha
tonks
Tonks
has
had
the
baby
yes
yes
she's
had
the
baby
shouted
Lupin
all
around
the
table
came
cries
of
delight
sighs
of
relief
Hermione
and
Fleur
both
squealed
Congratulations
and
Ron
said
Blimey
a
baby
as
if
he
had
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
before
yes
yes
a
boy
said
Lupin
again
who
seemed
dazed
by
his
own
happiness
he
strode
around
the
table
and
hugged
Harry
the
scene
in
the
basement
of
Grimmauld
Place
might
never
have
happened
you'll
be
godfather
he
said
as
he
released
Harry
m-me
stammered
Harry
you
yes
of
course
Dora
quite
agrees
no
one
better
i
yeah
blimey
harry
felt
overwhelmed
astonished
delighted
now
Bill
was
hurrying
to
fetch
wine
and
Fleur
was
persuading
Lupin
to
join
them
for
a
drink
i
can't
stay
long
I
must
get
back
said
Lupin
beaming
around
at
them
all
He
looked
years
younger
than
Harry
had
ever
seen
him
thank
you
thank
you
Bill
bill
had
soon
filled
all
of
their
goblets
they
stood
and
raised
them
high
in
a
toast
to
Teddy
Remus
Lupin
said
Lupin
a
great
wizard
in
the
making
oo
does
e
look
like
fleur
inquired
i
think
he
looks
like
Dora
but
she
thinks
he
is
like
me
not
much
hair
it
looked
black
when
he
was
born
but
I
swear
it's
turned
ginger
in
the
hour
since
probably
blond
by
the
time
I
get
back
andromeda
says
tonks's
hair
started
changing
color
the
day
that
she
was
born
he
drained
his
goblet
oh
go
on
then
just
one
more
he
added
beaming
as
Bill
made
to
fill
it
again
the
wind
buffeted
the
little
cottage
and
the
fire
leapt
and
crackled
and
Bill
was
soon
opening
another
bottle
of
wine
lupin's
news
seemed
to
have
taken
them
out
of
themselves
removed
them
for
a
while
from
their
state
of
siege
Tidings
of
new
life
were
exhilarating
only
the
goblin
seemed
untouched
by
the
suddenly
festive
atmosphere
and
after
a
while
he
slunk
back
to
the
bedroom
he
now
occupied
alone
harry
thought
he
was
the
only
one
who
had
noticed
this
until
he
saw
bill's
eyes
following
the
goblin
up
the
stairs
no
no
i
really
must
get
back
said
Lupin
at
last
declining
yet
another
goblet
of
wine
he
got
to
his
feet
and
pulled
his
traveling
cloak
back
around
himself
good-bye
good-bye
i'll
try
and
bring
some
pictures
in
a
few
day's
time
they'll
all
be
so
glad
to
know
that
i've
seen
you
he
fastened
his
cloak
and
made
his
farewells
hugging
the
women
and
grasping
hands
with
the
men
then
still
beaming
returned
into
the
wild
night
godfather
Harry
said
Bill
as
they
walked
into
the
kitchen
together
helping
clear
the
table
a
real
honor
congratulations
as
Harry
set
down
the
empty
goblets
he
was
carrying
Bill
pulled
the
door
behind
him
closed
shutting
out
the
still-voluble
voices
of
the
others
who
were
continuing
to
celebrate
even
in
lupin's
absence
i
wanted
a
private
word
actually
Harry
it
hasn't
been
easy
to
get
an
opportunity
with
the
cottage
this
full
of
people
bill
hesitated
harry
you're
planning
something
with
Griphook
it
was
a
statement
not
a
question
and
Harry
did
not
bother
to
deny
it
he
merely
looked
at
Bill
waiting
i
know
goblins
said
Bill
i've
worked
for
Gringotts
ever
since
I
left
Hogwarts
as
far
as
there
can
be
friendship
between
wizards
and
goblins
I
have
goblin
friends
or
at
least
goblins
I
know
well
and
like
again
Bill
hesitated
harry
what
do
you
want
from
Griphook
and
what
have
you
promised
him
in
return
i
can't
tell
you
that
said
Harry
sorry
Bill
the
kitchen
door
opened
behind
them
Fleur
was
trying
to
bring
through
more
empty
goblets
wait
Bill
told
her
Just
a
moment
she
backed
out
and
he
closed
the
door
again
then
I
have
to
say
this
Bill
went
on
if
you
have
struck
any
kind
of
bargain
with
Griphook
and
most
particularly
if
that
bargain
involves
treasure
you
must
be
exceptionally
careful
goblin
notions
of
ownership
payment
and
repayment
are
not
the
same
as
human
ones
harry
felt
a
slight
squirm
of
discomfort
as
though
a
small
snake
had
stirred
inside
him
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
we
are
talking
about
a
different
breed
of
being
said
Bill
dealings
between
wizards
and
goblins
have
been
fraught
for
centuries
but
you'll
know
all
that
from
History
of
Magic
there
has
been
fault
on
both
sides
I
would
never
claim
that
wizards
have
been
innocent
however
there
is
a
belief
among
some
goblins
and
those
at
Gringotts
are
perhaps
most
prone
to
it
that
wizards
cannot
be
trusted
in
matters
of
gold
and
treasure
that
they
have
no
respect
for
goblin
ownership
i
respect
Harry
began
but
Bill
shook
his
head
you
don't
understand
Harry
nobody
could
understand
unless
they
have
lived
with
goblins
to
a
goblin
the
rightful
and
true
master
of
any
object
is
the
maker
not
the
purchaser
all
goblin
made
objects
are
in
goblin
eyes
rightfully
theirs
but
it
was
bought
then
they
would
consider
it
rented
by
the
one
who
had
paid
the
money
they
have
however
great
difficulty
with
the
idea
of
goblin-made
objects
passing
from
wizard
to
wizard
you
saw
griphook's
face
when
the
tiara
passed
under
his
eyes
he
disapproves
i
believe
he
thinks
as
do
the
fiercest
of
his
kind
that
it
ought
to
have
been
returned
to
the
goblins
once
the
original
purchaser
died
they
consider
our
habit
of
keeping
goblin-made
objects
passing
them
from
wizard
to
wizard
without
further
payment
little
more
than
theft
harry
had
an
ominous
feeling
now
he
wondered
whether
Bill
guessed
more
than
he
was
letting
on
all
I
am
saying
said
Bill
setting
his
hand
on
the
door
back
into
the
sitting
room
is
to
be
very
careful
what
you
promise
goblins
Harry
it
would
be
less
dangerous
to
break
into
Gringotts
than
to
renege
on
a
promise
to
a
goblin
right
said
Harry
as
Bill
opened
the
door
yeah
thanks
i'll
bear
that
in
mind
as
he
followed
Bill
back
to
the
others
a
wry
thought
came
to
him
born
no
doubt
of
the
wine
he
had
drunk
he
seemed
set
on
to
become
just
as
reckless
a
godfather
to
Teddy
Lupin
as
Sirius
Black
had
been
to
him
chapter
Twenty-Six
gringotts
their
plans
were
made
their
preparations
complete
in
the
smallest
bedroom
a
single
long
coarse
black
hair
plucked
from
the
sweater
Hermione
had
been
wearing
at
Malfoy
Manor
lay
curled
in
a
small
glass
phial
on
the
mantelpiece
and
you'll
be
using
her
actual
wand
said
Harry
nodding
toward
the
walnut
wand
so
I
reckon
you'll
be
pretty
convincing
hermione
looked
frightened
that
the
wand
might
sting
or
bit
her
as
she
picked
it
up
i
hate
that
thing
she
said
in
a
low
voice
i
really
hate
it
it
feels
all
wrong
it
doesn't
work
properly
for
me
it's
like
a
bit
of
her
harry
could
not
help
but
remember
how
Hermione
has
dismissed
his
loathing
of
the
blackthorn
wand
insisting
that
he
was
imagining
things
when
it
did
not
work
as
well
as
his
own
telling
him
to
simply
practice
he
chose
not
to
repeat
her
own
advice
back
to
her
however
the
eve
of
their
attempted
assault
on
Gringotts
felt
like
the
wrong
moment
to
antagonize
her
it'll
probably
help
you
get
in
character
though
said
Ron
think
what
that
wand's
done
but
that's
my
point
said
Hermione
this
is
the
wand
that
tortured
neville's
mum
and
dad
and
who
knows
how
many
other
people
this
is
the
wand
that
killed
Sirius
harry
had
not
thought
of
that
He
looked
down
at
the
wand
and
was
visited
by
a
brutal
urge
to
snap
it
to
slice
it
in
half
with
gryffindor's
sword
which
was
propped
against
the
wall
beside
him
i
miss
my
wand
Hermione
said
miserably
i
wish
mr.
Ollivander
could
have
made
me
another
one
too
mr.
Ollivander
had
sent
Luna
a
new
wand
that
morning
she
was
out
on
the
back
lawn
at
that
moment
testing
its
capabilities
in
the
late
afternoon
sun
dean
who
had
lost
his
wand
to
the
Snatchers
was
watching
rather
gloomily
harry
looked
down
at
the
hawthorn
wand
that
had
once
belonged
to
Draco
Malfoy
he
had
been
surprised
but
pleased
to
discover
that
it
worked
for
him
at
least
as
well
as
hermione's
had
done
remembering
what
Ollivander
had
told
them
of
the
secret
workings
of
wands
Harry
thought
he
knew
what
hermione's
problem
was
She
had
not
won
the
walnut
wand's
allegiance
by
taking
it
personally
from
Bellatrix
the
door
of
the
bedroom
opened
and
Griphook
entered
harry
reached
instinctively
for
the
hilt
of
the
sword
and
drew
it
close
to
him
but
regretted
his
action
at
once
he
could
tell
that
the
goblin
had
noticed
seeking
to
gloss
over
the
sticky
moment
he
said
we've
just
been
checking
the
last-minute
stuff
Griphook
we've
told
Bill
and
Fleur
we're
leaving
tomorrow
and
we've
told
them
not
to
get
up
to
see
us
off
they
had
been
firm
on
this
point
because
Hermione
would
need
to
transform
in
Bellatrix
before
they
left
and
the
less
that
Bill
and
Fleur
knew
or
suspected
about
what
they
were
about
to
do
the
better
they
had
also
explained
that
they
would
not
be
returning
as
they
had
lost
perkin's
old
tent
on
the
night
that
the
snatcher's
caught
them
Bill
had
lent
them
another
one
it
was
now
packed
inside
the
beaded
bag
which
Harry
was
impressed
to
learn
Hermione
had
protected
from
the
Snatchers
by
the
simple
expedient
of
stuffing
it
down
her
sock
though
he
would
miss
Bill
Fleur
Luna
and
Dean
not
to
mention
the
home
comforts
they
had
enjoyed
over
the
last
few
weeks
Harry
was
looking
forward
to
escaping
the
confinement
of
Shell
Cottage
he
was
tired
of
trying
to
make
sure
that
they
were
not
overheard
tired
of
being
shut
in
the
tiny
dark
bedroom
most
of
all
he
longed
to
be
rid
of
Griphook
however
precisely
how
and
when
they
were
to
part
from
the
goblin
without
handing
over
gryffindor's
sword
remained
a
question
to
which
Harry
had
no
answer
it
had
been
impossible
to
decide
how
they
were
going
to
do
it
because
the
goblin
rarely
left
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
alone
together
for
more
than
five
minutes
at
a
time
He
could
give
my
mother
lessons
growled
Ron
as
the
goblin's
long
fingers
kept
appearing
around
the
edges
of
doors
with
bill's
warning
in
mind
Harry
could
not
help
suspecting
that
Griphook
was
on
the
watch
for
possible
skullduggery
hermione
disapproved
so
heartily
of
the
planned
double-cross
that
Harry
had
given
up
attempting
to
pick
her
brains
on
how
best
to
do
it
Ron
on
the
rare
occasions
that
they
had
been
able
to
snatch
a
few
griphook-free
moments
had
come
up
with
nothing
better
than
we'll
just
have
to
wing
it
mate
harry
slept
badly
that
night
lying
away
in
the
early
hours
he
thought
back
to
the
way
he
had
felt
the
night
before
they
had
infiltrated
the
Ministry
of
Magic
and
remembered
a
determination
almost
an
excitement
now
he
was
experiencing
jolts
of
anxiety
nagging
doubts
He
could
not
shake
off
the
fear
that
it
was
all
going
to
go
wrong
he
kept
telling
himself
that
their
plan
was
good
that
Griphook
knew
what
they
were
facing
that
they
were
well-prepared
for
all
the
difficulties
they
were
likely
to
encounter
yet
still
he
felt
uneasy
once
or
twice
he
heard
Ron
stir
and
was
sure
that
he
too
was
awake
but
they
were
sharing
the
sitting
room
with
Dean
so
Harry
did
not
speak
it
was
a
relief
when
six
o-clock
arrived
and
they
could
slip
out
of
their
sleeping
bags
dress
in
the
semidarkness
then
creep
out
into
the
garden
where
they
were
to
meet
Hermione
and
Griphook
the
dawn
was
chilly
but
there
was
little
wind
now
that
it
was
May
harry
looked
up
at
the
stars
still
glimmering
palely
in
the
dark
sky
and
listened
to
the
sea
washing
backward
and
forward
against
the
cliff
He
was
going
to
miss
the
sound
small
green
shoots
were
forcing
their
way
up
through
the
red
earth
of
dobby's
grave
now
in
a
year's
time
the
mound
would
be
covered
in
flowers
the
white
stone
that
bore
the
elf's
name
had
already
acquired
a
weathered
look
he
realized
now
that
they
could
hardly
have
laid
Dobby
to
rest
in
a
more
beautiful
place
but
Harry
ached
with
sadness
to
think
of
leaving
him
behind
looking
down
on
the
grave
he
wondered
yet
again
how
the
elf
had
known
where
to
come
to
rescue
them
his
fingers
moved
absentmindedly
to
the
little
pouch
still
strung
around
his
neck
thorough
which
he
could
feel
the
jagged
mirror
fragment
in
which
he
had
been
sure
he
had
seen
dumbledore's
eye
then
the
sound
of
a
door
opening
made
him
look
around
bellatrix
Lestrange
was
striding
across
the
lawn
toward
them
accompanied
by
Griphook
as
she
walked
she
was
tucking
the
small
beaded
bag
into
the
inside
pocket
of
another
set
of
the
old
robes
they
had
taken
from
Grimmauld
Place
though
Harry
knew
perfectly
well
that
it
was
really
Hermione
he
could
not
suppress
a
shiver
of
loathing
she
was
taller
than
he
was
her
long
black
hair
rippling
down
her
back
her
heavily
lidded
eyes
disdainful
as
they
rested
upon
him
but
then
she
spoke
and
he
heard
Hermione
through
bellatrix's
low
voice
she
tasted
disgusting
worse
than
Gurdyroots
okay
Ron
come
here
so
I
can
do
you
right
but
remember
I
don't
like
the
beard
too
long
oh
for
heaven's
sake
this
isn't
about
looking
handsome
it's
not
that
it
gets
in
the
way
but
I
liked
my
nose
a
bit
shorter
try
and
do
it
the
way
you
did
last
time
hermione
sighed
and
set
to
work
muttering
under
her
breath
as
she
transformed
various
aspects
of
ron's
appearance
he
was
to
be
given
a
completely
fake
identity
and
they
were
trusting
to
the
malevolent
aura
cast
by
Bellatrix
to
protect
him
meanwhile
Harry
and
Griphook
were
to
be
concealed
under
the
Invisibility
Cloak
there
said
Hermione
how
does
he
look
Harry
it
was
just
not
possible
to
discern
Ron
under
his
disguise
but
only
Harry
thought
because
he
knew
him
so
well
ron's
hair
was
now
long
and
wavy
he
had
a
thick
brown
beard
and
mustache
no
freckles
a
short
broad
nose
and
heavy
eyebrows
well
he's
not
my
type
but
he'll
do
said
Harry
shall
we
go
then
all
three
of
them
glanced
back
at
Shell
Cottage
lying
dark
and
silent
under
the
fading
stars
then
turned
and
began
to
walk
toward
the
point
just
beyond
the
boundary
wall
where
the
Fidelius
Chard
stopped
working
and
they
would
be
able
to
Disapparate
once
past
the
gate
Griphook
spoke
i
should
climb
up
now
Harry
Potter
I
think
harry
bent
down
and
the
goblin
clambered
onto
his
back
his
hands
linked
on
front
of
harry's
throat
he
was
not
heavy
but
Harry
disliked
the
feeling
of
the
goblin
and
the
surprising
strength
with
which
he
clung
on
hermione
pulled
the
Invisibility
Cloak
out
of
the
beaded
bag
and
threw
it
over
them
both
perfect
she
said
bending
down
to
check
harry's
feet
i
can't
see
a
thing
let's
go
harry
turned
on
the
spot
with
Griphook
on
his
shoulders
concentrating
with
all
his
might
on
the
Leaky
Cauldron
the
inn
that
was
the
entrance
to
Diagon
Alley
the
goblin
clung
even
tighter
as
they
moved
into
the
compressing
darkness
and
seconds
later
harry's
feet
found
pavement
and
he
opened
his
eyes
on
Charing
Cross
Road
muggles
bustled
past
wearing
the
hangdog
expressions
of
early
morning
quite
unconscious
of
the
little
inn's
existence
the
bar
of
the
Leaky
Cauldron
was
nearly
deserted
ton
the
stooped
and
toothless
landlord
was
polishing
glasses
behind
the
bar
counter
a
couple
of
warlocks
having
a
muttered
conversation
in
the
far
corner
glanced
at
Hermione
and
drew
back
into
the
shadows
madam
Lestrange
murmured
Tom
and
as
Hermione
paused
he
inclined
his
head
subserviently
good
morning
said
Hermione
and
as
Harry
crept
past
still
carrying
Griphook
piggyback
under
the
Cloak
he
saw
Tom
look
surprised
too
polite
Harry
whispered
in
hermione's
ear
as
they
passed
out
of
the
Inn
into
the
tiny
backyard
you
need
to
treat
people
like
they're
scum
okay
okay
hermione
drew
out
bellatrix's
wand
and
rapped
a
brick
in
the
nondescript
wall
in
front
of
them
at
once
the
bricks
began
to
whirl
and
spin
A
hole
appeared
in
the
middle
of
them
which
grew
wider
and
wider
finally
forming
an
archway
onto
the
narrow
cobbled
street
that
was
Diagon
Alley
it
was
quiet
barely
time
for
the
shops
to
open
and
there
were
hardly
and
shoppers
abroad
the
crooked
cobbled
street
was
much
altered
now
from
the
bustling
place
Harry
had
visited
before
his
first
team
at
Hogwarts
so
many
years
before
more
shops
than
ever
were
boarded
up
though
several
new
establishments
dedicated
to
the
Dark
Arts
had
been
created
since
his
last
visit
harry's
own
face
glared
down
at
him
from
posters
plastered
over
many
windows
always
captioned
with
the
words
undesirable
number
one
a
number
of
ragged
people
sat
huddled
in
doorways
he
heard
them
moaning
to
the
few
passersby
pleading
for
gold
insisting
that
they
were
really
wizards
one
man
had
a
bloody
bandage
over
his
eye
as
they
set
off
along
the
street
the
beggars
glimpsed
Hermione
they
seemed
to
melt
away
before
her
drawing
hoods
over
their
faces
and
fleeing
as
fast
as
they
could
hermione
looked
after
them
curiously
until
the
man
with
the
bloodied
bandage
came
staggering
right
across
her
path
my
children
he
bellowed
pointing
at
her
his
voice
was
cracked
high-pitched
he
sounded
distraught
where
are
my
children
what
has
he
done
with
them
you
know
you
know
ii
really
stammered
Hermione
the
man
lunged
at
her
reaching
for
her
throat
then
with
a
bang
and
a
burst
of
red
light
he
was
thrown
backward
onto
the
ground
unconscious
ron
stood
there
his
wand
still
outstretched
and
a
look
of
shock
visible
behind
his
beard
faces
appeared
at
the
windows
on
either
side
of
the
street
while
a
little
knot
of
prosperous-looking
passerby
gathered
their
robes
about
them
and
broke
into
gentle
trots
keen
to
vacate
the
scene
their
entrance
into
Diagon
Alley
could
hardly
have
been
more
conspicuous
for
a
moment
Harry
wondered
whether
it
might
not
be
better
to
leave
now
and
try
to
think
of
a
different
plan
before
they
could
move
or
consult
one
another
however
they
heard
a
cry
from
behind
them
why
Madam
Lestrange
harry
whirled
around
and
Griphook
tightened
his
hold
around
harry's
neck
A
tall
think
wizard
with
a
crown
of
bushy
gray
hair
and
a
long
sharp
nose
was
striding
toward
them
it's
Travers
hissed
the
goblin
into
harry's
ear
but
at
that
moment
Harry
could
not
think
who
Travers
was
hermione
had
drawn
herself
up
to
full
height
and
said
with
as
much
contempt
as
she
could
muster
and
what
do
you
want
travers
stopped
in
his
tracks
clearly
affronted
he's
another
Death
Eater
breathed
Griphook
and
Harry
sidled
sideways
to
repeat
the
information
into
hermione's
ear
i
merely
sought
to
greet
you
said
Travers
coolly
but
if
my
presence
is
not
welcome
harry
recognized
his
voice
now
Travers
was
one
of
the
Death
Eaters
who
had
been
summoned
to
Xenophiliuss
house
no
no
not
at
all
Travers
said
Hermione
quickly
trying
to
cover
up
her
mistake
how
are
you
well
I
confess
I
am
surprised
to
see
you
out
and
about
Bellatrix
really
why
asked
Hermione
well
Travers
coughed
I
heard
that
the
Inhabitants
of
Malfoy
Manor
were
confined
to
the
house
after
the
ah
escape
harry
willed
Hermione
to
keep
her
head
if
this
was
true
and
Bellatrix
was
not
supposed
to
be
out
in
public
the
Dark
Lord
forgives
those
who
have
served
him
most
faithfully
in
the
past
said
Hermione
in
a
magnificent
imitation
of
bellatrix's
most
contemptuous
manner
perhaps
your
credit
is
not
as
good
with
him
as
mine
is
Travers
though
the
Death
Eater
looked
offended
he
also
seemed
less
suspicious
he
glanced
down
at
the
man
Ron
had
just
Stunned
how
did
it
offend
you
it
does
not
matter
it
will
not
do
so
again
said
Hermione
coolly
some
of
these
wandless
can
be
troublesome
said
Travers
while
they
do
nothing
but
beg
I
have
no
objection
but
one
of
them
actually
asked
me
to
plead
her
case
in
the
Ministry
last
week
i'm
a
witch
sir
i'm
a
witch
let
me
prove
it
to
you
he
said
in
a
squeaky
impersonation
as
if
I
was
going
to
give
her
my
wandbut
whose
wand
said
Travers
curiously
are
you
using
at
the
moment
Bellatrix
i
heard
that
your
own
was
i
have
my
wand
here
said
Hermione
coldly
holding
up
bellatrix's
wand
i
don't
know
what
rumors
you
have
been
listening
to
Travers
but
you
seem
sadly
misinformed
travers
seemed
a
little
taken
aback
at
that
and
he
turned
instead
to
Ron
who
is
your
friend
i
do
not
recognize
him
this
is
Dragomir
Despard
said
Hermione
they
had
decided
that
a
fictional
foreigner
was
the
safest
cover
for
Ron
to
assume
he
speaks
very
little
English
but
he
is
in
sympathy
with
the
Dark
lord's
aims
he
has
traveled
here
from
Transylvania
to
see
our
new
regime
indeed
how
do
you
do
Dragomir
ow
you
said
Ron
holding
out
his
hand
travers
extended
two
fingers
and
shook
ron's
hand
as
though
frightened
of
dirtying
himself
so
what
brings
you
and
yourahsympathetic
friend
to
Diagon
Alley
this
early
asked
Travers
i
need
to
visit
Gringotts
said
Hermione
alas
I
also
said
Travers
gold
filthy
gold
we
cannot
live
without
it
yet
I
confess
I
deplore
the
necessity
of
consorting
with
our
long-fingered
friends
harry
felt
griphook's
clasped
hands
tighten
momentarily
around
his
neck
shall
we
said
Travers
gesturing
Hermione
forward
hermione
had
no
choice
but
to
fall
into
step
beside
him
and
head
along
the
crooked
cobbled
street
toward
the
place
where
the
snowy-white
Gringotts
stood
towering
over
the
other
little
shops
ron
sloped
along
beside
them
and
Harry
and
Griphook
followed
a
watchful
Death
Eater
was
the
very
last
thing
they
needed
and
the
worst
of
it
was
with
Travers
matching
at
what
he
believed
to
be
bellatrix's
side
there
was
no
means
for
Harry
to
communicate
with
Hermione
or
Ron
all
too
soon
they
arrived
at
the
foot
of
the
marble
steps
leading
up
to
the
great
bronze
doors
as
Griphook
had
already
warned
them
the
liveried
goblins
who
usually
flanked
the
entrance
had
been
replaced
by
two
wizards
both
of
whom
were
clutching
long
thin
golden
rods
ah
Probity
Probes
signed
Travers
theatrically
so
crudebut
so
effective
and
he
set
off
up
the
steps
nodding
left
and
right
to
the
wizards
who
raised
the
golden
rods
and
passed
them
up
and
down
his
body
the
Probes
Harry
knew
detected
spells
of
concealment
and
hidden
magical
objects
knowing
that
he
had
only
seconds
Harry
pointed
draco's
wand
at
each
of
the
guards
in
turn
and
murmured
Confundo
twice
unnoticed
by
Travers
who
was
looking
through
the
bronze
doors
at
the
inner
hall
each
of
the
guards
gave
a
little
start
as
the
spells
hit
them
hermione's
long
black
hair
rippled
behind
her
as
she
climbed
the
steps
one
moment
madam
said
the
guard
raising
his
Probe
but
you've
just
done
that
said
Hermione
in
bellatrix's
commanding
arrogant
voice
travers
looked
around
eyebrows
raised
the
guard
was
confused
he
stared
down
at
the
thin
golden
Probe
and
then
at
his
companion
who
said
in
a
slightly
dazed
voice
yeah
you've
just
checked
them
Marius
hermione
swept
forward
ron
by
her
side
Harry
and
Griphook
trotting
invisibly
behind
them
harry
glanced
back
as
they
crossed
the
threshold
the
wizards
were
both
scratching
their
heads
two
goblins
stood
before
the
inner
doors
which
were
made
of
silver
and
which
carried
the
poem
warning
of
dire
retribution
to
potential
thieves
harry
looked
up
at
it
and
all
of
a
sudden
a
knife-sharp
memory
came
to
him
standing
on
this
very
spot
on
the
day
that
he
had
turned
eleven
the
most
wonderful
birthday
of
his
life
and
Hagrid
standing
beside
him
saying
Like
I
said
yeh'd
be
mad
ter
try
an
rob
it
gringotts
had
seemed
a
place
of
wonder
that
day
the
enchanted
repository
of
a
trove
of
gold
he
had
never
known
he
possessed
and
never
for
an
instant
could
he
have
dreamed
that
he
would
return
to
steal
but
within
seconds
they
were
standing
in
the
vast
marble
hall
of
the
bank
the
long
counter
was
manned
by
goblins
sitting
on
high
stools
serving
the
first
customers
of
the
day
hermione
Ron
and
Travers
headed
toward
an
old
goblin
who
was
examining
a
thick
gold
coin
through
an
eyeglass
hermione
allowed
Travers
to
step
ahead
of
her
on
the
pretext
of
explaining
features
of
the
hall
to
Ron
the
goblin
tossed
the
coin
he
was
holding
aside
said
to
nobody
in
particular
Leprechaun
and
then
greeted
Travers
who
passed
over
a
tiny
golden
key
which
was
examined
and
given
back
to
him
hermione
stepped
forward
madam
Lestrange
said
the
goblin
evidently
startled
dear
me
howhow
may
I
help
you
today
i
wish
to
enter
my
vault
said
Hermione
the
old
goblin
seemed
to
recoil
a
little
harry
glanced
around
not
only
was
Travers
hanging
back
watching
but
several
other
goblins
had
looked
up
from
their
work
to
stare
at
Hermione
you
have
identification
asked
the
goblin
identification
ii
have
never
been
asked
for
identification
before
said
Hermione
they
know
whispered
Griphook
in
harry's
ear
They
must
have
been
warned
there
might
be
an
imposter
your
wand
will
do
madam
said
the
goblin
he
held
out
a
slightly
trembling
hand
and
in
a
dreadful
blast
of
realization
Harry
knew
that
the
goblins
of
Gringotts
were
aware
that
bellatrix's
wand
had
been
stolen
act
now
act
now
whispered
Griphook
in
harry's
ear
the
Imperious
Curse
harry
raised
the
hawthorn
wand
beneath
the
cloak
pointed
it
at
the
old
goblin
and
whispered
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
Imperio
a
curious
sensation
shot
down
harry's
arm
a
feeling
of
tingling
warmth
that
seemed
to
flow
from
his
mind
down
the
sinews
and
veins
connecting
him
to
the
wand
and
the
curse
it
had
just
cast
the
goblin
took
bellatrix's
wand
examined
it
closely
and
then
said
Ah
you
have
had
a
new
wand
made
Madam
Lestrange
what
said
Hermione
No
no
that's
mine
a
new
wand
said
Travers
approaching
the
counter
again
still
the
goblins
all
around
were
watching
but
how
could
you
have
done
which
wandmaker
did
you
use
harry
acted
without
thinking
pointing
his
wand
at
Travers
he
muttered
Imperio
once
more
oh
yes
I
see
said
Travers
looking
down
at
bellatrix's
wand
yes
very
handsome
and
is
it
working
well
i
always
think
wands
require
a
little
breaking
in
don't
you
hermione
looked
utterly
bewildered
but
to
harry's
enormous
relief
she
accepted
the
bizarre
turn
of
events
without
comment
the
old
goblin
behind
the
counter
clapped
his
hands
and
a
younger
goblin
approached
i
shall
need
the
Clankers
he
told
the
goblin
who
dashed
away
and
returned
a
moment
later
with
a
leather
bag
that
seemed
to
be
full
of
jangling
metal
which
he
handed
to
his
senior
good
good
s
if
you
will
follow
me
Madam
Lestrange
said
the
old
goblin
hopping
down
off
his
stool
and
vanishing
from
sight
i
shall
take
you
to
your
vault
he
appeared
around
the
end
of
the
counter
jogging
happily
toward
them
the
contents
of
the
leather
bag
still
jingling
travers
was
now
standing
quite
still
with
his
mouth
hanging
wide
open
ron
was
drawing
attention
to
this
odd
phenomenon
by
regarding
Travers
with
confusion
wait
Bogrod
another
goblin
came
scurrying
around
the
counter
we
have
instructions
he
said
with
a
bow
to
Hermione
forgive
me
Madam
but
there
have
been
special
orders
regarding
the
vault
of
Lestrange
he
whispered
urgently
in
Bogrods
ear
but
the
Imperiused
goblin
shook
him
off
i
am
aware
of
the
instructions
Madam
Lestrange
wishes
to
visit
her
vault
very
old
family
old
clients
this
way
please
and
still
clanking
he
hurried
toward
one
of
the
many
doors
leading
off
the
hall
harry
looked
back
at
Travers
who
was
still
rooted
to
the
spot
looking
abnormally
vacant
and
made
his
decision
with
a
flick
of
his
wand
he
made
Travers
come
with
them
walking
meekly
in
their
wake
as
they
reached
the
door
and
passed
into
the
rough
stone
passageway
beyond
which
was
lit
with
flaming
torches
were
in
trouble
they
suspect
said
Harry
as
the
door
slammed
behind
them
and
he
pulled
off
the
Invisibility
Cloak
griphook
jumped
down
from
his
shoulders
neither
Travers
nor
Bogrod
showed
the
slightest
surprise
at
the
sudden
appearance
of
Harry
Potter
in
their
midst
theyre
Imperiused
he
added
in
response
to
Hermione
and
Rons
confused
queries
about
Travers
and
Bogrod
who
were
both
now
standing
there
looking
blank
i
dont
think
I
did
it
strongly
enough
I
dont
know
and
another
memory
darted
through
his
mind
of
the
real
Bellatrix
Lestrange
shrieking
at
him
when
he
had
first
tried
to
use
an
Unforgivable
Curse
You
need
to
mean
them
Potter
what
do
we
do
asked
Ron
shall
we
get
out
now
while
we
can
if
we
can
said
Hermione
looking
back
toward
the
door
into
the
main
hall
beyond
which
who
knew
what
was
happening
weve
got
this
far
I
say
we
go
on
said
Harry
good
said
Griphook
so
we
need
Bogrod
to
control
the
cart
I
no
long
have
the
authority
but
there
will
not
be
room
for
the
wizard
harry
pointed
his
wand
at
Travers
imperio
the
wizard
turned
and
set
off
along
the
dark
track
at
a
smart
pace
what
are
you
making
him
do
hide
said
Harry
as
he
pointed
his
wand
at
Bogrod
who
whistled
to
summon
a
little
cart
that
came
trundling
along
the
tracks
toward
them
out
of
the
darkness
harry
was
sure
he
could
hear
shouting
behind
them
in
the
main
hall
as
they
all
clambered
into
it
Bogrod
in
front
of
Griphook
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
crammed
together
in
the
back
with
a
jerk
the
cart
moved
off
gathering
speed
They
hurried
past
Travers
who
was
wriggling
into
a
crack
in
the
wall
then
the
cart
began
twisting
and
turning
through
the
labyrinthine
passages
sloping
downward
all
the
time
harry
could
not
hear
anything
over
the
rattling
of
the
cart
on
the
tracks
His
hair
flew
behind
him
as
they
swerved
between
stalactites
flying
ever
deeper
into
the
earth
but
he
kept
glancing
back
they
might
as
well
have
left
enormous
footprints
behind
them
the
more
he
thought
about
it
the
more
foolish
it
seemed
to
have
disguised
Hermione
as
Bellatrix
to
have
brought
along
Bellatrixs
wand
when
the
Death
Eaters
knew
who
had
stolen
it
there
were
a
deeper
than
Harry
had
ever
penetrated
within
Gringotts
they
took
a
hairpin
bend
at
speed
and
saw
ahead
of
them
with
seconds
to
spare
a
waterfall
pounding
over
the
track
harry
heard
Griphook
shout
No
but
there
was
no
braking
they
zoomed
through
it
water
filled
Harrys
eyes
and
mouth
He
could
not
see
or
breathe
Then
with
an
awful
lurch
the
cart
flipped
over
and
they
were
all
thrown
out
of
it
harry
heard
the
cart
smash
into
pieces
against
the
passage
wall
heard
Hermione
shriek
something
and
felt
himself
glide
back
toward
the
ground
as
though
weightless
landing
painlessly
on
the
rocky
passage
floor
c-Cushioning
Charm
Hermione
spluttered
as
Ron
pulled
her
to
her
feet
but
to
Harrys
horror
he
saw
that
she
was
no
longer
Bellatrix
instead
she
stood
there
in
overlarge
robes
sopping
wet
and
completely
herself
Ron
was
red-haired
and
beardless
again
they
were
realizing
it
as
they
looked
at
each
other
feeling
their
own
faces
the
Thiefs
Downfall
said
Griphook
clambering
to
his
feet
and
looking
back
the
deluge
onto
the
tracks
which
Harry
knew
now
had
been
more
than
water
it
washes
away
all
enchantment
all
magical
concealment
they
know
there
are
imposers
in
Gringotts
they
have
set
off
defenses
against
us
harry
saw
Hermione
checking
that
she
still
had
the
beaded
bag
and
hurriedly
thrust
his
own
hand
under
his
jacket
to
make
sure
he
had
not
lost
the
Invisibility
Cloak
then
he
turned
to
see
Bogrod
shaking
his
head
in
bewilderment
The
Thiefs
Downfall
seemed
to
have
lifted
his
Imperius
Curse
we
need
him
said
Griphook
we
cannot
enter
the
vault
without
a
Gringotts
goblin
and
we
need
the
clankers
imperio
harry
said
again
his
voice
echoed
through
the
stone
passage
as
he
felt
again
the
sense
of
heady
control
that
flowed
from
brain
to
wand
bogrod
submitted
once
more
to
his
will
his
befuddled
expression
changing
to
one
of
polite
indifference
as
Ron
hurried
to
pick
up
the
leather
bag
of
metal
tools
harry
I
think
I
can
hear
people
coming
said
Hermione
and
she
pointed
Bellatrixs
wand
at
the
waterfall
and
cried
Protego
they
saw
the
Shield
Charm
break
the
flow
of
enchanted
water
as
it
flew
up
the
passageway
good
thinking
said
Harry
lead
the
way
Griphook
how
are
we
going
to
get
out
again
ron
asked
as
they
hurried
on
foot
into
the
darkness
after
the
goblin
Bogrod
panting
in
their
wake
like
an
old
dog
lets
worry
about
that
when
we
have
to
said
Harry
he
was
trying
to
listen
He
thought
he
could
hear
something
clanking
and
moving
around
nearby
griphook
how
much
farther
not
far
Harry
Potter
not
far
and
they
turned
a
corner
and
saw
the
thing
for
which
Harry
had
been
prepared
but
which
still
brought
all
of
them
to
a
halt
a
gigantic
dragon
was
tethered
to
the
ground
in
front
of
them
barring
access
to
four
or
five
of
the
deepest
vaults
in
the
place
the
beasts
scales
had
turned
pale
and
flaky
during
its
long
incarceration
under
the
ground
its
eyes
were
milkily
pink
both
rear
legs
bore
heavy
cuffs
from
which
chains
led
to
enormous
pegs
driven
deep
into
the
rocky
floor
its
great
spiked
wings
folded
close
to
its
body
would
have
filled
the
chamber
if
it
spread
them
and
when
it
turned
its
ugly
head
toward
them
it
roared
with
a
noise
that
made
the
rock
tremble
opened
its
mouth
and
spat
a
jet
of
fire
that
sent
them
running
back
up
the
passageway
it
is
partially
blind
panted
Griphook
but
even
more
savage
for
that
however
we
have
the
means
to
control
it
it
has
learned
what
to
expect
when
the
Clankers
come
give
them
to
me
ron
passed
the
bag
to
Griphook
and
the
goblin
pulled
out
a
number
of
small
metal
instruments
that
when
shaken
made
a
long
ringing
noise
like
miniature
hammers
on
anvils
griphook
handed
them
out
Bogrod
accepted
his
meekly
you
know
what
to
do
Griphook
told
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
it
will
expect
pain
when
it
hears
the
noise
it
will
retreat
and
Bogrod
must
place
his
palm
upon
the
door
of
the
vault
they
advanced
around
the
corner
again
shaking
the
Clankers
and
the
noise
echoed
off
the
rocky
walls
grossly
magnified
so
that
the
inside
of
Harrys
skull
seemed
to
vibrate
with
the
den
the
dragon
let
out
another
hoarse
roar
then
retreated
harry
could
see
it
trembling
and
as
they
drew
nearer
he
saw
the
scars
made
by
vicious
slashes
across
its
face
and
guess
that
it
had
been
taught
to
fear
hot
swords
when
it
heard
the
sound
of
the
Clankers
make
him
press
his
hand
to
the
door
griphook
urged
Harry
who
turned
his
wand
again
upon
Bogrod
the
old
goblin
obeyed
pressing
his
palm
to
the
wood
and
the
door
of
the
vault
melted
away
to
reveal
a
cavelike
opening
crammed
from
floor
to
ceiling
with
golden
coins
and
goblets
silver
armor
the
skins
of
strange
creatures
some
with
long
spines
other
with
drooping
wings
potions
in
jeweled
flasks
and
a
skull
still
wearing
a
crown
search
fast
said
Harry
as
they
all
hurried
inside
the
vault
he
had
described
Hufflepuffs
cap
to
Ron
and
Hermione
but
if
it
was
the
other
unknown
Horcrux
that
resided
in
this
vault
he
did
not
know
what
it
looked
like
he
barely
had
time
to
glance
around
however
before
there
was
a
muffled
clunk
from
behind
them
The
door
had
reappeared
sealing
them
inside
the
vault
and
they
were
plunged
into
total
darkness
no
matter
Bogrod
will
be
able
to
release
us
said
Griphook
as
Ron
gave
a
shout
of
surprise
light
your
wands
cant
you
and
hurry
we
have
little
time
lumos
harry
shone
his
lit
wand
around
the
vault
Its
beam
fell
upon
glittering
jewels
he
saw
the
fake
sword
of
Gryffindor
lying
on
a
high
shelf
amongst
a
jumble
of
chains
ron
and
Hermione
had
lit
their
wands
too
and
were
now
examining
the
piles
of
objects
surrounding
them
harry
could
this
be
aargh
hermione
screamed
in
pain
and
Harry
turned
his
wand
on
her
in
time
to
see
a
jeweled
goblet
tumbling
from
her
grip
but
as
it
fell
it
split
became
a
shower
of
goblets
so
that
a
second
later
with
a
great
clatter
the
floor
was
covered
in
identical
cups
rolling
in
every
direction
the
original
impossible
to
discern
amongst
them
it
burned
me
moaned
Hermione
sucking
her
blistered
fingers
they
have
added
Germino
and
Flagrante
Curses
said
Griphook
everything
you
touch
will
burn
and
multiply
but
the
copies
are
worthless
and
if
you
continue
to
handle
the
treasure
you
will
eventually
be
crushed
to
death
by
the
weight
of
expanding
gold
okay
dont
touch
anything
said
Harry
desperately
but
even
as
he
said
it
Ron
accidentally
nudged
one
of
the
fallen
goblets
with
his
foot
and
twenty
more
exploded
into
being
while
Ron
hopped
on
the
spot
part
of
his
shoe
burned
away
by
contact
with
the
hot
metal
stand
still
dont
move
said
Hermione
clutching
at
Ron
just
look
around
said
Harry
remember
the
cups
small
and
gold
its
got
a
badger
engraved
on
it
two
handles
otherwise
see
if
you
can
spot
Ravenclaws
symbol
anywhere
the
eagle
they
directed
their
wands
into
every
nook
and
crevice
turning
cautiously
on
the
spot
it
was
impossible
not
to
brush
up
against
anything
Harry
sent
a
great
cascade
of
fake
Galleons
onto
the
ground
where
they
joined
the
goblets
and
now
there
was
scarcely
room
to
place
their
feet
and
the
glowing
gold
blazed
with
heat
so
that
the
vault
felt
like
a
furnace
harrys
wandlight
passed
over
shields
and
goblin-made
helmets
set
on
shelves
rising
to
the
ceiling
higher
and
higher
he
raised
the
beam
until
suddenly
it
found
an
object
that
made
his
heart
skip
and
his
hand
tremble
its
there
its
up
there
ron
and
Hermione
pointed
there
wands
at
it
too
so
that
the
little
golden
cup
sparkled
in
a
three-way
spotlight
the
cup
that
had
belonged
to
Helga
Hufflepuff
which
had
passed
into
the
possession
of
Hepzibah
Smith
from
whom
it
had
been
stolen
by
Tom
Riddle
and
how
the
hell
are
we
going
to
get
up
there
without
touching
anything
asked
Ron
accio
Cup
cried
Hermione
who
had
evidently
forgotten
in
her
desperation
what
Griphook
had
told
them
during
their
planning
sessions
no
use
no
use
snarled
the
goblin
then
what
do
we
do
said
Harry
glaring
at
the
goblin
if
you
want
the
sword
Griphook
then
youll
have
to
help
us
more
than
wait
can
I
touch
stuff
with
the
sword
hermione
give
it
here
hermione
fumbled
insider
her
robes
drew
out
a
beaded
bag
rummaged
for
a
few
seconds
then
removed
the
shining
sword
harry
seized
it
by
its
rubied
hilt
and
touched
the
tip
of
the
blade
to
a
silver
flagon
nearby
which
did
not
multiply
if
I
can
just
poke
the
sword
through
a
handle
but
how
am
I
going
to
get
up
there
the
shelf
on
which
the
cup
reposed
was
out
of
reach
for
any
of
them
even
Ron
who
was
tallest
the
heat
from
the
enchanted
treasure
rose
in
waves
and
sweat
ran
down
Harrys
face
and
back
as
he
struggled
to
think
of
a
way
up
to
the
cup
and
then
he
heard
the
dragon
roar
on
the
other
side
of
the
vault
door
and
the
sound
of
clanking
growing
louder
and
louder
they
were
truly
trapped
now
There
was
no
way
out
except
through
the
door
and
a
horde
of
goblins
seemed
to
be
approaching
on
the
other
side
harry
looked
at
Ron
and
Hermione
and
saw
terror
in
their
faces
hermione
said
Harry
as
the
clanking
grew
louder
Ive
got
to
get
up
there
weve
got
to
get
rid
of
it
she
raised
her
wand
pointed
it
at
Harry
and
whispered
Levicorpus
hoisted
into
the
air
by
his
ankle
Harry
hit
a
suit
of
armor
and
replicas
burst
out
of
it
like
white-hot
bodies
filling
the
cramped
space
with
screams
of
pain
Ron
Hermione
and
the
two
goblins
were
knocked
aside
into
other
objects
which
also
began
to
replicate
half
buried
in
a
rising
tide
of
red-hot
treasure
they
struggled
and
yelled
has
Harry
thrust
the
sword
through
the
handle
of
Hufflepuffs
cup
hooking
it
onto
the
blade
impervius
screeched
Hermione
in
an
attempt
to
protect
herself
Ron
and
the
goblins
from
the
burning
metal
then
the
worst
scream
yet
made
Harry
look
down
Ron
and
Hermione
were
waist
deep
in
treasure
struggling
to
keep
Bogrod
from
slipping
beneath
the
rising
tide
but
Griphook
had
sunk
out
of
sight
and
nothing
but
the
tips
of
a
few
long
fingers
were
left
in
view
harry
seized
Griphooks
fingers
and
pulled
the
blistered
goblin
emerged
by
degrees
howling
liberatocorpus
yelled
Harry
and
with
a
crash
he
and
Griphook
landed
on
the
surface
of
the
swelling
treasure
and
the
sword
flew
out
of
Harrys
hand
get
it
harry
yelled
fighting
the
pain
of
the
hot
metal
on
his
skin
as
Griphook
clambered
onto
his
shoulders
again
determined
to
avoid
the
swelling
mass
of
red-hot
objects
wheres
the
sword
it
had
the
cup
on
it
the
clanking
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
was
growing
deafening
it
was
too
late
there
it
was
Griphook
who
had
seen
it
and
Griphook
who
lunged
and
in
that
instant
Harry
knew
that
the
goblin
had
never
expected
them
to
keep
their
word
one
hand
holding
tightly
to
a
fistful
of
Harrys
hair
to
make
sure
he
did
not
fall
into
the
heaving
sea
of
burning
gold
Griphook
seized
the
hilt
of
the
sword
and
swung
it
high
out
of
Harrys
reach
the
tiny
golden
cup
skewered
by
the
handle
on
the
swords
blade
was
flung
into
the
air
the
goblin
astride
him
Harry
dived
and
caught
it
and
although
he
could
feel
it
scalding
his
flesh
he
did
not
relinquish
it
even
while
countless
Hufflepuff
cups
burst
from
his
fist
raining
down
upon
him
as
the
entrance
of
the
vault
opened
up
again
and
he
found
himself
sliding
uncontrollably
on
an
expanding
avalanche
of
fiery
gold
and
silver
that
bore
him
Ron
Hermione
into
the
outer
chamber
hardly
aware
of
the
pain
from
the
burns
covering
his
body
and
still
borne
along
the
swell
of
replicating
treasure
Harry
shoved
the
cup
into
his
pocket
and
reached
up
to
retrieve
the
sword
but
Griphook
was
gone
sliding
from
Harrys
shoulders
the
moment
he
could
he
had
sprinted
for
cover
amongst
the
surrounding
goblins
brandishing
the
sword
and
crying
Thieves
thieves
help
thieves
he
vanished
into
the
midst
of
the
advancing
crowd
all
of
whom
were
holding
daggers
and
who
accepted
him
without
question
slipping
on
the
hot
metal
Harry
struggled
to
his
feet
and
knew
that
the
only
way
out
was
through
stupefy
he
bellowed
and
Ron
and
Hermione
joined
in
Jets
of
red
light
flew
into
the
crowd
of
goblins
and
some
toppled
over
but
others
advanced
and
Harry
saw
several
wizard
guards
running
around
the
corner
the
tethered
dragon
let
out
a
roar
and
a
gush
of
flame
flew
over
the
goblins
The
wizards
fled
doubled-up
back
the
way
they
had
come
and
inspiration
or
madness
came
to
Harry
pointing
his
wand
at
the
thick
cuffs
chaining
the
beast
to
the
floor
he
yelled
Relashio
the
cuffs
broken
open
with
loud
bangs
this
way
harry
yelled
and
still
shooting
Stunning
Spells
at
the
advancing
goblins
he
sprinted
toward
the
blind
dragon
harry
Harry
what
are
you
doing
cried
Hermione
get
up
climb
up
come
on
the
dragon
had
not
realized
that
it
was
free
Harrys
foot
found
the
crook
of
its
hind
leg
and
he
pulled
himself
up
onto
its
back
the
scales
were
hard
as
steel
it
did
not
even
seem
to
feel
him
he
stretched
out
an
arm
Hermione
hoisted
herself
up
Ron
climbed
on
behind
them
and
a
second
later
the
dragon
became
aware
that
it
was
untethered
with
a
roar
it
reared
Harry
dug
in
his
knees
clutching
as
tightly
as
he
could
to
the
jagged
scales
as
the
wings
opened
knocking
the
shrieking
goblins
aside
like
skittles
and
it
soared
into
the
air
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
flat
on
its
back
scraped
against
the
ceiling
as
it
dived
toward
the
passage
opening
while
the
pursuing
goblins
hurled
daggers
that
glanced
off
its
flanks
well
never
get
out
its
too
big
hermione
screamed
but
the
dragon
opened
its
mouth
and
belched
flame
again
blasting
the
tunnel
whose
floors
and
ceiling
cracked
and
crumbled
by
sheer
force
the
dragon
clawed
and
fought
its
way
through
harrys
eyes
were
shut
tight
against
the
heat
and
dust
Deafened
by
the
crash
of
rock
and
the
dragons
roars
he
could
only
cling
to
its
back
expecting
to
be
shaken
off
at
any
moment
then
he
heard
Hermione
yelling
Defodio
she
was
helping
the
dragon
enlarge
the
passageway
carving
out
the
ceiling
as
it
struggled
upward
toward
the
fresher
air
away
from
the
shrieking
and
clanking
goblins
Harry
and
Ron
copied
her
blasting
the
ceiling
apart
with
more
gouging
spells
they
passed
the
underground
lake
and
the
great
crawling
snarling
beast
seemed
to
sense
freedom
and
space
ahead
of
it
and
behind
them
the
passage
was
full
of
the
dragons
thrashing
spiked
tail
of
great
lumps
of
rock
gigantic
fractured
stalactites
and
the
clanking
of
the
goblins
seemed
to
be
growing
more
muffled
while
ahead
the
dragons
fire
kept
their
progress
clear
and
then
at
last
by
the
combined
force
of
their
spells
and
the
dragons
brute
strength
they
had
blasted
their
way
out
of
the
passage
into
the
marble
hallway
goblins
and
wizards
shrieked
and
ran
for
cover
and
finally
the
dragon
had
room
to
stretch
its
wings
Turning
its
horned
head
toward
the
cool
outside
air
it
could
smell
beyond
the
entrance
it
took
off
and
with
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
still
clinging
to
its
back
it
forced
its
way
through
the
metal
doors
leaving
them
buckled
and
hanging
from
their
hinges
as
it
staggered
into
Diagon
Alley
and
launched
itself
into
the
sky
chapter
Twenty-Seven
the
Final
Hiding
Place
there
was
no
means
of
steering
the
dragon
could
not
see
where
it
was
going
and
Harry
knew
that
if
it
turned
sharply
or
rolled
in
midair
they
would
find
it
impossible
to
cling
onto
its
broad
back
nevertheless
as
they
climbed
higher
and
higher
London
unfurling
below
them
like
a
gray-and-green
map
harry's
overwhelming
feeling
was
of
gratitude
for
an
escape
that
had
seemed
impossible
crouching
low
over
the
beast's
neck
he
clung
tight
to
the
metallic
scales
and
the
cool
breeze
was
soothing
on
his
burned
and
blistered
skin
the
dragon's
wings
beating
the
air
like
the
sails
of
a
windmill
behind
him
whether
from
delight
or
fear
he
could
not
tell
ron
kept
swearing
at
the
top
of
his
voice
and
Hermione
seemed
to
be
sobbing
after
five
minutes
or
so
Harry
lost
some
of
his
immediate
dread
that
the
dragon
was
going
to
throw
them
off
for
it
seemed
intent
on
nothing
but
getting
as
far
away
from
its
underground
prison
as
possible
but
the
question
of
how
and
when
they
were
to
dismount
remained
rather
frightening
he
had
no
idea
how
long
dragons
could
fly
without
landing
nor
how
this
particular
dragon
which
could
barely
see
would
locate
a
good
place
to
put
down
he
glanced
around
constantly
imagining
that
he
could
feel
his
seat
prickling
how
long
would
it
be
before
Voldemort
knew
that
they
had
broken
into
the
Lestranges
vault
how
soon
would
the
goblins
of
Gringotts
notify
Bellatrix
how
quickly
would
they
realize
what
had
been
taken
and
then
when
they
discovered
that
the
golden
cup
was
missing
voldemort
would
know
at
last
that
they
were
hunting
Horcruxes
the
dragon
seemed
to
crave
cooler
and
fresher
air
it
climbed
steadily
until
they
were
flying
through
wisps
of
chilly
cloud
and
Harry
could
no
longer
make
out
the
little
colored
dots
which
were
cars
pouring
in
and
out
of
the
capital
on
and
on
they
flew
over
countryside
parceled
out
in
patches
of
green
and
brown
over
roads
and
rivers
winding
through
the
landscape
like
strips
of
matte
and
glossy
ribbon
what
do
you
reckon
it's
looking
for
ron
yelled
as
they
flew
farther
and
farther
north
no
idea
Harry
bellow
back
his
hands
were
numb
with
cold
but
he
did
not
date
attempt
to
shift
his
grip
he
had
been
wondering
for
some
time
what
they
would
do
if
they
saw
the
coast
sail
beneath
them
if
the
dragon
headed
for
open
seal
he
was
cold
and
numb
not
to
mention
desperately
hungry
and
thirsty
when
he
wondered
had
the
beast
itself
last
eaten
surely
it
would
need
sustenance
before
long
and
what
if
at
that
point
it
realized
it
had
three
highly
edible
humans
sitting
on
its
back
the
sun
slipped
lower
in
the
sky
which
was
turning
indigo
and
still
the
dragon
flew
cities
and
towns
gliding
out
of
sight
beneath
them
its
enormous
shadow
sliding
over
the
earth
like
a
giant
dark
cloud
every
part
of
Harry
ached
with
the
effort
of
holding
on
to
the
dragon's
back
is
it
my
imagination
shouted
Ron
after
a
considerable
stretch
of
silence
or
are
we
losing
height
harry
looked
down
and
saw
deep
green
mountains
and
lakes
coppery
in
the
sunset
the
landscape
seemed
to
grow
larger
and
more
detailed
as
he
squinted
over
the
side
of
the
dragon
and
he
wondered
whether
it
had
divined
the
presence
of
fresh
water
by
the
flashes
of
reflected
sunlight
lower
and
lower
the
dragon
flew
in
great
spiraling
circles
honing
in
it
seemed
upon
one
of
the
smaller
lakes
i
say
we
jump
when
it
gets
low
enough
harry
called
back
to
the
others
straight
into
the
water
before
it
realizes
we're
here
they
agreed
Hermione
a
little
faintly
and
now
Harry
could
see
the
dragon's
wide
yellow
underbelly
rippling
in
the
surface
of
the
water
now
he
slithered
over
the
side
of
the
dragon
and
plummeted
feetfirst
toward
the
surface
of
the
lake
the
drop
was
greater
than
he
had
estimated
and
he
hit
the
water
hard
plunging
like
a
stone
into
a
freezing
green
reed-filled
world
he
kicked
toward
the
surface
and
emerged
panting
to
see
enormous
ripples
emanating
in
circles
from
the
places
where
Ron
and
Hermione
had
fallen
the
dragon
did
not
seem
to
have
noticed
anything
it
was
already
fifty
feet
away
swooping
low
over
the
lake
to
scoop
up
water
in
its
scarred
snout
as
Ron
and
Hermione
emerged
spluttering
and
gasping
from
the
depths
of
the
lake
the
dragon
flew
on
its
wings
beating
hard
and
landed
at
last
on
a
distant
bank
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
struck
out
for
the
opposite
shore
the
lake
did
not
seem
to
be
deep
soon
it
was
more
a
question
of
fighting
their
way
through
reeds
and
mud
than
swimming
and
at
last
they
flopped
sodden
panting
and
exhausted
onto
slippery
grass
hermione
collapsed
coughing
and
shuddering
though
Harry
could
have
happily
lain
down
and
slept
he
staggered
to
his
feet
drew
out
his
wand
and
started
casting
the
usual
protective
spells
around
them
when
he
had
finished
he
joined
the
others
it
was
the
first
time
that
he
had
seen
them
properly
since
escaping
from
the
vault
both
had
angry
red
burns
all
over
their
faces
and
arms
and
their
clothing
was
singed
away
in
places
they
were
wincing
as
they
dabbed
essence
of
dittany
onto
their
many
injuries
hermione
handed
Harry
the
bottle
then
pulled
out
three
bottles
of
pumpkin
juice
she
had
brought
from
Shell
Cottage
and
clean
dry
robes
for
all
of
them
they
changes
and
then
gulped
down
the
juice
well
on
the
upside
said
Ron
finally
who
was
sitting
watching
the
skin
on
his
hands
regrow
we
got
the
Horcrux
on
the
downside
no
sword
said
Harry
through
gritted
teeth
as
he
dripped
dittany
through
the
singed
hole
in
his
jeans
onto
the
angry
burn
beneath
no
sword
repeated
Ron
that
double-crossing
little
scab
harry
pulled
the
Horcrux
from
the
pocket
of
the
wet
jacket
he
had
just
taken
off
and
set
it
down
on
the
grass
in
front
of
them
glinting
in
the
sun
it
drew
their
eyes
as
they
swigged
their
bottles
of
juice
at
least
we
can't
wear
it
this
time
that'd
look
a
bit
weird
hanging
around
our
necks
said
Ron
wiping
his
mouth
on
the
back
of
his
hand
hermione
looked
across
the
lake
to
the
far
bank
where
the
dragon
was
still
drinking
what'll
happen
to
it
do
you
think
she
asked
Will
it
be
alright
you
sound
like
Hagrid
said
Ron
it's
a
dragon
Hermione
it
can
look
after
itself
it's
us
we
need
to
worry
about
what
do
you
mean
well
I
don't
know
how
to
break
this
to
you
said
Ron
but
I
think
they
might
have
noticed
we
broke
into
Gringotts
all
three
of
them
started
to
laugh
and
once
started
it
was
difficult
to
stop
harry's
ribs
ached
he
felt
lightheaded
with
hunger
but
he
lay
back
on
the
grass
beneath
the
reddening
sky
and
laughed
until
his
throat
was
raw
what
are
we
going
to
do
though
said
Hermione
finally
hiccuping
herself
back
to
seriousness
he'll
know
won't
he
you-Know-Who
will
know
we
know
about
his
Horcruxes
maybe
they'll
be
too
scared
to
tell
him
said
Ron
hopefully
Maybe
they'll
cover
up
The
sky
the
smell
of
the
lake
water
the
sound
of
ron's
voice
were
extinguished
pain
cleaved
harry's
head
like
a
sword
stroke
he
was
standing
in
a
dimly
lit
room
and
a
semicircle
of
wizards
faced
him
and
on
the
floor
at
his
feet
knelt
a
small
quaking
figure
what
did
you
say
to
me
his
voice
was
high
and
cold
but
fury
and
fear
burned
inside
him
the
one
thing
that
he
had
dreaded
but
it
could
not
be
true
he
could
not
see
how
the
goblin
was
trembling
unable
to
meet
the
red
eyes
high
above
his
say
it
again
murmured
Voldemort
say
it
again
m-my
Lord
stammered
the
goblin
its
black
eyes
wide
with
terror
m-my
Lord
we
t-tried
to
st-stop
them
im-impostors
my
Lord
broke
broke
into
the
into
the
Lestranges
vault
impostors
what
impostors
i
thought
Gringotts
had
ways
of
revealing
impostors
who
were
they
it
was
it
was
the
P-Potter
b-boy
and
the
t-two
accomplices
and
they
took
he
said
his
voice
rising
a
terrible
fear
gripping
him
Tell
me
what
did
they
take
a
s-small
golden
c-cup
m-my
Lord
the
scream
of
rage
of
denial
left
him
as
if
it
were
a
stranger's
he
was
crazed
frenzied
it
could
not
be
true
it
was
impossible
nobody
had
known
how
was
it
possible
that
the
boy
could
have
discovered
his
secret
the
Elder
Wand
slashed
through
the
air
and
green
light
erupted
through
the
room
the
kneeling
goblin
rolled
over
dead
the
watching
wizards
scattered
before
him
terrified
bellatrix
and
Lucius
Malfoy
threw
others
behind
them
in
their
race
for
the
door
and
again
and
again
his
wand
fell
and
those
who
were
left
were
slain
all
of
them
for
bringing
him
this
news
for
hearing
about
the
golden
cup
Alone
amongst
the
dead
he
stomped
up
and
down
and
they
passed
before
him
in
vision
his
treasures
his
safeguards
his
anchors
to
immortality
the
diary
was
destroyed
and
the
cup
was
stolen
what
if
what
if
the
boy
knew
about
the
others
could
he
know
had
he
already
acted
had
he
traced
more
of
them
was
Dumbledore
at
the
root
of
this
dumbledore
who
had
always
suspected
him
Dumbledore
dead
on
his
orders
Dumbledore
whose
wand
was
his
now
yet
who
reached
out
from
the
ignominy
of
death
through
the
boy
the
boy
But
surely
if
the
boy
had
destroyed
any
of
his
Horcruxes
he
Lord
Voldemort
would
have
known
would
have
felt
it
he
the
greatest
wizard
of
them
all
he
the
most
powerful
he
the
killer
of
Dumbledore
and
of
how
many
other
worthless
nameless
men
how
could
Lord
Voldemort
not
have
known
if
he
himself
most
important
and
precious
had
been
attacked
mutilated
true
he
had
not
felt
it
when
the
diary
had
been
destroyed
but
he
had
thought
that
was
because
he
had
no
body
to
fell
being
less
than
ghost
no
surely
the
rest
were
safe
the
other
Horcruxes
must
be
intact
but
he
must
know
he
must
be
sure
he
paced
the
room
kicking
aside
the
goblin's
corpse
as
he
passed
and
the
pictures
blurred
and
burned
in
his
boiling
brain
the
lake
the
shack
and
Hogwarts
A
modicum
of
calm
cooled
his
rage
now
how
could
the
boy
know
that
he
had
hidden
the
ring
in
the
Gaunt
shack
no
one
had
ever
known
him
to
be
related
to
the
Gaunts
he
had
hidden
the
connection
the
killings
had
never
been
traced
to
him
the
ring
surely
was
safe
and
how
could
the
boy
or
anybody
else
know
about
the
cave
or
penetrate
its
protection
the
idea
of
the
locket
being
stolen
was
absurd
as
for
the
school
He
alone
knew
where
in
Hogwarts
he
had
stowed
the
Horcrux
because
he
alone
had
plumed
the
deepest
secrets
of
that
place
and
there
was
still
Nagini
who
must
remain
close
now
no
longer
sent
to
do
his
bidding
under
his
protection
but
to
be
sure
to
be
utterly
sure
he
must
return
to
each
of
his
hiding
places
he
must
redouble
protection
around
each
of
his
Horcruxes
a
job
like
the
quest
for
the
Elder
Wand
that
he
must
undertake
alone
which
should
he
visit
first
which
was
in
most
danger
an
old
unease
flickered
inside
him
dumbledore
had
known
his
middle
name
dumbledore
might
have
made
the
connection
with
the
Gaunts
their
abandoned
home
was
perhaps
the
least
secure
of
his
hiding
places
it
was
there
that
he
would
go
first
the
lake
surely
impossible
though
was
there
a
slight
possibility
that
Dumbledore
might
have
known
some
of
his
past
misdeeds
through
the
orphanage
and
Hogwarts
but
he
knew
the
his
Horcrux
there
was
safe
it
would
be
impossible
for
Potter
to
enter
Hogsmeade
without
detection
let
alone
the
school
nevertheless
it
would
be
prudent
to
alert
Snape
to
the
fact
that
the
boy
might
try
to
reenter
the
castle
to
tell
Snape
why
the
boy
might
return
would
be
foolish
of
course
it
had
been
a
grave
mistake
to
trust
Bellatrix
and
Malfoy
didn't
their
stupidity
and
carelessness
prove
how
unwise
it
was
ever
to
trust
he
would
visit
the
Gaunt
shack
first
then
and
take
Nagini
with
him
he
would
not
be
parted
from
the
snake
anymore
and
he
strode
from
the
room
through
the
hall
and
out
into
the
dark
garden
where
the
fountain
played
he
called
the
snake
in
Parseltongue
and
it
slithered
out
to
join
him
like
a
long
shadow
harry's
eyes
flew
open
as
he
wrenched
himself
back
to
the
present
he
was
lying
on
the
bank
of
the
lake
in
the
setting
sun
and
Ron
and
Hermione
were
looking
down
at
him
judging
by
their
worried
looks
and
by
the
continued
pounding
of
his
scar
his
sudden
excursion
into
voldemort's
mind
had
not
passed
unnoticed
he
struggled
up
shivering
vaguely
surprised
that
he
was
still
wet
to
his
skin
and
saw
the
cup
lying
innocently
in
the
grass
before
him
and
the
lake
deep
blue
shot
with
gold
in
the
falling
sun
he
knows
his
own
voice
sounded
strange
and
low
after
voldemort's
high
screams
he
knows
and
he's
going
to
check
where
the
others
are
and
the
last
one
he
was
already
on
his
feet
is
at
Hogwarts
i
knew
it
i
knew
it
what
ron
was
gaping
at
him
Hermione
sat
up
looking
worried
but
what
did
you
see
how
do
you
know
i
saw
him
find
out
about
the
cup
I
I
was
in
his
head
he's
Harry
remembered
the
killings
he's
seriously
angry
and
scared
too
he
can't
understand
how
we
knew
and
now
he's
going
to
check
the
others
are
safe
the
ring
first
he
things
the
Hogwarts
one
is
safest
because
snape's
there
because
it'll
be
so
hard
not
to
be
seen
getting
in
i
think
he'll
check
that
one
last
but
he
could
still
be
there
within
hours
Did
you
see
where
in
Hogwarts
it
is
asked
Ron
now
scrambling
to
his
feet
too
no
he
was
concentrating
on
warning
Snape
he
didn't
think
about
exactly
where
it
is
Wait
wait
cried
Hermione
as
Ron
caught
up
to
the
Horcrux
and
Harry
pulled
out
the
Invisibility
Cloak
again
we
can't
just
go
we
haven't
got
a
plan
we
need
to
We
need
to
get
going
said
Harry
firmly
he
had
been
hoping
to
sleep
looking
forward
to
getting
into
the
new
tent
but
that
was
impossible
now
Can
you
imagine
what
he's
going
to
do
once
he
realizes
the
ring
and
the
locket
are
gone
what
if
he
moves
the
Hogwarts
Horcrux
decides
it
isn't
safe
enough
but
how
are
we
going
to
get
in
we'll
go
to
Hogsmeade
said
Harry
and
try
to
work
something
out
once
we
see
what
the
protection
around
the
school's
like
get
under
the
Cloak
Hermione
I
want
to
stick
together
this
time
but
we
don't
really
fit
it'll
be
dark
no
one's
going
to
notice
our
feet
the
flapping
of
enormous
wings
echoed
across
the
black
water
the
dragon
had
drunk
its
fill
and
risen
into
the
air
they
paused
in
their
preparations
to
watch
it
climb
higher
and
higher
now
black
against
the
rapidly
darkening
sky
until
it
vanished
over
a
nearby
mountain
then
Hermione
walked
forward
and
took
her
place
between
the
other
two
Harry
pulled
the
Cloak
down
as
far
as
it
would
go
and
together
they
turned
on
the
spot
into
the
crushing
darkness
chapter
Twenty-Eight
the
Missing
Mirror
harry's
feet
touched
the
road
he
saw
the
achingly
familiar
Hogsmeade
High
Street
dark
shop
fronts
and
the
mist
line
of
black
mountains
beyond
the
village
and
the
curve
in
the
road
ahead
that
led
off
toward
Hogwarts
and
light
spilling
from
the
windows
of
the
Three
Broomsticks
and
with
a
lurch
of
the
hear
he
remembered
with
piercing
accuracy
how
he
had
landed
here
nearly
a
year
before
supporting
a
desperately
weak
Dumbledore
all
this
in
a
second
upon
landing
and
then
even
as
he
relaxed
his
grip
upon
ron's
and
hermione's
arms
it
happened
the
air
was
rent
by
a
scream
that
sounded
like
voldemort's
when
he
had
realized
the
cup
had
been
stolen
It
tore
at
every
nerve
in
harry's
body
and
he
knew
that
their
appearance
had
caused
it
even
as
he
looked
at
the
other
two
beneath
the
Cloak
the
door
of
the
Three
Broomsticks
burst
open
and
a
dozen
cloaked
and
hooded
Death
Eaters
dashed
into
the
streets
their
wands
aloft
harry
seized
ron's
wrist
as
he
raised
his
wand
there
were
too
many
of
them
to
run
even
attempting
it
would
have
give
away
their
position
one
of
the
Death
Eaters
raised
his
wand
and
the
scream
stopped
still
echoing
around
the
distant
mountains
accio
Cloak
roared
one
of
the
Death
Eaters
harry
seized
his
folds
but
it
made
no
attempt
to
escape
the
Summoning
Charm
had
not
worked
on
it
not
under
your
wrapper
then
Potter
yelled
the
Death
Eater
who
had
tried
the
charm
and
then
to
his
fellows
spread
now
he's
here
six
of
the
Death
Eaters
ran
toward
them
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
backed
as
quickly
as
possible
down
the
nearest
side
street
and
the
Death
Eaters
missed
them
by
inches
they
waited
in
the
darkness
listening
to
the
footsteps
running
up
and
down
beams
of
light
flying
along
the
street
from
the
Death
Eaters
searching
wands
let's
just
leave
hermione
whispered
disapparate
now
great
idea
said
Ron
but
before
Harry
could
reply
a
Death
Eater
shouted
we
know
you
are
here
Potter
and
there's
no
getting
away
we'll
find
you
they
were
ready
for
us
whispered
Harry
they
set
up
that
spell
to
tell
them
we'd
come
i
reckon
theyve
done
something
to
keep
us
here
trap
us
what
about
dementors
called
another
Death
Eater
let'em
have
free
rein
they'd
find
him
quick
enough
the
Dark
Lord
wants
Potter
dead
by
no
hands
but
his
an
dementors
won't
kill
him
the
Dark
Lord
wants
potter's
life
nor
his
soul
he'll
be
easier
to
kill
if
he's
been
Kissed
first
there
were
noises
of
agreement
dread
filled
Harry
To
repel
dementors
they
would
have
to
produce
patronuses
which
would
give
them
away
immediately
we're
going
to
have
to
try
to
Disapparate
Harry
hermione
whispered
even
as
she
said
it
he
felt
the
unnatural
cold
being
spread
over
the
street
light
was
sucked
from
the
environment
right
up
to
the
stars
which
vanished
in
the
pitch
blackness
he
felt
Hermione
take
hold
of
his
arm
and
together
they
turned
on
the
spot
the
air
through
which
they
needed
to
move
seemed
to
have
become
solid
They
could
not
disapparate
the
Death
Eaters
had
cast
their
charms
well
the
cold
was
biting
deeper
and
deeper
into
harry's
flesh
he
Ron
and
Hermione
retreated
down
the
side
street
groping
their
way
along
the
wall
trying
not
to
make
a
sound
then
around
the
corner
gliding
noiselessly
came
dementors
ten
or
more
of
them
visible
because
they
were
of
a
denser
darkness
than
their
surroundings
with
their
black
cloaks
and
their
scabbed
and
rotting
hands
could
they
sense
fear
in
the
vicinity
harry
was
sure
of
it
They
seemed
to
be
coming
more
quickly
now
taking
those
dragging
rattling
breaths
he
detested
tasting
despair
in
the
air
closing
in
he
raised
his
wand
He
could
not
would
not
suffer
the
dementor's
Kiss
whatever
happened
afterward
it
was
of
Ron
and
Hermione
that
he
thought
as
he
whispered
Expecto
Patronum
the
silver
stag
burst
from
his
wand
and
charged
The
Dementors
scattered
and
there
was
a
triumphant
yell
from
somewhere
out
of
sight
it's
him
down
there
down
there
I
saw
his
Patronus
it
was
a
stag
the
Dementors
have
retreated
the
stars
were
popping
out
again
and
the
footsteps
of
the
Death
Eaters
were
becoming
louder
but
before
Harry
in
his
panic
could
decide
what
to
do
there
was
a
grinding
of
bolts
nearby
a
door
opened
on
the
left-side
of
the
narrow
street
and
a
rough
voice
said
Potter
in
here
quick
he
obeyed
without
hesitation
the
three
of
them
hurried
through
the
open
doorway
upstairs
keep
the
Cloak
on
keep
quiet
muttered
a
tall
figure
passing
them
on
his
way
into
the
street
and
slammed
the
door
behind
him
harry
had
had
no
idea
where
they
were
but
now
he
saw
by
the
stuttering
light
of
a
single
candle
the
grubby
sawdust
bar
of
the
hog's
Head
Inn
they
ran
behind
the
counter
and
through
a
second
doorway
which
led
to
a
trickery
wooden
staircase
that
they
climbed
as
fast
as
they
could
the
stairs
opened
into
a
sitting
room
with
a
durable
carpet
and
a
small
fireplace
above
which
hung
a
single
large
oil
painting
of
a
blonde
girl
who
gazed
out
at
the
room
with
a
kind
of
a
vacant
sweetness
shouts
reached
from
the
streets
below
still
wearing
the
Invisibility
Cloak
on
they
hurried
toward
the
grimy
window
and
looked
down
their
savior
whom
Harry
now
recognized
as
the
hog's
head's
barman
was
the
only
person
not
wearing
a
hood
so
what
he
was
bellowing
into
one
of
the
hooded
faces
so
what
you
send
dementors
down
my
street
i'll
send
a
Patronus
back
at'em
i'm
not
having'em
near
me
i've
told
you
that
i'm
not
having
it
that
wasn't
your
Patronus
said
a
Death
Eater
that
was
a
stag
it
was
potter's
stag
roared
the
barman
and
he
pulled
out
a
wand
stag
you
idiot
Expecto
Patronum
something
huge
and
horned
erupted
from
the
wand
head
down
it
charged
toward
the
High
Street
and
out
of
sight
that's
not
what
I
saw
said
the
Death
Eater
though
was
less
certainly
curfew's
been
broken
you
heard
the
noise
one
of
his
companions
told
the
barman
someone
was
out
on
the
streets
against
regulations
if
I
want
to
put
my
cat
out
I
will
and
be
damned
to
your
curfew
you
set
off
the
Caterwauling
Charm
what
if
I
did
going
to
cart
me
off
to
Azkaban
kill
me
for
sticking
my
nose
out
my
own
front
door
do
it
then
if
you
want
to
but
I
hope
for
your
sakes
you
haven't
pressed
your
little
Dark
Marks
and
summoned
him
he's
not
going
to
like
being
called
here
for
me
and
my
old
cat
is
he
now
don't
worry
about
us
said
one
of
the
Death
Eaters
worry
about
yourself
breaking
curfew
and
where
will
you
lot
traffic
potions
and
poisons
when
my
pub's
closed
down
what
will
happen
to
your
little
sidelines
then
are
you
threatening
i
keep
my
mouth
shut
it's
why
you
come
here
isn't
it
i
still
say
I
saw
a
stag
Patronus
shouted
the
first
Death
Eater
stag
roared
the
barman
it's
a
goat
idiot
all
right
we
made
a
mistake
said
the
second
Death
Eater
break
curfew
again
and
we
won't
be
so
lenient
the
Death
Eaters
strode
back
towards
the
High
Street
hermione
moaned
with
relief
wove
out
from
under
the
Cloak
and
sat
down
on
a
wobble-legged
chair
harry
drew
the
curtains
then
pulled
the
Cloak
off
himself
and
Ron
they
could
hear
the
barman
down
below
rebolting
the
door
of
the
bar
then
climbing
the
stairs
harry's
attention
was
caught
by
something
on
the
mantelpiece
a
small
rectangular
mirror
propped
on
top
of
it
right
beneath
the
portrait
of
the
girl
the
barman
entered
the
room
you
bloody
fools
he
said
gruffly
looking
from
one
to
the
other
of
them
what
were
you
thinking
coming
here
thank
you
said
Harry
you
can't
thank
you
enough
you
saved
our
lives
the
barman
grunted
harry
approached
him
looking
up
into
the
face
trying
to
see
past
the
long
stringy
wire-gray
hair
beard
he
wore
spectacles
behind
the
dirty
lenses
the
eyes
were
a
piercing
brilliant
blue
it's
your
eye
i've
been
seeing
in
the
mirror
there
was
a
silence
in
the
room
harry
and
the
barman
looked
at
each
other
you
sent
Dobby
the
barman
nodded
and
looked
around
for
the
elf
thought
he'd
be
with
you
where've
you
left
him
he's
dead
said
Harry
Bellatrix
Lestrange
killed
him
the
barman
face
was
impassive
after
a
few
moments
he
said
i'm
sorry
to
hear
it
I
liked
that
elf
he
turned
away
lightning
lamps
with
prods
of
his
wand
not
looking
at
any
of
them
you're
Aberforth
said
Harry
to
the
man's
back
he
neither
confirmed
or
denied
it
but
bent
to
light
the
fire
how
did
you
get
this
harry
asked
walking
across
to
sirius's
mirror
the
twin
of
the
one
he
had
broken
nearly
two
years
before
bought
it
from
Dung
bout
a
year
ago
said
Aberforth
albus
told
me
what
it
was
been
trying
to
keep
an
eye
out
for
you
ron
gasped
the
silver
doe
he
said
excitedly
Was
that
you
too
what
are
you
talking
about
asked
Aberforth
someone
sent
a
doe
Patronus
to
us
brains
like
that
you
could
be
a
Death
Eater
son
haven't
I
just
prove
my
Patronus
is
a
goat
oh
said
Ron
Yeah
well
i'm
hungry
he
added
defensively
as
his
stomach
gave
an
enormous
rumble
i
got
food
said
Aberforth
and
he
sloped
out
of
the
room
reappearing
moments
later
with
a
large
loaf
of
bread
some
cheese
and
a
pewter
jug
of
mead
which
he
set
upon
a
small
table
in
front
of
the
fire
ravenous
they
ate
and
drank
and
for
a
while
there
was
sound
of
chewing
right
then
said
Aberforth
when
the
had
eaten
their
fill
and
Harry
and
Ron
sat
slumped
dozily
in
their
chairs
we
need
to
think
of
the
best
way
to
get
you
out
of
here
can't
be
done
by
night
you
heard
what
happens
if
anyone
moves
outdoors
during
darkness
Caterwauling
charm's
set
off
they'll
be
onto
you
like
bowtruckles
on
doxy
eggs
i
don't
reckon
i'll
be
able
to
pass
of
a
stag
as
a
goat
a
second
time
wait
for
daybreak
when
curfew
lifts
then
you
can
put
your
Cloak
back
on
and
set
out
on
foot
get
right
out
of
Hogsmeade
up
into
the
mountains
and
you'll
be
able
to
Disapparate
there
might
see
Hagrid
he's
been
hiding
in
a
cave
up
there
with
grawp
ever
since
they
tried
to
arrest
him
we're
not
leaving
said
Harry
we
need
to
get
into
Hogwarts
don't
be
stupid
boy
said
Aberforth
we've
got
to
said
Harry
what
you've
got
to
do
said
Aberforth
leaning
forward
is
to
get
as
far
from
here
as
from
here
as
you
can
you
don't
understand
there
isn't
much
time
we've
got
to
get
into
the
castle
dumbledore
I
mean
your
brother
wanted
us
the
firelight
made
the
grimy
lenses
of
aberforth's
glasses
momentarily
opaque
a
bright
flat
white
and
harry
remembered
the
blind
eyes
of
the
giant
spider
Aragog
my
brother
Albus
wanted
a
lot
of
things
said
Aberforth
and
people
had
a
habit
of
getting
hurt
while
he
was
carrying
out
his
grand
plans
you
get
away
from
this
school
Potter
and
out
of
the
country
if
you
can
forget
my
brother
and
his
clever
schemes
he's
gone
where
none
of
this
can
hurt
him
and
you
don't
owe
him
anything
you
don't
understand
said
Harry
again
oh
don't
I
said
Aberforth
quietly
you
don't
think
I
understood
my
own
brother
think
you
know
Albus
better
than
I
did
i
didn't
mean
that
said
Harry
whose
brain
felt
sluggish
with
exhaustion
and
from
the
surfeit
of
food
and
wine
it's
he
left
me
a
job
did
he
now
said
Aberforth
nice
job
I
hope
pleasant
easy
sort
of
thing
you'd
expect
an
unqualified
wizard
kid
to
be
able
to
do
without
overstretching
themselves
ron
gave
a
rather
grim
laugh
hermione
was
looking
strained
i-it's
not
easy
no
said
Harry
but
i've
got
to
got
to
why
got
to
he's
dead
isn't
he
said
Aberforth
roughly
let
it
go
boy
before
you
follow
him
save
yourself
i
can't
why
not
i
Harry
felt
overwhelmed
he
could
not
explain
so
he
took
the
offensive
instead
but
you're
fighting
too
you're
in
the
Order
of
the
Phoenix
i
was
said
Aberforth
the
Order
of
the
Phoenix
is
finished
you-know-who's
won
it's
over
and
anyone
who's
pretending
different's
kidding
themselves
it'll
never
be
safe
for
you
here
Potter
he
wants
you
too
badly
so
go
abroad
go
into
hiding
save
yourself
best
take
these
two
with
you
he
jerked
a
thumb
at
Ron
and
Hermione
they'll
be
in
danger
long
as
they
live
now
everyone
knows
they've
been
working
with
you
i
can't
leave
said
Harry
i've
got
a
job
give
it
to
someone
else
i
can't
it's
got
to
be
me
Dumbledore
explained
it
all
oh
did
he
now
and
did
he
tell
you
everything
was
he
honest
with
you
harry
wanted
him
with
all
his
heart
to
say
Yes
but
somehow
the
simple
word
would
not
rise
to
his
lips
aberforth
seemed
to
know
what
he
was
thinking
i
knew
my
brother
Potter
he
learned
secrecy
at
our
mother's
knee
secrets
and
lies
that's
how
we
grew
up
and
Albus
he
was
a
natural
the
old
man's
eyes
traveled
to
the
painting
of
the
girl
over
the
mantelpiece
it
was
now
Harry
looked
around
properly
the
only
picture
in
the
room
there
was
no
photograph
of
Albus
Dumbledore
nor
of
anyone
else
mr.
Dumbledore
said
Hermione
rather
timidly
is
that
your
sister
ariana
yes
said
Aberforth
tersely
been
reading
Rita
Skeeter
have
you
missy
even
by
the
rosy
light
of
the
fire
it
was
clear
that
Hermione
had
turned
red
elphias
Doge
mentioned
her
to
us
said
Harry
trying
to
spare
Hermione
that
old
berk
muttered
Aberforth
taking
another
swig
of
mead
thought
the
sun
shone
out
of
my
brother's
every
office
he
did
well
so
did
plenty
of
people
you
three
included
by
the
looks
of
it
harry
kept
quiet
he
did
not
want
to
express
the
doubts
and
uncertainties
about
Dumbledore
that
had
riddled
him
for
months
now
he
had
made
his
choice
while
he
dug
dobby's
grave
he
had
decided
to
continue
along
the
winding
dangerous
path
indicated
for
him
by
Albus
Dumbledore
to
accept
that
he
had
not
been
told
everything
that
he
wanted
to
know
but
simply
to
trust
he
had
no
desire
to
doubt
again
he
did
not
want
o
hear
anything
that
would
deflect
him
from
his
purpose
he
met
aberforth's
gaze
which
was
so
strikingly
like
his
brothers
The
bright
blue
eyes
gave
the
same
impression
that
they
were
x-raying
the
object
of
their
scrutiny
and
Harry
thought
that
Aberforth
knew
what
he
was
thinking
and
despised
him
for
it
professor
Dumbledore
cared
about
Harry
very
much
said
Hermione
in
a
low
voice
did
he
now
said
Aberforth
funny
thing
how
many
of
the
people
my
brother
cared
about
very
much
ended
up
in
a
worse
state
than
if
he'd
left
em
well
alone
what
do
you
mean
asked
Hermione
breathlessly
never
you
mind
said
Aberforth
but
that's
a
really
serious
thing
to
say
said
Hermione
are
you
are
you
talking
about
your
sister
aberforth
glared
at
her
His
lips
moved
as
if
he
were
chewing
the
words
he
was
holding
back
then
he
burst
into
speech
when
my
sister
was
six
years
old
she
was
attacked
by
three
Muggle
boys
they'd
seen
her
doing
magic
spying
through
the
back
garden
hedge
She
was
a
kid
she
couldn't
control
it
no
witch
or
wizard
can
at
that
age
what
they
saw
scared
them
I
expect
they
forced
their
way
through
the
hedge
and
when
she
couldn't
show
them
the
trick
they
got
a
bit
carried
away
trying
to
stop
the
little
freak
doing
it
hermione's
eyes
were
huge
in
the
firelight
Ron
looked
slightly
sick
aberforth
stood
up
tall
as
Albus
and
suddenly
terrible
in
his
anger
and
the
intensity
of
his
pain
it
destroyed
her
what
they
did
She
was
never
right
again
she
wouldn't
use
magic
but
she
couldn't
get
rid
of
it
it
turned
inward
and
drove
her
mad
it
exploded
out
of
her
when
she
couldn't
control
it
and
at
times
she
was
strange
and
dangerous
but
mostly
she
was
sweet
and
scared
and
harmless
and
my
father
went
after
the
bastards
that
did
it
said
Aberforth
and
attacked
them
and
they
locked
him
up
in
Azkaban
for
it
he
never
said
why
he'd
done
it
because
the
Ministry
had
known
what
Ariana
had
become
she'd
have
been
locked
up
in
st.
mungo's
for
good
they'd
have
seen
her
as
a
serious
threat
to
the
International
statute
of
Secrecy
unbalanced
like
she
was
with
magic
exploding
out
of
her
at
moments
when
she
couldn't
keep
it
in
any
longer
we
had
to
keep
her
safe
and
quiet
we
moved
house
put
it
about
she
was
ill
and
my
mother
looked
after
her
and
tried
to
keep
her
calm
and
happy
i
was
her
favourite
he
said
and
as
he
said
it
a
grubby
schoolboy
seemed
to
look
out
through
aberforth's
wrinkles
and
wrangled
beard
not
Albus
he
was
always
up
in
his
bedroom
when
he
was
home
reading
his
books
and
counting
his
prizes
keeping
up
with
his
correspondence
with
the
most
notable
magical
names
of
the
day
aberforth
succored
he
didn't
want
to
be
bothered
with
her
she
liked
me
best
i
could
get
her
to
eat
when
she
wouldn't
do
it
for
my
mother
I
could
calm
her
down
when
she
was
in
one
of
her
rages
and
when
she
was
quiet
she
used
to
help
me
feed
the
goats
then
when
she
was
fourteen
see
I
wasn't
there
said
Aberforth
if
i'd
been
there
I
could
have
calmed
her
down
she
had
one
of
her
rages
and
my
mother
wasn't
as
young
as
she
was
and
it
was
an
accident
ariana
couldn't
control
it
but
my
mother
was
killed
harry
felt
a
horrible
mixture
of
pity
and
repulsion
he
did
not
want
to
hear
any
more
but
Aberforth
kept
talking
and
Harry
wondered
how
long
it
had
been
since
he
had
spoken
about
this
whether
in
fact
he
had
ever
spoken
about
it
so
that
put
paid
to
albus's
trip
round
the
world
with
little
Doge
the
pair
of
em
came
home
for
my
mother's
funeral
and
then
Doge
went
off
on
his
own
and
Albus
settled
down
as
head
of
the
family
ha
aberforth
spat
into
the
fire
i'd
have
looked
after
her
I
told
him
so
I
didn't
care
about
school
i'd
have
stayed
home
and
done
it
he
told
me
I
had
to
finish
my
education
and
he'd
take
over
from
my
mother
bit
of
a
comedown
for
mr.
Brilliant
there's
no
prizes
for
looking
after
your
half-mad
sister
stopping
her
blowing
up
the
house
every
other
day
but
he
did
all
right
for
a
few
weeks
till
he
came
and
now
a
positively
dangerous
look
crept
over
Aberforths
face
grindelwald
and
at
last
my
brother
had
an
equal
to
talk
to
someone
just
as
bright
and
talented
he
was
and
looking
after
Ariana
took
a
backseat
then
while
they
were
hatching
all
their
plans
for
a
new
Wizarding
order
and
looking
for
Hallows
and
whatever
else
it
was
they
were
so
interested
in
grand
plans
for
the
benefit
of
all
Wizardkind
and
if
one
young
girl
neglected
what
did
that
matter
when
Albus
was
working
for
the
greater
good
but
after
a
few
weeks
of
it
i'd
had
enough
I
had
it
was
nearly
time
for
me
to
go
hack
to
Hogwarts
so
I
told
em
both
of
em
face-to-face
like
I
am
to
you
now
and
Aberforth
looked
downward
Harry
and
it
took
a
little
imagination
to
see
him
as
a
teenager
wiry
and
angry
confronting
his
elder
brother
i
told
him
you'd
better
give
it
up
now
you
can't
move
her
she's
in
no
fit
state
you
can't
take
her
with
you
wherever
it
is
you're
planning
to
go
when
you're
making
your
clever
speeches
trying
to
whip
yourselves
up
a
following
he
didn't
like
that
said
Aberforth
and
his
eyes
were
briefly
occluded
by
the
fireflight
on
the
lenses
of
his
glasses
They
turned
white
and
blind
again
grindelwald
didn't
like
that
at
all
he
got
angry
he
told
me
what
a
stupid
little
boy
I
was
trying
to
stand
in
the
way
of
him
and
my
brilliant
brother
didn't
I
understand
my
poor
sister
wouldn't
have
to
be
hidden
once
they'd
changed
the
world
and
led
the
wizards
out
of
hiding
and
taught
the
Muggles
their
place
and
there
was
an
argument
and
I
pulled
my
wand
and
he
pulled
out
his
and
I
had
the
Cruciatus
Curse
used
on
me
by
my
brother's
best
friend
and
Albus
was
trying
to
stop
him
and
then
all
three
of
us
were
dueling
and
the
flashing
lights
and
the
bangs
set
her
off
she
couldn't
stand
it
the
color
was
draining
from
aberforth's
face
as
though
he
had
suffered
a
mortal
wound
and
I
think
she
wanted
to
help
but
she
didn't
really
know
what
she
was
doing
and
I
don't
know
which
of
us
did
it
it
could
have
been
any
of
us
and
she
was
dead
his
voice
broke
on
the
last
word
and
he
dropped
down
into
the
nearest
chair
hermione's
face
was
wet
with
tears
and
Ron
was
almost
as
pale
as
Aberforth
harry
felt
nothing
but
revulsion
He
wished
he
had
not
heard
it
wished
he
could
wash
is
mind
clean
of
it
i'm
so
i'm
so
sorry
Hermione
whispered
gone
croaked
Aberforth
gone
forever
he
wiped
his
nose
on
hiss
cuff
and
cleared
his
throat
course
Grindelwald
scarpered
he
had
a
bit
of
a
track
record
already
back
in
his
own
country
and
he
didn't
want
Ariana
set
to
his
account
too
and
Albus
was
free
wasn't
he
free
of
the
burden
of
his
sister
free
to
become
the
greatest
wizard
of
the
he
was
never
free
said
Harry
i
beg
your
pardon
said
Aberforth
never
said
Harry
the
night
that
your
brother
died
he
drank
a
potion
that
drove
him
out
of
his
mind
he
started
screaming
pleading
with
someone
who
wasn't
there
don't
hurt
them
please
hurt
me
instead
ron
and
Hermione
were
staring
at
Harry
he
had
never
gone
into
details
about
what
had
happened
on
the
island
on
the
lake
the
events
that
had
taken
place
after
he
and
Dumbledore
had
returned
to
Hogwarts
had
eclipsed
it
so
thoroughly
he
thought
he
was
back
there
with
you
and
Grindelwald
I
know
he
did
said
Harry
remembering
Dumbledore
whispering
pleading
he
thought
he
was
watching
Grindelwald
hurting
you
and
Ariana
it
was
torture
to
him
if
you'd
seen
him
then
you
wouldn't
say
he
was
free
aberforth
seemed
lost
in
contemplation
of
his
own
knotted
and
veined
hands
after
a
long
pause
he
said
how
can
you
be
sure
Potter
that
my
brother
wasn't
more
interested
in
the
greater
good
than
in
you
how
can
you
be
sure
you
aren't
dispensable
just
like
my
little
sister
a
shard
of
ice
seemed
to
pierce
harry's
heart
i
don't
believe
it
dumbledore
loved
Harry
said
Hermione
why
didn't
he
tell
him
to
hide
then
shot
back
Aberforth
why
didn't
he
say
to
him
Take
care
of
yourself
here's
how
to
survive
because
said
Harry
before
Hermione
could
answer
sometimes
you've
got
to
think
about
more
than
your
own
safety
sometimes
you've
got
to
think
about
the
greater
good
this
is
war
you're
seventeen
boy
i'm
of
age
and
i'm
going
to
keep
fighting
even
if
you've
given
up
who
says
i've
given
up
the
Order
of
the
Phoenix
is
finished
Harry
repeated
you-know-who's
won
it's
over
and
anyone
who's
pretending
different's
kidding
themselves
i
don't
say
I
like
it
but
it's
the
truth
no
it
isn't
said
Harry
your
brother
knew
how
to
finish
You-Know-Who
and
he
passed
the
knowledge
on
to
me
i'm
going
to
keep
going
until
I
succeed
or
I
die
don't
think
I
don't
know
how
this
might
end
i've
known
it
for
years
he
waited
for
Aberforth
to
jeer
or
to
argue
but
he
did
not
he
merely
moved
we
need
to
get
into
Hogwarts
said
Harry
again
if
you
can't
help
us
we'll
wait
till
daybreak
leave
you
in
peace
and
try
to
find
a
way
in
ourselves
if
you
can
help
us
well
now
would
be
a
great
time
to
mention
it
aberforth
remained
fixed
in
his
chair
gazing
at
Harry
with
the
eye
that
were
so
extraordinarily
like
his
brother's
at
last
he
cleared
his
throat
got
to
his
feet
walked
around
the
little
table
and
approached
the
portrait
of
Ariana
you
know
what
to
do
he
said
she
smiled
turned
and
walked
away
not
as
people
in
portraits
usually
did
one
of
the
sides
of
their
frames
but
along
what
seemed
to
be
a
long
tunnel
painted
behind
her
they
watched
her
slight
figure
retreating
until
finally
she
was
swallowed
by
the
darkness
er
what
began
Ron
there's
only
one
way
in
now
said
Aberforth
you
must
know
they've
got
all
the
old
secret
passageways
covered
at
both
ends
dementors
all
around
the
boundary
walls
regular
patrols
inside
the
school
from
what
my
sources
tell
me
the
place
has
never
been
so
heavily
guarded
how
you
expect
to
do
anything
once
you
get
inside
it
with
Snape
in
charge
and
the
Carrows
as
his
deputies
well
that's
your
lookout
isn't
it
you
say
you're
prepared
to
die
but
what
said
Hermione
frowning
at
ariana's
picture
a
tiny
white
dot
reappeared
at
the
end
of
the
painted
tunnel
and
now
Ariana
was
walking
back
toward
them
growing
bigger
and
bigger
as
she
came
but
there
was
somebody
else
with
her
now
someone
taller
than
she
was
who
was
limping
along
looking
excited
his
hair
was
longer
than
Harry
had
ever
seen
he
appeared
and
torn
larger
and
larger
the
two
figures
grew
until
only
their
heads
and
shoulders
filled
the
portrait
then
the
whole
thing
swang
forward
on
the
wall
like
a
little
door
and
the
entrance
to
a
real
tunnel
was
revealed
and
our
of
it
his
hair
overgrown
his
face
cut
his
robes
ripped
clambered
the
real
Neville
Longbottom
who
gave
a
roar
of
delight
leapt
down
from
the
mantelpiece
and
yelled
i
knew
you'd
come
i
knew
it
Harry
chapter
Twenty-Nine
the
Lost
Diadem
neville
what
the
how
but
Neville
had
spotted
Ron
and
Hermione
and
with
yells
of
delight
was
hugging
them
too
the
longer
Harry
looked
at
Neville
the
worse
he
appeared
One
of
his
eyes
was
swollen
yellow
and
purple
there
were
gouge
marks
on
his
face
and
his
general
air
of
unkemptness
suggested
that
he
had
been
living
enough
nevertheless
his
battered
visage
shone
with
happiness
as
he
let
go
of
Hermione
and
said
again
I
knew
youd
come
kept
telling
Seamus
it
was
a
matter
of
time
neville
whats
happened
to
you
what
this
neville
dismissed
his
injuries
with
a
shake
of
the
head
this
is
nothing
Seamus
is
worse
youll
see
shall
we
get
going
then
oh
he
turned
to
Aberforth
Ab
there
might
be
a
couple
more
people
no
the
way
couple
more
repeated
Aberforth
ominously
what
dyou
mean
a
couple
more
Longbottom
theres
a
curfew
and
a
Camwaulding
Charm
on
the
whole
village
i
know
thats
why
theyll
be
Apparating
directly
into
the
bar
said
Neville
just
send
them
down
the
passage
when
they
get
here
will
you
thanks
a
lot
neville
held
out
his
hand
to
Hermione
and
helped
her
to
climb
up
onto
the
mantelpiece
and
into
the
tunnel
Ron
followed
then
Neville
harry
addressed
Aberforth
i
dont
know
how
to
thank
you
youve
saved
our
lives
twice
look
after
em
then
said
Aberforth
gruffly
i
might
not
be
able
to
save
em
a
third
time
harry
chambered
up
onto
the
mantelpiece
and
through
the
hole
behind
Arianas
portrait
there
were
smooth
stone
steps
on
the
other
side
It
looked
as
though
the
passageway
had
been
there
for
years
brass
lamps
hung
from
the
walls
and
the
earthy
floor
was
worn
and
smooth
as
they
walked
their
shadows
rippled
fanlike
across
the
wall
how
longs
this
been
here
ron
asked
as
they
set
off
it
isnt
on
the
Marauders
Map
is
it
Harry
i
thought
there
were
only
seven
passages
in
and
out
of
school
they
sealed
off
all
of
those
before
the
start
of
the
year
said
Neville
theres
no
chance
of
getting
through
any
of
them
now
not
with
the
curses
over
the
entrances
and
Death
Eaters
and
dementors
waiting
at
the
exits
he
started
walking
backward
beaming
drinking
them
in
never
mind
that
stuff
is
it
true
did
you
break
into
Gringotts
did
you
escape
on
a
dragon
its
everywhere
everyones
talking
about
it
Terry
Boot
got
beaten
up
by
Carrow
for
yelling
about
it
in
the
Great
Hall
at
dinner
yeah
its
true
said
Harry
neville
laughed
gleefully
what
did
you
do
with
the
dragon
released
it
into
the
wild
said
Ron
hermione
was
all
for
keeping
it
as
a
pet
dont
exaggerate
Ron
but
what
have
you
been
doing
people
have
been
saying
youve
just
been
on
the
run
Harry
but
I
dont
think
so
i
think
youve
been
up
to
something
youre
right
said
Harry
but
tell
us
about
Hogwarts
Neville
we
havent
heard
anything
its
been
well
its
not
really
like
Hogwarts
anymore
said
Neville
the
smile
fading
from
his
face
as
he
spoke
do
you
know
about
the
Carrows
those
two
Death
Eaters
who
teach
here
they
do
more
than
teach
said
Neville
theyre
in
charge
of
all
discipline
they
like
punishment
the
Carrows
like
Umbridge
nah
they
make
her
look
tame
the
other
teachers
are
all
supposed
to
refer
us
to
the
Carrows
if
we
do
anything
wrong
they
dont
though
if
they
can
avoid
it
you
can
tell
they
all
hate
them
as
much
as
we
do
amycus
the
bloke
he
teaches
what
used
to
be
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
except
now
its
just
the
Dark
Arts
were
supposed
to
practice
the
Cruciatus
Curse
on
people
whove
earned
detentions
what
harry
Ron
and
Hermiones
united
voices
echoed
up
and
down
the
passage
yeah
said
Neville
thats
how
I
got
this
one
he
pointed
at
a
particularly
deep
gash
in
his
cheek
I
refused
to
do
it
some
people
are
into
it
though
Crabbe
and
Goyle
love
it
first
time
theyve
ever
been
top
in
anything
I
expect
alecto
Amycuss
sister
teaches
Muggle
Studies
which
is
compulsory
for
everyone
weve
all
got
to
listen
to
her
explain
how
Muggles
are
like
animals
stupid
and
dirty
and
how
they
drive
wizards
into
hiding
by
being
vicious
toward
them
and
how
the
natural
order
is
being
reestablished
i
got
this
one
he
indicated
another
slash
to
his
face
for
asking
her
how
much
Muggle
blood
she
and
her
brother
have
got
blimey
Neville
said
Ron
theres
a
time
and
a
place
for
getting
a
smart
mouth
you
didnt
see
her
said
Neville
you
wouldnt
have
stood
it
either
the
thing
is
it
helps
when
people
stand
up
to
them
it
gives
everyone
hope
i
used
to
notice
that
when
you
did
it
Harry
but
theyve
used
you
as
a
knife
sharpener
said
Ron
winding
slightly
as
they
passed
a
lamp
and
Nevilles
injuries
were
thrown
into
even
greater
relief
neville
shrugged
doesnt
matter
they
dont
want
to
spill
too
much
pure
blood
so
theyll
torture
us
a
bit
if
were
mouthy
but
they
wont
actually
kill
us
harry
did
not
know
what
was
worse
the
things
that
Neville
was
saying
or
the
matter-of-fact
tone
in
which
he
said
them
the
only
people
in
real
danger
are
the
ones
whose
friends
and
relatives
on
the
outside
are
giving
trouble
they
get
taken
hostage
old
Xeno
Lovegood
was
getting
a
bit
too
outspoken
in
The
Quibbler
so
they
dragged
Luna
off
the
train
on
the
way
back
for
Christmas
neville
shes
all
right
weve
seen
her
yeah
I
know
she
managed
to
get
a
message
to
me
from
his
pocket
he
pulled
a
golden
coin
and
Harry
recognized
it
as
one
of
the
fake
Galleons
that
Dumbledores
Army
had
used
to
send
one
another
messages
these
have
been
great
said
Neville
beaming
at
Hermione
the
Carrows
never
rumbled
how
we
were
communicating
it
drove
them
mad
we
used
to
sneak
out
at
night
and
put
graffiti
on
the
walls
Dumbledores
Army
Still
Recruiting
stuff
like
that
snape
hated
it
you
used
to
said
Harry
who
had
noticed
the
past
tense
well
it
got
more
difficult
as
time
went
one
said
Neville
we
lost
Luna
at
Christmas
and
Ginny
never
came
back
after
Easter
and
the
three
of
us
were
sort
of
the
leaders
the
Carrows
seemed
to
know
I
was
behind
a
lot
of
it
so
they
started
coming
down
on
me
hard
and
then
Michael
Corner
went
and
got
caught
releasing
a
first-year
theyd
chained
up
and
they
tortured
him
pretty
badly
that
scared
people
off
no
kidding
muttered
Ron
as
the
passage
began
to
slope
upward
yeah
well
I
couldnt
ask
people
to
go
through
what
Michael
did
so
we
dropped
those
kinds
of
stunts
but
we
were
still
fighting
doing
underground
stuff
right
up
until
a
couple
of
weeks
ago
thats
when
they
decided
there
was
only
one
way
to
stop
me
I
suppose
and
they
went
for
Gran
they
what
said
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
together
yeah
said
Neville
panting
a
little
now
because
the
passage
was
climbing
so
steeply
well
you
can
see
their
thinking
it
had
worked
really
well
kidnapping
kids
to
force
their
relatives
to
behave
i
spose
it
was
only
a
matter
of
time
before
they
did
it
the
other
way
around
thing
was
he
faced
them
and
Harry
was
astonished
to
see
that
he
was
grinning
they
bit
off
a
bit
more
than
they
could
chew
with
Gran
little
old
witch
living
alone
they
probably
thought
hey
didnt
need
to
send
anyone
particularly
powerful
anyway
Neville
laughed
Dawlish
is
still
in
st.
Mungos
and
Grans
on
the
run
she
sent
me
a
letter
he
clapped
a
hand
to
the
breast
pocket
of
his
robes
telling
me
she
was
proud
of
me
that
Im
my
parents
son
and
to
keep
it
up
cool
said
Ron
yea
said
Neville
happily
only
thing
was
once
they
realized
they
had
no
hold
over
me
they
decided
Hogwarts
could
do
without
me
after
all
i
dont
know
whether
they
were
planning
to
kill
me
or
send
me
to
Azkaban
either
way
I
knew
it
was
time
to
disappear
but
said
Ron
looking
thoroughly
confused
arent
arent
we
heading
straight
back
for
Hogwarts
Course
said
Neville
youll
see
were
here
they
turned
a
corner
and
there
ahead
of
them
was
the
end
of
the
passage
another
short
flight
of
steps
led
to
a
door
just
like
the
one
hidden
behind
Arianas
portrait
neville
pushed
it
open
and
climbed
through
as
Harry
followed
he
heard
Neville
call
out
for
unseen
people
look
who
it
is
didnt
I
tell
you
as
Harry
emerged
into
the
room
behind
the
passage
there
were
several
screams
and
yells
harry
its
Potter
its
potter
ron
hermione
he
had
a
confused
impression
of
colored
hangings
of
lamps
and
many
faces
the
next
moment
he
Ron
and
Hermione
were
engulfed
hugged
pounded
on
the
back
their
hair
ruffled
their
hands
shaken
by
what
seemed
to
be
more
than
twenty
people
they
might
have
just
won
a
Quidditch
final
okay
okay
calm
down
neville
called
and
as
the
crowd
backed
away
Harry
was
able
to
take
in
their
surroundings
he
did
not
recognize
the
dorm
at
all
it
was
enormous
and
looked
rather
like
the
interior
of
a
particularly
sumptuous
tree
house
or
perhaps
a
gigantic
ships
cabin
multicolored
hammocks
were
strung
from
the
ceiling
and
from
the
balcony
that
ran
around
the
dark
wood-paneled
and
windowless
walls
which
were
covered
in
bright
tapestry
hangings
harry
saw
the
gold
Gryffindor
lion
emblazoned
on
scarlet
the
black
badger
of
Hufflepuff
set
against
yellow
and
the
bronze
eagle
of
Ravenclaw
on
blue
the
silver
and
green
of
Slytherin
alone
were
absent
there
were
bulging
bookcases
a
few
broomsticks
propped
against
the
walls
and
in
the
corner
a
large
wood-cased
wireless
where
are
we
room
of
Requirement
of
course
said
Neville
surpassed
itself
hasnt
it
the
Carrows
were
chasing
me
and
I
knew
I
had
just
one
chance
for
a
hideout
I
managed
to
get
through
the
door
and
this
is
what
I
found
well
it
wasnt
exactly
like
this
when
I
arrived
it
was
a
load
smaller
there
was
only
one
hammock
and
just
Gryffindor
hangings
but
its
expanded
as
more
and
more
of
the
D
a.
have
arrived
and
the
Carrows
cant
get
in
asked
Harry
looking
around
for
the
door
no
said
Seamus
Finnigan
whom
Harry
had
not
recognized
until
he
spoke
Seamuss
face
was
bruised
and
puffy
its
a
proper
hideout
as
long
as
one
of
us
stays
in
here
they
cant
get
at
us
the
door
wont
open
its
all
down
to
Neville
he
really
gets
this
room
youve
got
to
ask
for
exactly
what
you
need
like
I
dont
want
any
Carrow
supporters
to
be
able
to
get
in
and
itll
do
it
for
you
youve
just
got
to
make
sure
you
close
the
loopholes
nevilles
the
man
its
quite
straightforward
really
said
Neville
modestly
id
been
in
here
about
a
day
and
a
half
and
getting
really
hungry
and
wishing
I
could
get
something
to
eat
and
thats
when
the
passage
to
Hogs
Head
opened
up
i
went
through
it
and
met
Aberforth
hes
been
providing
us
with
food
because
for
some
reason
thats
the
one
thing
the
room
doesnt
really
do
yeah
well
foods
one
of
the
five
exceptions
to
Gamps
Law
of
Elemental
Transfiguration
said
Ron
to
general
astonishment
so
weve
been
hiding
out
here
for
nearly
two
weeks
said
Seamus
and
it
just
makes
more
hammocks
every
time
we
need
room
and
it
even
sprouted
a
pretty
good
bathroom
once
girls
started
turning
up
and
thought
theyd
quite
like
to
wash
yes
supplied
Lavender
Brown
whom
Harry
had
not
noticed
until
that
point
now
that
he
looked
around
properly
he
recognized
many
familiar
faces
both
Patil
twins
were
there
as
were
Terry
Boot
Ernie
Macmillan
Anthony
Goldstein
and
Michael
Corner
tell
us
what
youve
been
up
to
though
said
Ernie
thereve
been
so
many
rumors
weve
been
trying
to
keep
up
with
you
on
Potterwatch
he
pointed
at
the
wireless
you
didnt
break
into
Gringotts
they
did
said
Neville
and
the
dragons
true
too
there
was
a
smattering
of
applause
and
a
few
whoops
Ron
took
a
bow
what
were
you
after
asked
Seamus
eagerly
before
any
of
them
could
parry
the
question
with
one
of
their
own
Harry
felt
a
terrible
scorching
pain
in
the
lightning
scar
as
he
turned
his
back
hastily
on
the
curious
and
delighted
faces
the
Room
of
Requirement
vanished
and
he
was
standing
inside
a
ruined
stone
shack
and
the
rotting
floorboards
were
ripped
apart
at
his
feet
a
disinterred
golden
box
lay
open
and
empty
beside
the
hole
and
Voldemorts
scream
of
fury
vibrated
inside
his
head
with
an
enormous
effort
he
pulled
out
of
Voldemorts
mind
again
back
to
where
he
stood
swaying
in
the
Room
of
Requirement
sweat
pouring
from
his
face
and
Ron
holding
him
up
are
you
all
right
Harry
neville
was
saying
what
to
sit
down
i
expect
youre
tired
arent
no
said
Harry
he
looked
at
Ron
and
Hermione
trying
to
tell
them
without
words
that
Voldemort
had
just
discovered
the
loss
of
one
of
the
other
Horcruxes
time
was
running
out
fast
If
Voldemort
chose
to
visit
Hogwarts
next
they
would
miss
their
chance
we
need
to
get
going
he
said
and
their
expressions
told
him
that
they
understood
what
are
we
going
to
do
then
Harry
asked
Seamus
whats
the
plan
plan
repeated
Harry
he
was
exercising
all
his
willpower
to
prevent
himself
succumbing
again
to
Voldemorts
rage
His
scar
was
still
burning
well
theres
something
we
Ron
Hermione
and
I
need
to
do
and
then
well
get
out
of
here
nobody
was
laughing
or
whooping
anymore
neville
looked
confused
what
dyou
mean
get
out
of
here
we
havent
come
back
to
stay
said
Harry
rubbing
his
scar
trying
to
soothe
the
pain
theres
something
important
we
need
to
do
what
is
it
i
I
cant
tell
you
there
was
a
ripple
of
muttering
at
this
Nevilles
brows
contracted
why
cant
you
tell
us
its
something
to
do
with
fighting
You-Know-Who
right
well
yeah
then
well
help
you
the
other
members
of
Dumbledores
Army
were
nodding
some
enthusiastically
others
solemnly
a
couple
of
them
rose
from
their
chairs
to
demonstrate
their
willingness
for
immediate
action
you
dont
understand
Harry
seemed
to
have
said
that
a
lot
in
the
last
few
hours
we
we
cant
tell
you
weve
got
to
do
it
alone
why
asked
Neville
because
in
his
desperation
to
start
looking
for
the
missing
Horcrux
or
at
least
have
a
private
discussion
with
Ron
and
Hermione
about
where
they
might
commence
their
search
harry
found
it
difficult
to
gather
his
thoughts
his
scar
was
still
searing
dumbledore
left
the
three
of
us
a
job
he
said
carefully
and
we
werent
supposed
to
tell
I
mean
he
wanted
us
to
do
it
just
the
three
of
us
were
his
army
said
Neville
dumbledores
Army
we
were
all
in
it
together

been
keeping
it
going
while

been
off

your
own
it
hasnt
exactly

a
picnic

said
Ron
i

I
dont
see
why
you
cant
trust
us
everyone
in
this
rooms

fighting
and
theyve
been
driven
in
here
because
the
Carrows
were
hunting
them
down
everyone
in
heres
proven
theyre
loyal
to
Dumbledore
loyal
to
you
look
Harry
began
without
knowing
what
he
was
going
to
say
but
it
did
not
matter
the
tunnel
door
had
just
opened
behind
him
we
got
your
message
Neville
hello
you
three
I
thought
you
must
be
here
it
was
Luna
and
Dean
seamus
gave
a
great
roar
of
delight
and
ran
to
hug
his
best
friend
hi
everyone
said
Luna
happily
oh

great
to
be
back
luna
said
Harry
distractedly
what
are
you
doing
here
how
did
you
i
sent
for
her
said
Neville
holding
up
the
fake
Galleon
i
promised
her
and
Ginny
that
if
you
turned
up
Id
let
them
know
we
all
thought
that
if
you
came
back
it
would
mean
revolution
that
we
were
going
to
overthrow
Snape
and
the
Carrows
of
course
thats
what
it
means
said
Luna
brightly
isnt
it
Harry
were
going
to
fight
them
out
of
Hogwarts
listen
said
Harry
with
a
rising
sense
of
panic
Im
sorry
but
thats
not
what
we
came
back
for
theres
something
weve
got
to
do
and
then
youre
going
to
leave
us

this
mess
demanded
Michael
Cornet
no
said
Ron
what
were
doing
will
benefit
everyone
in
the
end
its
all
about
trying
to
get
rid
of
You-Know-Who
then
let
us
help
said
Neville
angrily
we
want
to
be
a
part
of
it
there
was
another
noise
behind
them
and
Harry
turned
his
heart
seemed
to
fall
Ginny
was
now
climbing
through
the
hole
in
the
wall
closely
followed
by
Fred
George
and
Lee
Jordan
ginny
gave
Harry
a
radiant
smile
He
had
forgotten
he
had
never
fully
appreciated
how
beautiful
she
was
but
he
had
never
been
less
pleased
to
see
her
aberforths
getting
a
bit
annoyed
said
Fred
raising
his
hand
in
answer
to
several
cries
of
greeting
he
wants
a
kip
and
his
bars
turned
into
a
railway
station
harrys
mouth
fell
open
right
behind
Lee
Jordan
came
Harrys
old
girlfriend
Cho
Chang
she
smiled
at
him
i
got
the
message
she
said
holding
up
her
own
fake
Galleon
and
she
walked
over
to
sit
beside
Michael
Corner
so
whats
the
plan
Harry
said
George
there
isnt
one
said
Harry
still
disoriented
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
all
these
people
unable
to
take
everything
in
while
his
scar
was
still
burning
so
fiercely
just
going
to
make
it
up
as
we
go
along
are
we
my
favorite
kind
said
Fred
youve
got
to
stop
this
harry
told
Neville
what
did
you
call
them
all
back
for
this
is
insane
were
fighting
arent
we
said
Dean
taking
out
his
fake
Galleon
the
message
said
Harry
was
back
and
we
were
going
to
fight
ill
have
to
get
a
wand
though
you
havent
got
a
wand
began
Seamus
ron
turned
suddenly
to
Harry
why
cant
they
help
what
they
can
help
he
dropped
his
voice
and
said
so
that
none
of
them
could
hear
but
Hermione
who
stood
between
them
We
dont
know
where
it
is
weve
got
to
find
it
fast
we
dont
have
to
tell
them
its
a
Horcrux
harry
looked
from
Ron
to
Hermione
who
murmured
I
think
Rons
right
we
dont
even
know
what
were
looking
for
we
need
them
and
when
Harry
looked
unconvinced
You
dont
have
to
do
everything
alone
Harry
harry
thought
fast
his
scar
still
prickling
his
head
threatening
to
split
again
dumbledore
had
warned
him
against
telling
anyone
but
Ron
and
Hermione
about
the
Horcruxes
secrets
and
lies
thats
how
we
grew
up
and
Albus
he
was
a
natural
was
he
turning
into
Dumbledore
keeping
his
secrets
clutched
to
his
chest
afraid
to
trust
but
Dumbledore
had
trusted
Snape
and
where
had
that
led
to
murder
at
the
top
of
the
highest
tower
all
right
he
said
quietly
to
the
other
two
okay
he
called
to
the
room
at
large
and
all
noise
ceased
Fred
and
George
who
had
been
cracking
jokes
for
the
benefit
of
those
nearest
fell
silent
and
all
of
the
looked
alert
excited
theres
something
we
need
to
find
Harry
said
something
something
thatll
help
us
overthrow
You-Know-Who
its
here
at
Hogwarts
but
we
dont
know
where
it
might
have
belonged
to
Ravenclaw
has
anyone
heard
of
an
object
like
that
has
anyone
come
across
something
with
her
eagle
on
it
for
instance
he
looked
hopefully
toward
the
little
group
of
Ravenclaws
to
Padma
Michael
Terry
and
Cho
but
it
was
Luna
who
answered
perched
on
the
arm
of
Ginnys
chair
well
theres
her
lost
diadem
i
told
you
about
it
remember
Harry
the
lost
diadem
of
Ravenclaw
daddys
trying
to
duplicate
it
yeah
but
the
lost
diadem
said
Michael
Corner
rolling
his
eyes
is
lost
Luna
thats
sort
of
the
point
when
was
it
lost
asked
Harry
centuries
ago
they
say
said
Cho
and
Harrys
heart
sank
professor
Flitwick
says
the
diadem
vanished
with
Ravenclaw
herself
people
have
looked
but
she
appealed
to
her
fellow
Ravenclaws
nobodys
ever
found
a
trace
of
it
have
them
they
all
shook
their
heads
sorry
but
what
is
a
diadem
asked
Ron
its
a
kind
of
crown
said
Terry
Boot
ravenclaws
was
supposed
to
have
magical
properties
enhance
the
wisdom
of
the
wearer
yes
Daddys
Wrackspurt
siphons
but
Harry
cut
across
Luna
and
none
of
you
have
ever
seen
anything
that
looks
like
it
they
all
shook
their
heads
again
harry
looked
at
Ron
and
Hermione
and
his
own
disappointment
was
mirrored
back
at
him
an
object
that
had
been
lost
this
long
and
apparently
without
trace
did
not
seem
like
a
good
candidate
for
the
Horcrux
hidden
in
the
castle
before
he
could
formulate
a
new
question
however
Cho
spoke
again
if
youd
like
to
see
what
the
diadems
supposed
to
look
like
I
could
take
you
up
to
our
common
room
and
show
you
Harry
ravenclaws
wearing
it
in
her
statue
harrys
scar
scorched
again
For
a
moment
the
Room
of
Requirement
swam
before
him
and
he
saw
instead
the
dark
earth
soaring
beneath
him
and
felt
the
great
snake
wrapped
around
his
shoulders
voldemort
was
flying
again
whether
to
the
underground
lake
or
here
to
the
castle
he
did
not
know
Either
way
there
was
hardly
any
time
left
hes
on
the
move
he
said
quietly
to
Ron
and
Hermione
he
glanced
at
Cho
and
then
back
at
them
listen
I
know
its
not
much
of
a
lead
but
Im
going
to
go
look
at
this
statue
at
least
find
out
what
the
diadem
looks
like
wait
for
me
here
and
keep
you
know
the
other
one
safe
cho
had
got
to
her
feet
but
Ginny
said
rather
fiercely
No
Luna
will
take
Harry
wont
you
Luna
oooh
yes
Id
like
to
said
Luna
happily
as
Cho
sat
down
again
looking
disappointed
how
do
we
get
out
harry
asked
Neville
over
here
he
led
Harry
and
Luna
to
a
corner
where
a
small
cupboard
opened
onto
a
steep
staircase
it
comes
out
somewhere
different
every
day
so
theyve
never
been
able
to
find
it
he
said
only
trouble
is
we
never
know
exactly
where
were
going
to
end
up
when
we
go
out
be
careful
Harry
theyre
always
patrolling
the
corridors
at
night
no
problem
said
Harry
see
you
in
a
bit
he
and
Luna
hurried
up
the
staircase
which
was
long
lit
by
torches
and
turned
corners
in
unexpected
places
at
last
they
reached
what
appeared
to
be
solid
wall
get
under
here
Harry
told
Luna
pulling
out
the
Invisibility
Cloak
and
throwing
it
over
both
of
them
he
gave
the
wall
a
little
push
it
melted
away
at
his
touch
and
they
slipped
outside
harry
glanced
back
and
saw
that
it
had
resealed
itself
at
once
they
were
standing
in
a
dark
corridor
harry
pulled
Luna
back
into
the
shadows
fumbled
in
the
pouch
around
his
neck
and
took
out
the
Marauders
Map
holding
it
close
to
his
nose
he
searched
and
located
his
and
Lunas
dots
at
last
were
up
on
the
fifth
floor
he
whispered
watching
filch
moving
away
from
them
a
corridor
ahead
come
on
this
way
they
crept
off
harry
had
prowled
the
castle
at
night
many
times
before
but
never
had
his
heart
hammered
that
fast
never
had
so
much
depended
on
his
safe
passage
through
the
place
through
squares
of
moonlight
upon
the
floor
past
suits
of
armor
whose
helmets
creaked
at
the
sound
of
their
soft
footsteps
around
corners
beyond
which
who
knew
what
lurked
harry
and
Luna
walked
checking
the
Marauders
Map
whenever
light
permitted
twice
pausing
to
allow
a
ghost
to
pass
without
drawing
attention
to
themselves
he
expected
to
encounter
an
obstacle
at
any
moment
his
worst
fear
was
Peeves
and
he
strained
his
ears
with
every
step
to
hear
the
first
telltale
signs
of
the
poltergeists
approach
the
way
Harry
breathed
Luna
plucking
his
sleeve
and
pulling
him
toward
a
spiral
staircase
they
climbed
in
tight
dizzying
circles
Harry
had
never
been
up
here
before
at
last
they
reached
a
door
there
was
no
handle
and
no
keyhole
nothing
but
a
plain
expanse
of
aged
wood
and
a
bronze
knocker
in
the
shape
an
eagle
luna
reached
out
a
pale
hand
which
looked
eerie
floating
in
midair
unconnected
to
arm
or
body
she
knocked
once
and
in
the
silence
it
sounded
to
Harry
like
a
cannon
blast
at
once
the
beak
of
the
eagle
opened
but
instead
of
a
birds
called
a
soft
musical
voice
said
Which
came
first
the
phoenix
or
the
flame
hmm
what
do
you
think
Harry
said
Luna
looking
thoughtful
what
isnt
there
a
password
oh
no
youve
got
to
answer
a
question
said
Luna
what
if
you
get
it
wrong
well
you
have
to
wait
for
somebody
who
gets
it
right
said
Luna
that
way
you
learn
you
see
yeah
trouble
is
we
cant
really
afford
to
wait
for
anyone
else
Luna
no
I
see
what
you
mean
said
Luna
seriously
well
then
I
think
the
answer
is
that
a
circle
has
no
beginning
well
reasoned
said
the
voice
and
the
door
swung
open
the
deserted
Ravenclaw
common
room
was
a
wide
circular
room
airier
than
any
Harry
had
ever
seen
at
Hogwarts
graceful
arched
windows
punctuated
the
walls
which
were
hung
with
blue-and-bronze
silks
by
day
the
Ravenclaws
would
have
a
spectacular
view
of
the
surrounding
mountains
the
ceiling
was
domed
and
painted
with
stars
which
were
echoed
in
the
midnight-blue
carpet
there
were
tables
chairs
and
bookcases
and
in
a
niche
opposite
the
door
stood
a
tall
statue
of
white
marble
harry
recognized
Rowena
Ravenclaw
from
the
bust
he
had
seen
at
Lunas
house
the
statue
stood
beside
a
door
that
led
he
guessed
to
dormitories
above
he
strode
right
up
to
the
marble
woman
and
she
seemed
to
look
back
at
him
with
a
quizzical
half
smile
on
her
face
beautiful
yet
slightly
intimidating
a
delicate-looking
circlet
had
been
reproduced
in
marble
on
top
of
her
head
it
was
not
unlike
the
tiara
Fleur
had
worn
at
her
wedding
there
were
tiny
words
etched
into
it
harry
stepped
out
from
under
the
Cloak
and
climbed
up
onto
Ravenclaws
plinth
to
read
them
Wit
beyond
measure
is
mans
greatest
treasure
which
makes
you
pretty
skint
witless
said
a
cackling
voice
harry
whirled
around
slipped
off
the
plinth
and
landed
on
the
floor
the
sloping-shouldered
figure
of
Alecto
Carrow
was
standing
before
him
and
even
as
Harry
raised
his
wand
she
pressed
a
stubby
forefinger
to
the
skull
and
snake
branded
on
her
forearm
chapter
Thirty
the
Sacking
of
Severus
Snape
the
moment
her
finger
touched
the
Mark
harry's
scar
burned
savagely
the
starry
room
vanished
from
sight
and
he
was
standing
upon
an
outcrop
of
rock
beneath
a
cliff
and
the
sea
was
washing
around
him
and
there
was
a
triumph
in
his
heart
They
have
the
boy
a
loud
bang
brought
Harry
back
to
where
he
stood
disoriented
he
raised
his
wand
but
the
witch
before
him
was
already
falling
forward
she
hit
the
ground
so
hard
that
the
glass
in
the
bookcases
tinkled
i've
never
Stunned
anyone
except
in
our
D
a.
lessons
said
Luna
sounding
mildly
interested
that
was
noisier
than
I
though
it
would
be
and
sure
enough
the
ceiling
had
begun
to
tremble
Scurrying
echoing
footsteps
were
growing
louder
from
behind
the
door
leading
to
the
dormitories
luna's
spell
had
woken
Ravenclaws
sleeping
above
luna
where
are
you
i
need
to
get
under
the
Cloak
luna's
feet
appeared
out
of
nowhere
he
hurried
to
her
side
and
she
let
the
Cloak
fall
back
over
them
as
the
door
opened
and
a
stream
of
Ravenclaws
all
in
their
nightclothes
flooded
into
the
common
room
there
were
gasps
and
cries
of
surprise
as
they
saw
Alecto
lying
there
unconscious
slowly
they
shuffled
in
around
her
a
savage
beast
that
might
wake
at
any
moment
and
attack
them
then
one
brave
little
first-year
darted
up
to
her
and
prodded
her
backside
with
his
big
toe
i
think
she
might
be
dead
he
shouted
with
delight
oh
look
whispered
Luna
happily
as
the
Ravenclaws
crowded
in
around
Alecto
they're
pleased
yeah
great
harry
closed
his
eyes
and
as
his
scar
throbbed
he
chose
to
sink
again
into
voldemort's
mind
he
was
moving
along
the
tunnel
into
the
first
cave
he
had
chosen
to
make
sure
of
the
locker
before
coming
but
that
would
not
take
him
long
there
was
a
rap
on
the
common
room
door
and
every
Ravenclaw
froze
from
the
other
side
Harry
heard
the
soft
musical
voice
that
issued
from
the
eagle
door
knocker
Where
do
Vanished
objects
go
i
dunno
do
I
shut
it
snarled
an
uncouth
voice
that
Harry
knew
was
that
of
the
Carrow
brother
Amycus
Alecto
alecto
are
you
there
have
you
got
him
open
the
door
the
Ravenclaws
were
whispering
amongst
themselves
terrified
then
without
warning
there
came
a
series
of
loud
bangs
as
though
somebody
was
firing
a
gun
into
the
door
alecto
if
he
comes
and
we
haven't
got
Potter
d'you
want
to
go
the
same
way
as
the
Malfoys
answer
me
amycus
bellowed
shaking
the
door
for
all
he
was
worth
but
still
it
did
not
open
the
Ravenclaws
were
all
backing
away
and
some
of
the
most
frightened
began
scampering
back
up
the
stair
case
to
their
beds
then
just
as
Harry
was
wondering
whether
he
ought
not
to
blast
open
the
door
and
Stun
Amycus
before
the
Death
Eater
could
do
anything
else
a
second
most
familiar
voice
rang
out
beyond
the
door
may
I
ask
what
you
are
doing
Professor
Carrow
trying-to
get
through
this
damned
door
shouted
Amycus
go
and
get
Flitwick
get
him
to
open
it
now
but
isn't
your
sister
in
there
asked
Professor
McGonagall
didn't
Professor
Flitwick
let
her
in
earlier
this
evening
at
your
urgent
request
perhaps
she
could
open
the
door
for
you
then
you
needn't
wake
up
half
the
castle
she
ain't
answering
you
old
besom
you
open
it
garn
do
it
now
certainly
if
you
wish
it
said
Professor
McGonagall
with
awful
coldness
There
was
a
genteel
tap
of
the
knocker
and
the
musical
voice
asked
again
where
do
Vanished
objects
go
into
non
being
which
is
to
say
everything
replied
Professor
McGonagall
nicely
phrased
replied
the
eagle
door
knocker
and
the
door
swung
open
the
few
Ravenclaws
who
had
remained
behind
sprinted
for
the
stairs
as
Amycus
burst
over
the
threshold
brandishing
his
wand
hunched
like
his
sister
he
had
a
pallid
doughy
face
and
tiny
eyes
which
fell
at
once
on
Alecto
sprawled
motionless
on
the
floor
he
let
out
a
yell
of
fury
and
fear
what've
they
done
the
little
whelps
he
screamed
i'll
Cruciate
the
lot
of
em
till
they
tell
me
who
did
it-and
what's
the
Dark
Lord
going
to
say
he
shrieked
standing
over
his
sister
and
smacking
himself
on
the
forehead
with
his
fist
We
haven't
got
him
and
they've
gone
and
killed
her
she's
only
Stunned
said
Professor
McGonagall
impatiently
who
had
stooped
down
to
examine
Alecto
she'll
be
perfectly
all
right
no
she
bludgering
well
won't
bellowed
Amycus
not
after
the
Dark
Lord
gets
hold
of
her
she's
gone
and
sent
for
him
I
felt
me
Mark
burn
and
he
thinks
we've
got
Potter
got
Potter
said
Professor
McGonagall
sharply
What
do
you
mean
got
Potter
he
told
us
Potter
might
try
and
get
inside
Ravenclaw
Tower
and
to
send
for
him
if
we
caught
him
why
would
Harry
Potter
try
to
get
inside
Ravenclaw
Tower
potter
belongs
in
my
House
beneath
the
disbelief
and
anger
Harry
heard
a
little
strain
of
pride
in
her
voice
and
affection
for
Minerva
McGonagall
gushed
up
inside
him
we
was
told
he
might
come
in
here
said
Carrow
i
dunno
why
do
I
professor
McGonagall
stood
up
and
her
beady
eyes
swept
the
room
twice
they
passed
right
over
the
place
where
Harry
and
Luna
stood
we
can
push
it
off
on
the
kids
said
Amycus
his
pig
like
face
suddenly
crafty
yeah
that's
what
we'll
do
we'll
say
Alecto
was
ambushed
by
the
kids
them
kids
up
there
he
looked
up
at
the
starry
ceiling
toward
the
dormitories
and
we'll
say
they
forced
her
to
pres
her
Mark
and
that's
why
he
got
a
false
alarm
he
can
punish
them
couple
of
kids
more
or
less
what's
the
difference
only
the
difference
between
truth
and
lied
courage
and
cowardice
said
Professor
McGonagall
who
had
turned
pale
a
difference
in
short
which
you
and
your
sister
seem
unable
to
appreciate
but
let
me
make
one
thing
very
clear
you
are
not
going
to
pass
off
your
many
ineptitudes
on
the
students
of
Hogwarts
i
shall
not
permit
it
excuse
me
amycus
moved
forward
until
he
was
offensively
close
to
Professor
McGonagall
his
face
within
inches
of
hers
she
refused
to
back
away
but
looked
down
at
him
as
if
he
were
something
disgusting
she
had
found
stuck
to
the
lavatory
seat
it's
not
a
case
of
what
you'll
permit
Minerva
McGonagall
your
time's
over
it's
us
what's
in
charge
here
now
and
you'll
back
me
up
or
you'll
pay
the
price
and
he
spat
in
her
face
harry
pulled
the
Cloak
off
himself
raised
his
wand
and
said
You
shouldn't
have
done
that
as
Amycus
spun
around
Harry
shouted
Crucio
the
Death
Eater
was
lifted
off
his
feet
he
writhed
through
the
air
like
a
drowning
man
thrashing
and
howling
in
pain
and
then
with
a
crunch
and
a
shattering
of
glass
he
smashed
into
the
front
of
a
bookcase
and
crumpled
insensible
to
the
floor
i
see
what
Bellatrix
meant
said
Harry
the
blood
thundering
through
his
brain
you
need
to
really
mean
it
potter
whispered
Professor
McGonagall
clutching
her
heart
potter
you're
here
what
how
she
struggled
to
pull
herself
together
potter
that
was
foolish
he
spat
at
you
said
Harry
potter
I
that
was
very
gallant
of
you
but
don't
you
realize
yeah
I
do
Harry
assured
her
somehow
her
panic
steadied
him
professor
McGonagall
voldemort's
on
the
way
oh
are
we
allowed
to
say
the
name
now
asked
Luna
with
an
air
of
interest
pulling
off
the
Invisibility
Cloak
the
appearance
of
a
second
outlaw
seemed
to
overwhelm
Professor
McGonagall
who
staggered
backward
and
fell
into
a
nearby
chair
clutching
at
the
neck
of
her
old
tartan
dressing
gown
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
what
we
call
him
Harry
told
Luna
he
already
knows
where
I
am
in
a
distant
part
of
harry's
brain
that
part
connected
to
the
angry
burning
scar
he
could
see
Voldemort
sailing
fast
over
the
dark
lake
in
the
ghostly
green
boat
he
had
nearly
reached
the
island
where
the
stone
basin
stood
you
must
flee
whispered
Professor
McGonagall
Now
Potter
as
quickly
as
you
can
i
can't
said
Harry
there's
something
I
need
to
do
professor
so
you
know
where
the
diadem
of
Ravenclaw
is
the
d-diadem
of
Ravenclaw
of
course
not
hasn't
it
been
lost
for
centuries
she
sat
up
a
little
straighter
Potter
it
was
madness
utter
madness
for
you
to
enter
this
castle
i
had
to
said
Harry
professor
there's
something
hidden
here
that
i'm
supposed
to
find
and
it
could
be
the
diadem
if
I
could
just
speak
to
Professor
Flitwick
there
was
a
sound
of
movement
of
clinking
glass
amycus
was
coming
round
before
Harry
or
Luna
could
act
Professor
McGonagall
rose
to
her
feet
pointed
her
wand
at
the
groggy
Death
Eater
and
said
Imperio
amycus
got
up
walked
over
to
his
sister
picked
up
her
wand
then
shuffled
obediently
to
Professor
McGonagall
and
handed
it
over
along
with
his
own
then
he
lay
down
on
the
floor
beside
Alecto
professor
McGonagall
waved
her
wand
again
and
a
length
of
shimmering
silver
rope
appeared
out
of
thin
air
and
snaked
around
the
Carrows
binding
them
tightly
together
potter
said
Professor
McGonagall
turning
to
face
him
again
with
superb
indifference
to
the
Carrows
predicament
if
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
does
indeed
know
that
you
are
here
as
she
said
it
a
wrath
that
was
like
physical
pain
blazed
through
Harry
setting
his
scar
on
fire
and
for
a
second
he
looked
down
upon
a
basin
whose
potion
had
turned
clear
and
saw
that
no
golden
locket
lay
safe
beneath
the
surface
potter
are
you
all
right
said
a
voice
and
Harry
came
back
he
was
clutching
luna's
shoulder
to
steady
himself
time's
running
out
voldemort's
getting
nearer
Professor
i'm
acting
on
dumbledore's
orders
I
must
find
what
he
wanted
me
to
find
but
we've
got
to
get
the
students
out
while
i'm
searching
the
castle
it's
me
Voldemort
wants
but
he
won't
care
about
killing
a
few
more
or
less
not
now
not
now
he
knows
i'm
attacking
Horcruxes
Harry
finished
the
sentence
in
his
head
you're
acting
on
dumbledore's
orders
she
repeated
with
a
look
of
dawning
wonder
then
she
drew
herself
up
to
her
fullest
height
we
shall
secure
the
school
against
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
while
you
search
for
this
this
object
is
that
possible
i
think
so
said
Professor
McGonagall
dryly
we
teachers
are
rather
good
at
magic
you
know
i
am
sure
we
will
be
able
to
hold
him
off
for
a
while
if
we
all
put
our
best
efforts
into
it
of
course
something
will
have
to
be
done
about
Professor
Snape
let
me
and
if
Hogwarts
is
about
to
enter
a
state
of
siege
with
the
Dark
Lord
at
the
gates
it
would
indeed
be
advisable
to
take
as
many
innocent
people
out
of
the
way
as
possible
with
the
Floo
Network
under
observation
and
Apparition
impossible
within
the
grounds
there's
a
way
said
Harry
quickly
and
he
explained
about
the
passageway
leading
into
the
hog's
Head
potter
we're
talking
about
hundreds
of
students
i
know
Professor
but
if
Voldemort
and
the
Death
Eaters
are
concentrating
on
the
school
boundaries
they
won't
be
interested
in
anyone
who's
Disapparating
out
of
hog's
Head
there's
something
in
that
she
agreed
she
pointed
her
wand
at
the
Carrows
and
a
silver
net
fell
upon
their
bound
bodies
tied
itself
around
them
and
hoisted
them
into
the
air
where
they
dangled
beneath
the
blue-and-gold
ceiling
like
two
large
ugly
sea
creatures
come
we
must
alert
the
other
Heads
of
House
you'd
better
put
that
Cloak
back
on
she
marched
toward
the
door
and
as
she
did
so
she
raised
her
wand
from
the
tip
burst
three
silver
cats
with
spectacle
markings
around
their
eyes
the
Patronuses
ran
sleekly
ahead
filling
the
spiral
staircase
with
silvery
light
as
Professor
McGonagall
Harry
and
Luna
hurried
back
down
along
the
corridors
they
raced
and
one
by
one
the
Patronuses
left
them
professor
mcgonagall's
tartan
dressing
gown
rustled
over
the
floor
and
Harry
and
Luna
jogged
behind
her
under
the
Cloak
they
had
descended
two
more
floors
when
another
set
of
quiet
joined
theirs
harry
whose
scar
was
still
prickling
heard
them
first
he
felt
in
the
pouch
around
his
neck
for
the
marauder's
Map
but
before
he
could
take
it
our
McGonagall
too
seemed
to
become
aware
of
their
company
she
halted
raised
her
wand
ready
to
duel
and
said
who's
there
it
is
I
said
a
low
voice
from
behind
a
suit
of
armor
stepped
Severus
Snape
hatred
boiled
up
in
Harry
at
the
sight
of
him
he
had
forgotten
the
details
of
snape's
appearance
in
the
magnitude
of
his
crimes
forgotten
how
his
greasy
black
hair
hung
in
curtains
around
his
thin
face
how
his
black
eyes
had
a
dead
cold
look
he
was
not
wearing
nightclothes
but
was
dressed
in
his
usual
black
cloak
and
he
too
was
holding
his
wand
ready
for
a
fight
where
are
the
Carrows
he
asked
quietly
wherever
you
told
them
to
be
I
expect
Severus
said
Professor
McGonagall
snape
stepped
nearer
and
his
eyes
flitted
over
Professor
McGonagall
into
the
air
around
her
as
if
he
knew
that
Harry
was
there
harry
held
his
wand
up
too
ready
to
attack
i
was
under
the
impression
said
Snape
That
Alecto
had
apprehended
an
intruder
really
said
Professor
McGonagall
and
what
gave
you
that
impression
snape
mad
a
slight
flexing
movement
of
his
left
arm
where
the
Dark
Mark
was
branded
into
his
skin
oh
but
naturally
said
Professor
McGonagall
you
Death
Eaters
have
your
own
private
means
of
communication
I
forgot
snape
pretended
not
to
have
heard
her
his
eyes
were
still
probing
the
air
all
about
her
and
he
was
moving
gradually
closer
with
an
air
of
hardly
noticing
what
he
was
doing
i
did
not
know
that
it
was
your
night
to
patrol
the
corridors
Minerva
you
have
some
objection
i
wonder
what
could
have
brought
you
out
of
our
bed
at
this
late
hour
i
thought
I
heard
a
disturbance
said
Professor
McGonagall
really
but
all
seems
calm
snape
looked
into
her
eyes
have
you
seen
Harry
Potter
Minerva
because
if
you
have
i
must
insist
professor
McGonagall
moved
faster
than
Harry
could
have
believed
her
wand
slashed
through
the
air
and
for
a
split
second
Harry
thought
that
Snape
must
crumple
unconscious
but
the
swiftness
of
his
Shield
Charm
was
such
that
McGonagall
was
thrown
off
balance
She
brandished
her
wand
at
a
touch
on
the
wall
and
it
flew
out
of
its
bracket
harry
about
to
curse
Snape
was
forced
to
pull
Luna
out
of
the
way
of
the
descending
flames
which
became
a
ring
of
fire
that
filled
the
corridor
and
flew
like
a
lasso
at
Snape
then
it
was
no
longer
fire
but
a
great
black
serpent
that
McGonagall
blasted
to
smoke
which
re-formed
and
solidified
in
seconds
to
become
a
swarm
of
pursuing
daggers
snape
avoided
them
only
by
forcing
the
suit
of
armor
in
front
of
him
and
with
echoing
clangs
the
daggers
sank
one
after
another
into
its
breast
minerva
said
a
squeaky
voice
and
looking
behind
him
still
shielding
Luna
from
flying
spells
Harry
saw
Professors
Flitwick
and
Sprout
sprinting
up
the
corridor
toward
them
in
their
nightclothes
with
the
enormous
Professor
Slughorn
panting
along
at
the
rear
no
squealed
Flitwick
raising
his
wand
you'll
do
no
more
murder
at
Hogwarts
flitwick's
spell
hit
the
suit
of
armor
behind
which
Snape
had
taken
shelter
with
a
clatter
it
came
to
life
snape
struggled
free
of
the
crushing
arms
and
sent
it
flying
back
toward
his
attackers
harry
and
Luna
had
to
dive
sideways
to
avoid
it
as
it
smashed
into
the
wall
and
shattered
when
Harry
looked
up
again
Snape
was
in
full
flight
McGonagall
Flitwick
and
Sprout
all
thundering
after
him
he
hurtled
through
a
classroom
door
and
moments
later
he
heard
McGonagall
cry
Coward
coward
what's
happened
what's
happened
asked
Luna
harry
dragged
her
to
her
feet
and
they
raced
along
the
corridor
trailing
the
Invisibility
Cloak
behind
them
into
the
deserted
classroom
where
Professors
McGonagall
Flitwick
and
Sprout
were
standing
at
a
smashed
window
he
jumped
said
Professor
McGonagall
as
Harry
and
Luna
ran
into
the
room
you
mean
he's
dead
harry
sprinted
to
the
window
ignoring
flitwick's
and
sprout's
yells
of
shock
at
his
sudden
appearance
no
he's
not
dead
said
McGonagall
bitterly
unlike
Dumbledore
he
was
still
carrying
a
wand
and
he
seems
to
have
learned
a
few
tricks
from
his
master
with
a
tingle
of
horror
Harry
saw
in
the
distance
a
huge
bat
like
shape
flying
through
the
darkness
toward
the
perimeter
wall
there
were
heavy
footfalls
behind
them
and
a
great
deal
of
puffing
slughorn
had
just
caught
up
harry
he
panted
massaging
his
immense
chest
beneath
his
emerald-green
silk
pajamas
my
dear
boy
what
a
surprise
minerva
do
please
explain
severus
what
our
headmaster
is
taking
a
short
break
said
Professor
McGonagall
pointing
at
the
snape-shaped
hole
in
the
window
professor
harry
shouted
his
hand
on
his
forehead
He
could
see
the
inferi-filled
lake
sliding
beneath
him
and
he
felt
a
ghostly
green
boat
bump
into
the
underground
shore
and
Voldemort
lept
from
it
with
murder
in
his
heart
professor
we've
got
to
barricade
the
school
he's
coming
now
very
well
he-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
is
coming
she
told
the
other
teachers
sprout
and
Flitwick
gasped
slughorn
let
out
a
low
groan
potter
has
work
to
do
in
the
castle
on
dumbledore's
orders
we
need
to
put
in
place
every
protection
of
which
we
are
capable
while
Potter
does
what
he
needs
to
do
you
realize
of
course
that
nothing
we
do
will
be
able
to
keep
out
You-Know-Who
indefinitely
squeaked
Flitwick
but
we
can
hold
him
up
said
Professor
Sprout
thank
you
Pomona
said
Professor
McGonagall
and
between
the
two
witches
there
passed
a
look
of
grim
understanding
i
suggest
we
establish
basic
protection
around
the
place
then
gather
our
students
and
meet
in
the
Great
Hall
most
must
be
evacuated
though
if
any
of
those
who
are
over
age
wish
to
stay
and
fight
I
think
they
ought
to
be
given
the
chance
agreed
said
Professor
Sprout
already
hurrying
toward
the
door
i
shall
meet
you
in
the
Great
Hall
in
twenty
minutes
with
my
House
and
as
she
jogged
out
of
sight
they
could
hear
her
muttering
Tentacula
devil's
Snare
and
Snargaluff
pods
yes
i'd
like
to
see
the
Death
Eaters
fighting
those
i
can
act
from
here
said
Flitwick
and
although
he
could
barely
see
out
of
it
he
pointed
his
wand
through
the
smashed
window
and
started
muttering
incantations
of
great
complexity
harry
heard
a
weird
rushing
noise
as
though
Flitwick
had
unleashed
the
power
of
the
wind
into
the
grounds
professor
Harry
said
approaching
the
little
Charms
master
professor
i'm
sorry
to
interrupt
but
this
is
important
have
you
got
any
idea
where
the
diadem
of
Ravenclaw
is
Protego
horribillis-the
diadem
of
Ravenclaw
squeaked
Flitwick
a
little
extra
wisdom
never
goes
amiss
Potter
but
I
hardly
think
it
would
be
much
use
in
this
situation
i
only
meant
do
you
know
where
it
is
have
you
ever
seen
it
seen
it
Nobody
has
seen
it
in
living
memory
long
since
lost
boy
harry
felt
a
mixture
of
desperate
disappointment
and
panic
what
then
was
the
Horcrux
we
shall
meet
you
and
your
Ravenclaws
in
the
Great
Hall
Filius
said
Professor
McGonagall
beckoning
to
Harry
and
Luna
to
follow
her
they
had
just
reached
the
door
when
Slughorn
rumbled
into
speech
my
word
he
puffed
pale
and
sweaty
his
walrus
mustache
aquiver
what
a
to-do
i'm
not
at
all
sure
whether
this
is
wise
Minerva
he
is
bound
to
find
a
way
in
you
know
and
anyone
who
has
tried
to
delay
him
will
be
in
the
most
grievous
peril
i
shall
expect
you
and
the
Slytherins
in
the
Great
Hall
in
twenty
minutes
also
said
Professor
McGonagall
if
you
wish
to
leave
with
your
students
we
shall
not
stop
you
but
if
any
of
you
attempt
to
sabotage
our
resistance
or
take
up
arms
against
us
within
this
castle
then
Horace
we
duel
to
kill
minerva
he
said
aghast
the
time
has
come
for
Slytherin
House
to
decide
upon
its
loyalties
interrupted
Professor
McGonagall
go
and
wake
your
students
Horace
harry
did
not
stay
to
watch
Slughorn
splutter
he
and
Luna
stayed
after
Professor
McGonagall
who
had
taken
up
a
position
in
the
middle
of
the
corridor
and
raised
her
wand
piertotum-oh
for
heaven's
sake
Filch
not
now
the
aged
caretaker
had
just
come
hobbling
into
view
shouting
Students
out
of
bed
students
in
the
corridors
they're
supposed
to
be
you
blithering
idiot
shouted
McGonagall
now
go
and
do
something
constructive
find
Peeves
p-Peeves
stammered
Filch
as
though
he
had
never
heard
the
name
before
yes
Peeves
you
fool
Peeves
haven't
you
been
complaining
about
him
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
go
and
fetch
him
at
once
filch
evidently
thought
Professor
McGonagall
had
taken
leave
of
her
senses
but
hobbled
away
hunch-shouldered
muttering
under
his
breath
and
now-Piertotum
Locomator
cried
Professor
McGonagall
and
all
along
the
corridor
the
statues
and
suits
of
armor
jumped
down
from
their
plinths
and
from
the
echoing
crashes
from
the
floors
above
and
below
Harry
knew
that
their
fellows
throughout
the
castle
had
done
the
same
hogwarts
is
threatened
shouted
Professor
McGonagall
man
the
boundaries
protect
us
do
your
duty
to
our
school
clattering
and
yelling
the
horde
of
moving
statues
stampeded
past
Harry
some
of
them
smaller
others
larger
than
life
there
were
animals
too
and
the
clanking
suits
of
armor
brandished
swords
and
spiked
balls
on
chains
now
Potter
said
McGonagall
you
and
Miss
Lovegood
had
better
return
to
your
friends
and
bring
them
to
the
Great
Hall
I
shall
rouse
the
other
Gryffindors
they
parted
at
the
top
of
the
next
staircase
Harry
and
Luna
turning
back
toward
the
concealed
entrance
to
the
Room
of
Requirement
as
they
ran
they
met
crowds
of
students
most
wearing
traveling
cloaks
over
their
pajamas
being
shepherded
down
to
the
Great
Hall
by
teachers
and
prefects
that
was
Potter
harry
Potter
it
was
him
I
swear
I
just
saw
him
but
Harry
did
not
look
back
and
at
last
they
reached
the
entrance
to
the
Room
of
Requirement
Harry
leaned
against
the
enchanted
wall
which
opened
to
admit
them
and
he
and
Luna
sped
back
down
the
steep
staircase
wh
as
the
room
came
into
view
Harry
slipped
down
a
few
stairs
in
shock
it
was
packed
far
more
crowded
than
when
he
had
last
been
in
there
kingsley
and
Lupin
were
looking
up
at
him
as
were
Oliver
Wood
Katie
Bell
Angelina
Johnson
and
Alicia
Spinnet
Bill
and
Fleur
and
mr.
and
Mrs

Fred

to
miss
the
fun
Harry
and
the
D
a.
let
the
Order
of
the
Phoenix
know
and
it
all
kind
of
snowballed
what
first
Harry
called
George
what's
going
on
they're
evacuating
the
younger
kids
and
everyone's
meeting
in
the
Great
Hall
to
get
organized
Harry
said
we're
fighting
there
was
a
great
roar
and
a
surge
toward
the
stairs
he
was
pressed
back
against
he
wall
as
they
ran
past
hi
the
mingled
members
of
the
Order
of
the
Phoenix
dumbledore's
Army
and
harry's
old
Quidditch
team
all
with
their
wands
drawn
heading
up
into
the
main
castle
come
on
Luna
Dean
called
as
he
passed
holding
out
his
free
hand
she
took
it
and
followed
him
back
up
the
stairs
the
crowd
was
thinning
only
a
little
knot
of
people
remained
below
in
the
Room
of
Requirement
and
Harry
joined
them
mrs
weasley
was
struggling
with
Ginny
around
them
stood
Lupin
Fred
George
Bill
and
Fleur

underage
mrs
weasley
shouted
at
her
daughter
as
Harry
approached

the
boys
yes
but

ginny's

flew
as
she
pulled
her
arm
out
of
her
mother's
grip
i'm
in
dumbledore's
Army
a
teenagers
gang
a
teenagers
gang
that's

Fred

shouted
Mrs
weasley

were
thinking

George
looked
slightly
ashamed
of

Ginny
said
Bill
gently

everyone

ginny
shouted
angry
tears
sparkling
in
her
eyes
my
whole
family's
here
I
can't
stand
waiting
there
alone
and
not
knowing
and
her
eyes
met
harry's
for
the
first
time
she
looked
at
him
beseechingly
but
he
shook
his
head
and
she
turned
away
bitterly
fine
she
said
staring
at
the
entrance
to
the
tunnel
back
to
the
hog's
Head
i'll
say
good-by
now
then
and
there
was
a
scuffling
and
a
great
thump
someone
else
had
clambered
out
of
the
tunnel
overbalanced
slightly
and
fallen
he
pulled
himself
up
no
the
nearest
chair
looked
around
through
lopsided
horn-rimmed
glasses
and
said
Am
I
too
late
has
it
started
i
only
just
found
out
so
I
I
percy
spluttered
into
silence
evidently
he
had
not
expected
to
run
into
most
of
his
family
there
was
a
long
moment
of
astonishment
broken
by
Fleur
turning
to
Lupin
and
saying
in
a
wildly
transparent
attempt
to
break
the
tension
so
ow
eez
leetle
Teddy
lupin
blinked
at
her
startled
the
silence
between
the
Weasleys
seemed
to
be
solidifying
like
ice
i
oh
yes
he's
fine
lupin
said
loudly
yes
Tonks
is
with
him
at
her
mother's
percy
and
the
other
Weasleys
were
still
staring
at
one
another
frozen
here
i've
got
a
picture
lupin
shouted
pulling
a
photograph
from
inside
his
jacket
and
showing
it
to
Fleur
and
Harry
who
saw
a
tiny
baby
with
a
tuft
of
bright
turquoise
hair
waving
fat
fists
at
the
camera
i
was
a
fool
percy
roared
so
loudly
that
Lupin
nearly
dropped
his
photograph
i
was
an
idiot
I
was
a
pompous
prat
I
was
a
a
ministry-loving
family-disowning
power-hungry
moron
said
Fred
percy
swallowed
yes
I
was
well
you
can't
say
fairer
than
that
said
Fred
holding
his
hand
out
to
Percy
mrs
weasley
burst
into
tears
she
ran
forward
pushed
Fred
aside
and
pulled
Percy
into
a
strangling
hug
while
he
patted
her
on
the
back
his
eyes
on
his
father
i'm
sorry
Dad
Percy
said
mr.
Weasley
blinked
rather
rapidly
then
he
too
hurried
to
hug
his
son
what
made
you
see
sense
Perce
inquired
George
it's
been
coming
on
for
a
while
said
Percy
mopping
his
eyes
under
his
glasses
with
a
corner
of
his
traveling
cloak
but
I
had
to
find
a
way
out
and
it's
not
so
easy
at
the
Ministry
they're
imprisoning
traitors
all
the
time
i
managed
to
make
contact
with
Aberforth
and
he
tipped
me
off
ten
minutes
ago
that
Hogwarts
was
going
to
make
a
fight
of
it
so
here
I
am
well
we
do
look
to
our
prefects
to
take
a
lead
at
times
such
as
these
said
George
in
a
good
imitation
of
percy's
most
pompous
manner
now
let's
get
upstairs
and
fight
or
all
the
good
Death
eaters'll
be
taken
so
you're
my
sister
in-law
now
said
Percy
shaking
hands
with
Fleur
as
they
hurried
off
toward
the
staircase
with
Bill
Fred
and
George
ginny
barked
Mrs
weasley
ginny
had
been
attempting
under
cover
of
the
reconciliations
to
sneak
upstairs
too
molly
how
about
this
said
Lupin
why
doesn't
Ginny
stay
here
then
at
least
she'll
be
on
the
scene
and
know
what's
going
on
but
she
won't
be
in
the
middle
of
the
fighting
i
that's
a
good
idea
said
mr.
Weasley
firmly
Ginny
you
stay
in
this
room
you
hear
me
ginny
did
not
seem
to
like
the
idea
much
but
under
her
father's
unusually
stern
gaze
she
nodded
mr.
and
Mrs
weasley
and
Lupin
headed
off
to
the
stairs
as
well
where's
Ron
asked
Harry
where's
Hermione
they
must
have
gone
up
the
Great
Hall
already
mr.
Weasley
called
over
his
shoulder
i
didn't
see
them
pass
me
said
Harry
they
said
something
about
a
bathroom
said
Ginny
not
long
after
you
left
a
bathroom
harry
strode
across
the
room
to
an
open
door
leading
off
the
Room
of
Requirement
and
checked
the
bathroom
beyond
it
was
empty
you're
sure
they
said
bath
but
then
his
scar
seared
and
the
Room
of
Requirement
vanished
he
was
looking
through
the
high
wrought-iron
gates
with
winged
boats
on
pillars
at
either
side
looking
through
the
dark
grounds
toward
the
castle
which
was
ablaze
with
lights
nagini
lay
draped
over
his
shoulders
he
was
possessed
of
that
cold
cruel
sense
of
purpose
that
preceded
murder
chapter
Thirty-One
the
Battle
of
Hogwarts
the
enchanted
ceiling
of
the
Great
Hall
was
dark
and
scattered
with
stars
and
below
it
the
four
long
House
tables
were
lined
with
disheveled
students
some
in
traveling
cloaks
others
in
dressing
gowns
here
and
there
shone
the
pearly
white
figures
of
the
school
ghosts
every
eye
living
and
dead
was
fixed
upon
Professor
McGonagall
who
was
speaking
from
the
raised
platform
at
the
top
of
the
Hall
behind
her
stood
the
remaining
teaches
including
the
palomino
centaur
Firenze
and
the
members
of
the
Order
of
the
Phoenix
who
had
arrived
to
fight
evacuation
will
be
overseen
by
mr.
Filch
and
Madame
Pomfrey
prefects
when
I
give
the
word
you
will
organize
your
House
and
take
your
charges
in
orderly
fashion
to
the
evacuation
point
many
of
the
students
looked
petrified
however
as
Harry
skirted
the
walls
scanning
the
Gryffindor
table
for
Ron
and
Hermione
Ernie
Macmillan
stood
up
at
the
Hufflepuff
table
and
shouted
And
what
if
we
want
to
stay
and
fight
there
was
a
smattering
of
applause
if
you
are
of
age
you
may
stay
said
Professor
McGonagall
what
about
our
things
called
a
girl
at
the
Ravenclaw
table
our
trunks
our
owls
we
have
no
time
to
collect
possessions
said
Professor
McGonagall
the
important
thing
is
to
get
you
out
of
here
safely
where's
Professor
Snape
shouted
a
girl
from
the
Slytherin
table
he
has
to
use
the
common
phrase
done
a
bunk
replied
Professor
McGonagall
and
a
great
cheer
erupted
from
the
Gryffindors
Hufflepuffs
and
Ravenclaws
harry
moved
up
the
Hall
alongside
the
Gryffindor
table
still
looking
for
Ron
and
Hermione
as
he
passed
faces
turned
in
his
direction
and
a
great
deal
of
whispering
broke
out
in
his
wake
we
have
already
placed
protection
around
the
castle
Professor
McGonagall
was
saying
but
it
is
unlikely
to
hold
for
very
long
unless
we
reinforce
it
i
must
ask
you
therefore
to
move
quickly
and
calmly
and
do
as
your
prefects
but
her
final
words
were
drowned
as
a
different
voice
echoed
throughout
the
Hall
it
was
high
cold
and
clear
there
was
no
telling
from
where
it
came
it
seemed
to
issue
from
the
walls
themselves
like
the
monster
it
had
once
commanded
it
might
have
lain
dormant
there
for
centuries
i
know
that
you
are
preparing
to
fight
there
were
screams
amongst
the
students
some
of
whom
clutched
each
other
looking
around
in
terror
for
the
source
of
the
sound
your
efforts
are
futile
you
cannot
fight
me
i
do
not
want
to
kill
you
i
have
great
respect
for
the
teachers
of
Hogwarts
i
do
not
want
to
spill
magical
blood
there
was
silence
in
the
Hall
now
the
kind
of
silence
that
presses
against
the
eardrums
that
seems
too
huge
to
be
contained
by
walls
give
me
Harry
Potter
said
voldemort's
voice
and
they
shall
not
be
harmed
give
me
Harry
Potter
and
I
shall
leave
the
school
untouched
give
me
Harry
Potter
and
you
will
be
rewarded
you
have
until
midnight
the
silence
swallowed
them
all
again
every
head
turned
every
eye
in
the
place
seemed
to
have
found
Harry
to
hold
him
forever
in
the
glare
of
thousands
of
invisible
beams
then
a
figure
rose
from
the
Slytherin
table
and
he
recognized
Pansy
Parkinson
as
she
raised
a
shaking
arm
and
screamed
But
he's
there
potter's
there
someone
grab
him
before
Harry
could
speak
there
was
a
massive
movement
the
Gryffindors
in
front
of
him
had
risen
and
stood
facing
not
Harry
but
the
Slytherins
then
the
Hufflepuffs
stood
and
almost
at
the
same
moment
the
Ravenclaws
all
of
them
with
their
backs
to
Harry
all
of
them
looking
toward
Pansy
instead
and
Harry
awestruck
and
overwhelmed
saw
wands
emerging
everywhere
pulled
from
beneath
cloaks
and
from
under
sleeves
thank
you
Miss
Parkinson
said
Professor
McGonagall
in
a
clipped
voice
you
will
leave
the
Hall
first
with
mr.
Filch
if
the
rest
of
your
House
could
follow
harry
heard
the
grinding
of
the
benches
and
then
the
sound
of
the
Slytherins
trooping
out
on
the
other
side
of
the
Hall
ravenclaws
follow
on
cried
Professor
McGonagall
slowly
the
four
tables
emptied
the
Slytherin
table
was
completely
deserted
but
a
number
of
older
Ravenclaws
remained
seated
while
their
fellows
filed
out
even
more
Hufflepuffs
stayed
behind
and
half
of
Gryffindor
remained
in
their
seats
necessitating
Professor
mcgonagall's
descent
from
the
teachers
platform
to
chivvy
the
underage
on
their
way
absolutely
not
Creevey
go
and
you
Peakes
harry
hurried
over
to
the
Weasleys
all
sitting
together
at
the
Gryffindor
table
where
are
Ron
and
Hermione
haven't
you
found
began
mr.
Weasley
looking
worried
but
he
broke
off
as
Kingsley
had
stepped
forward
on
the
raised
platform
to
address
those
who
had
remained
behind
we've
only
got
half
an
half
an
hour
until
midnight
so
we
need
to
act
fast
a
battle
plan
has
been
agreed
between
the
teachers
of
Hogwarts
and
the
Order
of
the
Phoenix
professors
Flitwick
Sprout
and
McGonagall
are
going
to
take
groups
of
fighters
up
to
the
three
highest
towers
Ravenclaw
Astronomy
and
Gryffindor
where
they'll
have
good
overview
excellent
positions
from
which
to
work
spells
meanwhile
Remus
he
indicated
Lupin
Arthur
he
pointed
toward
mr.
Weasley
sitting
at
the
Gryffindor
table
and
I
will
take
groups
into
the
grounds
we'll
need
somebody
to
organize
defense
of
the
entrances
or
the
passageways
into
the
school
sounds
like
a
job
for
us
called
Fred
indicating
himself
and
George
and
Kingsley
nodded
his
approval
all
right
leaders
up
here
and
we'll
divide
up
the
troops
potter
said
Professor
McGonagall
hurrying
up
to
him
as
students
flooded
the
platform
jostling
for
position
receiving
instructions
aren't
you
supposed
to
be
looking
for
something
what
oh
said
Harry
oh
yeah
he
had
almost
forgotten
about
the
Horcrux
almost
forgotten
that
the
battle
was
being
fought
so
that
he
could
search
for
it
The
inexplicable
absence
of
Ron
and
Hermione
had
momentarily
driven
every
other
thought
from
his
mind
then
go
Potter
go
right
yeah
he
sensed
eyes
following
him
as
he
ran
out
of
the
Great
Hall
again
into
the
entrance
hall
still
crowded
with
evacuating
students
he
allowed
himself
to
be
swept
up
the
marble
staircase
with
them
but
at
the
top
he
hurried
off
along
a
deserted
corridor
fear
and
panic
were
clouding
his
thought
processes
he
tried
to
calm
himself
to
concentrate
on
finding
the
Horcrux
but
his
thoughts
buzzed
as
frantically
and
fruitlessly
as
wasps
trapped
beneath
a
glass
without
Ron
and
Hermione
to
help
him
he
could
not
seem
to
marshal
his
ideas
he
slowed
down
coming
to
a
halt
halfway
along
a
passage
where
he
sat
down
on
the
plinth
of
a
departed
statue
and
pulled
the
marauder's
Map
out
of
the
pouch
around
his
neck
he
could
not
see
ron's
of
hermione's
names
anywhere
on
it
though
the
density
of
the
crowd
of
dots
now
making
its
way
to
the
Room
of
Requirement
might
he
thought
be
concealing
them
he
put
the
map
away
pressed
his
hands
over
his
face
and
closed
his
eyes
trying
to
concentrate
voldemort
thought
i'd
go
to
Ravenclaw
Tower
there
it
was
a
solid
fact
the
place
to
start
voldemort
had
stationed
Alecto
Carrow
in
the
Ravenclaw
common
room
and
there
could
be
only
one
explanation
Voldemort
feared
that
Harry
already
knew
his
Horcrux
was
connected
to
that
House
but
the
only
object
anyone
seemed
to
associate
with
Ravenclaw
was
the
lost
diadem
and
how
could
the
Horcrux
be
the
diadem
how
was
it
possible
that
Voldemort
the
Slytherin
had
found
the
diadem
that
had
eluded
generations
of
Ravenclaws
who
could
have
told
him
where
to
look
when
nobody
had
seen
the
diadem
in
living
memory
in
living
memory
beneath
his
fingers
harry's
eyes
flew
open
again
he
leapt
up
from
the
plinth
and
tore
back
the
way
he
had
come
now
in
pursuit
of
his
one
last
hope
the
sound
of
hundreds
of
people
marching
toward
the
Room
of
Requirement
grew
louder
and
louder
as
he
returned
to
the
marble
stairs
prefects
were
shouting
instructions
trying
to
keep
track
of
the
students
in
their
own
houses
there
was
much
pushing
and
shouting
Harry
saw
Zacharias
Smith
bowling
over
first
years
to
get
to
the
front
of
the
queue
here
and
there
younger
students
were
in
tears
while
older
ones
called
desperately
for
friends
or
siblings
harry
caught
sight
of
a
pearly
white
figure
drifting
across
the
entrance
hall
below
and
yelled
as
loudly
as
he
could
over
the
clamor
nick
nick
i
need
to
talk
to
you
he
forced
his
way
back
through
the
tide
of
students
finally
reaching
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
where
Nearly
Headless
Nick
ghost
of
Gryffindor
Tower
stood
waiting
for
him
harry
my
dear
boy
nick
made
to
grasp
harry's
hands
with
both
of
his
own
Harry
felt
as
though
they
had
been
thrust
into
icy
water
nick
you've
got
to
help
me
who's
the
ghost
of
Ravenclaw
Tower
nearly
Headless
Nick
looked
surprised
and
a
little
offended
the
Gray
Lady
of
course
but
if
it
is
ghostly
services
you
require
it's
got
to
be
her
d'you
know
where
she
is
let's
see
nick's
head
wobbled
a
little
on
his
ruff
as
he
turned
hither
and
thither
peering
over
the
heads
of
the
swarming
students
that's
her
over
there
Harry
the
young
woman
with
the
long
hair
harry
looked
in
the
direction
of
nick's
transparent
pointing
finger
and
saw
a
tall
ghost
who
caught
sight
of
Harry
looking
at
her
raised
her
eyebrows
and
drifted
away
through
a
solid
wall
harry
ran
after
her
once
through
the
door
of
the
corridor
into
which
she
had
disappeared
he
saw
her
at
the
very
end
of
the
passage
still
gliding
smoothly
away
from
him
hey
wait
come
back
she
consented
to
pause
floating
a
few
inches
from
the
ground
harry
supposed
that
she
was
beautiful
with
her
waist-length
hair
and
floor-length
cloak
but
she
also
looked
haughty
and
proud
close
in
he
recognized
her
as
a
ghost
he
had
passed
several
times
in
the
corridor
but
to
whom
he
had
never
spoken
you're
the
Gray
Lady
she
nodded
but
did
not
speak
the
ghost
of
Ravenclaw
Tower
that
is
correct
her
tone
was
not
encouraging
please
I
need
some
help
i
need
to
know
anything
you
can
tell
me
about
the
lost
diadem
a
cold
smile
curved
her
lips
i
am
afraid
she
said
turning
to
leave
that
I
cannot
help
you
wait
he
had
not
meant
to
shout
but
anger
and
panic
were
threatening
to
overwhelm
him
he
glanced
at
his
watch
as
she
hovered
in
front
of
him
it
was
a
quarter
to
midnight
this
is
urgent
he
said
fiercely
if
that
diadem's
at
Hogwarts
i've
got
to
find
it
fast
you
are
hardly
the
first
student
to
covet
the
diadem
she
said
disdainfully
generations
of
students
have
badgered
me
this
isn't
about
trying
to
get
better
marks
harry
shouted
at
her
it's
about
Voldemort
defeating
Voldemort
or
aren't
you
interested
in
that
she
could
not
blush
but
her
transparent
cheeks
became
more
opaque
and
her
voice
was
heated
as
she
replied
Of
course
I
how
dare
you
suggest
well
help
me
then
her
composure
was
slipping
it
it
is
not
a
question
of
she
stammered
my
mother's
diadem
your
mother's
she
looked
angry
with
herself
when
I
lived
she
said
stiffly
I
was
Helena
Ravenclaw
you're
her
daughter
but
then
you
must
know
what
happed
to
it
while
the
diadem
bestows
wisdom
she
said
with
an
obvious
effort
to
pull
herself
together
I
doubt
that
it
would
greatly
increase
you
chances
of
defeating
the
wizard
who
calls
himself
Lord
haven't
I
told
you
i'm
not
interested
in
wearing
it
harry
said
fiercely
there's
no
time
to
explain
but
if
you
care
about
Hogwarts
if
you
want
to
see
Voldemort
finished
you've
got
to
tell
me
anything
you
know
about
the
diadem
she
remained
quite
still
floating
in
midair
staring
down
at
him
and
a
sense
of
hopelessness
engulfed
Harry
of
course
if
she
had
known
anything
she
would
have
told
Flitwick
of
Dumbledore
who
had
surely
asked
her
the
same
question
he
had
shaken
his
head
and
made
to
turn
away
when
she
spoke
in
a
low
voice
i
stole
the
diadem
from
my
mother
you
you
did
what
i
stole
the
diadem
repeated
Helena
Ravenclaw
in
a
whisper
i
sought
to
make
myself
cleverer
more
important
than
my
mother
i
ran
away
with
it
he
did
not
know
how
he
had
managed
to
gain
her
confidence
and
did
not
ask
he
simply
listened
hard
as
she
went
on
my
mother
they
say
never
admitted
that
the
diadem
was
gone
but
pretended
that
she
had
it
still
she
concealed
her
loss
my
dreadful
betrayal
even
from
the
other
founders
of
Hogwarts
then
my
mother
fell
ill
fatally
ill
in
spite
of
my
perfidy
she
was
desperate
to
see
me
one
more
time
she
sent
a
man
who
had
long
loved
me
though
I
spurned
his
advances
to
find
me
she
knew
that
he
would
not
rest
until
he
had
done
so
harry
waited
she
drew
a
deep
breath
and
threw
back
her
head
he
tracked
me
to
the
forest
where
I
was
hiding
when
I
refused
to
return
with
him
he
became
violent
the
baron
was
always
a
hot-tempered
man
furious
at
my
refusal
jealous
of
my
freedom
he
stabbed
me
the
Baron
you
mean
he
Bloody
Baron
yes
said
the
Gray
Lady
and
she
lifted
aside
the
cloak
she
wore
to
reveal
a
single
dark
wound
in
her
white
chest
when
he
saw
what
he
had
done
he
was
overcome
with
remorse
he
took
the
weapon
that
had
claimed
my
life
and
used
it
to
kill
himself
all
these
centuries
later
he
wears
his
chains
as
an
act
of
penitence
as
he
should
she
added
bitterly
and
and
the
diadem
it
remained
where
I
had
hidden
it
when
I
heard
the
Baron
blundering
through
the
forest
toward
me
concealed
inside
a
hollow
tree
a
hollow
tree
repeated
Harry
what
tree
where
was
this
a
forest
in
Albania
a
lonely
place
I
thought
was
far
beyond
my
mother's
reach
albania
repeated
Harry
sense
was
emerging
miraculously
from
confusion
and
now
he
understood
why
she
was
telling
him
what
she
had
denied
Dumbledore
and
Flitwick
you've
already
told
someone
this
story
haven't
you
another
student
she
closed
her
eyes
and
nodded
i
had
no
idea
he
was
flattering
he
seemed
to
understand
to
sympathize
yes
Harry
thought
tom
Riddle
would
certainly
have
understood
Helena
ravenclaw's
desire
to
possess
fabulous
objects
to
which
she
had
little
right
well
you
weren't
the
first
person
Riddle
wormed
things
out
of
harry
muttered
he
could
be
charming
when
he
wanted
so
Voldemort
had
managed
to
wheedle
the
location
of
the
lost
diadem
out
of
the
Gray
Lady
he
had
traveled
to
that
far-flung
forest
and
retrieved
the
diadem
from
its
hiding
place
perhaps
as
soon
as
he
left
Hogwarts
before
he
even
started
work
at
Borgin
and
Burkes
and
wouldn't
those
secluded
Albanian
woods
have
seemed
an
excellent
refuge
when
so
much
later
Voldemort
and
needed
a
place
to
lie
low
undisturbed
for
ten
long
years
but
the
diadem
once
it
became
his
precious
Horcrux
had
not
been
left
in
that
lowly
tree
no
the
diadem
had
been
returned
secretly
to
its
true
home
and
Voldemort
must
have
put
it
there
the
night
he
asked
for
a
job
said
Harry
finishing
his
thought
i
beg
your
pardon
he
hid
the
diadem
in
the
castle
the
night
he
asked
Dumbledore
to
let
him
teach
said
Harry
saying
it
out
loud
enabled
him
to
make
sense
of
it
all
he
mustve
hidden
the
diadem
on
his
way
up
to
or
down
from
Dumbledores
office
but
it
was
well
worth
trying
to
get
the
job
then
he
mightve
got
the
chance
to
nick
Gryffindors
sword
as
well
thank
you
thanks
harry
left
her
floating
there
looking
utterly
bewildered
as
he
rounded
the
corner
back
into
the
entrance
hall
he
checked
his
watch
it
was
five
minutes
until
midnight
and
though
he
now
knew
what
the
last
Horcrux
was
he
was
no
closer
to
discovering
where
it
was
generations
of
students
had
failed
to
find
the
diadem
that
suggested
that
it
was
not
in
Ravenclaw
Tower
but
if
not
there
where
what
hiding
place
had
Tom
Riddle
discovered
inside
Hogwarts
Castle
that
he
believed
would
remain
secret
forever
lost
in
desperate
speculation
Harry
turned
a
corner
but
he
had
taken
only
a
few
steps
down
the
new
corridor
when
the
window
to
his
left
broke
open
with
a
deafening
shattering
crash
as
he
leapt
aside
a
gigantic
body
flew
in
through
the
window
and
hit
the
opposite
wall
something
large
and
furry
detached
itself
whimpering
from
the
new
arrival
and
flung
itself
at
Harry
hagrid
harry
bellowed
fighting
off
Fang
the
boarhounds
attentions
as
the
enormous
bearded
figure
clambered
to
his
feet
What
the
harry
yer
here
yer
here
hagrid
stooped
down
bestowed
upon
Harry
a
cursory
and
rib-cracking
hug
then
ran
back
to
the
shattered
window
good
boy
Grawpy
he
bellowed
through
the
hole
in
the
window
ill
se
yer
in
a
moment
theres
a
good
lad
beyond
Hagrid
out
in
the
dark
night
Harry
saw
bursts
of
light
in
the
distance
and
heard
a
weird
keening
scream
he
looked
down
at
his
watch
It
was
midnight
the
battle
had
begun
blimey
Harry
panted
Hagrid
this
is
it
eh
time
ter
fight
hagrid
where
have

You-Know-Who

Hagrid
grimly
voice
carried
didnt
it
Yet

Knew

Fang
so

an
Grawpy
an
Fang

our
way
through
the
boundary
by
the
forest
Grawpy
was
carryin
us
Fang
an
me
told
him
ter
let
me
down
at
the
castle
so
he
shoved
me
through
the
window
bless

not
exactly
what
I
meant
bu
wheres
Ron
an
Hermione
that
said
Harry
is
a
really
good
question
come
on
they
hurried
together
along
the
corridor
Fang
lolloping
beside
them
harry
could
hear
movement
through
the
corridors
all
around
running
footsteps
shouts
through
the
windows
he
could
see
more
flashes
of
light
in
the
dark
grounds
wherere
we
goin
puffed
Hagrid
pounding
along
at
Harrys
heels
making
the
floorboards
quake
i
dunno
exactly
said
Harry
making
another
random
turn
but
Ron
and
Hermione
must
be
around
here
somewhere
the
first
casualties
of
the
battle
were
already
strewn
across
the
passage
ahead
The
two
stone
gargoyles
that
usually
guarded
the
entrance
to
the
staffroom
had
been
smashed
apart
by
a
jinx
that
had
sailed
through
another
broken
window
their
remains
stirred
feebly
on
the
floor
and
as
Harry
leapt
over
one
of
their
disembodied
heads
it
moaned
faintly
oh
dont
mind
me
ill
just
be
here
and
crumble
its
ugly
stone
face
made
Harry
think
suddenly
of
the
marble
bust
of
Rowena
Ravenclaw
at
Xenophiliuss
house
wearing
that
mad
headdress
and
then
of
the
statue
in
Ravenclaw
Tower
with
the
stone
diadem
upon
her
white
curls
and
as
he
reached
the
end
of
the
passage
the
memory
of
a
third
stone
effigy
came
back
to
him
that
of
an
ugly
old
warlock
onto
whose
head
Harry
himself
had
placed
a
wig
and
a
battered
old
hat
the
shock
shot
through
Harry
with
the
heat
of
firewhisky
and
he
nearly
stumbled
he
knew
at
least
where
the
Horcrux
sat
waiting
for
him
tom
Riddle
who
confided
in
no
one
and
operated
alone
might
have
been
arrogant
enough
to
assume
that
he
and
only
he
had
penetrated
the
deepest
mysteries
of
Hogwarts
Castle
of
course
Dumbledore
and
Flitwick
those
model
pupils
had
never
set
foot
in
that
particular
place
but
he
Harry
had
strayed
off
the
beaten
track
in
his
time
at
school
here
at
least
was
a
secret
area
he
and
Voldemort
knew
that
Dumbledore
had
never
discovered
he
was
roused
by
Professor
Sprout
who
was
thundering
past
followed
by
Neville
and
half
a
dozen
others
all
of
them
wearing
earmuffs
and
carrying
what
appeared
to
be
large
potted
plants
mandrakes
neville
bellowed
at
Harry
over
his
shoulder
as
he
ran
going
to
lob
them
over
the
walls
they
wont
like
this
harry
knew
now
where
to
go
he
sped
off
with
Hagrid
and
Fang
galloping
behind
him
they
passed
portrait
after
portrait
and
the
painted
figures
raced
alongside
them
wizards
and
witches
in
ruffs
and
breeches
in
armor
and
cloaks
cramming
themselves
into
each
others
canvases
screaming
news
from
other
parts
of
the
castle
as
they
reached
the
end
of
this
corridor
the
whole
castle
shook
and
Harry
knew
as
a
gigantic
vase
blew
off
its
plinth
with
explosive
force
that
it
was
in
the
grip
of
enchantments
more
sinister
than
those
of
the
teachers
and
the
Order
its
all
righ
Fang
its
all
righ
yelled
Hagrid
but
the
great
boarhound
had
taken
flight
as
slivers
of
china
flew
like
shrapnel
through
the
air
and
Hagrid
pounded
off
after
the
terrified
dog
leaving
Harry
alone
he
forged
on
through
the
trembling
passages
his
wand
at
the
ready
and
for
the
length
of
one
corridor
the
little
painted
knight
Sir
Cadrigan
rushed
from
painting
to
painting
beside
him
clanking
along
in
his
armor
screaming
encouragement
his
fat
little
pony
cantering
behind
him
braggarts
and
rogues
dogs
and
scoundrels
drive
them
out
Harry
Potter
see
them
off
harry
hurtled
around
a
corner
and
found
Fred
and
a
small
knot
of
students
including
Lee
Jordan
and
Hannah
Abbott
standing
beside
another
empty
plinth
whose
statue
had
concealed
a
secret
passageway
their
wands
were
drawn
and
they
were
listening
at
the
concealed
hole
nice
night
for
it
fred
shouted
as
the
castle
quaked
again
and
Harry
sprinted
by
elated
and
terrified
in
equal
measure
along
yet
another
corridor
he
dashed
and
then
there
were
owls
everywhere
and
Mrs
norris
was
hissing
and
trying
to
bat
them
with
her
paws
no
doubt
to
return
them
to
their
proper
place
potter
aberforth
Dumbledore
stood
blocking
the
corridor
ahead
his
wand
held
ready
ive
had
hundreds
of
kids
thundering
through
my
pub
Potter
i
know
were
evacuating
Harry
said
Voldemorts
attacking
because
they
havent
handed
you
over
yeah
said
Aberforth
im
not
deaf
the
whole
of
Hogsmeade
heard
him
and
it
never
occurred
to
any
of
you
to
keep
a
few
Slytherins
hostage
there
are
kids
of
Death
Eaters
youve
just
sent
to
safety
wouldnt
it
have
been
a
bit
smarter
to
keep
em
here
it
wouldnt
stop
Voldemort
said
Harry
and
your
brother
would
never
have
done
it
aberforth
grunted
and
tore
away
in
the
opposite
direction
your
brother
would
never
have
done
it
well
it
was
the
truth
Harry
thought
as
he
ran
on
again
Dumbledore
who
had
defended
Snape
for
so
long
would
never
have
held
students
ransom
and
then
he
skidded
around
a
final
corner
and
with
a
yell
of
mingled
relief
and
fury
he
saw
them
Ron
and
Hermione
both
with
their
arms
full
of
large
curved
dirty
yellow
objects
Ron
with
a
broomstick
under
his
arms
where
the
hell
have
you
been
harry
shouted
chamber
of
Secrets
said
Ron
chamber
what
said
Harry
coming
to
an
unsteady
halt
before
them
it
was
Ron
all
Rons
idea
said
Hermione
breathlessly
wasnt
it
absolutely
brilliant
there
we
were
after
we
left
and
I
said
to
Ron
even
if
we
find
the
other
one
how
are
we
going
to
get
rid
of
it
we
still
hadnt
got
rid
of
the
cup
and
then
he
thought
of
it
the
basilisk
what
the
something
to
get
rid
of
Horcruxes
said
Ron
simply
harrys
eyes
dropped
to
the
objects
clutched
in
Ron
and
Hermiones
arms
great
curved
fangs
torn
he
now
realized
from
the
skull
of
a
dead
basilisk
but
how
did
you
get
in
there
he
asked
staring
from
the
fangs
to
Ron
you
need
to
speak
Parseltongue
he
did
whispered
Hermione
show
him
Ron
ron
made
a
horrible
strangled
hissing
noise
its
what
you
did
to
open
the
locket
he
told
Harry
apologetically
i
had
to
have
a
few
goes
to
get
it
right
but
he
shrugged
modestly
we
got
there
in
the
end
he
was
amazing
said
Hermione
amazing
so
harry
was
struggling
to
keep
up
so
so
were
another
Horcrux
down
said
Ron
and
from
under
his
jacket
he
pulled
the
mangled
remains
of
Hufflepuffs
cup
hermione
stabbed
it
thought
she
should
she
hasnt
had
the
pleasure
yet
genius
yelled
Harry
it
was
nothing
said
Ron
though
he
looked
delighted
with
himself
so
whats
new
with
you
as
he
said
it
there
was
an
explosion
from
overhead
All
three
of
them
looked
up
as
dust
fell
from
the
ceiling
and
they
heard
a
distant
scream
i
know
what
the
diadem
looks
like
and
I
know
where
it
is
said
Harry
talking
fast
he
hid
it
exactly
where
I
had
my
old
Potions
book
where
everyones
been
hiding
stuff
for
centuries
he
thought
he
was
the
only
one
to
find
it
come
on
as
the
walls
trembled
again
he
led
the
other
two
back
through
the
concealed
entrance
and
down
the
staircase
into
the
Room
of
Requirement
it
was
empty
except
for
three
women
Ginny
Tonks
and
an
elderly
witch
wearing
a
moth-eaten
hat
whom
Harry
recognized
immediately
as
Nevilles
grandmother
ah
Potter
she
said
crisply
as
if
she
had
been
waiting
for
him
you
can
tell
us
whats
going
on
is
everyone
okay
said
Ginny
and
Tonks
together
S
far
as
we
know
said
Harry
are
there
still
people
in
the
passage
to
the
Hogs
Head
he
knew
that
the
room
would
not
be
able
to
transform
while
there
were
still
users
inside
it
i
was
the
last
to
come
through
said
Mrs
longbottom
i
sealed
it
I
think
it
unwise
to
leave
it
open
now
Aberforth
has
left
his
pub
have
you
seen
my
grandson
hes
fighting
said
Harry
naturally
said
the
old
lady
proudly
excuse
me
I
must
go
and
assist
him
with
surprising
speed
she
trotted
off
toward
the
stone
steps
harry
looked
at
Tonks
i
thought
you
were
supposed
to
be
with
Teddy
at
your
mothers
i
couldnt
stand
not
knowing
Tonks
looked
anguished
shell
look
after
him
have
you
seen
Remus
he
was
planning
to
lead
a
group
of
fighters
into
the
grounds
without
another
word
Tonks
sped
off
ginny
said
Harry
Im
sorry
but
we
need
you
to
leave
too
just
for
a
bit
then
you
can
come
back
in
ginny
looked
simply
delighted
to
leave
her
sanctuary
and
then
you
can
come
back
in
he
shouted
after
her
as
she
ran
up
the
steps
after
Tonks
youve
got
to
come
back
in
hang
on
a
moment
said
Ron
sharply
weve
forgotten
someone
who
asked
Hermione
the
house-elves
theyll
all
be
down
in
the
kitchen
wont
they
you
mean
we
ought
to
get
them
fighting
asked
Harry
no
said
Ron
seriously
I
mean
we
should
tell
them
to
get
out
we
dont
want
anymore
Dobbies
do
we
we
cant
order
them
to
die
for
us
there
was
a
clatter
as
the
basilisk
fangs
cascaded
out
of
Hermiones
arms
running
at
Ron
she
flung
them
around
his
neck
and
kissed
him
full
on
the
mouth
ron
threw
away
the
fangs
and
broomstick
he
was
holding
and
responded
with
such
enthusiasm
that
he
lifted
Hermione
off
her
feet
is
this
the
moment
harry
asked
weakly
and
when
nothing
happened
except
that
Ron
and
Hermione
gripped
each
other
still
more
firmly
and
swayed
on
the
spot
he
raised
his
voice
oi
theres
a
war
going
on
here
ron
and
Hermione
broke
apart
their
arms
still
around
each
other
i
know
mate
said
Ron
who
looked
as
though
he
had
recently
been
hit
on
the
back
of
the
head
with
a
Bludger
so
its
now
or
never
isnt
it
never
mind
that
what
about
the
Horcrux
harry
shouted
dyou
think
you
could
just
just
hold
it
in
until
weve
got
the
diadem
yeah
right
sorry
said
Ron
and
he
and
Hermione
set
about
gathering
up
fangs
both
pink
in
the
face
it
was
clear
as
the
three
of
them
stepped
back
into
the
corridor
upstairs
that
in
the
minutes
that
they
had
spent
in
the
Room
of
Requirement
the
situation
within
the
castle
had
deteriorated
severely
The
walls
and
ceiling
were
shaking
worse
than
ever
dust
filled
the
air
and
through
the
nearest
window
Harry
saw
bursts
of
green
and
red
light
so
close
to
the
foot
of
the
castle
that
he
knew
the
Death
Eaters
must
be
very
near
to
entering
the
place
looking
down
Harry
saw
Grawp
the
giant
meandering
past
swinging
what
looked
like
a
stone
gargoyle
torn
from
the
roof
and
roaring
his
displeasure
lets
hope
he
steps
on
some
of
them
said
Ron
as
more
screams
echoed
from
close
by
as
long
as
its
not
any
of
our
lot
said
a
voice
Harry
turned
and
saw
Ginny
and
Tonks
both
with
their
wands
drawn
at
the
next
window
which
was
missing
several
panes
even
as
he
watched
Ginny
sent
a
well-aimed
jinx
into
a
crowd
of
fighters
below
good
girl
roared
a
figure
running
through
the
dust
toward
them
and
Harry
saw
Aberforth
again
his
gray
hair
flying
as
he
led
a
small
group
of
students
past
they
look
like
they
might
be
breaching
the
north
battlements
theyve
brought
giants
of
their
own
have
you
seen
Remus
tonks
called
after
him
he
was
dueling
Dolohov
shouted
Aberforth
havent
seen
him
since
tonks
said
Ginny
Tonks
Im
sure
hes
okay
but
Tonks
had
run
off
into
the
dust
after
Aberforth
ginny
turned
helpless
to
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
theyll
be
all
right
said
Harry
though
he
knew
they
were
empty
words
ginny
well
be
back
in
a
moment
just
keep
out
of
the
way
keep
safe
come
on
he
said
to
Ron
and
Hermione
and
they
ran
back
to
the
stretch
of
wall
beyond
which
the
Room
of
Requirement
was
waiting
to
do
the
bidding
of
the
next
entrant
i
need
the
place
where
everything
is
hidden
harry
begged
of
it
inside
his
head
and
the
door
materialized
on
their
third
run
past
the
furor
of
the
battle
died
the
moment
they
crossed
the
threshold
and
closed
the
door
behind
them
All
was
silent
they
were
in
a
place
the
size
of
a
cathedral
with
the
appearance
of
a
city
its
towering
walls
built
of
objects
hidden
by
thousands
of
long-gone
students
and
he
never
realized
anyone
could
get
in
said
Ron
his
voice
echoing
in
the
silence
he
thought
he
was
the
only
one
said
Harry
too
bad
for
him
Ive
had
to
hide
stuff
in
my
time
this
way
he
added
i
think
its
down
here
they
sped
off
up
adjacent
aisles
Harry
could
hear
the
others
footsteps
echoing
through
the
towering
piles
of
junk
of
bottles
hats
crates
chairs
books
weapons
broomsticks
bats
somewhere
near
here
Harry
muttered
to
himself
somewhere
somewhere
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
labyrinth
he
went
looking
for
objects
he
recognized
from
his
one
previous
trip
into
the
room
his
breath
was
loud
in
his
ears
and
then
his
very
soul
seemed
to
shiver
there
it
was
right
ahead
the
blistered
old
cupboard
in
which
he
had
hidden
his
old
Potions
book
and
on
top
of
it
the
pockmarked
stone
warlock
wearing
a
dusty
old
wig
and
what
looked
like
an
ancient
discolored
tiara
he
had
already
stretched
out
his
hand
though
he
remained
few
feet
away
when
a
voice
behind
him
said
Hold
it
Potter
he
skidded
to
a
halt
and
turned
around
crabbe
and
Goyle
were
standing
behind
him
shoulder
to
shoulder
wands
pointing
right
at
Harry
through
the
small
space
between
their
jeering
faces
he
saw
Draco
Malfoy
thats
my
wand
youre
holding
Potter
said
Malfoy
pointing
his
own
through
the
gap
between
Crabbe
and
Goyle
not
anymore
panted
Harry
tightening
his
grip
on
the
hawthorn
wand
winners
keepers
Malfoy
whos
lent
you
theirs
my
mother
said
Draco
harry
laughed
though
there
was
nothing
very
humorous
about
the
situation
he
could
not
hear
Ron
or
Hermione
anymore
they
seemed
to
have
run
out
of
earshot
searching
for
the
diadem
so
how
come
you
three
arent
with
Voldemort
asked
Harry
were
gonna
be
rewarded
said
Crabbe
his
voice
was
surprisingly
soft
for
such
an
enormous
person
Harry
had
hardly
ever
heard
him
speak
before
crabbe
was
speaking
like
a
small
child
promised
a
large
bag
of
sweets
we
ung
back
Potter
we
decided
not
to
go
decided
to
bring
you
to
im
good
plan
said
Harry
in
mock
admiration
he
could
not
believe
that
he
was
this
close
and
was
going
to
be
thwarted
by
Malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
he
began
edging
slowly
backward
toward
the
place
where
the
Horcrux
sat
lopsided
upon
the
bust
if
he
could
just
get
his
hands
on
it
before
the
fight
broke
out
so
how
did
you
get
in
here
he
asked
trying
to
distract
them
i
virtually
lived
in
the
Room
of
Hidden
Things
all
last
year
said
Malfoy
his
voice
brittle
i
know
how
to
get
in
we
was
hiding
in
the
corridor
outside
grunted
Goyle
we
can
do
diss-lusion
Charms
now
and
then
his
face
split
into
a
gormless
grin
you
turned
up
right
in
front
of
us
and
said
you
was
looking
for
a
die-dum
whats
a
die-dum
harry
rons
voice
echoed
suddenly
from
the
other
side
of
the
wall
to
Harrys
right
are
you
talking
to
someone
with
a
whiplike
movement
Crabbe
pointed
his
wand
at
the
fifty
foot
mountain
of
old
furniture
of
broken
trunks
of
old
books
and
robes
and
unidentifiable
junk
and
shouted
Descendo
the
wall
began
to
totter
then
the
top
third
crumbled
into
the
aisle
next
door
where
Ron
stood
ron
harry
bellowed
as
somewhere
out
of
sight
Hermione
screamed
and
Harry
heard
innumerable
objects
crashing
to
the
floor
on
the
other
side
of
the
destabilized
wall
He
pointed
his
wand
at
the
rampart
cried
Finite
and
it
steadied
no
shouted
Malfoy
staying
Crabbes
arm
as
the
latter
made
to
repeat
his
spell
if
you
wreck
the
room
you
might
bury
this
diadem
thing
whats
that
matter
said
Crabbe
tugging
himself
free
its
Potter
the
Dark
Lord
wants
who
cares
about
a
die-dum
potter
came
in
here
to
get
it
said
Malfoy
with
ill-disguised
impatience
at
the
slow-wittedness
of
his
colleagues
so
that
must
mean
Must
mean
crabbe
turned
on
Malfoy
with
undisguised
ferocity
who
cares
what
you
think
i
dont
take
your
orders
no
more
Draco
you
an
your
dad
are
finished
harry
shouted
Ron
again
from
the
other
side
of
the
junk
wad
whats
going
on
harry
mimicked
Crabbe
whats
going
on
no
Potter
crucio
harry
had
lunged
for
the
tiara
Crabbes
curse
missed
him
but
hit
the
stone
bust
which
flew
into
the
air
the
diadem
soared
upward
and
then
dropped
out
of
sight
in
the
mass
of
objects
on
which
the
bust
had
rested
stop
malfoy
shouted
at
Crabbe
his
voice
echoing
through
the
enormous
room
the
Dark
Lord
wants
him
alive
so
im
not
killing
him
am
I
yelled
Crabbe
throwing
off
Malfoys
restraining
arm
but
if
I
can
I
will
the
Dark
Lord
wants
him
dead
anyway
whats
the
diff
a
jet
of
scarlet
light
shot
past
Harry
by
inches
Hermione
had
run
around
the
corner
behind
him
and
sent
a
Stunning
Spell
straight
at
Crabbes
head
it
only
missed
because
Malfoy
pulled
him
out
of
the
way
its
that
Mudblood
avada
Kedavra
harry
saw
Hermione
dive
aside
and
his
fury
that
Crabbe
had
aimed
to
kill
wiped
all
else
from
his
mind
he
shot
a
Stunning
Spell
at
Crabbe
who
lurched
out
of
the
way
knocking
Malfoys
wand
out
of
his
hand
it
rolled
out
of
sight
beneath
a
mountain
of
broken
furniture
and
bones
dont
kill
him
dont
kill
him
malfoy
yelled
at
Crabbe
and
Goyle
who
were
both
aiming
at
Harry
Their
split
seconds
hesitation
was
all
Harry
needed
expelliarmus
goyles
wand
flew
out
of
his
hand
and
disappeared
into
the
bulwark
of
objects
beside
him
Goyle
leapt
foolishly
on
the
spot
trying
to
retrieve
it
Malfoy
jumped
out
of
range
of
Hermiones
second
Stunning
Spell
and
Ron
appearing
suddenly
at
the
end
of
the
aisle
shot
a
full
Body-Bind
Curse
at
Crabbe
which
narrowly
missed
crabbe
wheeled
around
and
screamed
Avada
Kedavra
again
ron
leapt
out
of
sight
to
avoid
the
jet
of
green
light
the
wand-less
Malfoy
cowered
behind
a
three-legged
wardrobe
as
Hermione
charged
toward
them
hitting
Goyle
with
a
Stunning
Spell
as
she
came
its
somewhere
here
harry
yelled
at
her
pointing
at
the
pile
of
junk
into
which
the
old
tiara
had
fallen
look
for
it
while
I
go
and
help
R
harry
she
screamed
a
roaring
billowing
noise
behind
him
gave
him
a
moments
warning
he
turned
and
saw
both
Ron
and
Crabbe
running
as
hard
as
they
could
up
the
aisle
toward
them
like
it
hot
scum
roared
Crabbe
as
he
ran
but
he
seemed
to
have
no
control
over
what
he
had
done
flames
of
abnormal
size
were
pursuing
them
licking
up
the
sides
of
the
junk
bulwarks
which
were
crumbling
to
soot
at
their
touch
aguamenti
harry
bawled
but
the
jet
of
water
that
soared
from
the
tip
of
his
wand
evaporated
in
the
air
run
malfoy
grabbed
the
Stunned
Goyle
and
dragged
him
along
Crabbe
outstripped
all
of
them
now
looking
terrified
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
pelted
along
in
his
wake
and
the
fire
pursued
them
it
was
not
normal
fire
Crabbe
had
used
a
curse
of
which
Harry
had
no
knowledge
as
they
turned
a
corner
the
flames
chased
them
as
though
they
were
alive
sentient
intent
upon
killing
them
now
the
fire
was
mutating
forming
a
gigantic
pack
of
fiery
beasts
Flaming
serpents
chimaeras
and
dragons
rose
and
fell
and
rose
again
and
the
detritus
of
centuries
on
which
they
were
feeding
was
thrown
up
into
the
air
into
their
fanged
mouths
tossed
high
on
clawed
feet
before
being
consumed
by
the
inferno
malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
had
vanished
from
view
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
stopped
dead
the
fiery
monsters
were
circling
them
drawing
closer
and
closer
claws
and
horns
and
tails
lashed
and
the
heat
was
solid
as
a
wall
around
them
what
can
we
do
hermione
screamed
over
the
deafening
roars
of
the
fire
what
can
we
do
here
harry
seized
a
pair
of
heavy-looking
broomsticks
from
the
nearest
pile
of
junk
and
threw
one
to
Ron
who
pulled
Hermione
onto
it
behind
him
harry
swung
his
leg
over
the
second
broom
and
with
hard
kicks
to
the
ground
they
soared
up
in
the
air
missing
by
feet
the
horned
beak
of
a
flaming
raptor
that
snapped
its
jaws
at
them
the
smoke
and
heat
were
becoming
overwhelming
Below
them
the
cursed
fire
was
consuming
the
contraband
of
generations
of
hunted
students
the
guilty
outcomes
of
a
thousand
banned
experiments
the
secrets
of
the
countless
souls
who
had
sought
refuge
in
the
room
harry
couldnot
see
a
trace
of
Malfoy
Crabbe
or
Goyle
anywhere
he
swooped
as
low
as
he
dare
over
the
marauding
monsters
of
flame
to
try
to
find
them
but
there
was
nothing
but
fire
What
a
terrible
way
to
die
he
had
never
wanted
this
harry
lets
get
out
lets
get
out
bellowed
Ron
though
it
was
impossible
to
see
where
the
door
was
through
the
black
smoke
and
then
Harry
heard
a
thin
piteous
human
scream
from
amidst
the
terrible
commotion
the
thunder
of
devouring
flame
its
too
dangerous
ron
yelled
but
Harry
wheeled
in
the
air
his
glasses
giving
his
eyes
some
small
protection
from
the
smoke
he
raked
the
firestorm
below
seeking
a
sign
of
life
a
limb
or
a
face
that
was
not
yet
charred
like
wood
and
he
saw
them
Malfoy
with
his
arms
around
the
unconscious
Goyle
the
pair
of
them
perched
on
a
fragile
tower
of
charred
desks
and
Harry
dived
malfoy
saw
him
coming
and
raised
one
arm
but
even
as
Harry
grasped
it
he
knew
at
once
that
it
was
no
good
goyle
was
too
heavy
and
Malfoys
hand
covered
in
sweat
slid
instantly
out
of
Harrys
if
we
die
for
them
ill
kill
you
harry
roared
Rons
voice
and
as
a
great
flaming
chimaera
bore
down
upon
them
he
and
Hermione
dragged
Goyle
onto
their
broom
and
rose
rolling
and
pitching
into
the
air
once
more
as
Malfoy
clambered
up
behind
Harry
the
door
get
to
the
door
the
door
screamed
Malfoy
in
Harrys
ear
and
Harry
sped
up
following
Ron
Hermione
and
Goyle
through
the
billowing
black
smoke
hardly
able
to
breathe
and
all
around
them
the
last
few
objects
unburned
by
the
devouring
flames
were
flung
into
the
air
as
the
creatures
of
the
cursed
fire
cast
them
high
in
celebration
cups
and
shields
a
sparkling
necklace
and
an
old
discolored
tiara
what
are
you
doing
what
are
you
doing
the
doors
that
way
screamed
Malfoy
but
Harry
made
a
hairpin
swerve
and
dived
the
diadem
seemed
to
fall
in
slow
motion
turning
and
glittering
as
it
dropped
toward
the
maw
of
a
yawning
serpent
and
then
he
had
it
caught
it
around
his
wrist
harry
swerved
again
as
the
serpent
lunged
at
him
he
soared
upward
and
straight
toward
the
place
where
he
prayed
the
door
stood
open
Ron
Hermione
and
Goyle
had
vanished
Malfoy
was
screaming
and
holding
Harry
so
tightly
it
hurt
then
through
the
smoke
Harry
saw
a
rectangular
patch
on
the
wall
and
steered
the
broom
at
it
and
moments
later
clean
air
filled
his
lungs
and
they
collided
with
the
wall
in
the
corridor
beyond
malfoy
fell
off
the
broom
and
lay
facedown
gasping
coughing
and
retching
harry
rolled
over
and
sat
up
The
door
to
the
Room
of
Requirement
had
vanished
and
Ron
and
Hermione
sat
panting
on
the
floor
beside
Goyle
who
was
still
unconscious
c-Crabbe
choked
Malfoy
as
soon
as
he
could
speak
c-Crabbe
hes
dead
said
Ron
harshly
there
was
silence
apart
from
panting
and
coughing
then
a
number
of
huge
bangs
shook
the
castle
and
a
great
cavalcade
of
transparent
figures
galloped
past
on
horses
their
heads
screaming
with
bloodlust
under
their
arms
harry
staggered
to
his
feet
when
the
Headless
Hunt
had
passed
and
looked
around
The
battle
was
still
going
on
all
around
him
he
could
hear
more
scream
than
those
of
the
retreating
ghosts
panic
flared
within
him
wheres
Ginny
he
said
sharply
she
was
here
she
was
supposed
to
be
going
back
into
the
Room
of
Requirement
blimey
dyou
reckon
itll
still
work
after
that
fire
asked
Ron
but
he
too
got
to
his
feet
rubbing
his
chest
and
looking
left
and
right
shall
we
split
up
and
look
no
said
Hermione
getting
to
her
feet
too
malfoy
and
Goyle
remained
slumped
hopelessly
on
the
corridor
floor
neither
of
them
had
wands
lets
stick
together
i
say
we
go
Harry
whats
that
on
your
arm
what
oh
yeah
he
pulled
the
diadem
from
his
wrist
and
held
it
up
it
was
still
hot
blackened
with
soot
but
as
he
looked
at
it
closely
he
was
just
able
to
make
out
the
tiny
words
etched
upon
it
wit
beyond
measure
is
mans
greatest
treasure
a
bloodlike
substance
dark
and
tarry
seemed
to
be
leaking
from
the
diadem
suddenly
Harry
felt
the
thing
vibrate
violently
then
break
apart
in
his
hands
and
as
it
did
so
he
thought
he
heard
the
faintest
most
distant
scream
of
pain
echoing
not
from
the
grounds
or
the
castle
but
from
the
thing
that
had
just
fragmented
in
his
fingers
it
must
have
been
Fiendfyre
whimpered
Hermione
her
eyes
on
the
broken
piece
sorry
fiendfyre
cursed
fire
its
one
of
the
substances
that
destroy
Horcruxes
but
I
would
never
ever
have
dared
use
it
its
so
dangerous
how
did
Crabbe
know
how
to
mustve
learned
from
the
Carrows
said
Harry
grimly
shame
he
wasnt
concentrating
when
they
mentioned
how
to
stop
it
really
said
Ron
whose
hair
like
Hermiones
was
singed
and
whose
face
was
blackened
if
he
hadnt
tried
to
kill
us
all
Id
be
quite
sorry
he
was
dead
but
dont
you
realize
whispered
Hermione
this
means
if
we
can
just
get
the
snake
but
she
broke
off
as
yells
and
shouts
and
the
unmistakable
noises
of
dueling
filled
the
corridor
harry
looked
around
and
his
heart
seemed
to
fail
Death
Eaters
had
penetrated
Hogwarts
fred
and
Percy
had
just
backed
into
view
both
of
them
dueling
masked
and
hooded
men
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
ran
forward
to
help
Jets
of
light
flew
in
every
direction
and
the
man
dueling
Percy
backed
off
fast
Then
his
hood
slipped
and
they
saw
a
high
forehead
and
streaked
hair
hello
Minister
bellowed
Percy
sending
a
neat
jinx
straight
at
Thicknesse
who
dropped
his
wand
and
clawed
at
the
front
of
his
robes
apparently
in
awful
discomfort
did
I
mention
Im
resigning
youre
joking
Perce
shouted
Fred
as
the
Death
Eater
he
was
battling
collapsed
under
the
weight
of
three
separate
Stunning
Spells
thicknesse
had
fallen
to
the
ground
with
tiny
spikes
erupting
all
over
him
he
seemed
to
be
turning
into
some
form
of
sea
urchin
fred
looked
at
Percy
with
glee
you
actually
are
joking
Perce
i
dont
think
Ive
heard
you
joke
since
you
were
the
air
exploded
they
had
been
grouped
together
Harry
Ron
Hermione
Fred
and
Percy
the
two
Death
Eaters
at
their
feet
one
Stunned
the
other
Transfigured
and
in
that
fragment
of
a
moment
when
danger
seemed
temporarily
at
bay
the
world
was
rent
apart
Harry
felt
himself
flying
through
the
air
and
all
he
could
do
was
hold
as
tightly
as
possible
to
that
thin
stick
of
wood
that
was
his
one
and
only
weapon
and
shield
his
head
in
his
arms
He
heard
the
screams
and
yells
of
his
companions
without
a
hope
of
knowing
what
had
happened
to
them
and
then
the
world
resolved
itself
into
pain
and
semidarkness
He
was
half
buried
in
the
wreckage
of
a
corridor
that
had
been
subjected
to
a
terrible
attack
cold
air
told
him
that
the
side
of
the
castle
had
been
blown
away
and
hot
stickiness
on
his
cheek
told
him
that
he
was
bleeding
copiously
then
he
heard
a
terrible
cry
that
pulled
at
his
insides
that
expressed
agony
of
a
kind
neither
flame
nor
curse
could
cause
and
he
stood
up
swaying
more
frightened
than
he
had
been
that
day
more
frightened
perhaps
than
he
had
been
in
his
life
and
Hermione
was
struggling
to
her
feet
in
the
wreckage
and
three
redheaded
men
were
grouped
on
the
ground
where
the
wall
had
blasted
apart
harry
grabbed
Hermiones
hand
as
they
staggered
and
stumbled
over
stone
and
wood
no
no
no
someone
was
shouting
no
fred
no
and
Percy
was
shaking
his
brother
and
Ron
was
kneeling
beside
them
and
Freds
eyes
stared
without
seeing
the
ghost
of
his
last
laugh
still
etched
upon
his
face
chapter
Thirty-Two
the
Elder
Wand
the
world
had
ended
so
why
had
the
battle
not
ceased
the
castle
fallen
silent
in
horror
and
every
combatant
laid
down
their
arms
harry's
mind
was
in
free
fall
spinning
out
of
control
unable
to
grasp
the
impossibility
because
Fred
Weasley
could
not
be
dead
the
evidence
of
all
his
senses
must
be
lying
And
then
a
body
fell
past
the
hole
blown
into
the
side
of
the
school
and
curses
flew
in
at
them
from
the
darkness
hitting
the
wall
behind
their
heads
get
down
harry
shouted
as
more
curses
flew
through
the
night
He
and
Ron
had
both
grabbed
Hermione
and
pulled
her
to
the
floor
but
Percy
lay
across
fred's
body
shielding
it
from
further
harrm
and
when
Harry
shouted
Percy
come
on
we've
got
to
move
he
shook
his
head
percy
harry
saw
tear
tracks
streaking
the
grime
coating
ron's
face
as
he
sezied
his
elder
brother's
shoulders
and
pulled
but
Percy
would
not
budge
percy
you
can't
do
anything
for
him
we're
going
to
Hermione
screamed
and
Harry
turning
did
not
need
to
ask
why
a
monstrous
spider
the
size
of
a
small
car
was
trying
to
climb
through
the
huge
hole
in
the
wall
one
of
aragog's
descendants
had
joined
the
fight
ron
and
Harry
shouted
together
their
spells
collided
and
the
monster
was
blown
backward
its
legs
jerking
horribly
and
vanished
into
the
darkness
it
brought
friends
harry
called
to
the
others
glancing
over
the
edge
of
the
castle
through
the
hole
in
the
wall
the
curses
had
blasted
more
giant
spiders
were
climbing
the
side
of
the
building
liberated
from
the
Forbidden
Forest
into
which
the
Death
Eaters
must
have
penetrated
harry
fired
Stunning
Spells
down
upon
them
knocking
the
lead
monster
into
its
fellows
so
that
they
rolled
back
down
the
building
and
out
of
sight
then
more
curses
came
soaring
over
harry's
head
so
close
he
felt
the
force
of
them
blow
his
hair
let's
move
now
pushing
Hermione
ahead
of
him
with
ron
Harry
stooped
to
seize
fred's
body
under
the
armpit
percy
realizing
what
Harry
was
trying
to
do
stopped
clinging
to
the
body
and
helped
together
crouching
low
to
avoid
the
curses
flying
at
them
from
the
grounds
they
hauled
Fred
out
of
the
way
here
said
Harry
and
they
placed
him
in
a
niche
where
a
suit
of
armor
had
stood
earlier
he
could
not
bear
to
look
at
Fred
a
second
longer
than
he
had
to
and
after
making
sure
that
the
body
was
well
hidden
he
took
off
after
ron
and
Hermione
malfoy
and
Goyle
had
vanished
but
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
which
was
now
full
of
dust
and
falling
masonry
glass
long
gone
from
windows
he
saw
many
people
running
backward
and
forward
whether
friends
or
foes
he
could
not
tell
rounding
the
corner
Percy
let
out
a
bull-like
roar
rookwood
and
sprinted
off
in
the
direction
of
a
tall
man
who
was
pursuing
a
couple
of
students
harry
in
here
hermione
screamed
she
had
pulled
Ron
behind
a
tapestry
they
seemed
to
be
wrestling
together
and
for
one
mad
second
Harry
thought
that
they
were
embracing
again
then
hhe
saw
that
Hermione
was
trying
to
restrain
Ron
to
stop
him
running
after
Percy
listen
to
melisten
ron
i
wanna
helpi
wanna
kill
Death
Eaters
His
face
was
contorted
smeared
with
dust
and
smoke
and
he
was
shaking
with
rage
and
grief
ron
we're
the
only
ones
who
can
end
it
pleaseronwe
need
the
snake
we've
got
to
kill
the
snake
said
Hermione
but
Harry
knew
how
Ron
felt
Pursuing
another
Horcrux
could
not
bring
the
satisfaction
of
revenge
he
too
wanted
to
fight
to
punish
them
the
people
who
had
killed
Fred
and
he
wanted
to
find
the
other
Weasleys
and
above
all
make
sure
make
quite
sure
that
Ginny
was
notbut
he
could
not
permit
that
idea
to
form
in
his
mind
We
will
fight
hermione
said
we'll
have
to
to
reach
the
snake
but
let's
not
lose
sight
now
of
what
we're
supposed
to
be
d-doing
we're
the
only
ones
who
can
end
it
she
was
crying
too
and
she
wiped
her
face
on
her
torn
and
singed
sleeve
as
she
spoke
but
she
took
great
heaving
breaths
to
calm
herself
as
still
keeping
a
tight
hold
on
ron
she
turned
to
Harry
you
need
to
find
out
where
Voldemort
is
because
he'll
have
the
snake
with
him
won't
he
do
it
Harrylook
inside
him
why
was
it
so
easy
because
his
scar
had
been
burning
for
hours
yearning
to
show
him
voldemort's
thoughts
he
closed
his
eyes
on
her
command
and
at
once
the
screams
and
bangs
and
all
the
discordant
sounds
of
the
battle
were
drowned
until
they
became
distant
as
though
he
stood
far
far
away
from
them
he
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
a
desolate
but
strangely
familiar
room
with
peeling
paper
on
the
walls
and
all
the
windows
boarded
up
except
for
one
the
sounds
of
the
assault
on
the
castle
were
muffled
and
distant
the
single
unblocked
window
revealed
distant
bursts
of
light
where
the
castle
stood
but
inside
the
room
was
dark
except
for
a
solitary
oil
lamp
he
was
rolling
his
wand
between
his
figners
watching
it
his
thoughts
on
the
room
in
the
castle
the
secret
room
only
he
had
ever
found
the
room
like
the
chamber
that
you
had
to
be
clever
and
cunning
and
inquisitive
to
discover
he
was
confident
that
the
boy
would
not
find
the
diadem
although
dumbledore's
puppet
had
come
much
farther
than
he
ever
expected
too
far
my
Lord
said
a
voice
desperate
and
cracked
he
turned
there
was
Lucius
Malfoy
sitting
in
the
darkest
corner
ragged
and
still
bearing
the
marks
of
the
punishment
he
had
received
after
the
boy's
last
escape
one
of
his
eyes
remained
closed
and
puffy
my
Lord
please
my
son
if
your
son
is
dead
Lucius
it
is
not
my
fault
he
did
not
come
and
join
me
like
the
rest
of
the
Slytherins
perhaps
he
has
decided
to
befriend
Harry
Potter
nonever
whispered
Malfoy
you
must
hope
not
aren'taren't
you
afraid
my
Lord
that
Potter
might
die
at
another
hand
but
yours
asked
Malfoy
his
voice
shaking
wouldn't
it
be
forgive
me
more
prudent
to
call
off
this
battle
enter
the
castle
and
seek
him
y-yourself
do
not
pretend
Lucius
you
wish
the
battle
to
cease
so
that
you
can
discover
what
has
happened
to
your
son
and
i
do
not
need
to
seek
Potter
before
the
night
is
out
Potter
will
have
come
to
find
me
voldemort
dropped
his
gaze
once
more
to
the
wand
in
his
fingers
it
troubled
him
and
those
things
that
troubled
Lord
Voldemort
needed
to
be
rearranged
go
and
fetch
Snape
snape
m-my
Lord
snape
now
i
need
him
there
is
a
servicei
require
from
him
go.
Frightened
stumbling
a
little
through
the
gloom
Lucius
left
the
room
vodlemort
continued
to
stand
there
twirling
the
wand
between
his
fingers
staring
at
it
it
is
the
only
way
Nagini
he
whispered
and
he
looked
around
and
there
was
the
great
thick
snake
now
suspended
in
midair
twisting
gracefully
within
the
enchanted
protected
space
he
had
made
for
her
a
starry
transparent
sphere
somewhere
between
a
glittering
cage
and
a
tank
with
a
gasp
Harry
pulled
back
and
opened
his
yees
at
the
same
moment
his
ears
were
assaulted
with
the
screeches
and
cries
the
smashes
and
bangs
of
battle
he's
in
the
Shrieking
Shack
the
snake's
with
him
it's
got
some
sort
of
magical
protection
around
it
he's
just
sent
Lucius
Malfoy
to
find
Snape
voldemort's
sitting
in
the
shrieking
Shack
said
Hermione
outraged
he's
nothe's
not
even
fighting
he
doesn't
think
he
needs
to
fight
said
Harry
he
thinks
i'm
going
to
go
to
him
but
why
he
knows
i'm
after
horcruxeshe's
keeping
Nagini
close
beside
him
obviously
i'm
going
to
have
to
go
to
him
to
get
near
the
thing
Right
said
Ron
squaring
his
shoulders
so
you
can't
go
that's
what
he
wants
what
he's
expecting
you
stay
here
and
look
after
Hermione
and
i'll
go
and
get
it
Harry
cut
across
Ron
you
two
stay
here
i'll
go
under
the
Cloak
and
i'll
be
back
as
soon
as
I
No
said
Hermione
it
makes
much
more
sense
if
I
take
the
Cloak
and
don't
even
think
about
it
Ron
snarled
at
her
before
Hermione
could
get
farther
than
Ron
i'm
just
as
capable
the
tapestry
at
the
top
of
the
staircase
on
which
they
stood
was
ripped
open
potter
two
masked
Death
Eaters
stood
there
but
even
before
their
wands
were
fully
raised
Hermione
shouted
Glisseo
the
stairs
beneath
their
feet
flatteneed
into
a
chute
and
she
Harry
and
Ron
hurtled
down
it
unable
to
control
their
speed
but
so
fast
that
the
Death
Eaters
Stunning
Spells
flew
far
over
their
heads
they
shot
through
the
concealing
tapestry
at
the
bottom
and
spun
onto
the
floor
hitting
the
opposite
wall
duro
cried
Hermione
pointing
her
wand
at
the
tapestry
and
there
were
two
loud
sickening
crunches
as
the
tapestry
turned
to
stone
and
the
Death
Eaters
pursuing
them
crumpled
against
it
get
back
shouted
Ron
and
he
Harry
and
Hermione
hurled
themselves
against
a
door
as
a
herd
of
galloping
desks
thundered
past
shepherdd
by
a
sprinting
Professor
McGonagall
she
appeared
not
to
notice
them
her
hair
had
come
down
and
there
was
a
gash
on
her
cheek
as
she
turned
the
corner
they
heard
her
scream
charge
harry
you
get
the
Cloak
on
said
Hermione
never
mind
us
But
he
threw
it
over
all
three
of
them
large
though
they
were
he
doubted
anyone
would
see
their
disembodied
feet
through
the
dust
that
clogged
the
air
the
falling
stone
the
shimmer
of
spells
they
ran
down
the
next
staircase
and
found
themselves
in
a
corridor
full
of
duelers
the
portraits
on
either
side
of
the
fighters
were
crammed
with
figures
screaming
advice
and
encouragement
while
Death
Eaters
both
masked
and
unmasked
dueled
students
and
teachers
dean
had
won
himself
a
wand
for
he
was
face-to-face
with
Dolohov
Parvati
with
Travers
harry
ron
and
Hermione
raised
their
wands
at
once
ready
to
strike
but
the
duelers
were
weaving
and
darting
so
much
that
there
was
a
strong
likelihood
of
hurting
on
of
their
own
side
if
they
cast
curses
even
as
they
stood
braced
looking
for
the
opportunity
to
act
there
came
a
great
Wheeeeee
and
looking
up
Harry
saw
Peeves
zoomign
over
them
dropping
Snargaluff
pods
down
onto
the
Death
Eaters
whose
heads
were
suddenly
engulfed
in
wriggling
green
tubers
like
fat
worms
argh
a
fistful
of
tubers
had
hit
the
Cloak
over
ron's
head
the
damp
green
roots
were
suspended
improbably
in
midair
as
Ron
tried
to
shake
them
loose
someone's
invisible
there
shouted
a
masked
Death
Eater
pointing
dean
made
the
most
of
the
Death
eater's
momentary
distraction
knocking
him
out
with
a
stunning
Spell
Dolohov
attempted
to
retaliate
and
Parvati
shot
a
Body
Bind
Curse
at
him
let's
go
harry
yelled
and
he
Ron
and
Hermione
gathered
the
Cloak
tightly
around
themselves
and
pelted
heads
down
through
the
midst
of
the
fighters
slipping
a
little
in
pools
of
Snargaluff
juice
toward
the
top
of
the
marble
staircase
into
the
entrance

the

as
they
passed

looked
around
beaming
for
his

and
Ron
punched
him
from
under
the
Cloak
malfoy
fell
backward
on
top
of
the
Death
Eater
his
mouth
bleeding
utterly
bemused
and
that's
the
second
time
we've
saved
your
life
tonight
you

faced

ron
yelled
there
were
more
duelers
all
over
the
stairs
and
in
the
hall
death
Eaters
everywhere
Harry
looked
Yaxley
close
to
the
front
doors
in
combat
with
Flitwick
a
masked
Death
Eater
dueling
Kingsley
right
beside
them
students
ran
in
every
direction
some
carrying
or
dragging
injured
friends
harry
directed
a
Stunnning
Spell
toward
the
masked
Death
Eater
it
missed
but
nearly
hit
Neville
who
had
emerged
from
nowhere
brandishing
armfuls
of
Venomous
Tentacula
which
looped
itself
happily
around
the
nearest
Death
Eater
and
began
reeling
him
in
harry
Ron
and
Hermione
sped
won
the
marble
staircase
glass
shattered
on
the
left
and
the
Slytherin
hourglass
that
had
recorded
House
points
spilled
its
emeralds
everywhere
so
that
people
slipped
and
staggered
as
they
ran
two
bodies
fell
from
the
balcony
overhead
as
they
reached
the
ground
a
gray
blur
that
Harry
took
for
an
animal
sped
four-legged
across
the
hall
to
sink
its
teeth
into
one
of
the
fallen
no
shrieked
Hermione
and
with
a
deafening
blast
from
her
wand
Fenrir
Greyback
was
thrown
backward
from
the
feebly
struggling
body
of
Lavender
Brown
he
hit
the
marble
banisters
and
struggled
to
return
to
his
feet
then
with
a
bright
white
flash
and
a
crack
a
crystal
ball
fell
on
top
of
his
head
and
he
crumpled
to
the
ground
and
did
not
move
i
have
more
shrieked
Professor
Trelawney
from
over
the
banisters
more
for
any
who
want
them
here
And
with
a
move
likea
tennis
serve
she
heaved
another
enormous
crystal
sphere
from
her
bag
waved
her
wand
through
the
air
and
caused
the
ball
to
speed
across
the
hall
and
smash
through
a
window
at
the
same
moment
the
heavy
wooden
front
doors
burst
open
and
more
of
the
gigantic
spiders
forced
their
way
into
the
front
hall
screams
of
terror
rent
the
air
the
fighters
scattered
Death
Eaters
and
Hogwartians
alike
and
red
and
green
jets
of
light
flew
into
the
midst
of
the
oncoming
monsters
which
shuddered
and
reared
more
terrifying
than
ever
how
do
we
get
out
yelled
ron
over
all
the
screaming
but
before
either
Harry
or
Hermione
could
answer
they
were
bowled
aside
Hagrid
had
come
thundering
down
the
stairs
brandishing
his
flowery
pink
umbrella
don't
hurt
em
don't
hurt
em
he
yelled
hagrid
no
harry
forgot
everything
else
he
sprinted
out
from
under
the
cloak
running
bent
double
to
avoid
the
curses
illuminating
the
whole
hall
hagrid
come
back
but
he
was
not
even
halfway
to
Hagrid
when
he
saw
it
happen
Hagrid
vanished
amongst
the
spiders
and
with
a
great
scurrying
a
foul
swarming
movement
they
retreated
under
the
onslaught
of
spells
Hagrid
buried
in
their
midst
hagrid
harry
heard
someone
calling
his
own
name
whether
friend
or
foe
he
did
not
care
He
was
springint
down
the
front
steps
into
the
dark
grounds
and
the
spiders
were
swarming
away
with
their
prey
and
he
could
see
nothing
of
Hagrid
at
all
hagrid
he
thought
he
could
make
out
an
enormous
arm
waving
from
the
mdist
of
the
spider
swarm
but
as
he
made
to
chase
after
them
his
way
was
impeded
by
a
monumental
foot
which
swung
down
out
of
the
darkness
and
made
the
ground
on
which
he
stood
shudder
he
looked
up
A
giant
stood
before
him
twenty
feet
high
its
head
ihidden
in
shadow
nothing
but
its
treelike
hairy
shins
illuminated
by
light
from
the
castle
doors
with
one
brutal
fluid
movement
it
smashed
a
massive
fist
through
an
upper
window
and
glass
rained
down
upon
Harryk
forcing
him
back
under
the
shelter
of
the
doorway
oh
my
shrieked
Hermione
as
she
and
ron
caught
up
with
Harry
and
gazed
upward
at
the
giant
now
trying
to
seize
people
through
the
window
above
don't
ron
yelled
grabbing
hermione's
hand
as
she
raised
her
wand
stun
him
and
he'll
crush
half
the
castle
hagger
grawp
came
lurching
around
the
corner
of
the
castle
only
dnow
did
Harry
realzie
that
Grawp
was
indeed
an
undersized
giant
the
gargantuan
monster
trying
to
crush
people
on
the
upper
floors
turned
around
and
let
out
a
rorar
the
stone
steps
tremebled
as
he
stomped
toward
his
smaller
kin
and
grawp's
lopsided
mouth
fell
open
showing
yellow
half
brick-sized
teeth
and
then
they
launched
themselves
at
each
other
with
the
savagery
of
lions
run
harry
roared
the
ngiht
was
full
of
hideous
yells
and
blows
as
the
giants
wrestled
and
he
seized
hermione's
hand
and
tore
down
the
steps
into
the
grounds
Ron
bringing
up
the
rear
harry
had
not
lost
hope
of
finding
and
saving
Hagrid
he
ran
so
fast
that
they
were
halfway
toward
the
forest
before
they
were
brought
up
short
again
the
air
around
them
had
frozen
harry's
breath
caught
and
solidified
in
his
chest
shapes
moved
out
in
the
darkness
swirling
figures
of
concentrated
blackness
moving
in
a
great
wave
towards
the
castles
their
faces
hooded
and
their
breath
rattling
ron
and
Hermione
closed
in
beside
him
as
the
sounds
of
fighting
behind
them
grew
suddenly
muted
deadened
because
a
silence
only
dementors
could
bring
was
falling
thickly
through
the
night
and
Fred
was
gone
and
Hagrid
was
suurely
dying
or
already
dead
come
on
Harry
said
hermione's
voice
from
a
very
long
way
away
patronuses
Harry
come
on
he
raised
his
wand
but
a
dull
hopelessness
was
spreading
throughout
him
How
many
more
lay
dead
that
he
did
not
yet
know
about
he
felt
as
though
his
soul
had
already
half
left
his
body
harry
come
on
screamed
Hermione
a
hundred
dementors
were
advancing
gliding
toward
them
sucking
their
way
closer
to
harry's
despair
which
was
like
a
promise
of
a
feast
he
saw
ron's
silver
terrier
burst
into
the
air
flicker
feebly
and
expire
he
saw
hermione's
otter
twist
in
midair
and
fade
and
his
own
wand
trembled
in
his
hand
and
he
almost
welcomed
the
oncoming
oblivion
the
promise
of
nothing
of
no
feeling
and
then
a
silver
hare
a
boar
and
fox
soared
past
Harry
Ron
and
hermione's
heads
the
dementors
fell
back
before
the
creatures
approach
three
more
people
had
arrived
out
of
the
darkness
to
stand
beside
them
their
wands
outstretched
continuing
to
cast
Patronuses
Luna
Ernie
and
Seamus
that's
right
said
Luna
encouragingly
as
if
they
were
back
in
the
Room
of
Requirement
and
this
was
simply
spell
practice
for
the
D
a.
that's
right
Harry
come
on
think
of
something
happy
something
happy
he
said
his
voice
cracked
we're
all
still
here
she
whispered
were
still
fighting
come
on
now
there
was
a
silver
spark
then
a
wavering
light
and
then
with
the
greatest
effort
it
had
ever
cost
him
the
stag
burst
from
the
end
of
harry's
wand
it
cantered
forward
and
now
the
dementors
scattered
in
earnest
and
immediately
the
night
was
mild
again
but
the
sounds
of
the
surrounding
battle
were
loud
in
his
ears
can't
thank
you
enough
said
ron
shakily
turning
to
Luna
Ernie
and
Seamus
you
just
saved
With
a
roar
and
an
earth-quaking
tremor
another
giant
came
lurching
out
of
the
darkness
from
the
direction
of
the
forest
brandishing
a
club
taller
than
any
of
them
run
harry
shouted
again
but
the
others
needed
no
telling
They
all
scattered
and
not
a
second
too
soon
for
the
next
moment
the
creature's
vast
foot
had
fallen
exactly
where
they
had
been
standing
harry
looked
round
ron
and
Hermione
were
following
him
but
the
other
three
had
vanished
back
into
the
battle
let's
get
out
of
range
yelled
Ron
as
the
giant
swung
its
club
again
and
its
bellows
echoed
through
the
night
across
the
grounds
wehere
bursts
of
red
and
green
light
continued
to
illuminate
the
darkness
the
Whomping
willow
said
Harry
go
somehow
he
walled
it
all
up
in
his
mind
crammed
it
into
a
small
space
into
which
he
could
not
look
now
thoughts
of
Fred
and
Hagrid
and
his
terror
for
all
the
people
he
loved
scattered
in
and
outside
the
castle
must
all
wait
because
they
had
to
run
had
to
reach
the
snake
and
Voldemort
because
that
was
as
Hermione
said
the
only
way
to
end
it
He
sprinted
half-believing
he
could
outdistance
death
itself
ignoring
the
jets
of
light
flying
in
the
darkness
all
around
him
and
the
sound
of
hte
lake
crashing
like
the
sea
and
the
creaking
of
the
Forbidden
Forest
though
the
night
was
windless
through
grounds
that
seemed
themselves
to
have
risen
in
rebellion
he
ran
faster
than
he
had
ever
moved
in
his
life
and
it
was
he
who
saw
the
great
tree
first
the
Willow
that
protected
the
secret
at
its
roots
with
whiplike
slashing
branches
panting
and
gasping
Harry
slowed
down
skirting
the
willow's
swiping
branches
peering
through
the
darkness
toward
its
tick
trunk
trying
to
see
the
single
knot
in
the
bark
of
the
old
tree
that
would
paralyze
it
ron
and
Hermione
caught
up
Hermione
so
out
of
breath
that
she
could
not
speak
howhow're
we
going
to
get
in
panted
ron
i
cansee

again
Crookshanks
wheezed
Hermione
bent
double
clutching
her
chest
are
you
a
wizard
or
what
ohrightyeah
Ron
looked
around
then
directed
his
wand
at
a
twig
on
the
ground
and
said
Winguardium
Leviosa
the
twig
flew
up
from
the
gruond
spun
through
the
air
as
if
caught
by
a
gust
of
wind
then
zoomed
directly
at
the
trunk
through
the
willow's
ominously
swaying
branches
it
jabbed
at
a
place
near
the
roots
and
at
once
the
writhing
tree
became
still
perfect
panted
Hermione
wait
for
one
teetering
second
while
the
crashes
and
booms
of
the
battle
filled
the
air
Harry
hesitated
voldemort
wanted
him
to
do
this
wanted
him
to
come
was
he
leading
Ron
and
Hermione
into
a
trap
but
the
reality
seemed
to
close
upon
him
cruel
and
plain
the
only
way
forward
was
to
kill
the
snake
and
the
snake
was
where
Voldemort
was
and
voldemort
was
at
the
end
of
this
tunnel
harry
we're
coming
just
get
in
there
said
Ron
pushing
him
forward
harry
wriggled
into
the
earthy
passage
hidden
in
the
tree's
roots
it
was
a
much
tighter
squeeze
than
it
had
been
the
last
time
they
had
entered
it
the
tunnel
was
low-ceilinged
they
had
had
to
double
up
to
move
throuhgh
it
nearly
four
years
previously
now
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
crawl
harry
went
first
his
wand
illuminated
expecting
at
any
moment
to
meet
barriers
but
none
came
they
moved
in
silence
harry's
gaze
fixed
upon
the
swinging
beam
of
the
wand
held
in
his
fist
at
last
the
tunnel
began
to
slope
upward
and
Harry
saw
a
sliver
of
light
ahead
hermione
tugged
at
his
ankle
the
Cloak
she
whispered
put
the
Cloak
on
he
groped
behind
him
and
she
forced
the
bundle
of
slippery
cloth
into
his
free
hand
with
difficulty
he
dragged
it
over
himself
murmered
Nox
extinguishing
his
wandlight
and
continued
on
his
hands
and
knees
as
silently
as
possible
all
his
senses
straining
expecting
every
second
to
be
discovered
to
hear
a
cold
clear
voice
see
a
flash
of
green
light
and
then
he
heard
voices
coming
from
the
room
directly
ahead
of
them
only
slightly
muffled
by
the
fact
that
the
opening
at
the
endo
fht
etuunnel
had
been
blocked
up
by
what
looked
like
an
old
crate
hardly
daring
to
breathe
Harry
edged
right
up
tot
he
opening
and
peered
through
a
tiny
gap
left
between
crate
and
wall
the
room
beyond
was
dimly
lit
but
he
could
see
Nagini
swirlign
and
coiling
like
a
serpent
underwater
safe
in
her
enchanted
starry
sphere
which
floated
unsupported
in
midair
he
could
see
the
edge
of
a
table
and
a
long-fingered
white
hand
toying
with
a
wand
then
Snape
spoke
and
harry's
heart
lurched
Snape
was
inches
away
from
where
he
crouched
hidden
my
Lord
their
resistance
is
crumbling
and
it
is
doing
so
without
your
help
said
Voldemort
in
his
high
clear
voice
skilled
wizard
though
you
are
Severus
I
do
not
think
you
will
make
much
difference
now
we
are
almost
there
almost
let
me
find
the
boy
let
me
bring
you
Potter
i
know
I
can
find
him
my
Lord
please
snape
strode
past
the
gap
and
Harry
drew
back
a
little
keeping
his
eyes
fixed
upon
Nagini
wondering
whether
there
was
any
spell
that
might
penetrate
the
protection
surrounding
her
but
he
could
not
think
of
anything
one
failed
attempt
and
he
would
give
away
his
position
voldemort
stood
up
harry
could
see
him
now
see
the
red
eyes
the
flattened
serpentine
face
the
pallor
of
him
gleaming
slightly
in
the
semidarkness
i
have
a
problem
Severus
said
Voldemort
softly
my
Lord
said
Snape
voldemort
raised
the
Elder
Wand
holding
it
as
delicately
and
precisely
as
a
conductor's
baton
why
doesn't
it
work
for
me
Severus
in
the
silence
Harry
imagined
he
could
hear
the
snake
hissing
slightly
as
it
coiled
and
uncoiledor
was
it
voldemort's
sibilant
sigh
lingering
on
the
air
mymy
lord
said
Snape
blankly
i
do
not
understand
youyou
have
performed
extraordinary
magic
with
that
wand
no
said
Voldemort
i
have
performed
my
usual
magic
i
am
extraordinary
but
this
wand
no
it
has
not
revealed
the
wonders
it
has
promised
i
feel
no
difference
between
this
wand
and
the
one
I
procured
from
Ollivander
all
those
years
ago
voldemort's
tone
was
musing
calm
but
harry's
scar
had
begun
to
throb
and
pulse
Pain
was
building
in
his
forehead
and
he
could
feel
that
controlled
sense
of
fury
building
inside
Voldemort
no
difference
said
Voldemort
again
snape
did
not
speak
harry
could
not
see
his
face
he
wondered
whether
Snape
sensed
danger
was
trying
to
find
the
right
words
to
reassure
his
master
voldemort
started
to
move
around
the
room
Harry
lost
sight
of
him
for
seconds
as
he
prowled
speaking
in
that
same
measured
voice
while
the
pain
and
fury
mounted
in
Harry
i
have
thought
long
and
hard
Severus
do
you
know
why
I
have
called
you
back
from
battle
and
for
a
moment
Harry
saw
snape's
profile
his
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
coiling
snake
in
its
enchanted
cage
no
my
Lord
but
I
beg
you
will
let
me
return
let
me
find
Potter
you
sound
like
Lucius
neither
of
you
understands
Potter
as
I
do
he
does
not
need
finding
potter
will
come
to
me
i
knew
his
weakness
you
see
his
one
great
flaw
he
will
hate
watching
the
others
struck
down
around
him
knwoing
that
it
is
for
him
that
it
happens
he
will
want
to
stop
it
at
any
cost
he
will
come
but
my
Lord
he
might
be
killed
accidentally
by
someone
other
than
yourself
My
instructions
to
the
Death
Eaters
have
been
perfectly
clear
capture
Potter
kill
his
friendsthe
more
the
betterbut
do
not
kill
him
but
it
is
of
you
that
I
wished
to
speak
Severus
not
Harry
Potter
you
have
been
very
valuable
to
me
very
valuable
my
Lord
knows
I
seek
only
to
serve
him
butlet
me
go
and
find
the
boy
my
Lord
let
me
bring
him
to
you
i
know
I
can
I
have
told
you
no
said
Voldemort
and
Harry
caught
the
lgint
of
red
in
his
eyes
as
he
turned
again
and
the
swishing
of
his
cloak
was
like
the
slithering
of
a
snake
and
he
felt
voldemort's
impatience
in
his
burning
scar
my
concern
at
the
moment
Severus
is
what
will
happen
when
I
finally
meet
the
boy
my
Lord
there
can
be
no
question
surely
but
there
is
a
question
Severus
there
is
voldemort
halted
and
Harry
could
see
him
plainly
again
as
he
slid
the
Elder
Wand
through
his
white
fingers
staring
at
Snape
why
did
both
the
wands
I
have
used
fail
when
directed
at
Harry
Potter
ii
cannot
answer
that
my
Lord
can't
you
the
stab
of
rage
felt
like
a
spike
driven
through
harry's
head
he
forced
his
own
fist
into
his
mouth
to
stop
himself
from
crying
out
in
pain
he
closed
his
eyes
and
suddenly
he
was
Voldemort
looking
into
snape's
pale
face
my
wand
of
yew
did
everything
of
which
I
asked
it
Severus
except
to
kill
Harry
Potter
twice
it
failed
ollivander
told
me
under
torture
of
the
twin
cores
told
me
to
take
another's
wand
i
did
so
but
lucius's
wand
shattered
upon
meeting
potter's
ii
have
no
explanation
my
Lord
snape
was
not
looking
at
Voldemort
now
his
dark
eyes
were
still
fixed
upon
the
coiling
serpent
in
its
protective
sphere
i
sought
a
third
wand
Severus
the
Elder
Wand
the
Wand
of
Destiny
the
Deathstick
i
took
it
from
its
previous
master
i
took
it
from
the
grfave
of
Albus
Dumbledore
and
now
Snape
looked
at
Voldemort
and
snape's
face
was
like
a
death
mask
it
was
marble
white
and
so
still
that
when
he
spoke
it
was
a
shock
to
see
that
anyone
lived
behind
the
blank
eyes
my
Lordlet
me
go
to
the
boy
all
this
long
night
when
I
am
on
the
brink
of
victory
I
have
sat
here
said
Voldemort
his
voice
barely
louder
than
a
whisper
wondering
wondering
why
the
Elder
Wand
refuses
to
be
what
it
ought
to
be
refuses
to
perform
as
legend
says
it
must
perform
for
its
rightful
owner
and
I
think
I
have
the
answer
snape
did
not
speak
perhaps
you
already
know
it
you
are
a
clever
man
after
all
Severus
you
have
been
a
good
and
faithful
servant
and
I
regret
what
must
happen
my
Lord
The
Elder
Wand
cannot
serve
me
properly
Severus
because
I
am
not
its
true
master
the
Elder
Wand
belongs
to
the
wizard
who
killed
its
last
owner
you
killed
Albus
Dumbledore
while
you
live
Severus
the
Elder
Wand
cannot
truly
be
mine
my
Lord
snape
protested
raising
his
wand
it
cannot
be
any
other
way
said
Voldemort
i
must
master
the
wand
Severus
master
the
wand
and
I
master
Potter
at
last
and
Voldemort
swiped
the
air
with
the
Elder
Wand
it
did
nothing
to
sanpe
who
for
a
split
second
seemed
to
think
he
had
been
reprieved
but
then
voldemort's
intention
became
clear
the
snake's
cage
was
rolling
through
the
air
and
before
Snape
could
do
anything
more
than
yell
it
had
encased
him
head
and
shoulders
and
Voldemort
spoke
in
Parseltongue
kill
there
was
a
terrible
scream
harry
saw
snape's
face
losing
the
little
color
it
had
left
it
whitened
as
his
black
eyes
widened
as
the
snake's
fangs
pierced
his
neck
as
he
failed
to
push
the
enchanted
cage
off
himself
as
his
knees
gave
way
and
he
fell
to
the
floor
i
regret
it
said
Voldemort
coldly
he
turned
away
there
was
no
sadness
in
him
no
remorse
it
was
time
to
leave
this
shack
and
take
charge
with
a
wand
that
would
now
do
his
full
bidding
he
pointed
it
at
the
starry
cage
holding
the
snake
which
drifted
upward
off
snape
who
fell
sideways
onto
the
floor
blood
gushing
from
the
wounds
in
his
neck
voldemort
swept
from
the
room
without
a
backward
glance
and
the
great
serpent
floated
after
him
in
its
huge
protective
sphere
back
in
the
tunnel
and
his
own
mind
Harry
opened
his
eyes
He
had
drawn
blood
biting
down
on
his
knuckles
in
an
effort
not
to
shout
out
now
he
was
looking
through
the
tiny
crack
between
crate
and
wall
watching
a
foot
in
a
black
boot
trembling
on
the
floor
harry
breathed
Hermione
behind
him
but
he
had
already
pointed
his
wand
at
the
crate
blocking
his
view
it
lifted
an
inch
into
the
air
and
drifted
sideways
silently
as
quietly
as
he
could
he
pulled
himself
up
into
the
room
he
did
not
know
why
he
was
doing
it
why
he
was
approaching
the
dying
man
he
did
not
know
what
he
felt
as
he
saw
snape's
white
face
adn
the
fingers
trying
to
staunch
the
bloody
wound
at
his
neck
harry
took
off
the
invisibility
cloak
and
looked
down
upon
the
man
he
hated
whose
widening
black
eyes
found
Harry
as
he
cried
to
speak
harry
bent
over
him
and
Snape
seized
the
front
of
his
robes
and
pulled
him
close
a
terrible
rasping
gurgling
noise
issued
from
snape's
throat
take
it
take
it
something
more
than
blood
was
leaking
from
Snape
silvery
blue
neither
gas
nor
liquid
it
gushed
form
his
mouth
and
his
ears
and
his
eyes
and
Harry
knew
what
it
was
but
did
not
know
what
to
do
A
flask
conjured
from
thin
air
was
thrust
into
his
shaking
hand
by
Hermione
harry
lfited
the
silvery
substance
into
it
with
his
wand
when
the
falsk
was
full
to
the
brim
and
Snape
looked
as
though
there
was
no
blood
left
in
him
his
grip
on
harry's
robes
slackened
look
at
me
he
whispered
the
green
eyes
found
the
black
but
after
a
second
something
in
the
depths
of
the
dark
pari
seemed
to
vanish
leaving
them
fixed
blank
and
empty
the
hand
holding
Harry
thudded
to
the
floor
and
Snape
moved
no
more
chapter
Thirty-Three
the
Princes
Tale
harry
remained
kneeling
at
Snapes
side
simply
staring
down
at
him
until
quite
suddenly
a
high
cold
voice
spoke
so
close
to
them
that
Harry
jumped
on
his
feet
the
flask
gripped
tightly
in
his
hands
thinking
that
Voldemort
had
reentered
the
room
voldemorts
voice
reverberated
from
the
walls
and
floor
and
Harry
realized
that
he
was
talking
to
Hogwarts
and
to
all
the
surrounding
area
that
the
residents
of
Hogsmeade
and
all
those
still
fighting
in
the
castle
would
hear
him
as
clearly
as
if
he
stood
beside
them
his
breath
on
the
back
of
their
necks
a
deathblow
away
you
have
fought
said
the
high
cold
voice
valiantly
lord
Voldemort
knows
how
to
value
bravery
yet
you
have
sustained
heavy
losses
if
you
continue
to
resist
me
you
will
all
die
one
by
one
i
do
not
wish
this
to
happen
every
drop
of
magical
blood
spilled
is
a
loss
and
a
waste
lord
Voldemort
is
merciful
i
command
my
forces
to
retreat
immediately
you
have
one
hour
dispose
of
your
dead
with
dignity
treat
your
injured
i
speak
now
Harry
Potter
directly
to
you
you
have
permitted
your
friends
to
die
for
you
rather
than
face
me
yourself
i
shall
wait
for
one
hour
in
the
Forbidden
Forest
if
at
the
end
of
that
hour
you
have
not
come
to
me
have
not
given
yourself
up
then
battle
recommences
this
time
I
shall
enter
the
fray
myself
Harry
Potter
and
I
shall
find
you
and
I
shall
punish
every
last
man
woman
and
child
who
has
tried
to
conceal
you
from
me
one
hour
both
Ron
and
Hermione
shook
their
heads
frantically
looking
at
Harry
dont
listen
to
him
said
Ron
itll
be
all
right
said
Hermione
wildly
lets
lets
get
back
to
the
castle
if
hes
gone
to
the
forest
well
need
to
think
of
a
new
plan
she
glanced
at
Snapes
body
then
hurried
back
to
the
tunnel
entrance
ron
followed
her
harry
gathered
up
the
Invisibility
Cloak
then
looked
down
at
Snape
he
did
not
know
what
to
feel
except
shock
at
the
way
Snape
had
been
killed
and
the
reason
for
which
it
had
been
done
they
crawled
back
through
the
tunnel
none
of
them
talking
and
Harry
wondered
whether
Ron
and
Hermione
could
still
hear
Voldemort
ringing
in
their
heads
as
he
could
you
have
permitted
your
friends
to
die
for
you
rather
than
face
me
yourself
i
shall
wait
for
one
hour
in
the
Forbidden
Forest
one
hour
small
bundles
seemed
to
litter
the
lawn
at
the
front
of
the
castle
it
could
only
be
an
hour
or
so
from
dawn
yet
it
was
pitch-black
the
three
of
them
hurried
toward
the
stone
steps
a
lone
dog
the
size
of
a
small
boat
lay
abandoned
in
front
of
them
there
was
no
other
sign
of
Grawp
or
of
his
attacker
the
castle
was
unnaturally
silent
there
were
no
flashes
of
light
now
no
bangs
or
screams
or
shouts
the
flagstones
of
the
deserted
entrance
hall
were
stained
with
blood
emeralds
were
still
scattered
all
over
the
floor
along
with
pieces
of
marble
and
splintered
wood
part
of
the
banisters
had
been
blown
away
where
is
everyone
whispered
Hermione
ron
led
the
way
to
the
Great
Hall
harry
stopped
in
the
doorway
the
House
tables
were
gone
and
the
room
was
crowded
the
survivors
stood
in
groups
their
arms
around
each
others
necks
the
injured
were
being
treated
upon
the
raised
platform
by
Madam
Pomfrey
and
a
group
of
helpers
firenze
was
amongst
the
injured
his
flank
poured
blood
and
he
shook
where
he
lay
unable
to
stand
the
dead
lay
in
a
row
in
the
middle
of
the
Hall
harry
could
not
see
Freds
body
because
his
family
surrounded
him
george
was
kneeling
at
his
head
Mrs
weasley
was
lying
across
Freds
chest
her
body
shaking
mr.
Weasley
stroking
her
hair
while
tears
cascaded
down
his
cheeks
without
a
word
to
Harry
Ron
and
Hermione
walked
away
harry
saw
Hermione
approach
Ginny
whose
face
was
swollen
and
blotchy
and
hug
her
ron
joined
Bill
Fleur
and
Percy
who
flung
an
arm
around
Rons
shoulders
as
Ginny
and
Hermione
moved
closer
to
the
rest
of
the
family
Harry
had
a
clear
view
of
the
bodies
lying
next
to
Fred
remus
and
Tonks
pale
and
still
and
peaceful-looking
apparently
asleep
beneath
the
dark
enchanted
ceiling
the
Great
Hall
seemed
to
fly
away
become
smaller
shrink
as
Harry
reeled
backward
from
the
doorway
he
could
not
draw
breath
he
could
not
bear
to
look
at
any
of
the
other
bodies
to
see
who
else
had
died
for
him
he
could
not
bear
to
join
the
Weasleys
could
not
look
into
their
eyes
when
if
he
had
given
himself
up
in
the
first
place
Fred
might
never
have
died
he
turned
away
and
ran
up
the
marble
staircase
lupin
Tonks
he
yearned
not
to
feel
he
wished
he
could
rip
out
his
heart
his
innards
everything
that
was
screaming
inside
him
the
castle
was
completely
empty
even
the
ghosts
seemed
to
have
joined
the
mass
mourning
in
the
Great
Hall
harry
ran
without
stopping
clutching
the
crystal
flask
of
Snapes
last
thoughts
and
he
did
not
slow
down
until
he
reached
the
stone
gargoyle
guarding
the
headmasters
office
password
dumbledore
said
Harry
without
thinking
because
it
was
he
whom
he
yearned
to
see
and
to
his
surprise
the
gargoyle
slid
aside
revealing
the
spiral
staircase
behind
but
when
Harry
burst
into
the
circular
office
he
found
a
change
the
portraits
that
hung
all
around
the
walls
were
empty
not
a
single
headmaster
or
headmistress
remained
to
see
him
all
it
seemed
had
flitted
away
charging
through
the
paintings
that
lined
the
castle
so
that
they
could
have
a
clear
view
of
what
was
going
on
harry
glanced
hopelessly
at
Dumbledores
deserted
frame
which
hung
directly
behind
the
headmasters
chair
then
turned
his
back
on
it
the
stone
Pensieve
lay
in
the
cabinet
where
it
had
always
been
harry
heaved
it
onto
the
desk
and
poured
Snapes
memories
into
the
wide
basin
with
its
runic
markings
around
the
edge
to
escape
into
someone
elses
head
would
be
a
blessed
relief
nothing
that
even
Snape
had
left
him
could
be
worse
than
his
own
thoughts
the
memories
swirled
silver
white
and
strange
and
without
hesitating
with
a
feeling
of
reckless
abandonment
as
though
this
would
assuage
his
torturing
grief
Harry
dived
he
fell
headlong
into
sunlight
and
his
feet
found
warm
ground
when
he
straightened
up
he
saw
that
he
was
in
a
nearly
deserted
playground
a
single
huge
chimney
dominated
the
distant
skyline
two
girls
were
swinging
backward
and
forward
and
a
skinny
boy
was
watching
them
from
behind
a
clump
of
bushes
his
black
hair
was
overlong
and
his
clothes
were
so
mismatched
that
it
looked
deliberate
too
short
jeans
a
shabby
overlarge
coat
that
might
have
belonged
to
a
grown
man
an
odd
smocklike
shirt
harry
moved
closer
to
the
boy
snape
looked
no
more
than
nine
or
ten
years
old
sallow
small
stringy
there
was
undisguised
greed
in
his
thin
face
as
he
watched
the
younger
of
the
two
girls
swinging
higher
and
higher
than
her
sister
lily
dont
do
it
shrieked
the
elder
of
the
two
but
the
girl
had
let
go
of
the
swing
at
the
very
height
of
its
arc
and
flown
into
the
air
quite
literally
flown
launched
herself
skyward
with
a
great
shout
of
laughter
and
instead
of
crumpling
on
the
playground
asphalt
she
soared
like
a
trapeze
artist
through
the
air
staying
up
far
too
long
landing
far
too
lightly
mummy
told
you
not
to
petunia
stopped
her
swing
by
dragging
the
heels
of
her
sandals
on
the
ground
making
a
crunching
grinding
sound
then
leapt
up
hands
on
hips
mummy
said
you
werent
allowed
Lily
but
Im
fine
said
Lily
still
giggling
tuney
look
at
this
watch
what
I
can
do
petunia
glanced
around
the
playground
was
deserted
apart
from
themselves
and
though
the
girls
did
not
know
it
Snape
lily
had
picked
up
a
fallen
flower
from
the
bush
behind
which
Snape
lurked
petunia
advanced
evidently
torn
between
curiosity
and
disapproval
lily
waited
until
Petunia
was
near
enough
to
have
a
clear
view
then
held
out
her
palm
the
flower
sat
there
opening
and
closing
its
petals
like
some
bizarre
many-lipped
oyster
stop
it
shrieked
Petunia
its
not
hurting
you
said
Lily
but
she
closed
her
hand
on
the
blossom
and
threw
it
back
to
the
ground
its
not
right
said
Petunia
but
her
eyes
had
followed
the
flowers
flight
to
the
ground
and
lingered
upon
it
how
do
you
do
it
she
added
and
there
was
definite
longing
in
her
voice
its
obvious
isnt
it
snape
could
no
longer
contain
himself
but
had
jumped
out
from
behind
the
bushes
petunia
shrieked
and
ran
backward
toward
the
swings
but
Lily
though
clearly
startled
remained
where
she
was
snape
seemed
to
regret
his
appearance
a
dull
flush
of
color
mounted
the
sallow
cheeks
as
he
looked
at
Lily
whats
obvious
asked
Lily
snape
had
an
air
of
nervous
excitement
with
a
glance
at
the
distant
Petunia
now
hovering
beside
the
swings
he
lowered
his
voice
and
said
I
know
what
you
are
what
do
you
mean
youre
youre
a
witch
whispered
Snape
she
looked
affronted
thats
not
a
very
nice
thing
to
say
to
somebody
she
turned
nose
in
the
air
and
marched
off
toward
her
sister
no
said
Snape
he
was
highly
colored
now
and
Harry
wondered
why
he
did
not
take
off
the
ridiculously
large
coat
unless
it
was
because
he
did
not
want
to
reveal
the
smock
beneath
it
he
flapped
after
the
girls
looking
ludicrously
batlike
like
his
older
self
the
sisters
considered
him
united
in
disapproval
both
holding
on
to
one
of
the
swing
poles
as
though
it
was
the
safe
place
in
tag
you
are
said
Snape
to
Lily
you
are
a
witch
ive
been
watching
you
for
a
while
but
theres
nothing
wrong
with
that
my
mums
one
and
Im
a
wizard
petunias
laugh
was
like
cold
water
wizard
she
shrieked
her
courage
returned
now
that
she
had
recovered
from
the
shock
of
his
unexpected
appearance
i
know
who
you
are
youre
that
Snape
boy
they
live
down
Spinners
End
by
the
river
she
told
Lily
and
it
was
evident
from
her
tone
that
she
considered
the
address
a
poor
recommendation
why
have
you
been
spying
on
us
havent
been
spying
said
Snape
hot
and
uncomfortable
and
dirty-haired
in
the
bright
sunlight
wouldnt
spy
on
you
anyway
he
added
spitefully
youre
a
Muggle
though
Petunia
evidently
did
not
understand
the
word
she
could
hardly
mistake
the
tone
lily
come
on
were
leaving
she
said
shrilly
lily
obeyed
her
sister
at
once
glaring
at
Snape
as
she
left
he
stood
watching
them
as
they
marched
through
the
playground
gate
and
Harry
the
only
one
left
to
observe
him
recognized
Snapes
bitter
disappointment
and
understood
that
Snape
had
been
planning
this
moment
for
a
while
and
that
it
had
all
gone
wrong
the
scene
dissolved
and
before
Harry
knew
it
re-formed
around
him
he
was
now
in
a
small
thicket
of
trees
he
could
see
a
sunlit
river
glittering
through
their
trunks
the
shadows
cast
by
the
trees
made
a
basin
of
cool
green
shade
two
children
sat
facing
each
other
cross-legged
on
the
ground
snape
had
removed
his
coat
now
his
odd
smock
looked
less
pecular
in
the
half
light
and
the
Ministry
can
punish
you
if
you
do
magic
outside
school
you
get
letters
but
I
have
done
magic
outside
school
were
all
right
we
havent
got
wands
yet
they
let
you
off
when
youre
a
kid
and
you
cant
help
it
but
once
youre
eleven
he
nodded
importantly
and
they
start
training
you
then
youve
got
to
go
careful
there
was
a
little
silence
lily
had
picked
up
a
fallen
twig
and
twirled
it
in
the
air
and
Harry
knew
that
she
was
imagining
sparks
trailing
from
it
then
she
dropped
the
twig
leaned
in
toward
the
boy
and
said
It
is
real
isnt
it
its
not
a
joke
petunia
says
youre
lying
to
me
petunia
says
there
isnt
a
Hogwarts
it
is
real
isnt
it
its
real
for
us
said
Snape
not
for
her
but
well
get
the
letter
you
and
me
really
whispered
Lily
definitely
said
Snape
and
even
with
his
poorly
cut
hair
and
his
odd
clothes
he
struck
an
oddly
impressive
figure
sprawled
in
front
of
her
brimful
of
confidence
in
his
destiny
and
will
it
really
come
by
owl
lily
whispered
normally
said
Snape
but
youre
muggle-born
so
someone
from
the
school
will
have
to
come
and
explain
to
your
parents
does
it
make
a
difference
being
muggle-born
snape
hesitated
his
black
eyes
eager
in
the
greenish
gloom
moved
over
the
pale
face
the
dark
red
hair
no
he
said
it
doesnt
make
any
difference
good
said
Lily
relaxing
it
was
clear
that
she
had
been
worrying
youve
got
loads
of
magic
said
Snape
i
saw
that
all
the
time
I
was
watching
you
his
voice
trailed
away
she
was
not
listening
but
had
stretched
out
on
the
leafy
ground
and
was
looking
up
at
the
canopy
of
leaves
overhead
he
watched
her
as
greedily
as
he
had
watched
her
in
the
playground
how
are
things
at
your
house
lily
asked
a
little
crease
appeared
between
his
eyes
fine
he
said
theyre
not
arguing
anymore
oh
yes
theyre
arguing
said
Snape
he
picked
up
a
fistful
of
leaves
and
began
tearing
them
apart
apparently
unaware
of
what
he
was
doing
but
it
wont
be
that
long
and
Ill
be
gone
doesnt
your
dad
like
magic
he
doesnt
like
anything
much
said
Snape
severus
a
little
smile
twisted
Snapes
mouth
when
she
said
his
name
yeah
tell
me
about
the
dementors
again
what
dyou
want
to
know
about
them
for
if
I
use
magic
outside
school
they
wouldnt
give
you
to
the
dementors
for
that
dementors
are
for
people
who
do
really
bad
stuff
they
guard
the
wizard
prison
Azkaban
youre
not
going
to
end
up
in
Azkaban
youre
too
he
turned
red
again
and
shredded
more
leaves
then
a
small
rustling
noise
behind
Harry
made
him
turn
Petunia
hiding
behind
a
tree
had
lost
her
footing
tuney
said
Lily
surprise
and
welcome
in
her
voice
but
Snape
had
jumped
to
his
feet
whos
spying
now
he
shouted
what
dyou
want
petunia
was
breathless
alarmed
at
being
caught
harry
could
see
her
struggling
for
something
hurtful
to
say
what
is
that
youre
wearing
anyway
she
said
pointing
at
Snapes
chest
your
mums
blouse
there
was
a
crack
a
branch
over
Petunias
head
had
fallen
lily
screamed
the
branch
caught
Petunia
on
the
shoulder
and
she
staggered
backward
and
burst
into
tears
tuney
but
Petunia
was
running
away
lily
rounded
on
Snape
did
you
make
that
happen
no.
He
looked
both
defiant
and
scared
you
did
she
was
backing
away
from
him
you
did
you
hurt
her
no
no
I
didnt
but
the
lie
did
not
convince
Lily
after
one
last
burning
look
she
ran
from
the
little
thicket
off
after
her
sister
and
Snape
looked
miserable
and
confused
and
the
scene
re-formed
harry
looked
around
he
was
on
platform
nine
and
three
quarters
and
Snape
stood
beside
him
slightly
hunched
next
to
a
thin
sallow-faced
sour-looking
woman
who
greatly
resembled
him
snape
was
staring
at
a
family
of
four
a
short
distance
away
the
two
girls
stood
a
little
apart
from
their
parents
lily
seemed
to
be
pleading
with
her
sister
harry
moved
closer
to
listen
im
sorry
Tuney
Im
sorry
listen
She
caught
her
sisters
hand
and
held
tight
to
it
even
though
Petunia
tried
to
pull
it
away
maybe
once
Im
there
no
listen
Tuney
maybe
once
Im
there
Ill
be
able
to
go
to
Professor
Dumbledore
and
persuade
him
to
change
his
mind
i
dont
want
to
go
said
Petunia
and
she
dragged
her
hand
back
out
of
her
sisters
grasp
you
think
I
want
to
go
to
some
stupid
castle
and
learn
to
be
a
a
her
pale
eyes
roved
over
the
platform
over
the
cats
mewling
in
their
owners
arms
over
the
owls
fluttering
and
hooting
at
each
other
in
cages
over
the
students
some
already
in
their
long
black
robes
loading
trunks
onto
the
scarlet
steam
engine
or
else
greeting
one
another
with
glad
cries
after
a
summer
apart
you
think
I
want
to
be
a
a
freak
lilys
eyes
filled
with
tears
as
Petunia
succeeded
in
tugging
her
hand
away
im
not
a
freak
said
Lily
thats
a
horrible
thing
to
say
thats
where
youre
going
said
Petunia
with
relish
a
special
school
for
freaks
you
and
that
Snape
boy
weirdos
thats
what
you
two
are
its
good
youre
being
separated
from
normal
people
its
for
our
safety
lily
glanced
toward
her
parents
who
were
looking
around
the
platform
with
an
air
of
wholehearted
enjoyment
drinking
in
the
scene
then
she
looked
back
at
her
sister
and
her
voice
was
low
and
fierce
you
didnt
think
it
was
such
a
freaks
school
when
you
wrote
to
the
headmaster
and
begged
him
to
take
you
petunia
turned
scarlet
beg
i
didnt
beg
i
saw
his
reply
it
was
very
kind
you
shouldnt
have
read
whispered
Petunia
that
was
my
private
how
could
you
lily
gave
herself
away
by
half-glancing
toward
where
Snape
stood
nearby
petunia
gasped
that
boy
found
it
you
and
that
boy
have
been
sneaking
in
my
room
no
not
sneaking
Now
Lily
was
on
the
defensive
severus
saw
the
envelope
and
he
couldnt
believe
a
Muggle
could
have
contacted
Hogwarts
thats
all
he
says
there
must
be
wizards
working
undercover
in
the
postal
service
who
take
care
of
apparently
wizards
poke
their
noses
in
everywhere
said
Petunia
now
as
pale
as
she
had
been
flushed
freak
she
spat
at
her
sister
and
she
flounced
off
to
where
her
parents
stood
the
scene
dissolved
again
snape
was
hurrying
along
the
corridor
of
the
Hogwarts
Express
as
it
clattered
through
the
countryside
he
had
already
changed
into
his
school
robes
had
perhaps
taken
the
first
opportunity
to
take
off
his
dreadful
Muggle
clothes
at
last
he
stopped
outside
a
compartment
in
which
a
group
of
rowdy
boys
were
talking
hunched
in
a
corner
seat
beside
the
window
was
Lily
her
face
pressed
against
the
windowpane
snape
slid
open
the
compartment
door
and
sat
down
opposite
Lily
she
glanced
at
him
and
then
looked
back
out
of
the
window
she
had
been
crying
i
dont
want
to
talk
to
you
she
said
in
a
constricted
voice
why
not
tuney
h-hates
me
because
we
saw
that
letter
from
Dumbledore
so
what
she
threw
him
a
look
of
deep
dislike
so
shes
my
sister
shes
only
a
He
caught
himself
quickly
Lily
too
busy
trying
to
wipe
her
eyes
without
being
noticed
did
not
hear
him
but
were
going
he
said
unable
to
suppress
the
exhilaration
in
his
voice
this
is
it
were
off
to
Hogwarts
she
nodded
mopping
her
eyes
but
in
spite
of
herself
she
half
smiled
youd
better
be
in
Slytherin
said
Snape
encouraged
that
she
had
brightened
a
little
slytherin
one
of
the
boys
sharing
the
compartment
who
had
shown
no
interest
at
all
in
Lily
or
Snape
until
that
point
looked
around
at
the
word
and
Harry
whose
attention
had
been
focused
entirely
on
the
two
beside
the
window
saw
his
father
slight
black-haired
like
Snape
but
with
that
indefinable
air
of
having
been
well-cared-for
even
adored
that
Snape
so
conspicuously
lacked
who
wants
to
be
in
Slytherin
i
think
Id
leave
wouldnt
you
james
asked
the
boy
lounging
on
the
seats
opposite
him
and
with
a
jolt
Harry
realized
that
it
was
Sirius
sirius
did
not
smile
my
whole
family
have
been
in
Slytherin
he
said
blimey
said
James
and
I
thought
you
seemed
all
right
sirius
grinned
maybe
Ill
break
the
tradition
where
are
you
heading
if
youve
got
the
choice
james
lifted
an
invisible
sword
Gryffindor
where
dwell
the
brave
at
heart
Like
my
dad
snape
made
a
small
disparaging
noise
james
turned
on
him
got
a
problem
with
that
no
said
Snape
though
his
slight
sneer
said
otherwise
if
youd
rather
be
brawny
than
brainy
wherere
you
hoping
to
go
seeing
as
youre
neither
interjected
Sirius
james
roared
with
laughter
lily
sat
up
rather
flushed
and
looked
from
James
to
Sirius
in
dislike
come
on
Severus
lets
find
another
compartment
oooooo
james
and
Sirius
imitated
her
lofty
voice
James
tried
to
trip
Snape
as
he
passed
see
ya
Snivellus
a
voice
called
as
the
compartment
door
slammed
and
the
scene
dissolved
once
more
harry
was
standing
right
behind
Snape
as
they
faced
the
candlelit
House
tables
lined
with
rapt
faces
then
Professor
McGonagall
said
Evans
Lily
he
watched
his
mother
walk
forward
on
trembling
legs
and
sit
down
upon
the
rickety
stool
professor
McGonagall
dropped
the
Sorting
Hat
onto
her
head
and
barely
a
second
after
it
had
touched
the
dark
red
hair
the
hat
cried
Gryffindor
harry
heard
Snape
let
out
a
tiny
groan
lily
took
off
the
hat
handed
it
back
to
Professor
McGonagall
then
hurried
toward
the
cheering
Gryffindors
but
as
she
went
she
glanced
back
at
Snape
and
there
was
a
sad
little
smile
on
her
face
harry
saw
Sirius
move
up
the
bench
to
make
room
for
her
she
took
one
look
at
him
seemed
to
recognize
him
from
the
train
folded
her
arms
and
firmly
turned
her
back
on
him
the
roll
call
continued
harry
watched
Lupin
Pettigrew
and
his
father
join
Lily
and
Sirius
at
the
Gryffindor
table
at
last
when
only
a
dozen
students
remained
to
be
sorted
Professor
McGonagall
called
Snape
harry
walked
with
him
to
the
stool
watched
him
place
the
hat
upon
his
head
slytherin
cried
the
Sorting
Hat
and
Severus
Snape
moved
off
to
the
other
side
of
the
Hall
away
from
Lily
to
where
the
Slytherins
were
cheering
him
to
where
Lucius
Malfoy
a
prefect
badge
gleaming
upon
his
chest
patted
Snape
on
the
back
as
he
sat
down
beside
him
and
the
scene
changed
lily
and
Snape
were
walking
across
the
castle
courtyard
evidently
arguing
harry
hurried
to
catch
up
with
them
to
listen
in
as
he
reached
them
he
realized
how
much
taller
they
both
were
a
few
years
seemed
to
have
passed
since
their
Sorting
thought
we
were
supposed
to
be
friends
snape
was
saying
Best
friends
we
are
Sev
but
I
dont
like
some
of
the
people
youre
hanging
round
with
im
sorry
but
I
detest
Avery
and
Mulciber
mulciber
what
do
you
see
in
him
Sev
hes
creepy
dyou
know
what
he
tried
to
do
to
Mary
Macdonald
the
other
day
lily
had
reached
a
pillar
and
leaned
against
it
looking
up
into
the
thin
sallow
face
that
was
nothing
said
Snape
it
was
a
laugh
thats
all
it
was
Dark
Magic
and
if
you
think
thats
funny
what
about
the
stuff
Potter
and
his
mates
get
up
to
demanded
Snape
his
color
rose
again
as
he
said
it
unable
it
seemed
to
hold
in
his
resentment
whats
Potter
got
to
do
with
anything
said
Lily
they
sneak
out
at
night
theres
something
weird
about
that
Lupin
where
does
he
keep
going
hes
ill
said
Lily
they
say
hes
ill
every
month
at
the
full
moon
said
Snape
i
know
your
theory
said
Lily
and
she
sounded
cold
why
are
you
so
obsessed
with
them
anyway
why
do
you
care
what
theyre
doing
at
night
im
just
trying
to
show
you
theyre
not
as
wonderful
as
everyone
seems
to
think
they
are
the
intensity
of
his
gaze
made
her
blush
they
dont
use
Dark
Magic
though
she
dropped
her
voice
and
youre
being
really
ungrateful
i
heard
what
happened
the
other
night
you
went
sneaking
down
that
tunnel
by
the
Whomping
Willow
and
James
Potter
saved
you
from
whatevers
down
there
snapes
whole
face
contorted
and
he
spluttered
Saved
saved
you
think
he
was
playing
the
hero
he
was
saving
his
neck
and
his
friends
too
youre
not
going
to
I
wont
let
you
let
me
let
me
lilys
bright
green
eyes
were
slits
snape
backtracked
at
once
i
didnt
m
ean
I
just
dont
want
to
see
you
made
a
fool
of
He
fancies
you
James
Potter
fancies
you
the
words
seemed
wrenched
from
him
against
his
will
and
hes
not
everyone
thinks
big
Quidditch
hero
Snapes
bitterness
and
dislike
were
rendering
him
incoherent
and
Lilys
eyebrows
were
traveling
farther
and
farther
up
her
forehead
i
know
James
Potters
an
arrogant
toerag
she
said
cutting
across
Snape
i
dont
need
you
to
tell
me
that
but
Mulcibers
and
Averys
idea
of
humor
is
just
evil
evil
Sev
i
dont
understand
how
you
can
be
friends
with
them
harry
doubted
that
Snape
had
even
heard
her
strictures
on
Mulciber
and
Avery
the
moment
she
had
insulted
James
Potter
his
whole
body
had
relaxed
and
as
they
walked
away
there
was
a
new
spring
in
Snapes
step
and
the
scene
dissolved
harry
watched
again
as
Snape
left
the
Great
Hall
after
sitting
his
O
w.l.
in
Defense
Against
the
Dark
Arts
watched
as
he
wandered
away
from
the
castle
and
strayed
inadvertently
close
to
the
place
beneath
the
beech
tree
where
James
Sirius
Lupin
and
Pettigrew
sat
together
but
Harry
kept
his
distance
this
time
because
he
knew
what
happened
after
James
had
hoisted
Severus
into
the
air
and
taunted
him
he
knew
what
had
been
done
and
said
and
it
gave
him
no
pleasure
to
hear
it
again
he
watched
as
Lily
joined
the
group
and
went
to
Snapes
defense
distantly
he
heard
Snape
shout
at
her
in
his
humiliation
and
his
fury
the
unforgivable
word
Mudblood
the
scene
changed
im
sorry
im
not
interested
im
sorry
save
your
breath
it
was
nighttime
lily
who
was
wearing
a
dressing
gown
stood
with
her
arms
folded
in
front
of
the
portrait
of
the
Fat
Lady
at
the
entrance
to
Gryffindor
Tower
i
only
came
out
because
Mary
told
me
you
were
threatening
to
sleep
here
i
was
i
would
have
done
i
never
meant
to
call
you
Mudblood
it
just
slipped
out
there
was
no
pity
in
Lilys
voice
its
too
late
ive
made
excuses
for
you
for
years
none
of
my
friends
can
understand
why
I
even
talk
to
you
you
and
your
precious
little
Death
Eater
friends
you
see
you
dont
even
deny
it
you
dont
even
deny
thats
what
youre
all
aiming
to
be
you
cant
wait
to
join
You-Know-Who
can
you
he
opened
his
mouth
but
closed
it
without
speaking
i
cant
pretend
anymore
youve
chosen
your
way
Ive
chosen
mine
no
listen
I
didnt
mean
to
call
me
Mudblood
but
you
call
everyone
of
my
birth
Mudblood
Severus
why
should
I
be
any
different
he
struggled
on
the
verge
of
speech
but
with
a
contemptuous
look
she
turned
and
climbed
back
through
the
portrait
hole
the
corridor
dissolved
and
the
scene
took
a
little
longer
to
reform
Harry
seemed
to
fly
through
shifting
shapes
and
colors
until
his
surroundings
solidified
again
and
he
stood
on
a
hilltop
forlorn
and
cold
in
the
darkness
the
wind
whistling
through
the
branches
of
a
few
leafless
trees
the
adult
Snape
was
panting
turning
on
the
spot
his
wand
gripped
tightly
in
his
hand
waiting
for
something
or
for
someone
his
fear
infected
Harry
too
even
though
he
knew
that
he
could
not
be
harmed
and
he
looked
over
his
shoulder
wondering
what
it
was
that
Snape
was
waiting
for
then
a
blinding
jagged
jet
of
white
light
flew
through
the
air
harry
thought
of
lightning
but
Snape
had
dropped
to
his
knees
and
his
wand
had
flown
out
of
his
hand
dont
kill
me
that
was
not
my
intention
any
sound
of
Dumbledore
Apparating
had
been
drowned
by
the
sound
of
the
wind
in
the
branches
he
stood
before
Snape
with
his
robes
whipping
around
him
and
his
face
was
illuminated
from
below
in
the
light
cast
by
his
wand
well
Severus
what
message
does
Lord
Voldemort
have
for
me
no
no
message
Im
here
on
my
own
account
snape
was
wringing
his
hands
he
looked
a
little
mad
with
his
straggling
black
hair
flying
around
him
i
I
come
with
a
warning
no
a
request
please
dumbledore
flicked
his
wand
though
leaves
and
branches
still
flew
through
the
night
air
around
them
silence
fell
on
the
spot
where
he
and
Snape
faced
each
other
what
request
could
a
Death
Eater
make
of
me
the
the
prophecy
the
prediction
trelawney
ah
yes
said
Dumbledore
how
much
did
you
relay
to
Lord
Voldemort
everything
everything
I
heard
said
Snape
that
is
why
it
is
for
that
reason
he
thinks
it
means
Lily
Evans
the
prophecy
did
not
refer
to
a
woman
said
Dumbledore
it
spoke
of
a
boy
born
at
the
end
of
July
you
know
what
I
mean
he
thinks
it
means
her
son
he
is
going
to
hunt
her
down
kill
them
all
if
she
means
so
much
to
you
said
Dumbledore
surely
Lord
Voldemort
will
spare
her
could
you
not
ask
for
mercy
for
the
mother
in
exchange
for
the
son
i
have
I
have
asked
him
you
disgust
me
said
Dumbledore
and
Harry
had
never
heard
so
much
contempt
in
his
voice
snape
seemed
to
shrink
a
little
You
do
not
care
then
about
the
deaths
of
her
husband
and
child
they
can
die
as
long
as
you
have
what
you
want
snape
said
nothing
but
merely
looked
up
at
Dumbledore
hide
them
all
then
he
croaked
keep
her
them
safe
please
and
what
will
you
give
me
in
return
Severus
in
in
return
snape
gaped
at
Dumbledore
and
Harry
expected
him
to
protest
but
after
a
long
moment
he
said
Anything
the
hilltop
faded
and
Harry
stood
in
Dumbledores
office
and
something
was
making
a
terrible
sound
like
a
wounded
animal
snape
was
slumped
forward
in
a
chair
and
Dumbledore
was
standing
over
him
looking
grim
after
a
moment
or
two
Snape
raised
his
face
and
he
looked
like
a
man
who
had
lived
a
hundred
years
of
misery
since
leaving
the
wild
hilltop
i
thought
you
were
going
to
keep
her
safe
she
and
James
put
their
faith
in
the
wrong
person
said
Dumbledore
rather
like
you
Severus
werent
you
hoping
that
Lord
Voldemort
would
spare
her
snapes
breathing
was
shallow
her
boy
survives
said
Dumbledore
with
a
tiny
jerk
of
the
head
Snape
seemed
to
flick
off
an
irksome
fly
her
son
lives
he
has
her
eyes
precisely
her
eyes
you
remember
the
shape
and
color
of
Lily
Evanss
eyes
I
am
sure
dont
bellowed
Snape
gone
dead
is
this
remorse
Severus
i
wish
i
wish
I
were
dead
and
what
use
would
that
be
to
anyone
said
Dumbledore
coldly
if
you
loved
Lily
Evans
if
you
truly
loved
her
then
your
way
forward
is
clear
snape
seemed
to
peer
through
a
haze
of
pain
and
Dumbledores
words
appeared
to
take
a
long
time
to
reach
him
what
what
do
you
mean
you
know
how
and
why
she
died
make
sure
it
was
not
in
vain
help
me
protect
Lilys
son
he
does
not
need
protection
the
Dark
Lord
has
gone
the
Dark
Lord
will
return
and
Harry
Potter
will
be
in
terrible
danger
when
he
does
there
was
a
long
pause
and
slowly
Snape
regained
control
of
himself
mastered
his
own
breathing
at
last
he
said
Very
well
very
well
but
never
never
tell
Dumbledore
this
must
be
between
us
swear
it
i
cannot
bear
especially
Potters
son
i
want
your
word
my
word
Severus
that
I
shall
never
reveal
the
best
of
you
dumbledore
sighed
looking
down
into
Snapes
ferocious
anguished
face
if
you
insist
the
office
dissolved
but
re-formed
instantly
snape
was
pacing
up
and
down
in
front
of
Dumbledore
mediocre
arrogant
as
his
father
a
determined
rule-breaker
delighted
to
find
himself
famous
attention-seeking
and
impertinent
you
see
what
you
expect
to
see
Severus
said
Dumbledore
without
raising
his
eyes
from
a
copy
of
Transfiguration
Today
other
teachers
report
that
the
boy
is
modest
likable
and
reasonably
talented
personally
I
find
him
an
engaging
child
dumbledore
turned
a
page
and
said
without
looking
up
Keep
an
eye
on
Quirrell
wont
you
a
whirl
of
color
and
now
everything
darkened
and
Snape
and
Dumbledore
stood
a
little
apart
in
the
entrance
hall
while
the
last
stragglers
from
the
Yule
Ball
passed
them
on
their
way
to
bed
well
murmured
Dumbledore
karkaroffs
Mark
is
becoming
darker
too
he
is
panicking
he
fears
retribution
you
know
how
much
help
he
gave
the
Ministry
after
the
Dark
Lord
fell
snape
looked
sideways
at
Dumbledores
crooked-nosed
profile
karkaroff
intends
to
flee
if
the
Mark
burns
does
he
said
Dumbledore
softly
as
Fleur
Delacour
and
Roger
Davies
came
giggling
in
from
the
grounds
and
are
you
tempted
to
join
him
no
said
Snape
his
black
eyes
on
Fleurs
and
Rogers
retreating
figures
i
am
not
such
a
coward
no
agreed
Dumbledore
you
are
a
braver
man
by
far
than
Igor
Karkaroff
you
know
I
sometimes
think
we
Sort
too
soon
he
walked
away
leaving
Snape
looking
stricken
and
now
Harry
stood
in
the
headmasters
office
yet
again
it
was
nighttime
and
Dumbledore
sagged
sideways
in
the
thronelike
chair
behind
the
desk
apparently
semiconscious
his
right
hand
dangled
over
the
side
blackened
and
burned
snape
was
muttering
incantations
pointing
his
wand
at
the
wrist
of
the
hand
while
with
his
left
hand
he
tipped
a
goblet
full
of
thick
golden
potion
down
Dumbledores
throat
after
a
moment
or
two
Dumbledores
eyelids
fluttered
and
opened
why
said
Snape
without
preamble
why
did
you
put
on
that
ring
it
carries
a
curse
surely
you
realized
that
why
even
touch
it
marvolo
Gaunts
ring
lay
on
the
desk
before
Dumbledore
it
was
cracked
the
sword
of
Gryffindor
lay
beside
it
dumbledore
grimaced
was
a
fool
sorely
tempted
tempted
by
what
dumbledore
did
not
answer
it
is
a
miracle
you
managed
to
return
here
snape
sounded
furious
that
ring
carried
a
curse
of
extraordinary
power
to
contain
it
is
all
we
can
hope
for
I
have
trapped
the
curse
in
one
hand
for
the
time
being
dumbledore
raised
his
blackened
useless
hand
and
examined
it
with
the
expression
of
one
being
shown
an
interesting
curio
you
have
done
very
well
Severus
how
long
do
you
think
I
have
dumbledores
tone
was
conversational
he
might
have
been
asking
for
a
weather
forecast
snape
hesitated
and
then
said
I
cannot
tell
maybe
a
year
there
is
no
halting
such
a
spell
forever
it
will
spread
eventually
it
is
the
sort
of
curse
that
strengthens
over
time
dumbledore
smiled
the
news
that
he
had
less
than
a
year
to
live
seemed
a
matter
of
little
or
no
concern
to
him
i
am
fortunate
extremely
fortunate
that
I
have
you
Severus
if
you
had
only
summoned
me
a
little
earlier
I
might
have
been
able
to
do
more
buy
you
more
time
said
Snape
furiously
he
looked
down
at
the
broken
ring
and
the
sword
did
you
think
that
breaking
the
ring
would
break
the
curse
something
like
that
i
was
delirious
no
doubt
said
Dumbledore
with
an
effort
he
straightened
himself
in
his
chair
well
really
this
makes
matters
much
more
straightforward
snape
looked
utterly
perplexed
dumbledore
smiled
i
refer
to
the
plan
Lord
Voldemort
is
revolving
around
me
his
plan
to
have
the
poor
Malfoy
boy
murder
me
snape
sat
down
in
the
chair
Harry
had
so
often
occupied
across
the
desk
from
Dumbledore
harry
could
tell
that
he
wanted
to
say
more
on
the
subject
of
Dumbledores
cursed
hand
but
the
other
held
it
up
in
polite
refusal
to
discuss
the
matter
further
scowling
Snape
said
The
Dark
Lord
does
not
expect
Draco
to
succeed
this
is
merely
punishment
for
Luciuss
recent
failures
slow
torture
for
Dracos
parents
while
they
watch
him
fail
and
pay
the
price
in
short
the
boy
has
had
a
death
sentence
pronounced
upon
him
as
surely
as
I
have
said
Dumbledore
now
I
should
have
thought
the
natural
successor
to
the
job
once
Draco
fails
is
yourself
there
was
a
short
pause
that
I
think
is
the
Dark
Lords
plan
lord
Voldemort
foresees
a
moment
in
the
near
future
when
he
will
not
need
a
spy
at
Hogwarts
he
believes
the
school
will
soon
be
in
his
grasp
yes
and
if
it
does
fall
into
his
grasp
said
Dumbledore
almost
it
seemed
as
an
aside
I
have
your
word
that
you
will
do
all
in
your
power
to
protect
the
students
at
Hogwarts
snape
gave
a
stiff
nod
good
now
then
your
first
priority
will
be
to
discover
what
Draco
is
up
to
a
frightened
teenage
boy
is
a
danger
to
others
as
well
as
to
himself
offer
him
help
and
guidance
he
ought
to
accept
he
likes
you
much
less
since
his
father
has
lost
favor
draco
blames
me
he
thinks
I
have
usurped
Luciuss
position
all
the
same
try
i
am
concerned
less
for
myself
than
for
accidental
victims
of
whatever
schemes
might
occur
to
the
boy
ultimately
of
course
there
is
only
one
thing
to
be
done
if
we
are
to
save
him
from
Lord
Voldemorts
wrath
snape
raised
his
eyebrows
and
his
tone
was
sardonic
as
he
asked
Are
you
intending
to
let
him
kill
you
certainly
not
you
must
kill
me
there
was
a
long
silence
broken
only
by
an
odd
clicking
noise
fawkes
the
phoenix
was
gnawing
a
bit
of
cuttlebone
would
you
like
me
to
do
it
now
asked
Snape
his
voice
heavy
with
irony
or
would
you
like
a
few
moments
to
compose
an
epitaph
oh
not
quite
yet
said
Dumbledore
smiling
i
daresay
the
moment
will
present
itself
in
due
course
given
what
has
happened
tonight
he
indicated
his
withered
hand
we
can
be
sure
that
it
will
happen
within
a
year
if
you
dont
mind
dying
said
Snape
roughly
why
not
let
Draco
do
it
that
boys
soul
is
not
yet
so
damaged
said
Dumbledore
i
would
not
have
it
ripped
apart
on
my
account
and
my
soul
Dumbledore
mine
you
alone
know
whether
it
will
harm
your
soul
to
help
an
old
man
avoid
pain
and
humiliation
said
Dumbledore
i
ask
this
one
great
favor
of
you
Severus
because
death
is
coming
for
me
as
surely
as
the
Chudley
Cannons
will
finish
bottom
of
this
years
league
i
confess
I
should
prefer
a
quick
painless
exit
to
the
protracted
and
messy
affair
it
will
be
if
for
instance
Greyback
is
involved
I
hear
Voldemort
has
recruited
him
or
dear
Bellatrix
who
likes
to
play
with
her
food
before
she
eats
it
his
tone
was
light
but
his
blue
eyes
pierced
Snape
as
they
had
frequently
pierced
Harry
as
though
the
soul
they
discussed
was
visible
to
him
at
last
Snape
gave
another
curt
nod
dumbledore
seemed
satisfied
thank
you
Severus
the
office
disappeared
and
now
Snape
and
Dumbledore
were
strolling
together
in
the
deserted
castle
grounds
by
twilight
what
are
you
doing
with
Potter
all
these
evenings
you
are
closeted
together
snape
asked
abruptly
dumbledore
looked
weary
why
you
arent
trying
to
give
him
more
detentions
Severus
the
boy
will
soon
have
spent
more
time
in
detention
than
out
he
is
his
father
over
again
in
looks
perhaps
but
his
deepest
nature
is
much
more
like
his
mothers
i
spend
time
with
Harry
because
I
have
things
to
discuss
with
him
information
I
must
give
him
before
it
is
too
late
information
repeated
Snape
you
trust
him
you
do
not
trust
me
it
is
not
a
question
of
trust
i
have
as
we
both
know
limited
time
it
is
essential
that
I
give
the
boy
enough
information
for
him
to
do
what
he
needs
to
do
and
why
may
I
not
have
the
same
information
i
prefer
not
to
put
all
of
my
secrets
in
one
basket
particularly
not
a
basket
that
spends
so
much
time
dangling
on
the
arm
of
Lord
Voldemort
which
I
do
on
your
orders
and
you
do
it
extremely
well
do
not
think
that
I
underestimate
the
constant
danger
in
which
you
place
yourself
Severus
to
give
Voldemort
what
appears
to
be
valuable
information
while
withholding
the
essentials
is
a
job
I
would
entrust
to
nobody
but
you
yet
you
confide
much
more
in
a
boy
who
is
incapable
of
Occlumency
whose
magic
is
mediocre
and
who
has
a
direct
connection
into
the
Dark
Lords
mind
voldemort
fears
that
connection
said
Dumbledore
not
so
long
ago
he
had
one
small
taste
of
what
truly
sharing
Harrys
mind
means
to
him
it
was
pain
such
as
he
has
never
experienced
he
will
not
try
to
possess
Harry
again
I
am
sure
of
it
not
in
that
way
i
dont
understand
lord
Voldemorts
soul
maimed
as
it
is
cannot
bear
close
contact
with
a
soul
like
Harrys
like
a
tongue
on
frozen
steel
like
flesh
in
flame
souls
we
were
talking
of
minds
in
the
case
of
Harry
and
Lord
Voldemort
to
speak
of
one
is
to
speak
of
the
other
dumbledore
glanced
around
to
make
sure
that
they
were
alone
they
were
close
by
the
Forbidden
Forest
now
but
there
was
no
sign
of
anyone
near
them
after
you
have
killed
me
Severus
you
refuse
to
tell
me
everything
yet
you
expect
that
small
service
of
me
snarled
Snape
and
real
anger
flared
in
the
thin
face
now
you
take
a
great
deal
for
granted
Dumbledore
perhaps
I
have
changed
my
mind
you
gave
me
your
word
Severus
and
while
we
are
talking
about
services
you
owe
me
I
thought
you
agreed
to
keep
a
close
eye
on
our
young
Slytherin
friend
snape
looked
angry
mutinous
dumbledore
sighed
come
to
my
office
tonight
Severus
at
eleven
and
you
shall
not
complain
that
I
have
no
confidence
in
you
they
were
back
in
Dumbledores
office
the
windows
dark
and
Fawkes
sat
silent
as
Snape
sat
quite
still
as
Dumbledore
walked
around
him
talking
harry
must
not
know
not
until
the
last
moment
not
until
it
is
necessary
otherwise
how
could
he
have
the
strength
to
do
what
must
be
done
but
what
must
he
do
that
is
between
Harry
and
me
now
listen
closely
Severus
there
will
come
a
time
after
my
death
do
not
argue
do
not
interrupt
there
will
come
a
time
when
Lord
Voldemort
will
seem
to
fear
for
the
life
of
his
snake
for
Nagini
snape
looked
astonished
precisely
if
there
comes
a
time
when
Lord
Voldemort
stops
sending
that
snake
forth
to
do
his
bidding
but
keeps
it
safe
beside
him
under
magical
protection
then
I
think
it
will
be
safe
to
tell
Harry
tell
him
what
dumbledore
took
a
deep
breath
and
closed
his
eyes
tell
him
that
on
the
night
Lord
Voldemort
tried
to
kill
him
when
Lily
cast
her
own
life
between
them
as
a
shield
the
Killing
Curse
rebounded
upon
Lord
Voldemort
and
a
fragment
of
Voldemorts
soul
was
blasted
apart
from
the
whole
and
latched
itself
onto
the
only
living
soul
left
in
that
collapsed
building
part
of
Lord
Voldemort
lives
inside
Harry
and
it
is
that
which
gives
him
the
power
of
speech
with
snakes
and
a
connection
with
Lord
Voldemorts
mind
that
he
has
never
understood
and
while
that
fragment
of
soul
unmissed
by
Voldemort
remains
attached
to
and
protected
by
Harry
Lord
Voldemort
cannot
die
harry
seemed
to
be
watching
the
two
men
from
one
end
of
a
long
tunnel
they
were
so
far
away
from
him
their
voices
echoing
strangely
in
his
ears
so
the
boy
the
boy
must
die
asked
Snape
quite
calmly
and
Voldemort
himself
must
do
it
Severus
that
is
essential
another
long
silence
then
Snape
said
I
thought
all
those
years
that
we
were
protecting
him
for
her
for
Lily
we
have
protected
him
because
it
has
been
essential
to
teach
him
to
raise
him
to
let
him
try
his
strength
said
Dumbledore
his
eyes
still
tight
shut
meanwhile
the
connection
between
them
grows
ever
stronger
a
parasitic
growth
sometimes
I
have
thought
he
suspects
it
himself
if
I
know
him
he
will
have
arranged
matters
so
that
when
he
does
set
out
to
meet
his
death
it
will
truly
mean
the
end
of
Voldemort
dumbledore
opened
his
eyes
snape
looked
horrified
you
have
kept
him
alive
so
that
he
can
die
at
the
right
moment
dont
be
shocked
Severus
how
many
men
and
women
have
you
watched
die
lately
only
those
whom
I
could
not
save
said
Snape
he
stood
up
you
have
used
me
meaning
i
have
spied
for
you
and
lied
for
you
put
myself
in
mortal
danger
for
you
everything
was
supposed
to
be
to
keep
Lily
Potters
son
safe
now
you
tell
me
you
have
been
raising
him
like
a
pig
for
slaughter
but
this
is
touching
Severus
said
Dumbledore
seriously
have
you
grown
to
care
for
the
boy
after
all
for
him
shouted
Snape
expecto
Patronum
from
the
tip
of
his
wand
burst
the
silver
doe
she
landed
on
the
office
floor
bounded
once
across
the
office
and
soared
out
of
the
window
dumbledore
watched
her
fly
away
and
as
her
silvery
glow
faded
he
turned
back
to
Snape
and
his
eyes
were
full
of
tears
after
all
this
time
always
said
Snape
and
the
scene
shifted
now
Harry
saw
Snape
talking
to
the
portrait
of
Dumbledore
behind
his
desk
you
will
have
to
give
Voldemort
the
correct
date
of
Harrys
departure
from
his
aunt
and
uncles
said
Dumbledore
not
to
do
so
will
raise
suspicion
when
Voldemort
believes
you
so
well
informed
however
you
must
plant
the
idea
of
decoys
that
I
think
ought
to
ensure
Harrys
safety
try
Confunding
Mundungus
Fletcher
and
Severus
if
you
are
forced
to
take
part
in
the
chase
be
sure
to
act
your
part
convincingly
i
am
counting
upon
you
to
remain
in
Lord
Voldemorts
good
books
as
long
as
possible
or
Hogwarts
will
be
left
to
the
mercy
of
the
Carrows
now
Snape
was
head
to
head
with
Mundungus
in
an
unfamiliar
tavern
Mundunguss
face
looking
curiously
blank
Snape
frowning
in
concentration
you
will
suggest
to
the
Order
of
the
Phoenix
Snape
murmured
that
they
use
decoys
polyjuice
Potion
identical
Potters
its
the
only
thing
that
might
work
you
will
forget
that
I
have
suggested
this
you
will
present
it
as
your
own
idea
you
understand
i
understand
murmured
Mundungus
his
eyes
unfocused
now
Harry
was
flying
alongside
Snape
on
a
broomstick
through
a
clear
dark
night
He
was
accompanied
by
other
hodded
Death
Eaters
and
ahead
were
Lupin
and
a
Harry
who
was
really
George
a
Death
Eater
moved
ahead
of
Snape
and
raised
his
wand
pointing
it
directly
at
Lupins
back
sectumsempra
shouted
Snape
but
the
spell
intended
for
the
Death
Eaters
wand
hand
missed
and
hit
George
instead
and
next
Snape
was
kneeling
in
Siriuss
old
bedroom
tears
were
dripping
from
the
end
of
his
hooked
nose
as
he
read
the
old
letter
from
Lily
the
second
page
carried
only
a
few
words
could
ever
have
been
friends
with
Gellert
Grindelwald
i
think
her
minds
going
personally
lots
of
love
lily
snape
took
the
page
bearing
Lilys
signature
and
her
love
and
tucked
it
inside
his
robes
then
he
ripped
in
two
the
photograph
he
was
also
holding
so
that
he
kept
the
part
from
which
Lily
laughed
throwing
the
portion
showing
James
and
Harry
back
onto
the
floor
under
the
chest
of
drawers
and
now
Snape
stood
again
in
the
headmasters
study
as
Phineas
Nigellus
came
hurrying
into
his
portrait
headmaster
they
are
camping
in
the
Forest
of
Dean
the
Mudblood
do
not
use
that
word
the
Granger
girl
then
mentioned
the
place
as
she
opened
her
bag
and
I
heard
her
good
very
good
cried
the
portrait
of
Dumbledore
behind
the
headmasters
chair
now
Severus
the
sword
do
not
forget
that
it
must
be
taken
under
conditions
of
need
and
valor
and
he
must
not
know
that
you
give
it
if
Voldemort
should
read
Harrys
mind
and
see
you
acting
for
him
i
know
said
Snape
curtly
he
approached
the
portrait
of
Dumbledore
and
pulled
at
its
side
it
swung
forward
revealing
a
hidden
cavity
behind
it
from
which
he
took
the
sword
of
Gryffindor
and
you
still
arent
going
to
tell
me
why
its
so
important
to
give
Potter
the
sword
said
Snape
as
he
swung
a
traveling
cloak
over
his
robes
no
I
dont
think
so
said
Dumbledores
portrait
he
will
know
what
to
do
with
it
and
Severus
be
very
careful
they
may
not
take
kindly
to
your
appearance
after
George
Weasleys
mishap
snape
turned
at
the
door
dont
worry
Dumbledore
he
said
coolly
i
have
a
plan
and
Snape
left
the
room
harry
rose
up
out
of
the
Pensieve
and
moments
later
he
lay
on
the
carpeted
floor
in
exactly
the
same
rooms
Snape
might
just
have
closed
the
door
chapter
Thirty-Four
the
Forest
Again
finally
the
truth
lying
with
his
face
pressed
into
the
dusty
carpet
of
the
office
where
he
had
once
thought
he
was
learning
the
secrets
of
victory
Harry
understood
at
last
that
he
was
not
supposed
to
survive
his
job
was
to
walk
calmly
into
Deaths
welcoming
arms
along
the
way
he
was
to
dispose
of
Voldemorts
remaining
links
to
life
so
that
when
at
last
he
flung
himself
across
Voldemorts
path
and
did
not
raise
a
wand
to
defend
himself
the
end
would
be
clean
and
the
job
that
ought
to
have
been
done
in
Godrics
Hollow
would
be
finished
neither
would
live
neither
could
survive
he
felt
his
heart
pounding
fiercely
in
his
chest
how
strange
that
in
his
dread
of
death
it
pumped
all
the
harder
valiantly
keeping
him
alive
but
it
would
have
to
stop
and
soon
its
beats
were
numbered
how
many
would
there
be
time
for
as
he
rose
and
walked
through
the
castle
for
the
last
time
out
into
the
grounds
and
into
the
forest
terror
washed
over
him
as
he
lay
on
the
floor
with
that
funeral
drum
pounding
inside
him
would
it
hurt
to
die
all
those
times
he
had
thought
that
it
was
about
to
happen
and
escaped
he
had
never
really
thought
of
the
thing
itself
His
will
to
live
had
always
been
so
much
stronger
than
his
fear
of
death
yet
it
did
not
occur
to
him
now
to
try
to
escape
to
outrun
Voldemort
it
was
over
he
knew
it
and
all
that
was
left
was
the
thing
itself
dying
if
he
could
only
have
died
on
that
summers
night
when
he
had
left
number
four
Privet
Drive
for
the
last
time
when
the
noble
phoenix
feather
wand
had
saved
him
if
he
could
only
have
died
like
Hedwig
so
quickly
he
would
not
have
known
it
had
happened
or
if
he
could
have
launched
himself
in
front
of
a
wand
to
save
someone
he
loved
he
envied
even
his
parents
deaths
now
this
cold-blooded
walk
to
his
own
destruction
would
require
a
different
kind
of
bravery
he
felt
his
fingers
trembling
slightly
and
made
an
effort
to
control
them
although
no
one
could
see
him
the
portraits
on
the
walls
were
all
empty
slowly
very
slowly
he
sat
up
and
as
he
did
so
he
felt
more
alive
and
more
aware
of
his
own
living
body
than
ever
before
why
had
he
never
appreciated
what
a
miracle
he
was
brain
and
nerve
and
bounding
heart
it
would
all
be
gone
or
at
least
he
would
be
gone
from
it
his
breath
came
slow
and
deep
and
his
mouth
and
throat
were
completely
dry
but
so
were
his
eyes
dumbledores
betrayal
was
almost
nothing
of
course
there
had
been
a
bigger
plan
Harry
had
simply
been
too
foolish
to
see
it
he
realized
that
now
he
had
never
questioned
his
own
assumption
that
Dumbledore
wanted
him
alive
now
he
saw
that
his
life
span
had
always
been
determined
by
how
long
it
took
to
eliminate
all
the
Horcruxes
dumbledore
had
passed
the
job
of
destroying
them
to
him
and
obediently
he
had
continued
to
chip
away
at
the
bonds
tying
not
only
Voldemort
but
himself
to
life
how
neat
how
elegant
not
to
waste
any
more
lives
but
to
give
the
dangerous
task
to
the
boy
who
had
already
been
marked
for
slaughter
and
whose
death
would
not
be
a
calamity
but
another
blow
against
Voldemort
and
Dumbledore
had
known
that
Harry
would
not
duck
out
that
he
would
keep
going
to
the
end
even
though
it
was
his
end
because
he
had
taken
trouble
to
get
to
know
him
hadnt
he
dumbledore
knew
as
Voldemort
knew
that
Harry
would
not
let
anyone
else
die
for
him
now
that
he
had
discovered
it
was
in
his
power
to
stop
it
the
images
of
Fred
Lupin
and
Tonks
lying
dead
in
the
Great
Hall
forced
their
way
back
into
his
minds
eye
and
for
a
moment
he
could
hardly
breathe
death
was
impatient
but
Dumbledore
had
overestimated
him
he
had
failed
The
snake
survived
one
Horcrux
remained
to
bind
Voldemort
to
the
earth
even
after
Harry
had
been
killed
true
that
would
mean
an
easier
job
for
somebody
he
wondered
who
would
do
it
ron
and
Hermione
would
know
what
needed
to
be
done
of
course
that
would
have
been
why
Dumbledore
wanted
him
to
confide
in
two
others
so
that
if
he
fulfilled
his
true
destiny
a
little
early
they
could
carry
on
like
rain
on
a
cold
window
these
thoughts
pattered
against
the
hard
surface
of
the
incontrovertible
truth
which
was
that
he
must
die
i
must
die
it
must
end
ron
and
Hermione
seemed
a
long
way
away
in
a
far-off
country
he
felt
as
though
he
had
parted
from
them
long
ago
there
would
be
no
good-byes
and
no
explanations
he
was
determined
of
that
this
was
a
journey
they
could
not
take
together
and
the
attempts
they
would
make
to
stop
him
would
waste
valuable
time
he
looked
down
at
the
battered
gold
watch
he
had
received
on
his
seventeenth
birthday
nearly
half
of
the
hour
allotted
by
Voldemort
for
his
surrender
had
elapsed
he
stood
up
his
heart
was
leaping
against
his
ribs
like
a
frantic
bird
perhaps
it
knew
it
had
little
time
left
perhaps
it
was
determined
to
fulfill
a
lifetimes
beats
before
the
end
he
did
not
look
back
as
he
closed
the
office
door
the
castle
was
empty
he
felt
ghostly
striding
through
it
alone
as
if
he
had
already
died
the
portrait
people
were
still
missing
from
their
frames
the
whole
place
was
eerily
still
as
if
all
its
remaining
lifeblood
were
concentrated
in
the
Great
Hall
where
the
dead
and
the
mourners
were
crammed
harry
pulled
the
Invisibility
Cloak
over
himself
and
descended
through
the
floors
at
last
walking
down
the
marble
staircase
into
the
entrance
hall
perhaps
some
tiny
part
of
him
hoped
to
be
sensed
to
be
seen
to
be
stopped
but
the
Cloak
was
as
ever
impenetrable
perfect
and
he
reached
the
front
doors
easily
then
Neville
nearly
walked
into
him
he
was
one
half
of
a
pair
that
was
carrying
a
body
in
from
the
grounds
harry
glanced
down
and
felt
another
dull
blow
to
his
stomach
Colon
Creevey
though
underage
must
have
sneaked
back
just
as
Malfoy
Crabbe
and
Goyle
had
done
he
was
tiny
in
death
you
know
what
i
can
manage
him
alone
Neville
said
Oliver
Wood
and
he
heaved
Colin
over
his
shoulder
in
a
firemans
lift
and
carried
him
into
the
Great
Hall
neville
leaned
against
the
door
frame
for
a
moment
and
wiped
his
forehead
with
the
back
of
his
hand
he
looked
like
an
old
man
then
he
set
off
on
the
steps
again
into
the
darkness
to
recover
more
bodies
harry
took
one
glance
back
at
the
entrance
of
the
Great
Hall
people
were
moving
around
trying
to
comfort
each
other
drinking
kneeling
beside
the
dead
but
he
could
not
see
any
of
the
people
he
loved
no
hint
of
Hermione
Ron
Ginny
or
any
of
the
other
Weasleys
no
Luna
he
felt
he
would
have
given
all
the
time
remaining
to
him
for
just
one
last
look
at
them
but
then
would
he
ever
have
the
strength
to
stop
looking
it
was
better
like
this
he
moved
down
the
steps
and
out
into
the
darkness
it
was
nearly
four
in
the
morning
and
the
deathly
stillness
of
the
grounds
felt
as
though
they
were
holding
their
breath
waiting
to
see
whether
he
could
do
what
he
must
harry
moved
toward
Neville
who
was
bending
over
another
body
neville
blimey
Harry
you
nearly
gave
me
heart
failure
harry
had
pulled
off
the
Cloak
The
idea
had
come
to
him
out
of
nowhere
born
out
of
a
desire
to
make
absolutely
sure
where
are
you
going
alone
neville
asked
suspiciously
its
all
part
of
the
plan
said
Harry
theres
someting
Ive
got
to
do
listen
Neville
harry
neville
looked
suddenly
scared
harry
youre
not
thinking
of
handing
yourself
over
no
Harry
lied
easily
Course
not
this
is
something
else
but
I
might
be
out
of
sight
for
a
while
you
know
Voldemorts
snake
neville
hes
got
a
huge
snake
calls
it
Nagini
ive
heard
yeah
what
about
it
its
got
to
be
killed
ron
and
Hermione
know
that
but
just
in
case
they
the
awfulness
of
that
possibility
smothered
him
for
a
moment
made
it
impossible
to
keep
talking
but
he
pulled
himself
together
again
This
was
crucial
he
must
be
like
Dumbledore
keep
a
cool
head
make
sure
there
were
backups
others
to
carry
on
dumbledore
had
died
knowing
that
three
people
still
knew
about
the
Horcruxes
now
Neville
would
take
Harrys
place
There
would
still
be
three
in
the
secret
just
in
case
theyre
busy
and
you
get
the
chance
kill
the
snake
kill
the
snake
Harry
repeated
all
right
Harry
youre
okay
are
you
im
fine
thanks
Neville
but
Neville
seized
his
wrist
as
Harry
made
to
move
on
were
all
going
to
keep
fighting
Harry
you
know
that
yeah
I
the
suffocating
feeling
extinguished
the
end
of
the
sentence
he
could
not
go
on
neville
did
not
seem
to
find
it
strange
he
patted
Harry
on
the
shoulder
released
him
and
walked
away
to
look
for
more
bodies
harry
swung
the
Cloak
back
over
himself
and
walked
on
someone
else
was
moving
not
far
away
stooping
over
another
prone
figure
on
the
ground
he
was
feet
away
from
her
when
he
realized
it
was
Ginny
he
stopped
in
his
tracks
she
was
crouching
over
a
girl
who
was
whispering
for
her
mother
its
all
right
Ginny
was
saying
its
ok
were
going
to
get
you
inside
but
I
want
to
go
home
whispered
the
girl
i
dont
want
to
fight
anymore
i
know
said
Ginny
and
her
voice
broke
its
going
to
be
all
right
ripples
of
cold
undulated
over
Harrys
skin
he
wanted
to
shout
out
to
the
night
he
wanted
Ginny
to
know
that
he
was
there
he
wanted
her
to
know
where
he
was
going
he
wanted
to
be
stopped
to
be
dragged
back
to
be
sent
back
home
but
he
was
home
hogwards
was
the
first
and
best
home
he
had
known
he
and
Voldemort
and
Snape
the
abandoned
boys
had
all
found
home
here
ginny
was
kneeling
beside
the
injured
girl
now
holding
her
hand
with
a
huge
effort
Harry
forced
himself
on
he
thought
he
saw
Ginny
look
around
as
he
passed
and
wondered
whether
she
had
sensed
someone
walking
nearby
but
he
did
not
speak
and
he
did
not
look
back
hagrids
hut
loomed
out
of
the
darkness
there
were
no
lights
no
sound
of
Fang
scrabbling
at
the
door
his
bark
booming
in
welcome
all
those
visits
to
Hagrid
and
the
gleam
of
the
copper
kettle
on
the
fire
and
rock
cakes
and
giant
grubs
and
his
great
bearded
face
and
Ron
vomiting
slugs
and
Hermione
helping
him
save
Norbert
he
moved
on
and
now
he
reached
the
edge
of
the
forest
and
he
stopped
a
swarm
of
dementors
was
gliding
amongst
the
trees
he
could
feel
their
chill
and
he
was
not
sure
he
would
be
able
to
pass
safely
through
it
he
had
not
strength
left
for
a
Patronus
he
could
no
longer
control
his
own
trembling
it
was
not
after
all
so
easy
to
die
every
second
he
breathed
the
smell
of
the
grass
the
cool
air
on
his
face
was
so
precious
To
think
that
people
had
years
and
years
time
to
waste
so
much
time
it
dragged
and
he
was
clinging
to
each
second
at
the
same
time
he
thought
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
go
on
and
knew
that
he
must
the
long
game
was
ended
the
Snitch
had
been
caught
it
was
time
to
leave
the
air
the
Snitch
his
nerveless
fingers
fumbled
for
a
moment
with
the
pouch
at
his
neck
and
he
pulled
it
out
i
open
at
the
close
breathing
fast
and
hard
he
stared
down
at
it
now
that
he
wanted
time
to
move
as
slowly
as
possible
he
seemed
to
have
sped
up
and
understanding
was
coming
so
fast
it
seemed
to
have
bypassed
though
this
was
the
close
this
was
the
moment
he
pressed
the
golden
metal
to
his
lips
and
whispered
I
am
about
to
die
the
metal
shell
broke
open
he
lowered
his
shaking
hand
raised
Dracos
wand
beneath
the
Cloak
and
murmured
Lumos
the
black
stone
with
is
jagged
crack
running
down
the
center
sat
in
the
two
halves
of
the
Snitch
the
Resurrection
Stone
had
cracked
down
the
vertical
line
representing
the
Elder
Wand
the
triangle
and
circle
representing
the
Cloak
and
the
stone
were
still
discernible
and
again
Harry
understood
without
having
to
think
it
did
not
matter
about
bringing
them
back
for
he
was
about
to
join
them
he
was
not
really
fetching
them
They
were
fetching
him
he
closed
his
eyes
and
turned
the
stone
over
in
his
hand
three
times
he
knew
it
had
happened
because
he
heard
slight
movements
around
him
that
suggested
frail
bodies
shifting
their
footing
on
the
earthy
twig-strewn
ground
that
marked
the
outer
edge
of
the
forest
he
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
around
they
were
neither
ghost
nor
truly
flesh
he
could
see
that
they
resembled
most
closely
the
Riddle
that
had
escaped
from
the
diary
so
long
ago
and
he
had
been
memory
made
nearly
solid
less
substantial
than
living
bodies
but
much
more
than
ghosts
they
moved
toward
him
and
on
each
face
there
was
the
same
loving
smile
james
was
exactly
the
same
height
as
Harry
he
was
wearing
the
clothes
in
which
he
had
died
and
his
hair
was
untidy
and
ruffled
and
his
glasses
were
a
little
lopsided
like
mr.
Weasleys
sirius
was
tall
and
handsome
and
younger
by
far
than
Harry
had
seen
him
in
life
he
loped
with
an
easy
grace
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
a
grin
on
his
face
lupin
was
younger
too
and
much
less
shabby
and
his
hair
was
thicker
and
darker
he
looked
happy
to
be
back
in
this
familiar
place
scene
of
so
many
adolescent
wanderings
lilys
smile
was
widest
of
all
she
pushed
her
long
hair
back
as
she
drew
closer
to
him
and
her
green
eyes
so
like
his
searched
his
face
hungrily
as
though
she
would
never
be
able
to
look
at
him
enough
youve
been
so
brave
he
could
not
speak
his
eyes
feasted
on
her
and
he
thought
that
he
would
like
to
stand
and
look
at
her
forever
and
that
would
be
enough
you
are
nearly
there
said
James
very
close
we
are
so
proud
of
you
does
it
hurt
the
childish
question
had
fallen
from
Harrys
lips
before
he
could
stop
it
dying
not
at
all
said
Sirius
quicker
and
easier
than
falling
asleep
and
he
will
want
it
to
be
quick
he
wants
it
over
said
Lupin
i
didnt
want
you
to
die
Harry
said
these
words
came
without
his
volition
any
of
you
im
sorry
he
addressed
Lupin
more
than
any
of
them
beseeching
him
right
after
youd
had
your
son
remus
Im
sorry
i
am
sorry
too
said
Lupin
sorry
I
will
never
know
him
but
he
will
know
why
I
died
and
I
hope
he
will
understand
i
was
trying
to
make
a
world
in
which
he
could
live
a
happier
life
a
chilly
breeze
that
seemed
to
emanate
from
the
heart
of
the
forest
lifted
the
hair
at
Harrys
brow
he
knew
that
they
would
not
tell
him
to
go
that
it
would
have
to
be
his
decision
youll
stay
with
me
until
the
very
end
said
James
they
wont
be
able
to
see
you
asked
Harry
we
are
part
of
you
said
Sirius
invisible
to
anyone
else
harry
looked
at
his
mother
stay
close
to
me
he
said
quietly
and
he
set
of
the
dementors
chill
did
not
overcome
him
he
passed
through
it
with
his
companions
and
they
acted
like
Patronuses
to
him
and
together
they
marched
through
the
old
trees
that
grew
closely
together
their
branches
tangled
their
roots
gnarled
and
twisted
underfoot
harry
clutched
the
Cloak
tightly
around
him
in
the
darkness
traveling
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
forest
with
no
idea
where
exactly
Voldemort
was
but
sure
that
he
would
find
him
beside
him
making
scarcely
a
sound
walked
James
Sirius
Lupin
and
Lily
and
their
presence
was
his
courage
and
the
reason
he
was
able
to
keep
putting
one
foot
in
front
of
the
other
his
body
and
mind
felt
oddly
disconnected
now
his
limbs
working
without
conscious
instruction
as
if
he
were
passenger
not
driver
in
the
body
he
was
about
to
leave
the
dead
who
walked
beside
him
through
the
forest
were
much
more
real
to
him
now
than
the
living
back
at
the
castle
Ron
Hermione
Ginny
and
all
the
others
were
the
ones
who
felt
like
ghosts
as
he
stumbled
and
slipped
toward
the
end
of
his
life
toward
Voldemort
a
thud
and
a
whisper
Some
other
living
creature
had
stirred
close
by
harry
stopped
under
the
Cloak
peering
around
listening
and
his
mother
and
father
Lupin
and
Sirius
stopped
too
someone
there
came
a
rough
whisper
close
at
hand
hes
got
an
Invisibility
Cloak
could
it
be
two
figures
emerged
from
behind
a
nearby
tree
Their
wands
flared
and
Harry
saw
Yaxley
and
Dolohov
peering
into
the
darkness
directly
at
the
place
Harry
his
mother
and
father
and
Sirius
and
Lupin
stood
apparently
they
could
not
see
anything
definitely
heard
something
said
Yaxley
animal
dyou
reckon
that
head
case
Hagrid
kept
a
whole
bunch
of
stuff
in
here
said
Dolohov
glancing
over
his
shoulder
yaxley
looked
down
at
his
watch
times
nearly
up
porters
had
his
hour
hes
not
coming
better
go
back
said
Yaxley
find
out
what
the
plan
is
now
he
and
Dolohov
turned
and
walked
deeper
into
the
forest
harry
followed
them
knowing
that
they
would
lead
him
exactly
where
he
wanted
to
go
he
glanced
sideways
and
his
mother
smiled
at
him
and
his
father
nodded
encouragement
they
had
traveled
on
mere
minutes
when
Harry
saw
light
ahead
and
Yaxley
and
Dolohov
stepped
out
into
a
clearing
that
Harry
knew
had
been
the
place
where
the
monstrous
Aragog
had
once
lived
the
remnants
of
his
vast
web
were
there
still
but
the
swarms
of
descendants
he
had
spawned
had
been
driven
out
by
the
Death
Eaters
to
fight
for
their
cause
a
fire
burned
in
the
middle
of
the
clearing
and
its
flickering
light
fell
over
a
crowd
of
completely
silent
watchful
Death
Eaters
some
of
them
were
still
masked
and
hooded
others
showed
their
faces
two
giants
sat
on
the
outskirts
of
the
group
casting
massive
shadows
over
the
scene
their
faces
cruel
rough-hewn
like
rock
harry
saw
Fenrir
skulking
chewing
his
long
nails
the
great
blond
Rowle
was
dabbing
at
his
bleeding
lip
he
saw
Lucius
Malfoy
who
looked
defeated
and
terrified
and
Narcissa
whose
eyes
were
sunken
and
full
of
apprehension
every
eye
was
fixed
upon
Voldemort
who
stood
with
his
head
bowed
and
his
white
hands
folded
over
the
Elder
Wand
in
front
of
him
he
might
have
been
praying
or
else
counting
silently
in
his
mind
and
Harry
standing
still
on
the
edge
of
the
scene
though
absurdly
of
a
child
counting
in
a
game
of
hide-and-seek
behind
his
head
still
swirling
and
coiling
the
great
snake
Nagini
floated
in
her
glittering
charmed
cage
like
a
monstrous
halo
when
Dolohov
and
Yaxley
rejoined
the
circle
Voldemort
looked
up
no
sign
of
him
my
Lord
said
Dolohov
voldemorts
expression
did
not
change
the
red
eyes
seemed
to
burn
in
the
firelight
slowly
he
drew
the
Elder
Wand
between
his
long
fingers
my
Lord
bellatrix
had
spoken
She
sat
closest
to
Voldemort
disheveled
her
face
a
little
bloody
but
otherwise
unharmed
voldemort
raised
his
hand
to
silence
her
and
she
did
not
speak
another
word
but
eyed
him
in
worshipful
fascination
i
thought
he
would
come
said
Voldemort
in
his
high
clear
voice
his
eyes
on
the
leaping
flames
i
expected
him
to
come
nobody
spoke
they
seemed
as
scared
as
Harry
whose
heart
was
now
throwing
itself
against
his
ribs
as
though
determined
to
escape
the
body
he
was
about
to
cast
aside
his
hands
were
sweating
as
he
pulled
off
the
Invisibility
Cloak
and
stuffed
it
beneath
his
robes
with
his
wand
he
did
not
want
to
be
tempted
to
fight
i
was
it
seems
mistaken
said
Voldemort
you
werent
harry
said
it
as
loudly
as
he
could
with
all
the
force
he
could
muster
He
did
not
want
to
sound
afraid
the
Resurrection
Stone
slipped
from
between
his
numb
fingers
and
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eyes
he
saw
his
parents
Sirius
and
Lupin
vanish
as
he
stepped
forward
into
the
firelight
at
that
moment
he
felt
that
nobody
mattered
but
Voldemort
it
was
just
the
two
of
them
the
illusion
was
gone
as
soon
as
it
had
come
the
giants
roared
as
the
Death
Eaters
rose
together
and
there
were
many
cries
gasps
even
laughter
voldemort
had
frozen
where
he
stood
but
his
red
eyes
had
found
Harry
and
he
stared
as
Harry
moved
toward
him
with
nothing
but
the
fire
between
them
then
a
voice
yelled
harry
no
he
turned
Hagrid
was
bound
and
trussed
tied
to
a
tree
nearby
his
massive
body
shook
the
branches
overhead
as
he
struggled
desperate
no
no
harry
whatre
yeh
quiet
shouted
Rowle
and
with
a
flick
of
his
wand
Hagrid
was
silenced
bellatrix
who
had
leapt
to
her
feet
was
looking
eagerly
from
Voldemort
to
Harry
her
breast
heaving
the
only
things
that
moved
were
the
flames
and
the
snake
coiling
and
uncoiling
in
the
glittering
cage
behind
Voldemorts
head
harry
could
feel
his
wand
against
his
chest
but
he
made
no
attempt
to
draw
it
he
knew
that
the
snake
was
too
well
protected
knew
that
if
he
managed
to
point
the
wand
at
Nagini
fifty
curses
would
hit
him
first
and
still
Voldemort
and
Harry
looked
at
each
other
and
now
Voldemort
tilted
his
head
a
little
to
the
side
considering
the
boy
standing
before
him
and
a
singularly
mirthless
smile
curled
the
lipless
mouth
harry
Potter
he
said
very
softly
his
voice
might
have
been
part
of
the
spitting
fire
the
Boy
Who
Lived
none
of
the
Death
Eaters
moved
they
were
waiting
Everything
was
waiting
hagrid
was
struggling
and
Bellatrix
was
panting
and
Harry
thought
inexplicably
of
Ginny
and
her
blazing
look
and
the
feel
of
her
lips
on
his
voldemort
had
raised
his
wand
his
head
was
still
tilted
to
one
side
like
a
curious
child
wondering
what
would
happen
if
he
proceeded
harry
looked
back
into
the
red
eyes
and
wanted
it
to
happen
now
quickly
while
he
could
still
stand
before
he
lost
control
before
he
betrayed
fear
he
saw
the
mouth
move
and
a
flash
of
green
light
and
everything
was
gone
chapter
Thirty-Five
kings
Cross
he
lay
facedown
listening
to
the
silence
he
was
perfectly
alone
nobody
was
watching
nobody
else
was
there
he
was
not
perfectly
sure
that
he
was
there
himself
a
long
time
later
or
maybe
no
time
at
all
it
came
to
him
that
he
must
exist
must
be
more
than
disembodied
thought
because
he
was
lying
definitely
lying
on
some
surface
therefore
he
had
a
sense
of
touch
and
the
thing
against
which
he
lay
existed
too
almost
as
soon
as
he
had
reached
this
conclusion
Harry
became
conscious
that
he
was
naked
convinced
as
he
was
of
his
total
solitude
this
did
not
concern
him
but
it
did
intrigue
him
slightly
he
wondered
whether
as
he
could
feel
he
would
be
able
to
see
in
opening
them
he
discovered
that
he
had
eyes
he
lay
in
a
bright
mist
though
it
was
not
like
mist
he
had
ever
experienced
before
his
surroundings
were
not
hidden
by
cloudy
vapor
rather
the
cloudy
vapor
had
not
yet
formed
into
surroundings
the
floor
on
which
he
lay
seemed
to
be
white
neither
warm
nor
cold
but
simply
there
a
flat
blank
something
on
which
to
be
he
sat
up
his
body
appeared
unscathed
he
touched
his
face
he
was
not
wearing
glasses
anymore
then
a
noise
reached
him
through
the
unformed
nothingness
that
surrounded
him
the
small
soft
thumpings
of
something
that
flapped
flailed
and
struggled
it
was
a
pitiful
noise
yet
also
slightly
indecent
he
had
the
uncomfortable
feeling
that
he
was
eavesdropping
on
something
furtive
shameful
for
the
first
time
he
wished
he
were
clothed
barely
had
the
wish
formed
in
his
head
than
robes
appeared
a
short
distance
away
he
took
them
and
pulled
them
on
they
were
soft
clean
and
warm
it
was
extraordinary
how
they
had
appeared
just
like
that
the
moment
he
had
wanted
them
he
stood
up
looking
around
was
he
in
some
great
Room
of
Requirement
the
longer
he
looked
the
more
there
was
to
see
a
great
domed
glass
roof
glittered
high
above
him
in
sunlight
perhaps
it
was
a
palace
all
was
hushed
and
still
except
for
those
odd
thumping
and
whimpering
noises
coming
from
somewhere
close
by
in
the
mist
harry
turned
slowly
on
the
spot
and
his
surroundings
seemed
to
invent
themselves
before
his
eyes
a
wide-open
space
bright
and
clean
a
hall
larger
by
far
than
the
Great
Hall
with
that
clear
domed
glass
ceiling
it
was
quite
empty
he
was
the
only
person
there
except
for
he
recoiled
he
had
spotted
the
thing
that
was
making
the
noises
it
had
the
form
of
a
small
naked
child
curled
on
the
ground
its
skin
raw
and
rough
flayed-looking
and
it
lay
shuddering
under
a
seat
where
it
had
been
left
unwanted
stuffed
out
of
sight
struggling
for
breath
he
was
afraid
of
it
small
and
fragile
and
wounded
though
it
was
he
did
not
want
to
approach
it
nevertheless
he
drew
slowly
nearer
ready
to
jump
back
at
any
moment
soon
he
stood
near
enough
to
touch
it
yet
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
do
it
he
felt
like
a
coward
he
ought
to
comfort
it
but
it
repulsed
him
you
cannot
help
he
spun
around
albus
Dumbledore
was
walking
toward
him
sprightly
and
upright
wearing
sweeping
robes
of
midnight
blue
harry
he
spread
his
arms
wide
and
his
hands
were
both
whole
and
white
and
undamaged
you
wonderful
boy
you
brave
brave
man
let
us
walk
stunned
Harry
followed
as
Dumbledore
strode
away
from
where
the
flayed
child
lay
whimpering
leading
him
to
two
seats
that
Harry
had
not
previously
noticed
set
some
distance
away
under
that
high
sparkling
ceiling
dumbledore
sat
down
in
one
of
them
and
Harry
fell
into
the
other
staring
at
his
old
headmasters
face
dumbledores
long
silver
hair
and
beard
the
piercingly
blue
eyes
behind
half-moon
spectacles
the
crooked
nose
Everything
was
as
he
had
remembered
it
and
yet
but
youre
dead
said
Harry
oh
yes
said
Dumbledore
matter-of-factly
then
im
dead
too
ah
said
Dumbledore
smiling
still
more
broadly
that
is
the
question
isnt
it
on
the
whole
dear
boy
I
think
not
they
looked
at
each
other
the
old
man
still
beaming
not
repeated
Harry
not
said
Dumbledore
but
harry
raised
his
hand
instinctively
toward
the
lightning
scar
it
did
not
seem
to
be
there
but
I
should
have
died
I
didnt
defend
myself
i
meant
to
let
him
kill
me
and
that
said
Dumbledore
will
I
think
have
made
all
the
difference
happiness
seemed
to
radiate
from
Dumbledore
like
light
like
fire
Harry
had
never
seen
the
man
so
utterly
so
palpably
content
explain
said
Harry
but
you
already
know
said
Dumbledore
he
twiddled
his
thumbs
together
i
let
him
kill
me
said
Harry
didnt
I
you
did
said
Dumbledore
nodding
go
on
so
the
part
of
his
soul
that
was
in
me
dumbledore
nodded
still
more
enthusiastically
urging
Harry
onward
a
broad
smile
of
encouragement
on
his
face
has
it
gone
oh
yes
said
Dumbledore
yes
he
destroyed
it
your
soul
is
whole
and
completely
your
own
Harry
but
then
harry
trembled
over
his
shoulder
to
where
the
small
maimed
creature
trembled
under
the
chair
what
is
that
Professor
something
that
is
beyond
either
of
our
help
said
Dumbledore
but
if
Voldemort
used
the
Killing
Curse
Harry
started
again
and
nobody
died
for
me
this
time
how
can
I
be
alive
i
think
you
know
said
Dumbledore
think
back
remember
what
he
did
in
his
ignorance
in
his
greed
and
his
cruelty
harry
thought
he
let
his
gaze
drift
over
his
surroundings
if
it
was
indeed
a
palace
in
which
they
sat
it
was
an
odd
one
with
chairs
set
in
little
rows
and
bits
of
railing
here
and
there
and
still
he
and
Dumbledore
and
the
stunted
creatures
under
the
chair
were
the
only
beings
there
then
the
answer
rose
to
his
lips
easily
without
effort
he
took
my
blood
said
Harry
precisely
said
Dumbledore
he
took
your
blood
and
rebuilt
his
living
body
with
it
your
blood
in
his
veins
Harry
Lilys
protection
inside
both
of
you
he
thethered
you
to
life
while
he
lives
i
live
while
he
lives
but
I
thought
i
thought
it
was
the
other
way
around
i
thought
we
both
had
to
die
or
is
it
the
same
thing
he
was
distracted
by
the
whimpering
and
thumping
of
the
agonized
creature
behind
them
and
glanced
back
at
it
yet
again
are
you
sure
we
cant
do
anything
there
is
no
help
possible
then
explain
more
said
Harry
and
Dumbledore
smiled
you
were
the
seventh
Horcrux
Harry
the
Horcrux
he
never
meant
to
make
he
had
rendered
his
soul
so
unstable
that
it
broke
apart
when
he
committed
those
acts
of
unspeakable
evil
the
murder
of
your
parents
the
attempted
killing
of
a
child
but
what
escaped
from
that
room
was
even
less
than
he
knew
he
left
more
than
his
body
behind
he
left
part
of
himself
latched
to
you
the
would-be
victim
who
had
survived
and
his
knowledge
remained
woefully
incomplete
Harry
that
which
Voldemort
does
not
value
he
takes
no
trouble
to
comprehend
of
house-elves
and
childrens
tales
of
love
loyalty
and
innocence
Voldemort
knows
and
understands
nothing
nothing
that
they
all
have
a
power
beyond
his
own
a
power
beyond
the
reach
of
any
magic
is
a
truth
he
has
never
grasped
he
took
your
blood
believing
it
would
strengthen
him
he
took
into
his
body
a
tiny
part
of
the
enchantment
your
mother
laid
upon
you
when
she
died
for
you
his
body
keeps
her
sacrafice
alive
and
while
that
enchantment
survives
so
do
you
and
so
does
Voldemorts
one
last
hope
for
himself
dumbledore
smiled
at
Harry
and
Harry
stared
at
him
and
you
knew
this
you
knew
all
along
i
guessed
but
my
guesses
have
usually
been
good
said
Dumbledore
happily
and
they
sat
in
silence
for
what
seemed
like
a
long
time
while
the
creature
behind
them
continued
to
whimper
and
tremble
theres
more
said
Harry
theres
more
to
it
why
did
my
wand
break
the
wand
he
borrowed
as
to
that
I
cannot
be
sure
have
a
guess
then
said
Harry
and
Dumbledore
laughed
what
you
must
understand
Harry
is
that
you
and
Lord
Voldemort
have
journeyed
together
into
realms
of
magic
hitherto
unknown
and
untested
but
here
is
what
i
think
happened
and
it
is
unprecedented
and
no
wandmaker
could
I
think
ever
have
predicted
or
explained
it
to
Voldemort
without
meaning
to
as
you
now
know
Lord
Voldemort
doubled
the
bond
between
you
when
he
returned
to
a
human
form
a
part
of
his
soul
was
still
attached
to
yours
and
thinking
to
strengthen
himself
he
took
a
part
of
your
mothers
sacrafice
into
himself
if
he
could
only
have
understood
the
precise
and
terrible
power
of
that
sacrifice
he
would
not
perhaps
have
dared
to
touch
your
blood
but
then
if
he
had
been
able
to
understand
he
could
not
be
Lord
Voldemort
and
might
never
have
murdered
at
all
having
ensured
this
two-fold
connection
having
wrapped
your
destinies
together
more
securely
than
ever
two
wizards
were
joined
in
history
Voldemort
proceeded
to
attack
you
with
a
wand
that
shared
a
core
with
yours
and
now
something
very
strange
happened
as
we
know
the
cores
reacted
in
a
way
that
Lord
Voldemort
who
never
knew
that
your
wand
was
a
twin
of
his
had
ever
expected
he
was
more
afraid
than
you
were
that
night
Harry
you
had
accepted
even
embraced
the
possibility
of
death
something
Lord
Voldemort
has
never
been
able
to
do
your
courage
won
your
wand
overpowered
his
and
in
doing
so
something
happened
between
those
wands
something
that
echoed
the
relationship
between
their
masters
i
believe
that
your
wand
imbibed
some
of
the
power
and
qualities
of
Voldemorts
wand
that
night
which
is
to
say
that
it
contained
a
little
of
Voldemort
himself
so
your
wand
recognized
him
when
he
pursued
you
recognized
a
man
who
was
both
kin
and
mortal
enemy
and
it
regurgitated
some
of
his
own
magic
against
him
magic
much
more
powerful
than
anything
Luciuss
wand
had
ever
performed
your
wand
now
contained
the
power
of
your
enormous
courage
and
of
Voldemorts
own
deadly
skill
What
chance
did
that
poor
stick
of
Lucius
Malfoys
stand
but
if
my
wand
was
so
powerful
how
come
Hermione
was
able
to
break
it
asked
Harry
my
dear
boy
its
remarkable
effects
were
directed
only
at
Voldemort
who
had
tampered
so
ill-advisedly
with
the
deepest
laws
of
magic
only
toward
him
was
that
wand
abnormally
powerful
otherwise
it
was
a
wand
like
any
other
though
a
good
one
I
am
sure
Dumbledore
finished
kindly
harry
sat
in
thought
for
a
long
time
or
perhaps
seconds
it
was
very
hard
to
be
sure
of
things
like
time
here
he
killed
me
with
your
wand
he
failed
to
kill
you
with
my
wand
Dumbledore
corrected
Harry
i
think
we
can
agree
that
you
are
not
dead
though
of
course
he
added
as
if
fearing
he
had
been
discourteous
I
do
not
minimize
your
sufferings
which
I
am
sure
were
severe
i
feel
great
at
the
moment
though
said
Harry
looking
down
at
his
clean
unblemished
hands
where
are
we
exactly
well
I
was
going
to
ask
you
that
said
Dumbledore
looking
around
where
would
you
say
that
we
are
until
Dumbledore
had
asked
Harry
had
not
known
now
however
he
found
that
he
had
an
answer
ready
to
give
it
looks
he
said
slowly
like
Kings
Cross
station
except
a
lo
cleaner
and
empty
and
there
are
no
trains
as
far
as
I
can
see
kings
Cross
station
dumbledore
was
chuckling
immoderately
good
gracious
really
well
where
do
you
think
we
are
asked
Harry
a
little
defensively
my
dear
boy
I
have
no
idea
this
is
as
they
say
your
party
harry
had
no
idea
what
this
meant
Dumbledore
was
being
infuriating
he
glared
at
him
then
remembered
a
much
more
pressing
question
than
that
of
their
current
location
the
Deathly
Hallows
he
said
and
he
was
glad
to
see
that
the
words
wiped
the
smile
from
Dumbledores
face
ah
yes
he
said
he
even
looked
a
little
worried
well
for
the
first
time
since
Harry
had
met
Dumbledore
he
looked
less
than
an
old
man
much
less
he
looked
fleetingly
like
a
small
boy
caught
in
wrongdoing
can
you
forgive
me
he
said
can
you
forgive
me
for
not
trusting
you
for
not
telling
you
harry
I
only
feared
that
you
would
fail
as
I
had
failed
i
only
dreaded
that
you
would
make
my
mistakes
i
crave
your
pardon
Harry
i
have
known
for
some
time
now
that
you
are
the
better
man
what
are
you
talking
about
asked
Harry
startled
by
Dumbledores
tone
by
the
sudden
tears
in
his
eyes
the
Hallows
the
Hallows
murmured
Dumbledore
a
desperate
mans
dream
but
theyre
real
real
and
dangerous
and
a
lure
for
fools
said
Dumbledore
and
I
was
such
a
fool
but
you
know
dont
you
i
have
no
secrets
from
you
anymore
you
know
what
do
I
know
dumbledore
turned
his
whole
body
to
face
Harry
and
tears
still
sparkled
in
the
brilliantly
blue
eyes
master
of
death
Harry
master
of
Death
was
I
better
ultimately
than
Voldemort
of
course
you
were
said
Harry
of
course
how
can
you
ask
that
you
never
killed
if
you
could
avoid
it
true
true
said
Dumbledore
and
he
was
like
a
child
seeking
reassurance
yet
I
too
sought
a
way
to
conquer
death
Harry
not
the
way
he
did
said
Harry
after
all
his
anger
at
Dumbledore
how
odd
it
was
to
sit
here
beneath
the
high
vaulted
ceiling
and
defend
Dumbledore
from
himself
hallows
not
Horcruxes
hallows
murmured
Dumbledore
not
Horcruxes
precisely
there
was
a
pause
the
creature
behind
them
whimpered
but
Harry
no
longer
looked
around
grindelwald
was
looking
for
them
too
he
asked
dumbledore
closed
his
eyes
for
a
moment
and
nodded
it
was
the
thing
above
all
that
drew
us
together
he
said
quietly
two
clever
arrogant
boys
with
a
shared
obsession
he
wanted
to
come
to
Godrics
Hollow
as
I
am
sure
you
have
guessed
because
of
the
grave
of
Ignotus
Peverell
he
wanted
to
explore
the
place
the
third
brother
had
died
so
its
true
asked
Harry
all
of
it
the
Peverell
brothers
were
the
three
brothers
of
the
tale
said
Dumbledore
nodding
oh
yes
I
think
so
whether
they
met
Death
on
a
lonely
road
i
think
it
more
likely
that
the
peverell
brothers
were
simply
gifted
dangerous
wizards
who
succeeded
in
creating
those
powerful
objects
the
story
of
them
being
Deaths
own
Hallows
seems
to
me
the
sort
of
legend
that
might
have
sprung
up
around
such
creations
the
Cloak
as
you
know
now
traveled
down
through
the
ages
father
to
son
mother
to
daughter
right
down
to
Ignotuss
last
living
descendant
who
was
born
as
Ignotus
was
in
the
village
of
Godrics
Hollow
dumbledore
smiled
at
Harry
me
you
you
have
guessed
I
know
why
the
Cloak
was
in
my
possession
on
the
night
your
parents
died
james
had
showed
it
to
me
just
a
few
days
previously
it
explained
much
of
his
undetected
wrongdoing
at
school
i
could
hardly
believe
what
I
was
seeing
i
asked
to
borrow
it
to
examine
it
i
had
long
since
given
up
my
dream
of
uniting
the
Hallows
but
I
could
not
resist
could
not
help
taking
a
closer
look
it
was
a
Cloak
the
likes
of
which
I
had
never
seen
immensely
old
perfect
in
every
respect
and
then
your
father
died
and
I
had
two
Hallows
at
last
all
to
myself
his
tone
was
unbearably
bitter
the
Cloak
wouldnt
have
helped
them
survive
though
Harry
said
quickly
voldemort
knew
where
my
mum
and
dad
were
the
Cloak
couldnt
have
made
them
curse-proof
true
sighed
Dumbledore
true
harry
waited
but
Dumbledore
did
not
speak
so
he
prompted
him
so
youd
given
up
looking
for
the
Hallows
when
you
saw
the
Cloak
oh
yes
said
Dumbledore
faintly
it
seemed
that
he
forced
himself
to
meet
Harrys
eyes
you
know
what
happened
you
know
you
cannot
despise
me
more
than
I
despise
myself
but
I
dont
despise
you
then
you
should
said
Dumbledore
he
drew
a
deep
breath
you
know
the
secret
of
my
sisters
ill
health
what
those
Muggles
did
what
she
became
you
know
how
my
poor
father
sought
revenge
and
paid
the
price
died
In
Azkaban
you
know
how
my
mother
gave
up
her
own
life
to
care
for
Ariana
i
resented
it
Harry
dumbledore
stated
it
baldly
coldly
he
was
looking
now
over
the
top
of
Harrys
head
into
the
distance
i
was
gifted
I
was
brilliant
i
wanted
to
escape
i
wanted
to
shine
i
wanted
glory
do
not
misunderstand
me
he
said
and
pain
crossed
the
face
so
that
he
looked
ancient
again
i
loved
them
I
loved
my
parents
I
loved
my
brother
and
my
sister
but
I
was
selfish
Harry
more
selfish
than
you
who
are
a
remarkably
selfless
person
could
possibly
imagine
so
that
when
my
mother
died
and
I
was
left
the
responsibility
of
a
damaged
sister
and
a
wayward
brother
I
returned
to
my
village
in
anger
and
bitterness
trapped
and
wasted
I
thought
and
then
of
course
he
came
dumbledore
looked
directly
into
Harrys
eyes
again
grindelwald
you
cannot
imagine
how
his
ideas
caught
me
Harry
inflamed
me
muggles
forced
into
subservience
we
wizards
triumphant
grindelwald
and
I
the
glorious
young
leaders
of
the
revolution
oh
I
had
a
few
scruples
i
assuaged
my
conscience
with
empty
words
it
would
all
be
for
the
greater
good
and
any
harm
done
would
be
repaid
a
hundredfold
in
benefits
for
wizards
did
I
know
in
my
heart
of
hearts
what
Gellert
Grindelwald
was
i
think
I
did
but
I
closed
my
eyes
if
the
plans
we
were
making
came
to
fruition
all
my
dreams
would
come
true
and
at
the
heart
of
our
schemes
the
Deathly
Hallows
how
they
fascinated
him
how
they
fascinated
both
of
us
the
unbeatable
wand
the
weapon
that
would
lead
us
to
power
the
Resurrection
Stone
to
him
though
I
pretended
not
to
know
it
it
meant
an
army
of
Inferi
to
me
I
confess
it
meant
the
return
of
my
parents
and
the
lifting
of
all
responsibility
from
my
shoulders
and
the
Cloak
somehow
we
never
discussed
the
Cloak
much
Harry
both
of
us
could
conceal
ourselves
well
enough
without
the
Cloak
the
true
magic
of
which
of
course
is
that
it
can
be
used
to
protect
and
shield
others
as
well
as
its
owner
i
thought
that
if
we
ever
found
it
it
might
be
useful
in
hiding
Ariana
but
our
interest
in
the
Cloak
was
mainly
that
it
completed
the
trio
for
the
legend
said
that
the
man
who
had
united
all
three
objects
would
then
be
truly
master
of
death
which
we
took
to
mean
invincible
invincible
masters
of
death
Grindelwald
and
Dumbledore
two
months
of
insanity
of
cruel
dreams
and
neglect
of
the
only
two
members
of
my
family
left
to
me
and
then
you
know
what
happened
reality
returned
in
the
form
of
my
rough
unlettered
and
infinitely
more
admirable
brother
i
did
not
want
to
hear
the
truths
he
shouted
at
me
i
did
not
want
to
hear
that
I
could
not
set
forth
and
seek
Hallows
with
a
fragile
and
unstable
sister
in
tow
the
argument
became
a
fight
grindelwald
lost
control
that
which
I
had
always
sensed
in
him
though
I
pretended
not
to
now
sprang
into
terrible
being
and
Ariana
after
all
my
mothers
care
and
caution
lay
dead
upon
the
floor
dumbledore
gave
a
little
gasp
and
began
to
cry
in
earnest
harry
reached
out
and
was
glad
to
find
that
he
could
touch
him
He
gripped
his
arm
tightly
and
Dumbledore
gradually
regained
control
well
Grindelwald
fled
as
anyone
but
I
could
have
predicted
he
vanished
with
his
plans
for
seizing
power
and
his
schemes
for
Muggle
torture
and
his
dreams
of
the
Deathly
Hallows
dreams
in
which
I
had
encouraged
him
and
helped
him
he
ran
while
I
was
left
to
bury
my
sister
and
learn
to
live
with
my
guilt
and
my
terrible
grief
the
price
of
my
shame
years
passed
there
were
rumors
about
him
they
said
he
had
procured
a
wand
of
immense
power
i
meanwhile
was
offered
the
post
of
Minister
of
Magic
not
once
but
several
times
naturally
I
refused
i
had
learned
that
I
was
not
to
be
trusted
with
power
but
youd
have
been
better
much
better
than
Fudge
or
Scimgeour
burst
out
Harry
would
I
asked
Dumbledore
heavily
i
am
not
so
sure
i
had
proven
as
a
very
young
man
that
power
was
my
weakness
and
my
temptation
it
is
a
curious
thing
Harry
but
perhaps
those
who
are
best
suited
to
power
are
those
who
have
never
sought
it
those
who
like
you
have
leadership
thrust
upon
them
and
take
up
the
mantle
because
they
must
and
find
to
their
own
surprise
that
they
wear
it
well
i
was
safer
at
Hogwarts
i
think
I
was
a
good
teacher
you
were
the
best
you
are
very
kind
Harry
but
while
I
busied
myself
with
the
training
of
young
wizards
Grindelwald
was
raising
an
army
they
say
he
feared
me
and
perhaps
he
did
but
less
I
think
than
I
feared
him
oh
not
death
said
Dumbledore
in
answer
to
Harrys
questioning
look
not
what
he
could
do
to
me
magically
i
knew
that
we
were
evenly
matched
perhaps
that
I
was
a
shade
more
skillful
it
was
the
truth
I
feared
you
see
I
never
knew
which
of
us
in
that
last
horrific
fight
had
actually
cast
the
curse
that
killed
my
sister
you
may
call
me
cowardly
You
would
be
right
Harry
i
dreaded
beyond
all
things
the
knowledge
that
it
had
been
I
who
brought
about
her
death
not
merely
through
my
arrogance
and
stupidity
but
that
I
actually
struck
the
blow
that
snuffed
out
her
life
i
think
he
knew
it
I
think
he
knew
what
frightened
me
i
delayed
meeting
him
until
finally
it
would
have
been
too
shameful
to
resist
any
longer
people
were
dying
and
he
seemed
unstoppable
and
I
had
to
do
what
I
could
well
you
know
what
happened
next
i
won
the
duel
i
won
the
wand
another
silence
harry
did
not
ask
whether
Dumbledore
had
ever
found
out
who
struck
Ariana
dead
he
did
not
want
to
know
and
even
less
did
he
want
Dumbledore
to
have
to
tell
him
at
last
he
knew
what
Dumbledore
would
have
seen
when
he
looked
in
the
mirror
of
Erised
and
why
Dumbledore
had
been
so
understanding
of
the
fascination
it
had
exercised
over
Harry
they
sat
in
silence
for
a
long
time
and
the
whipmerings
of
the
creature
behind
them
barely
disturbed
Harry
anymore
at
last
he
said
Grindelwald
tried
to
stop
Voldemort
going
after
the
wand
he
lied
you
know
pretended
he
had
never
had
it
dumbledore
nodded
looking
down
at
his
lap
tears
still
glittering
on
the
crooked
nose
they
say
he
showed
remorse
in
later
years
alone
in
his
cell
at
Nurmengard
i
hope
that
is
true
i
would
like
to
think
that
he
did
feel
the
horror
and
shame
of
what
he
had
done
perhaps
that
lie
to
Voldemort
was
his
attempt
to
make
amends
to
prevent
Voldemort
from
taking
the
Hallow
or
maybe
from
breaking
into
your
tomb
suggested
Harry
and
Dumbledore
dabbed
his
eyes
after
another
short
pause
Harry
said
You
tried
to
use
the
Resurrection
Stone
dumbledore
nodded
when
I
discovered
it
after
all
those
years
buried
in
the
abandoned
home
of
the
Gaunts
the
Hallow
I
had
craved
most
of
all
though
in
my
youth
I
had
wanted
it
for
very
different
reasons
I
lost
my
head
Harry
i
quite
forgot
that
I
was
not
a
Horcrux
that
the
ring
was
sure
to
carry
a
curse
i
picked
it
up
and
I
put
it
on
and
for
a
second
I
imagined
that
I
was
about
to
see
Ariana
and
my
mother
and
my
father
and
to
tell
them
how
very
very
sorry
I
was
i
was
such
a
fool
Harry
after
all
those
years
I
had
learned
nothing
i
was
unworthy
to
unite
the
Deathly
Hallows
I
had
proved
it
time
and
again
and
here
was
final
proof
why
said
Harry
it
was
natural
you
wanted
to
see
them
again
whats
wrong
with
that
maybe
a
man
in
a
million
could
unite
the
Hallows
Harry
i
was
fit
only
to
possess
the
meanest
of
them
the
least
extraordinary
i
was
fit
to
own
the
Elder
Wand
and
not
boast
of
it
and
not
to
kill
with
it
i
was
permitted
to
tame
and
use
it
because
I
took
it
not
for
gain
but
to
save
others
from
it
but
the
Cloak
I
took
out
of
vain
curiousity
and
so
it
could
never
have
worked
for
me
as
it
works
for
you
its
true
owners
the
stone
I
would
have
used
in
an
attempt
to
drag
back
those
who
are
at
peace
rather
than
enable
my
self-sacrafice
as
you
did
you
are
the
worthy
possessor
of
the
Hallows
dumbledore
patted
Harrys
hand
and
Harry
looked
up
at
the
old
man
and
smiled
he
could
not
help
himself
how
coul
dhe
remain
angry
with
Dumbledore
now
why
did
you
have
to
make
it
so
difficult
dumbledores
smile
was
tremulous
i
am
afraid
I
counted
on
Miss
Granger
to
slow
you
up
Harry
i
was
afraid
that
your
hot
head
might
dominate
your
good
heart
i
was
scared
that
if
presented
outright
with
the
facts
about
those
tempting
objects
you
might
seize
the
Hallows
as
I
did
at
the
wrong
time
for
the
wrong
reasons
if
you
laid
hands
on
them
I
wanted
you
to
possess
them
safely
you
are
the
true
master
of
death
because
the
true
master
does
not
seek
to
run
away
from
Death
he
accepts
that
he
must
die
and
understands
that
there
are
far
far
worse
things
in
the
living
world
than
dying
and
Voldemort
never
knew
about
the
Hallows
i
do
not
think
so
because
he
did
not
recognize
the
Resurrection
Stone
he
turned
into
a
Horcrux
but
even
if
he
had
known
about
them
Harry
i
doubt
that
he
woul
dhave
been
interested
in
any
except
the
first
he
would
not
think
that
he
needed
the
Cloak
and
as
for
the
stone
whom
would
he
want
to
bring
back
from
the
dead
he
fears
the
dead
he
does
not
love
but
you
expected
him
to
go
after
the
wand
i
have
been
sure
that
he
would
try
ever
since
your
wand
beat
Voldemorts
in
the
graveyard
of
Little
Hangleton
at
first
he
was
afraid
that
you
had
conquered
him
by
superior
skill
once
he
had
kidnapped
Ollivander
however
he
discovered
the
existence
of
the
twin
cores
he
thought
that
explained
everything
yet
the
borrowed
wand
did
no
better
against
yours
so
Voldemort
instead
of
asking
himself
what
quality
it
was
in
you
that
had
made
your
wand
so
strong
what
gift
you
possessed
that
he
did
not
naturally
set
out
to
find
the
one
wand
that
they
said
would
beat
any
other
for
him
the
Elder
Wand
has
become
an
obsession
to
rival
his
obsession
with
you
he
believes
that
the
Elder
Wand
removes
his
last
weakness
and
makes
him
truly
invincible
poor
Severus
if
you
planned
your
death
with
Snape
you
meant
him
to
end
up
with
the
Elder
Wand
didnt
you
i
admit
that
was
my
intention
said
Dumbledore
but
it
did
not
work
as
I
intended
did
it
no
said
Harry
that
bit
didnt
work
out
the
creature
behind
them
jerked
and
moaned
and
Harry
and
Dumbledore
sate
without
talking
for
the
longest
time
yet
the
realization
of
what
would
happen
next
settled
gradually
over
Harry
in
the
long
minutes
like
softly
falling
snow
ive
got
to
go
back
havent
I
that
is
up
to
you
ive
got
a
choice
oh
yes
Dumbledore
smiled
at
him
we
are
in
Kings
Cross
you
say
i
think
that
if
you
decided
not
to
go
back
you
would
be
able
to
lets
say
board
a
train
and
where
would
it
take
me
on
said
Dumbledore
simply
silence
again
voldemorts
got
the
Elder
Wand
true
voldemort
has
the
Elder
Wand
but
you
want
me
to
go
back
i
think
said
Dumbledore
that
if
you
choose
to
return
there
is
a
chance
that
he
may
be
finished
for
good
i
cannot
promise
it
but
I
know
this
Harry
that
you
have
less
to
fear
from
returning
here
than
he
does
harry
glanced
again
at
the
raw
looking
thing
that
trembled
and
choked
in
the
shadow
beneath
the
distant
chair
do
not
pity
the
dead
Harry
pity
the
living
and
above
all
those
who
live
without
love
by
returning
you
may
ensure
that
fewer
souls
are
maimed
fewer
families
are
torn
apart
if
that
seems
to
you
a
worthy
goal
they
we
saw
good-bye
for
the
present
harry
nodded
and
sighed
leaving
this
place
would
not
be
nearly
as
hard
as
walking
into
the
forest
had
been
but
it
was
warm
and
light
and
peaceful
here
and
he
knew
that
he
was
heading
back
to
pain
and
the
fear
of
more
loss
he
stood
up
and
Dumbledore
did
the
same
and
they
looked
for
a
long
moment
into
each
others
faces
tell
me
one
last
thing
said
Harry
Is
this
real
or
has
this
been
happening
inside
my
head
dumbledore
beamed
at
him
and
his
voice
sounded
loud
and
strong
in
Harrys
ears
even
though
the
bright
mist
was
descending
again
obscuring
his
figure
of
course
it
is
happening
inside
your
head
Harry
but
why
on
earth
should
that
mean
it
is
not
real
chapter
Thirty-Six
the
Flaw
in
the
Plan
he
was
flying
facedown
on
the
grond
again
the
smell
of
the
forest
filled
his
nostrils
he
could
feel
the
cold
hard
ground
beneath
his
cheek
and
the
hinge
of
his
glasses
which
have
been
knocked
sideways
by
the
fall
cutting
into
his
temple
every
inch
of
him
ached
and
the
place
where
Killing
Curse
had
hit
him
felt
like
the
bruise
of
an
iron-clad
punch
he
did
not
stir
but
he
remained
exactly
where
he
had
fallen
with
his
left
arm
bent
out
at
an
akward
angle
and
his
mouth
gaping
he
had
expected
to
hear
cheer
of
triumph
and
jubilation
at
his
death
but
instead
hurried
footsteps
whispers
and
solicitous
murmurs
filled
the
air
my
Lord
my
Lord
it
was
bellatrix's
voice
and
she
spoke
as
if
to
a
lover
harry
did
not
dare
open
his
eyes
but
allowed
his
other
senses
to
explore
his
predicament
he
knew
that
his
wand
was
still
stowed
beneath
his
robes
because
he
could
feel
it
pressed
between
his
chest
and
the
ground
a
slight
cushioning
effect
in
the
area
of
his
stomach
told
him
that
the
Invisibility
Cloak
was
also
there
stuffed
out
of
sight
my
Lord
that
will
do
said
voldemort's
voice
more
footsteps
several
people
were
backing
away
from
the
same
spot
desperate
to
see
what
was
happening
and
why
Harry
opened
his
eyes
by
a
milimeter
voldemort
seemed
to
be
getting
to
his
feet
various
Death
Eaters
were
hurrying
away
from
him
returning
to
the
crowd
lining
the
clearing
bellatrix
alone
remained
behind
kneeling
beside
Voldemort
harry
closed
his
eyes
again
and
considered
what
he
had
seen
the
Death
Eaters
have
been
buddled
around
Voldemort
who
seem
to
have
fallen
to
the
ground
something
had
happened
when
he
had
hit
Harry
with
the
Killing
Curse
had
Voldemort
too
collapsed
it
seemed
like
it
and
both
of
them
had
briefly
fallen
unconcious
and
both
of
them
had
now
returned
my
Lord
let
me
i
do
not
require
assitance
said
Voldemort
coldly
and
though
he
could
not
see
it
Harry
pictured
bellatrix
withdrawing
a
helpful
hand
the
boy
is
he
dead
there
was
a
complete
silence
in
the
clearing
nobody
approached
Harry
but
he
felt
their
concentraded
gaze
it
seemed
to
press
him
harder
into
the
ground
and
he
was
terrified
a
finger
or
an
eyelid
might
twitch
you
said
Voldemort
and
there
was
a
bang
and
a
small
shrick
of
pain
examine
him
tell
me
whether
he
is
dead
harry
did
not
know
who
had
been
sent
to
verify
he
could
only
lie
there
with
his
heart
thumping
traitorously
and
wait
to
be
examined
but
at
the
same
time
nothing
small
comfort
through
it
was
that
Voldemort
was
wary
of
approaching
him
that
Voldemort
suspected
that
all
had
not
gone
to
plan
hands
softer
than
he
had
been
expecting
touched
harry's
face
and
felt
his
heart
he
could
hear
the
woman's
fast
breathing
her
pounding
of
life
against
his
ribs
is
Draco
alive
is
he
in
the
castle
the
whisper
was
barely
audible
her
lips
were
an
inch
from
his
car
her
head
bent
so
low
that
her
long
hair
shielded
his
face
from
the
onlookers
yes
he
breathed
back
he
felt
the
hand
on
his
chest
contract
her
nails
pierced
him
then
it
was
withdrawn
she
had
sat
up
he
is
dead
narcissa
Malfoy
called
to
the
watchers
and
now
they
shouted
now
they
yelled
in
triumph
and
stamped
their
feet
and
through
his
eyelids
Harry
saw
bursts
of
red
and
silver
light
shoot
into
the
air
in
celebration
still
feigning
death
on
the
ground
he
understood
narcissa
knew
that
the
only
way
she
would
be
permitted
to
enter
Hogwarts
and
find
her
son
was
as
part
of
the
conquering
army
she
no
longer
cared
whether
Voldemort
won
you
see
screeched
Voldemort
over
the
tumult
harry
Potter
is
dead
by
my
hand
and
no
man
alive
can
threaten
me
now
watch
crucio
harry
had
been
expecting
it
knew
his
body
would
not
be
allowed
to
remain
unsullied
upon
the
forest
floor
it
must
be
subjected
to
humiliation
to
prove
voldemort's
victory
he
was
lifted
into
the
air
and
it
took
all
his
determination
to
remain
limp
yet
the
pain
he
expected
did
not
come
he
was
thrown
once
twice
three
times
into
the
air
his
glasses
flew
off
and
he
felt
his
wand
slide
a
little
beneath
his
robes
but
he
kept
himself
floppy
and
lifeless
and
when
he
fell
no
ground
for
the
last
time
the
clearing
echoed
with
jeers
and
shrieks
of
laughter
now
said
Voldemort
we
go
to
the
castle
and
show
them
what
has
become
of
their
hero
who
shall
drag
the
body
no
Wait
there
was
a
fresh
outbreak
of
laughter
and
after
a
few
moments
Harry
felt
the
ground
trembling
beneath
him
you
carry
him
Voldemort
said
he
will
be
nice
and
visible
in
your
arms
will
he
not
pick
up
your
little
friend
Hagrid
and
the
glasses
put
on
the
glasses
he
must
be
recognizable
someone
slammed
harry's
glasses
back
onto
his
face
with
deliberate
force
but
the
enormous
hands
that
lifted
him
into
the
air
were
exceedingly
gentle
harry
could
feel
hagrid's
arms
trembling
with
the
force
of
his
heaving
sobs
great
tears
splashed
down
upon
him
as
Hagrid
cradled
Harry
in
his
arms
and
Harry
did
not
dare
by
movement
or
word
to
intimate
to
Hagrid
that
all
was
not
yet
lost
move
said
Voldemort
and
Hagrid
stumbled
forward
forcing
his
way
through
the
close-growing
trees
back
through
the
forest
branches
caught
at
harry's
hair
and
robes
but
he
lay
quiescent
his
mouth
lolling
open
his
eyes
shut
and
in
the
darkness
while
the
death
Eaters
croed
all
around
them
and
while
Hagrid
sobbed
blindly
nobody
looked
to
see
whether
a
pulse
beat
in
the
exposed
neck
of
harry
Potter
the
two
giants
crashed
along
behind
the
Death
Eaters
Harry
could
hear
trees
creaking
and
falling
as
they
passed
they
made
so
much
din
that
birds
toes
shrieking
into
the
sky
and
even
the
jeers
of
the
Death
Eaters
were
drowned
the
victorious
procession
marched
on
toward
the
open
ground
and
after
a
while
Harry
could
tell
by
the
lightening
of
the
darkness
through
his
closed
eyelids
that
the
trees
were
beginning
to
thin
bane
hagrid's
unexpected
bellow
nearly
forced
harry's
eyes
open
happy
now
are
yeh
that
yeh
didn't
fight
yeh
cowardly
bunch
o
nags
are
yeh
happy
Harry
potter's
d-dead
hagrid
could
not
continue
but
broke
down
in
fresh
tears
harry
wondered
how
many
centaurs
were
watching
their
procession
pass
he
dared
not
open
his
eyes
to
look
some
of
the
Death
Eaters
called
insults
at
the
centaurs
as
they
left
them
behind
a
little
later
Harry
sensed
by
a
freshening
of
the
air
that
they
had
reached
the
edge
of
the
forest
stop
harry
thought
that
Hagrid
must
have
been
forced
to
obey
voldemort's
command
because
he
lurched
a
little
and
now
a
chill
settled
over
them
where
they
sood
and
Harry
heard
the
rasping
breath
of
the
dementors
that
patrolled
the
other
trees
they
would
not
affect
him
now
the
fact
of
his
own
survival
burned
inside
him
a
talisman
against
them
as
though
his
father's
stag
kept
guardian
in
his
heart
someone
passed
close
by
Harry
and
he
knew
that
it
was
Voldemort
himself
because
he
spoke
a
moment
later
his
voice
magically
magnified
so
that
it
swelled
through
the
ground
crashing
upon
harry's
eardrums
harry
Potter
is
dead
he
was
killed
as
he
ran
away
trying
to
save
himself
while
you
lay
down
your
lives
for
him
we
bring
you
his
body
as
proof
that
your
hero
is
gone
the
battle
is
won
you
have
lost
half
of
your
fighters
my
Death
Eaters
outnumber
you
and
the
Boy
Who
Lived
is
finished
there
must
be
no
more
war
anyone
who
continues
to
resist
man
woman
or
child
will
be
slaughtered
as
will
every
member
of
their
family
come
out
of
the
castle
now
kneel
before
me
and
you
shall
be
spared
your
parents
and
children
your
brothers
and
sisters
will
live
and
be
forgiven
and
you
will
join
me
in
the
new
world
we
shall
build
togheter
there
was
silence
in
the
grounds
and
from
the
castle
voldemort
was
so
close
to
him
that
Harry
did
not
dare
open
his
eyes
again
come
said
Voldemort
and
Harry
heard
him
move
ahead
and
Hagrid
was
forced
to
follow
now
Harry
opened
his
eyes
a
fraction
and
saw
voldemort
striding
in
front
them
wearing
the
great
snake
Nagini
around
his
shoulders
now
free
of
her
enchanted
cage
but
Harry
had
no
possibility
of
extracting
the
wand
concealed
under
his
robes
without
being
noticed
by
the
Death
Eaters
who
marched
on
the
either
side
of
them
through
the
slowly
lightening
darkness
harry
sobbed
Hagrid
oh
Harry
harry
harry
shut
his
eyes
tight
again
he
knew
that
they
were
approaching
the
castle
and
strained
his
ears
to
distinguish
above
the
gleeful
voices
of
the
Death
Eaters
and
their
tramping
footsteps
signs
of
life
from
those
within
stop
the
Death
Eaters
camte
to
a
halt
Harry
heard
them
spreading
out
in
a
line
facing
the
opne
front
doors
of
the
school
he
could
see
even
though
his
closed
lids
the
teddish
glow
that
meant
light
streamed
upon
him
from
the
entrance
hall
he
waited
any
moment
the
people
for
whom
he
had
tried
to
die
would
see
him
lying
apparently
dead
in
hagrid's
arms
no
the
scream
was
the
more
terrible
because
he
had
never
expected
or
dreamed
that
Professor
McGonagall
could
make
such
a
sound
he
heard
another
women
laughing
nearby
and
knew
that
Bellatrix
gloried
in
mcgonagall's
despair
he
squinted
again
for
a
single
second
and
saw
the
open
doorway
filling
with
people
as
the
survivors
of
the
battle
came
out
onto
the
front
steps
to
face
their
vanquishers
and
see
the
truth
of
harry's
death
for
themselves
he
saw
Voldemort
standing
a
little
in
front
of
him
stroking
nagini's
head
with
a
single
white
finger
he
closed
his
eyes
again
no
no
harry
harry
ron's
hermione's
and
ginny's
voices
were
worse
than
mcgonagall's
Harry
wanted
nothing
more
than
to
call
back
yet
he
made
himself
lie
silent
and
their
cries
acted
like
a
trigger
the
crowd
of
survivors
took
up
the
cause
screaming
and
yelling
abuse
at
the
Death
Eathers
until
silence
cried
Voldemort
and
there
was
a
bang
and
a
flash
of
bright
light
and
silence
was
forced
upn
them
all
it
is
over
set
him
down
hagrid
at
my
feet
where
he
belongs
harry
felt
himself
lowered
onto
the
grass
you
see
said
Voldemort
and
Harry
felt
him
striding
backward
and
forward
right
beside
the
place
where
he
lay
harry
Potter
is
dead
do
you
understand
now
deluded
ones
he
was
nothing
ever
but
a
boy
who
relied
on
others
to
sacrifice
themselves
for
him
he
beat
you
yelled
Ron
and
the
charm
broke
and
the
defenders
of
Hogwarts
were
shouting
and
screaming
again
until
a
second
more
powerful
bang
extinguished
their
voices
once
more
he
was
killed
while
trying
to
sneak
out
of
the
castle
grounds
said
Voldemort
and
there
was
a
relish
in
his
voice
for
the
lie
killed
while
trying
to
save
himself
but
Voldemort
broke
off
Harry
heard
a
scuffle
and
a
shout
then
another
bang
a
flash
of
light
and
grunt
of
pain
he
opened
his
eyes
an
infinitesimal
amount
someone
had
broken
free
of
the
crowd
and
charged
at
Voldemort
Harry
saw
the
figure
hit
the
ground
disarmed
Voldemort
throwing
the
challenger's
wand
aside
and
laughing
and
who
is
this
he
said
in
his
soft
snake's
hiss
who
has
volunteered
to
demonstrate
what
happens
to
those
who
continue
to
fight
when
the
battle
is
lost
bellatrix
gave
a
delighted
laugh
it
is
Neville
Longbottom
my
Lord
the
boy
who
has
been
giving
the
Carrows
so
much
trouble
the
son
of
the
Aurors
remember
ah
yes
I
remember
said
Voldemort
looking
down
at
Neville
who
was
struggling
back
to
his
feet
unarmed
and
unproctected
standing
in
the
no-man's-land
between
the
survivors
and
the
Death
Eaters
but
you
are
a
pureblood
aren't
you
my
brave
boy
voldemort
asked
Neville
who
stood
facing
him
his
empty
hands
curled
in
fists
so
what
if
I
am
said
Neville
loudly
you
show
spirit
and
bravery
and
you
come
of
noble
stock
you
will
make
a
very
valuable
Death
Eater
we
need
your
kind
Neville
Longbottom
i'll
join
you
when
hell
freezes
over
said
Neville
dumbledore's
Army
he
shouted
and
there
was
an
answering
cheer
from
the
crowd
whom
voldemort's
Silencing
Charms
seemed
unable
to
hold
very
well
said
Voldemort
and
Harry
heard
more
danger
in
the
silkiness
of
his
voice
than
in
the
most
powerful
curse
if
that
is
your
choice
Longbottom
we
revert
to
the
original
plan
on
your
head
he
said
quietly
be
it
still
watching
through
his
lashes
Harry
saw
Voldemort
wave
his
wand
seconds
later
out
of
one
of
the
castle's
shattered
windows
something
that
looked
like
a
misshapen
bird
flew
through
the
half
light
and
landed
in
voldemort's
hand
he
shook
the
mildewed
object
by
its
pointed
end
and
it
dangled
emtpy
and
ragged
the
Sorting
Hat
there
will
be
no
more
Sorting
at
Hogwarts
School
said
Voldemort
there
will
be
no
more
Houses
the
emblem
sheild
and
colors
of
my
noble
ancestor
Salazar
Slythering
will
suffice
everyone
won't
they
Neville
Longbottom
he
pointed
his
wand
at
Neville
who
grew
rigid
and
still
then
forced
the
hat
onto
neville's
head
so
thta
it
slipped
down
below
his
eyes
there
were
movements
from
the
watching
crowd
in
front
of
the
castle
and
as
one
the
Death
Eaters
raised
their
wands
holding
the
fighters
of
Hogwarts
at
bay
neville
here
is
now
going
to
demonstrate
what
happens
to
anyone
foolish
enough
to
continue
to
oppose
me
said
Voldemort
and
with
a
flick
of
his
wand
he
caused
the
Sorting
Hat
to
burst
into
flames
screams
split
the
dawn
and
Neville
was
a
flame
rooted
to
the
spot
unable
to
move
and
Harry
could
not
bear
it
He
must
act
and
then
many
things
happened
at
the
same
moment
they
heard
uproar
from
the
distant
boundary
of
the
school
as
what
sounded
like
hundreds
of
people
came
swarming
over
the
out-of-sight
walls
and
pelted
toward
the
castle
uttering
lowd
war
cries
at
the
same
time
Grawp
came
lumbering
around
the
side
of
the
castel
and
yelled
hagger
his
cry
was
answered
by
roars
from
voldemort's
giants
They
ran
at
Grawp
like
bull
elephants
making
the
earth
quake
then
came
hooves
and
the
twangs
of
bows
and
arrows
were
suddenly
falling
amongst
the
Death
Eaters
who
broke
ranks
shouting
their
surprise
harry
pulled
the
Invisibilty
Cloak
from
inside
his
robes
swunt
it
over
himself
and
sprang
to
his
feet
as
Neville
moved
too
in
one
swift
fluid
motin
Neville
broke
free
of
the
Body-Bind
Curse
upon
him
the
flaming
har
fell
off
him
and
he
drew
from
its
depths
something
silver
with
a
glittering
rubied
handle
the
slash
of
the
silver
blade
could
not
be
heard
over
the
roar
of
the
oncoming
crowd
or
the
sounds
of
the
clashing
giants
or
of
te
stampending
centaurs
and
yet
it
seemd
to
draw
every
eye
with
a
single
stroke
Neville
sliced
off
the
great
snake's
head
which
spun
high
into
the
air
gleaming
in
the
light
flooding
from
the
entrance
hall
and
voldemort's
mouth
was
open
in
a
scream
of
fury
that
nobody
could
hear
and
the
snake's
body
thudded
to
the
ground
at
his
feet
hidden
beneath
the
Invisibilty
Cloak
Harry
cast
a
Shield
Charm
between
Neville
and
Voldemort
before
the
latter
could
raise
his
stamps
of
the
battling
giants
hagrid's
yell
came
loudets
of
all
harry
hagrid
shouted
harry
where's
harry
chaos
reigned
the
charging
centaurs
were
scattering
the
Death
Eaters
everyone
was
feeling
the
giants
stamping
feet
and
nearer
and
nearar
thundered
the
reinforcements
that
had
come
from
who
knew
where
Harry
saw
great
winget
creatues
soaring
the
heads
of
voldemort's
giants
thestrals
and
Buckbeak
the
hippogriff
scratching
at
their
eyes
while
Grawp
punched
and
pummeled
them
and
now
the
wizards
defenders
of
Hogwarts
and
Death
Eaters
alike
were
being
forced
back
into
the
castle
harry
was
shooting
jinxes
and
curses
at
any
Death
Eater
he
could
see
and
they
crumpled
not
knowing
what
or
who
had
hit
them
and
their
bodies
were
trampled
by
the
retreating
crowd
still
hidden
beneath
the
Invisibility
Cloak
Harry
was
buffered
into
the
entrance
hall
He
was
searching
for
Voldemort
and
saw
him
across
the
room
firing
spells
from
his
wand
as
he
backed
into
the
Great
Hall
still
screaming
instructions
to
his
followers
as
he
sent
curses
flying
left
and
right
Harry
cast
more
Shield
Charms
and
voldemort's
would-be
victims
seamus
Finnigan
and
Hannah
Abbott
datted
past
him
into
the
Great
Hall
where
they
joined
the
fight
already
flourishing
inside
it
and
now
there
were
more
even
more
people
storming
up
the
front
steps
and
Harry
saw
Charlie
Weasly
overtaking
Horace
Slughorn
who
was
still
wearing
his
emeral
pijamas
they
seemed
to
have
returned
at
the
head
of
what
looked
like
the
families
and
friends
of
every
Hogwarts
student
who
had
remained
to
fight
along
with
the
shopkeeps
and
homeowners
of
Hogsmeade
the
centaurs
Bane
Ronan
and
Magorian
burst
into
the
hall
with
a
great
clatter
of
hooves
as
behind
Harry
the
door
that
led
to
the
kitchens
was
blasted
off
its
hinges
the
house-elves
of
Hogwarts
swarmed
intot
he
entrance
hall
screaming
and
waving
carving
knives
and
cleaver
and
at
their
head
the
locker
of
Regulus
Black
bouncing
on
his
chest
was
Kreacher
his
bullfrog's
voice
audible
even
above
this
din
Fight
fight
fight
for
my
Master
defender
of
house-elves
fight
the
Dark
Lord
in
the
name
of
brave
Regulus
fight
they
were
hacking
and
stabbing
at
the
ankles
and
shim
of
Death
Eaters
their
tiny
faces
alive
with
malice
and
everywhere
Harry
looked
Death
Eaters
were
folding
under
sheer
weight
of
numbers
overcome
by
spells
dragging
arrows
from
wounds
stabbed
in
the
leg
by
elves
or
else
simply
attempting
to
escape
but
swallowed
by
the
oncoming
horde
but
it
was
not
over
yet
Harry
sped
between
duelers
past
atruggling
prosoners
and
into
he
Great
Hall
voldemort
was
in
the
center
of
the
battle
and
he
was
striking
and
smiting
al
within
reach
harry
could
not
get
a
clear
shot
but
fought
his
way
nearer
still
invisible
and
the
Great
Hall
became
more
and
more
crowded
as
everyone
who
could
walk
forced
their
way
inside
harry
saw
Yaxley
slammed
tot
he
floor
by
George
and
Lee
Jordan
saw
Dolohov
fall
with
a
scream
at
flitwick's
hands
saw
Walden
Macnair
thrown
across
the
room
by
Hagrid
hit
the
stone
wall
opposite
and
slide
unconscious
to
the
ground
he
saw
Ron
and
neville
bringing
down
Fenrir
Greyback
aberforth
Stunning
Rookwood
Arthur
and
Percy
flooting
Thicknesse
and
Lucius
and
Narcissa
Malfoy
running
through
the
crowd
not
even
attempting
to
fight
screaming
for
their
son
voldemort
was
now
dueling
McGonagall
Slughorn
Kingsley
all
at
once
and
there
was
a
cold
hatred
in
his
face
as
they
wove
and
ducked
around
him
unable
to
finish
him
bellatrix
was
still
fighing
too
fifty
yards
away
from
Voldemort
and
like
her
master
she
dueled
three
at
once
Hermione
Ginny
and
Luna
all
battling
their
hardest
but
Bellatrix
was
equal
to
them
and
harry's
attention
was
diverted
as
a
Killing
Curse
shot
so
close
to
Ginny
that
she
missed
death
by
an
inch
he
changed
course
running
at
Bellatrix
rather
than
Voldemort
but
before
he
had
gone
a
few
steps
he
was
knocked
sideways
not
my
daughter
you
bitch
mrs
weasley
threw
off
her
cloak
as
she
ran
freeing
her
arms
Bellatrix
spun
on
the
spot
roaring
with
laughter
at
the
sight
of
the
new
challenger
out
of
my
way
shouted
Mrs
weasley
to
the
three
girls
and
with
a
simple
swipe
of
her
wand
she
began
to
duel
harry
watched
with
terror
and
elation
as
Molly
weasley's
wand
slashed
and
twisted
and
Bellatrix
lestrange's
smile
faltered
and
became
a
snarl
jets
of
light
flew
from
both
wands
the
floor
around
the
withces
feet
became
bot
and
cracked
both
woman
were
fighting
to
kill
no
mrs
weasley
cried
as
a
few
students
ran
forward
trying
to
come
to
her
aid
get
back
get
back
she
is
mine
hundreds
of
people
now
lined
the
walls
watching
the
two
fights
Voldemort
and
his
three
opponents
Bellatrix
and
Molly
and
Harry
stood
invisible
torn
between
both
wanting
to
attack
and
yet
to
protect
unable
to
be
sure
that
he
would
not
hit
the
innocent
what
will
happen
to
your
children
when
i've
killed
you
taunted
Bellatrix
as
mad
as
her
master
capering
as
molly's
curses
danced
around
her
when
mummy's
gone
the
same
way
as
Freddie
you
will
never
touch
our
children
again
screamed
Mrs
weasley
bellatrix
laughed
the
same
exhilarated
laugh
her
cousin
Sirius
had
given
as
he
toppled
backward
through
the
veil
and
suddenly
Harry
knew
what
was
going
to
happen
before
it
did
molly's
curse
soared
beneath
bellatrix's
constreched
arm
and
hit
her
squarely
in
the
chest
directly
over
her
heart
bellatrix's
glounting
smile
froze
her
eyes
seemd
to
bulge
For
the
tiniest
space
of
time
she
knew
what
had
happened
and
then
she
toppled
and
the
watching
crowd
roared
and
Voldemord
screamed
harry
felt
as
though
he
turned
into
slow
motin
he
saw
McGonagall
Kingsley
and
Slughorn
blasted
backward
flailing
and
writhing
through
the
air
as
voldemort's
fury
at
the
fall
of
his
last
best
leutenant
exploded
with
the
force
of
a
bomb
Voldemort
raised
his
wand
and
directed
it
at
Molly
Weasley
protego
roared
Harry
and
the
Shield
Charm
expanded
in
the
middle
of
the
Hall
and
Voldemort
stared
around
for
the
source
as
Harry
pulled
off
the
Invisibility
Cloak
at
last
the
yell
of
shock
the
cheers
the
screams
on
every
side
of
Harry
he's
alive
were
stifled
at
once
the
crowd
was
afraid
and
silence
fell
abruptly
and
completely
as
Voldemort
and
Harry
looked
at
each
other
and
began
at
the
same
moment
to
circle
each
other
i
don't
want
anyone
else
to
help
Harry
said
loudly
and
in
the
total
silence
his
voice
carried
like
a
trumpet
call
it's
got
to
be
like
this
it's
got
to
be
me
voldemort
hissed
potter
doesn't
mean
that
he
said
his
red
eyes
wide
this
isn't
how
he
works
is
it
who
are
you
going
to
use
as
a
shield
today
Potter
nobody
said
Harry
simply
there
are
no
more
Horcruxes
it's
just
you
and
me
neither
can
live
while
the
other
survives
and
one
of
us
is
about
to
leave
for
good
one
of
us
jeered
Voldemort
and
his
wholy
body
was
taut
and
his
red
eyes
stared
a
snake
that
was
about
to
strike
you
think
it
will
be
you
do
you
the
boy
who
has
survived
by
accident
and
because
Dumbledore
was
pulling
the
strings
accident
was
it
when
my
mother
died
to
save
me
asked
Harry
they
were
still
moving
sideways
both
of
them
in
that
perfect
circle
maintaining
the
same
distance
from
each
other
and
for
Harry
no
face
existed
but
voldemort's
accident
when
I
decided
to
fight
in
that
graveyard
accident
that
I
didn't
defend
myself
tonight
and
still
survived
and
returned
to
fight
again
accidents
screamed
Voldemort
but
still
he
did
not
strike
and
the
watching
crowd
was
frozen
as
if
Petrified
and
of
the
hundreds
in
the
Hall
nobody
seemed
to
breathe
but
they
two
accident
and
chance
and
the
fact
that
you
crouched
and
sniveled
behind
the
skirts
of
greater
men
and
women
and
permitted
me
to
kill
them
for
you
you
won't
be
killing
anyone
else
tonight
said
Harry
as
they
circled
and
stared
into
each
other's
eyes
green
into
red
you
won't
be
able
to
kill
any
of
them
ever
again
don't
you
get
it
i
was
ready
to
die
to
stop
you
from
hurting
these
people
but
you
did
not
I
meant
to
and
that's
what
did
it
i've
done
what
my
mother
did
they're
protected
from
you
haven't
you
noticed
how
none
of
the
spells
you
put
on
them
are
binding
you
can't
torture
them
you
can't
touch
them
you
don't
learn
from
your
mistakes
Riddle
do
you
you
dare
yes
I
dare
said
Harry
i
know
things
you
don't
know
Tom
Riddle
i
know
lots
of
important
things
that
you
don't
want
to
hear
some
before
you
make
another
big
mistake
voldemort
did
not
speak
but
powled
in
a
circle
and
Harry
knew
that
he
kept
him
temporarily
mesmerized
at
bay
held
back
by
the
faintest
possibility
that
Harry
might
indeed
know
a
final
secret
is
it
love
again
said
Voldemort
his
snake's
face
jeering
dumbledore
favorite
solution
love
which
he
claimed
conqered
death
though
love
did
not
stop
him
falling
from
the
tower
and
breaking
like
and
old
waxwork
love
which
did
not
prevent
me
stamping
out
your
Modblood
mother
like
a
cockroack
Potter
and
nobody
seems
to
love
you
enough
to
run
forward
this
time
and
take
my
curse
so
what
will
stop
you
dying
now
when
I
strike
just
one
thing
said
Harry
and
still
they
circled
each
other
wrapped
in
each
other
held
apart
by
nothing
but
the
last
secret
if
it
is
not
love
that
will
save
you
this
time
said
Voldemort
you
must
believe
that
you
have
magic
that
i
do
not
or
else
a
weapon
more
powerful
than
mine
i
believe
both
said
Harry
and
he
saw
shock
flit
across
the
snakelike
face
though
it
was
instantly
dispelled
Voldemort
began
to
laugh
and
the
sound
was
more
frightening
than
his
screams
humorles
and
insane
it
echoed
around
the
silent
Hall
you
think
you
know
more
magic
than
I
do
he
said
than
I
than
Lord
Voldemort
who
has
performed
magic
that
Dumbledore
himself
never
dreamed
of
oh
he
dreamed
of
it
said
Harry
but
he
knew
more
than
you
knew
enough
not
to
do
what
you've
done
you
mean
he
was
weak
screamed
Voldemort
too
weak
to
dare
too
weak
to
take
what
might
have
been
his
what
will
be
mine
no
he
was
cleverer
than
you
said
Harry
a
better
wizard
a
better
man
i
brought
about
the
death
of
Albus
Dumbledore
you
thought
you
did
said
Harry
but
you
were
wrong
for
the
frist
time
the
watching
crowd
stirred
as
the
hundreds
of
people
around
the
walls
drew
breath
as
one
dumbledore
is
dead
voldemort
hurled
the
words
at
Harry
as
in
the
marble
tomb
in
the
grounds
of
this
castle
I
have
seen
it
Potter
and
he
will
not
return
yes
Dumbledore
is
dead
said
Harry
calmly
but
you
didn't
have
him
killed
he
chose
his
own
manner
of
dying
chose
it
months
before
he
died
arranged
the
whole
thing
with
the
man
you
thought
was
your
servant
what
chldish
dream
is
this
said
Voldemort
but
still
he
did
not
strike
and
his
red
eyes
did
not
waver
from
harry's
severus
Snape
wasn't
yours
said
Harry
snape
was
dumbledore's
dumbledore's
from
the
moment
you
starting
hunting
down
my
mother
and
you
never
realized
it
because
of
the
thing
you
can't
understand
you
never
saw
Snape
cast
a
Patronus
did
you
Riddle
voldemort
did
not
answer
they
continued
to
circle
each
other
like
wolves
about
to
tear
each
other
apart
snape's
Patronus
was
a
doe
said
Harry
the
same
as
my
mother's
because
he
loved
her
for
nearly
all
of
his
life
from
the
time
when
they
were
children
you
should
have
realized
he
said
as
he
saw
voldemort's
nostrils
flare
he
asked
you
to
spare
her
life
didn't
he
he
desired
her
that
was
all
sneered
Voldemort
but
when
she
had
gone
he
agreed
that
there
were
other
women
and
of
purer
blood
worhier
of
him
of
course
he
told
you
that
said
Harry
but
he
was
dumbledore's
spy
from
the
moment
you
threatened
her
and
he's
been
working
against
you
ever
since
dumbledore
was
already
dying
when
Snape
finished
him
it
matters
not
shrieked
Voldemort
who
had
followed
every
word
with
rapt
attention
but
now
let
out
a
cackle
of
mad
laughter
it
matters
not
whether
Snape
was
mine
or
dumbledore's
or
what
petty
obstacles
they
tried
to
put
in
my
path
i
crushed
them
as
I
crushed
your
mother
snape's
supposed
great
love
oh
but
it
all
makes
sense
Potter
and
in
ways
that
you
do
not
understand
dumbledore
was
trying
to
keep
the
Elder
Wand
from
me
he
intended
that
Snape
should
be
the
true
master
of
the
wand
but
I
got
there
ahead
of
you
little
boy
I
reached
the
wand
before
you
could
get
your
hands
on
it
I
understood
the
truth
before
you
caught
up
i
killed
Severus
Snape
three
hours
ago
and
the
Elder
Wand
the
Deathstick
the
Wand
of
Destiny
is
truly
mine
dumbledore's
last
plan
went
wrong
Harry
Potter
yeah
it
did
said
Harry
you're
right
but
before
you
try
to
kill
me
i'd
advise
you
think
what
you've
done
think
and
try
for
some
remorse
Riddle
what
is
this
of
all
the
things
that
Harry
had
said
to
him
beyond
any
revelation
or
taunt
nothing
had
socked
Voldemort
like
this
harry
saw
is
pupils
contract
to
thin
slits
saw
the
skin
around
his
eyes
whiten
it's
your
one
last
chance
said
Harry
it's
all
you've
got
left
i've
seen
what
you'll
be
otherwise
be
a
man
try
try
for
some
remorse
you
dare
said
Voldemort
again
yes
I
dare
said
Harry
because
Dumbledores
last
plan
hasnt
backfired
on
me
at
all
its
backfired
on
you
Riddle
voldemorts
hand
was
trembling
on
the
Elder
Wand
and
Harry
gripped
Dracos
very
tightly
the
moment
he
knew
was
seconds
away
that
wand
still
isnt
working
properly
for
you
because
you
murdered
the
wrong
person
severus
Snape
was
never
the
true
master
of
the
Elder
Wand
he
never
defeated
Dumbledore
he
killed
arent
you
listening
snape
never
beat
Dumbledore
dumbledores
death
was
planned
between
them
dumbledore
instended
to
die
undefeated
the
wands
last
true
master
if
all
had
gone
as
planned
the
wands
power
would
have
died
with
him
because
it
had
never
been
won
from
him
but
then
Potter
Dumbledore
as
good
as
gave
me
the
wand
voldemorts
voice
shook
with
malicious
pleasure
i
stole
the
wand
from
its
last
masters
tomb
i
removed
it
against
the
last
masters
wishes
its
power
is
mine
you
still
dont
get
it
Riddle
do
you
possessing
the
wand
isnt
enough
holding
it
using
it
doesnt
make
it
really
yours
didnt
you
listen
to
Ollivander
the
wand
chooses
the
wizard
the
Elder
Wand
recognized
a
new
master
before
Dumbledore
died
someone
who
never
even
laid
a
hand
on
it
the
new
master
removed
the
wand
from
Dumbledore
against
his
will
never
realizing
exactly
what
he
had
done
or
that
the
worlds
most
dangerous
wand
had
given
him
its
allegiance
voldemorts
chest
rose
and
fell
rapidly
and
Harry
could
feel
the
curse
coming
feel
it
building
inside
the
wand
pointed
at
his
face
the
true
master
of
the
Elder
Wand
was
Draco
Malfoy
blank
shock
showed
in
Voldemorts
face
for
a
moment
but
then
it
was
gone
but
what
does
it
matter
he
said
softly
even
if
you
are
right
Potter
it
makes
no
difference
to
you
and
me
you
no
longer
have
the
phoenix
wand
We
duel
on
skill
alone
and
after
I
have
killed
you
I
can
attend
to
Draco
Malfoy
but
youre
too
late
said
Harry
youve
missed
your
chance
i
got
there
first
i
overpowered
Draco
weeks
ago
i
took
his
wand
from
him
harry
twitched
the
hawthorn
wand
and
he
felt
the
eyes
of
everyone
in
the
Hall
upon
it
so
it
all
comes
down
to
this
doesnt
it
whispered
Harry
does
the
wand
in
your
hand
know
its
last
master
was
Disarmed
because
if
it
does
i
am
the
true
master
of
the
Elder
Wand
a
red-glow
burst
suddenly
across
the
enchanted
sky
above
them
as
an
edge
of
dazzling
sun
appeared
over
the
sill
of
the
nearest
window
the
light
hit
both
of
their
faces
at
the
same
time
so
that
Voldemorts
was
suddenly
a
flaming
blur
harry
heard
the
high
voice
shriek
as
he
too
yelled
his
best
hope
to
the
heavens
pointing
Dracos
wand
avada
Kedavra
expelliarmus
the
bang
was
like
a
cannon
blast
and
the
golden
flames
that
erupted
between
them
at
the
dead
center
of
the
circle
they
had
been
treading
marked
the
point
where
the
spells
collided
harry
saw
Voldemorts
green
jet
meet
his
own
spell
saw
the
Elder
Wand
fly
high
dark
against
the
sunrise
spinning
across
the
enchanted
ceiling
like
the
head
of
Nagini
spinning
through
the
air
toward
the
master
it
would
not
kill
who
had
come
to
take
full
possession
of
it
at
last
and
Harry
with
the
unerring
skill
of
the
Seeker
caught
the
wand
in
his
free
hand
as
Voldemort
fell
backward
arms
splayed
the
slit
pupils
of
the
scarlet
eyes
rolling
upward
tom
Riddle
hit
the
floor
with
a
mundane
finality
his
body
feeble
and
shrunken
the
white
hands
empty
the
snakelike
face
vacant
and
unknowing
voldemort
was
dead
killed
by
his
own
rebounding
curse
and
Harry
stood
with
two
wands
in
his
hand
staring
down
at
his
enemys
shell
one
shivering
second
of
silence
the
shock
of
the
moment
suspended
and
then
the
tumult
broke
around
Harry
as
the
screams
and
the
cheers
and
the
roars
of
the
watchers
rent
the
air
the
fierce
new
sun
dazzled
the
windows
as
they
thundered
toward
him
and
the
first
to
reach
him
were
Ron
and
Hermione
and
it
was
their
arms
that
were
wrapped
around
him
their
incomprehensible
shouts
that
deafened
him
the
Ginny
Neville
and
Luna
were
there
and
then
all
the
Weasleys
and
Hagrid
and
Kingsley
and
McGonagall
and
Flitwick
and
Sprout
and
Harry
could
not
hear
a
word
that
anyone
was
shouting
not
tell
whose
hands
were
seizing
him
pulling
him
trying
to
hug
some
part
of
him
hundreds
of
them
pressing
in
all
of
them
determined
to
touch
the
Boy
Who
Lived
the
reason
it
was
over
at
last
the
sun
rose
steadily
over
Hogwarts
and
the
Great
Hall
blazed
with
life
and
light
harry
was
an
indispensible
part
of
the
mingled
outpourings
of
jubilation
and
mourning
of
grief
and
celebration
they
wanted
him
there
with
them
their
leader
and
symbol
their
savior
and
their
guide
and
that
he
had
not
slept
that
he
craved
the
company
of
only
a
few
of
them
seemed
to
occur
to
no
one
he
must
speak
to
the
bereaved
clasp
their
hands
witness
their
tears
receive
their
thanks
hear
the
news
now
creeping
in
from
every
quarter
as
the
morning
drew
on
that
the
Imperiused
up
and
down
the
country
had
come
back
to
themselves
that
Death
Eaters
were
fleeing
or
else
being
captured
that
the
innocent
of
Azkaban
were
being
released
at
that
very
moment
and
that
Kingsley
Shacklebolt
had
been
named
temporary
Minister
of
Magic
they
moved
Voldemorts
body
and
laid
it
in
a
chamber
off
the
Hall
away
form
the
bodies
of
Fred
Tonks
Lupin
Colin
Creevey
and
fifty
others
who
had
died
fighting
him
mcGonagall
had
replaced
the
House
tables
not
nobody
was
sitting
according
to
House
anymore
All
were
jumbled
together
teachers
and
pupils
ghosts
and
parents
centaurs
and
house-elves
and
Firenze
lay
recovering
in
the
corner
and
Grawp
peered
in
through
a
smashed
window
and
people
were
throwing
food
into
his
laughing
mouth
after
a
while
exhausted
and
drained
Harry
found
himself
sitting
on
a
bench
beside
Luna
id
want
some
peace
and
quiet
if
it
were
me
she
said
id
love
some
he
replied
ill
distract
them
all
she
said
use
your
cloak
and
before
he
could
say
a
word
she
had
cried
Oooh
look
a
Blibbering
humdinger
and
pointed
out
the
window
everyone
who
heard
looked
around
and
Harry
slid
the
Cloak
up
over
himself
and
got
to
his
feet
now
he
could
move
through
the
Hall
without
interference
he
spotted
Ginny
two
tables
away
she
was
sitting
with
her
head
on
her
mothers
shoulder
There
would
be
time
to
talk
later
hours
and
days
and
maybe
years
in
which
to
talk
he
saw
Neville
the
sword
of
Gryffindor
lying
beside
his
plate
as
he
ate
surrounded
by
a
knot
of
fervent
admirers
along
the
aisle
between
the
tables
he
walked
and
he
spotted
the
three
Malfoys
huddled
together
as
though
unsure
whether
or
not
they
were
supposed
to
be
there
but
nobody
was
paying
them
any
attention
everywhere
he
looked
he
saw
families
reunited
and
finally
he
saw
the
two
whose
company
he
craved
most
its
me
he
muttered
crouching
down
between
them
will
you
come
with
me
they
stood
up
at
once
and
together
he
Ron
and
Hermione
left
the
Great
Hall
great
chunks
were
missing
from
the
marble
staircase
part
of
the
balustrade
gone
and
rubble
and
bloodstains
occurred
ever
few
steps
as
their
climbed
somewhere
in
the
distance
they
could
hear
Peeves
zooming
through
the
corridors
singing
a
victory
song
of
his
own
composition
we
did
it
we
bashed
them
wee
Potters
the
one
and
Voldys
gone
moldy
so
now
lets
have
fun
really
gives
a
feeling
for
the
scope
and
tragedy
of
the
thing
doesnt
it
said
Ron
pushing
open
a
door
to
let
Harry
and
Hermione
through
happiness
would
come
Harry
though
but
at
the
moment
it
was
muffled
by
exhaustion
and
the
pain
of
losing
Fred
and
Lupin
and
Tonks
pierced
him
like
a
physical
wound
every
few
steps
most
of
all
he
felt
the
most
stupendous
relief
and
a
longing
to
sleep
but
first
he
owed
an
explanation
to
Ron
and
Hermione
who
had
stuck
with
him
for
so
long
and
who
deserved
the
truth
painstakingly
he
recounted
what
he
had
seem
in
the
Pensieve
and
what
had
happened
in
the
forest
and
they
had
not
even
begun
to
express
all
their
shock
and
amazement
when
at
last
they
arrived
at
the
place
to
which
they
had
been
walking
though
none
of
them
had
mentioned
their
destination
since
he
had
last
seen
it
the
gargoyle
guarding
the
entrance
to
the
headmasters
study
had
been
knocked
aside
it
stood
lopsided
looking
a
little
punch-drunk
and
Harry
wondered
whether
it
would
be
able
to
distinguish
passwords
anymore
can
we
go
up
he
asked
the
gargoyle
feel
free
groaned
the
statue
they
clambered
over
him
and
onto
the
spiral
stone
staircase
that
moved
slowly
upward
like
an
escalator
harry
pushed
open
the
door
at
the
top
he
had
one
brief
glimpse
of
the
stone
Pensieve
on
the
desk
where
he
had
left
it
and
then
an
earsplitting
noise
made
him
cry
out
thinking
of
curses
and
returning
Death
Eaters
and
the
rebirth
of
Voldemort
but
it
was
applause
all
around
the
walls
the
headmasters
and
headmistresses
of
Hogwarts
were
giving
him
a
standing
ovation
they
waved
their
hats
and
in
some
cases
their
wigs
they
reached
through
their
frames
to
grip
each
others
hands
they
danced
up
and
down
on
their
chairs
in
which
they
have
been
painted
Dilys
Derwent
sobbed
unashamedly
Dexter
Fortescue
was
waving
his
ear-trumpet
and
Phineas
Niggelus
called
in
his
high
reedy
voice
And
let
it
be
noted
that
Slytherin
House
played
its
part
let
our
contribution
not
be
forgotten
but
Harry
had
eyes
only
for
the
man
who
stood
in
the
largest
portrait
directly
behind
the
headmasters
chair
tears
were
sliding
down
from
behind
the
half-moon
spectacles
into
the
long
silver
beard
and
the
pride
and
the
gratitude
emanating
from
him
filled
Harry
wit
h
the
same
balm
as
phoenix
song
at
last
Harry
held
up
his
hands
and
the
portraits
fell
respectfully
silent
beaming
and
mopping
their
eyes
and
waiting
eagerly
for
him
to
speak
he
directed
his
words
at
Dumbledore
however
and
chose
them
with
enormous
care
exhausted
and
bleary-eyed
though
he
was
he
must
make
one
last
effort
seeking
one
last
piece
of
advice
the
thing
that
was
hidden
in
the
Snitch
he
began
I
dropped
it
in
the
forest
i
dont
exactly
here
but
Im
not
going
to
go
looking
for
it
again
do
you
agree
my
dear
boy
I
do
said
Dumbledore
while
his
fellow
pictures
looked
confused
and
curious
a
wise
and
courageous
decision
but
no
less
than
I
would
have
expected
of
you
does
anyone
know
else
know
where
it
fell
no
one
said
Harry
and
Dumbledore
nodded
his
satisfaction
im
going
to
keep
Ignotuss
present
though
said
Harry
and
Dumbledore
beamed
but
of
course
Harry
it
is
yours
forever
until
you
pass
it
on
and
then
theres
this
harry
held
up
the
Elder
Wand
and
Ron
and
Hermione
looked
at
it
with
a
reverence
that
even
in
his
befuddled
and
sleep-deprived
state
Harry
did
not
like
to
see
i
dont
want
it
said
Harry
what
said
Ron
loudly
are
you
mental
i
know
its
powerful
said
Harry
wearily
but
I
was
happier
with
mine
so
he
rummaged
in
the
pouch
hung
around
his
neck
and
pulled
out
the
two
halves
of
holly
tstill
just
connected
by
the
finest
threat
of
phoenix
feather
hermione
had
said
that
they
could
not
be
repaired
that
the
damage
was
too
severe
all
he
knew
was
that
if
this
did
not
work
nothing
would
he
laid
the
broken
wand
upon
the
headmasters
desk
touched
it
with
the
very
tip
of
the
Elder
Wand
and
said
Reparo
as
his
wand
resealed
red
sparks
flew
out
of
its
end
harry
knew
that
he
had
succeeded
he
picked
up
the
holly
and
phoenix
wand
and
felt
a
sudden
warmth
in
his
fingers
as
though
wand
and
hand
were
rejoicing
at
their
reunion
im
putting
the
Elder
Wand
he
told
Dumbledore
who
was
watching
him
with
enormous
affection
and
admiration
back
where
it
came
from
it
can
stay
there
if
I
die
a
natural
death
like
Ignotus
its
power
will
be
broken
wont
it
the
previous
master
will
never
have
been
defeated
thatll
be
the
end
of
it
dumbledore
nodded
they
smiled
at
each
other
are
you
sure
said
Ron
there
was
the
faintest
trace
of
longing
in
his
voice
as
he
looked
at
the
Elder
Wand
i
think
Harrys
right
said
Hermione
quietly
that
wands
more
trouble
than
its
worth
said
Harry
and
quite
honestly
he
turned
away
from
the
painted
portraits
thinking
now
only
of
the
four-poster
bed
lying
waiting
for
him
in
Gryffindor
Tower
and
wondering
whether
Kreacher
might
bring
him
a
sandwich
there
Ive
had
enough
trouble
for
a
lifetime
epilogue
nineteen
Years
Later
autumn
seemed
to
arrive
suddenly
that
year
the
morning
of
the
first
of
September
was
crisp
as
an
apple
and
as
the
little
family
bobbed
across
the
rumbling
road
toward
the
great
sooty
station
the
fumes
of
car
exhausts
and
the
breath
of
pedestrians
sparkled
like
cobwebs
in
the
cold
air
two
large
cages
tattled
on
top
of
the
laden
trolleys
the
parents
were
pushing
the
owls
inside
them
hooted
indignantly
and
the
redheaded
girl
trailed
fearfully
behind
here
brothers
clutching
her
father's
arm
it
won't
be
long
and
you'll
be
going
too
Harry
told
her
two
years
sniffed
Lily
i
want
to
go
now
the
commuters
stared
curiously
at
the
owls
as
the
family
wove
its
way
toward
the
barrier
between
platforms
nine
and
ten
albus's
voice
drifted
back
to
Harry
over
the
surrounding
clamor
his
sons
had
resumed
the
argument
they
had
started
in
the
car
i
won't
i
won't
be
a
Slytherin
james
give
it
a
rest
said
Ginny
i
only
said
he
might
be
said
James
grinning
at
his
younger
brother
there's
nothing
wrong
with
that
he
might
be
in
Slytherin
but
James
caught
his
mother's
eye
and
fell
silent
the
five
Potters
approached
the
barrier
with
a
slightly
cocky
look
over
his
shoulder
at
his
younger
brother
James
took
the
trolley
from
his
mother
and
broke
into
a
run
a
moment
later
he
had
vanished
you'll
write
to
me
won't
you
albus
asked
his
parents
immediately
capitalizing
on
the
momentary
absence
of
his
brother
every
day
of
you
want
us
to
said
Ginny
not
every
day
said
Albus
quickly
James
says
most
people
only
get
letters
from
home
about
once
a
month
we
wrote
to
James
three
times
a
week
last
year
said
Ginny
and
you
don't
want
to
believe
everything
he
tells
you
about
Hogwarts
Harry
put
in
he
likes
a
laugh
your
brother
side
by
side
they
pushed
the
second
trolley
forward
gathering
speed
as
they
reached
the
barrier
Albus
winced
but
no
collision
came
instead
the
family
emerged
onto
platform
nine
and
three-quarters
which
was
obscured
by
thick
white
steam
that
was
pouring
from
the
scarlet
Hogwarts
Express
indistinct
figures
were
swarming
through
the
mist
into
which
James
had
already
disappeared
where
are
they
asked
Albus
anxiously
peering
at
the
hazy
forms
they
passed
as
they
made
their
way
down
the
platform
we'll
find
them
said
Ginny
reassuringly
but
the
vapor
was
dense
and
it
was
difficult
to
make
out
anybody's
faces
detached
from
their
owners
voices
sounded
unnaturally
loud
Harry
thought
he
head
Percy
discoursing
loudly
on
broomstick
regulations
and
was
quite
glad
of
the
excuse
not
to
stop
and
say
hello
i
think
that's
them
Al
said
Ginny
suddenly
a
group
of
four
people
emerged
from
the
mist
standing
alongside
the
very
last
carriage
their
faces
only
came
into
focus
when
Harry
Ginny
Lily
and
Albus
had
drawn
right
up
to
them
hi
said
Albus
sounding
immensely
relieved
roses
who
was
already
wearing
her
brand-new
Hogwarts
robes
beamed
at
him
parked
all
right
then
ron
asked
Harry
i
did
hermione
didn't
believe
I
could
pass
a
Muggle
driving
test
did
you
she
thought
i'd
have
to
Confound
the
examiner
no
I
didn't
said
Hermione
I
had
complete
faith
in
you
as
a
matter
of
fact
I
did
Confund
him
Ron
whispered
to
Harry
as
together
they
lifted
albus's
trunk
and
owl
onto
the
train
i
only
forgot
to
look
in
the
wing
mirror
and
let's
face
it
I
can
use
a
Supersensory
Charm
for
that
back
on
the
platform
they
found
Lily
and
Hugo
rose's
younger
brother
having
an
animated
discussion
about
which
House
they
would
be
sorted
into
when
they
finally
went
to
Hogwarts
if
you're
not
in
Gryffindor
we'll
disinherit
you
said
Ron
but
no
pressure
ron
lily
and
Hugo
laughed
but
Albus
and
Rose
looked
solemn
he
doesn't
mean
it
said
Hermione
and
Ginny
but
Ron
was
no
longer
paying
attention
catching
harry's
eye
he
nodded
covertly
to
a
point
some
fifty
yards
away
the
steam
had
thinned
for
a
moment
and
three
people
stood
in
sharp
relief
against
the
shifting
mist
look
who
it
is
draco
Malfoy
was
standing
there
with
his
wife
and
son
a
dark
coat
buttoned
up
to
his
throat
his
hair
was
receding
somewhat
which
emphasized
the
pointed
chin
the
new
boy
resembled
Draco
as
much
as
Albus
resembled
Harry
draco
caught
sight
of
Harry
Ron
Hermione
and
Ginny
staring
at
him
nodded
curtly
and
turned
away
again
so
that's
little
Scorpius
said
Ron
under
his
breath
make
sure
you
beat
him
in
every
test
Rosie
thank
God
you
inherited
your
mother's
brains
ron
for
heaven's
sake
said
Hermione
half
stern
half
amused
don't
try
to
turn
them
against
each
other
before
they've
even
started
school
you're
right
sorry
said
Ron
but
unable
to
help
himself
he
added
don't
get
too
friendly
with
him
though
Rosie
granddad
Weasley
would
never
forgive
you
if
you
married
a
pureblood
hey
james
had
reappeared
he
had
divested
himself
of
his
trunk
owl
and
trolley
and
was
evidently
bursting
with
news
teddy's
back
there
he
said
breathlessly
pointing
back
over
his
shoulder
into
the
billowing
clouds
of
steam
just
seen
him
and
guess
what
he's
doing
snogging
Victoire
he
gazed
up
at
the
adults
evidently
disappointed
by
the
lack
of
reaction
our
Teddy
teddy
Lupin
snogging
our
Victoire
our
cousin
and
I
asked
teddy
what
he
was
doing
you
interrupted
them
said
Ginny
you
are
so
like
Ron
and
he
said
he'd
come
to
see
her
off
and
then
he
told
me
to
go
away
he's
snogging
her
james
added
as
though
worried
he
had
not
made
himself
clear
oh
it
would
be
lovely
if
they
got
married
whispered
Lily
ecstatically
teddy
would
really
be
part
of
the
family
then
he
already
comes
round
for
dinner
about
four
times
a
week
said
Harry
Why
don't
we
just
invite
him
to
live
with
is
and
have
done
with
it
yeah
said
James
enthusiastically
i
don't
mind
sharing
with
AlTeddy
could
have
my
room
no
said
Harry
firmly
you
and
Al
will
share
a
room
only
when
I
want
the
house
demolished
he
checked
the
battered
old
watch
that
had
once
been
Fabian
prewett's
it's
nearly
eleven
you'd
better
get
on
board
don't
forget
to
give
Neville
our
love
ginny
told
James
as
she
hugged
him
mum
i
can't
give
a
professor
love
but
you
know
Neville
james
rolled
his
eyes
outside
yeah
but
at
school
he's
Professor
Longbottom
isn't
he
i
can't
walk
into
Herbology
and
give
him
love
shaking
his
head
at
his
mother's
foolishness
he
vented
his
feelings
by
aiming
a
kick
at
Albus
see
you
later
al.
Watch
out
for
the
thestrals
i
thought
they
were
invisible
you
said
they
were
invisible
but
James
merely
laughed
permitted
his
mother
to
kiss
him
gave
his
father
a
fleeting
hug
then
leapt
onto
the
rapidly
filling
train
they
saw
him
wave
then
sprint
away
up
the
corridor
to
find
his
friends
thestrals
are
nothing
to
worry
about
Harry
told
Albus
they're
gentle
things
there's
nothing
scare
about
them
anyway
you
won't
be
going
up
to
school
in
the
carriages
you'll
be
going
in
the
boats
ginny
kissed
Albus
good-bye
see
you
at
Christmas
bye
Al
said
Harry
as
his
son
hugged
him
don't
forget
hagrid's
invited
you
to
tea
next
Friday
don't
mess
with
Peeves
don't
duel
anyone
till
you're
learned
how
and
don't
let
James
wind
you
up
what
if
i'm
in
Slytherin
the
whisper
was
for
his
father
alone
and
Harry
knew
that
only
the
moment
of
departure
could
have
forced
Albus
to
reveal
how
great
and
sincere
that
fear
was
harry
crouched
down
so
that
albus's
face
was
slightly
above
his
own
alone
of
harry's
three
children
Albus
had
inherited
lily's
eyes
ablus
Severus
Harry
said
quietly
so
that
nobody
but
Ginny
could
hear
and
she
was
tactful
enough
to
pretend
to
be
waving
to
rose
who
was
now
on
the
train
you
were
named
for
two
headmasters
of
Hogwarts
one
of
them
was
a
Slytherin
and
he
was
probably
the
bravest
man
I
ever
knew
but
just
say
then
Slytherin
House
will
have
gained
an
excellent
student
won't
it
it
doesn't
matter
to
us
al.
But
if
it
matter
to
you
you'll
be
able
to
choose
Gryffindor
over
Slytherin
the
Sorting
Hat
takes
your
choice
into
account
really
it
did
for
me
said
Harry
he
had
never
told
any
of
his
children
that
before
and
he
saw
the
wonder
in
albus's
face
when
he
said
it
but
how
the
doorsr
were
slamming
all
along
the
scarlet
train
and
the
blurred
outlines
of
parents
swarming
forward
for
final
kisses
last-minute
reminders
Albus
jumped
into
the
carriage
and
ginny
closed
the
door
behind
him
students
were
hanging
from
the
windows
nearest
them
a
great
number
of
faces
both
on
the
train
and
off
seemed
to
be
turned
toward
Harry
why
are
they
all
staring
demanded
Albus
as
he
and
rose
craned
around
to
look
at
the
other
students
don't
let
it
worry
you
said
Ron
it's
me
i'm
extremely
famous
albus
Rose
Hugo
and
Lily
laughed
the
train
began
to
more
and
Harry
walked
alongside
it
watching
his
son's
thin
face
already
ablaze
with
excitement
harry
kept
smiling
and
waving
even
though
it
was
like
a
little
bereavement
watching
his
son
glide
away
from
him
the
last
trace
of
steam
evaporated
in
the
autumn
air
the
train
rounded
a
corner
harry's
hand
was
still
raised
in
farewell
he'll
be
alright
murmured
Ginny
as
Harry
looked
dat
her
he
lowered
his
hand
absentmindedly
and
touched
the
lightning
scar
on
his
forehead
i
know
he
will
the
scar
had
not
pained
Harry
for
nineteen
years
all
was
well
